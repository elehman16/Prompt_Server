plate waste and self-reported food likings between school lunch based on the new Nordic
diet (NND) and packed lunch from home. In two 3-month periods in a cluster-randomised
controlled unblinded cross-over study 3rd- and 4th-grade children (<italic>n</italic> 187)
from two municipal schools received lunch meals based on NND principles and their usual
packed lunch (control). Food intake and plate waste (<italic>n</italic> 1558) were
calculated after weighing lunch plates before and after the meal for five consecutive days
and self-reported likings (<italic>n</italic> 905) assessed by a web-based questionnaire.
Average food intake was 6 % higher for the NND period compared with the packed lunch
period. The quantity of NND intake varied with the menu (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;
0&#x000b7;0001) and was positively associated with self-reported likings. The edible plate waste
was 88 (<sc>sd</sc> 80) g for the NND period and 43 (<sc>sd</sc> 60) g for the packed
lunch period whereas the relative edible plate waste was no different between periods for
meals having waste (<italic>n</italic> 1050). Edible plate waste differed between menus
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;0001), with more waste on soup days (36 %) and vegetarian
days (23 %) compared with the packed lunch period. Self-reported likings were negatively
associated with percentage plate waste (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;0001). The study
suggests that portion sizes need to be considered in new school meal programmes. New
strategies with focus on reduction of plate waste, children's likings and nutritious
school meals are crucial from both a nutritional, economic and environmental point of
view.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Edible plate waste</kwd><kwd>School meals</kwd><kwd>Packed lunches</kwd><kwd>Food liking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>NND, new Nordic diet

education is the primary role of the schools, the schools cannot entirely achieve their
mission if children are not alert and ready to learn which are related to a healthy diet and
physical activity<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, schools are important settings to improve access to
healthier foods for preventing overweight, obesity and chronic diseases in the long term and
to reach children across all ethnic and socio-economic groups<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several school-based interventions have documented that it is possible to
influence school children's dietary habits positively<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The majority of Danish children do not eat in accordance with the national dietary
guidelines, but consume too many energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods, too much sugar, salt,
saturated fat and fat, and too little wholegrain, fruits, vegetables and fish<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the social differences in overweight and obesity have
widened from 2000&#x02013;2002 to 2005&#x02013;2008, especially for boys of parents with a short
education<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Denmark has no national school food programme and three out of four Danish children bring a
packed lunch from home as only a few schools have canteens<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Typically, a packed lunch consists of open-faced sandwiches on
Danish-style rye bread with liver paste or other types of meat products and sometimes
vegetables and fruit<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The OPUS School Meal Intervention was conducted comparing new Nordic diet
(NND) meals with packed lunches from home in order to investigate the health impact of serving
school meals based on the NND<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Translated into English, OPUS is an abbreviation for &#x02018;optimal well-being,
development and health for Danish children through a healthy new Nordic Diet&#x02019;.</p><p>Fundamental for NND dietary principles are that meals are palatable, environmentally friendly
and largely based on food originating from the Nordic region<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another key principle for the NND is to obtain less waste from the
overall food production which includes an appropriate food intake as well as minimising food
waste because food wasted affects not only the cost of the meal but also the climate
footprint<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Plate waste is generally defined as the quantity of edible food served that is
uneaten<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some plate waste is unavoidable, given the diversity of children and
daily variation in appetite but excessive plate waste may indicate unnecessary costs of a meal
programme and furthermore plate waste may have negative impact on the climate
footprint<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the potential health effects of the NND in a free-living
population are dependent on the NND meals being actually eaten and not just served.</p><p>The measurement of food waste of different school lunch formats is new &#x02013; and timely with the
current awareness of food waste overall in a dietary sustainability context. Furthermore, to
our knowledge, no randomised controlled trial has assessed the impact of introducing a whole
new full meal concept covering the whole lunch, while at the same time performing careful
measurements of children's plate waste.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the amount of food intake and total
and relative edible plate waste differed between packed lunches from home and school meals
served based on NND principles. A further objective was to examine how food intake and food
waste at the two types of meals are associated with the children's likings of the meals.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Study design and recruitment</title><p>The OPUS School Meal Study is a cluster-randomised controlled unblinded cross-over study.
In two 3-month periods 3rd- and 4th-grade children (aged 8&#x02013;11 years) from nine selected
municipal schools received school meals based on the NND and their usual packed lunch
(control) in random order during the school year 2011&#x02013;2012. A number of measurements were
performed before the start of the first dietary period (baseline), at the end of the first
dietary period (month 3) and at the end of the second dietary period (month 6). The study
design and recruitment to the OPUS School Meal Study including this plate waste study have
previously been described in detail<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Two of the nine selected schools were randomly assigned to the present study of food
intake and plate waste. The NND meals were produced locally at each school by trained
chefs and kitchen personnel hired for the study and small groups of children participated
in the cooking every day.</p><p>The packed lunches were eaten in the classrooms whereas the NND meals were prepared and
served in a cafeteria set up for the purpose of the study. Supervised by the OPUS kitchen
personnel, four to six alternating pupils served the <italic>ad libitum</italic> hot NND
meals at the buffet. The children were encouraged to taste all food served and keep a
reasonable plate distribution with vegetable and starchy food filling the majority of the
plate<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The adult kitchen personnel supervised four to six alternating
children who helped to serve the NND meals.</p><p>The guidelines and dietary composition and nutrient content of NND have been described in
detail by Mitril <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The NND menus contained more berries, cabbage, root vegetables,
legumes, fresh herbs, potatoes, wild plants and mushrooms, whole grains, nuts, fish,
shellfish and less meat than the average Danish diet<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">

whereas the energy density of the packed lunch on average was 740 kJ/100 g.</p><p>A 3-week NND menu was developed and served for each of the three seasons (autumn, winter
and spring). The menu plan for the NND meals were the following: Monday: soup and some
fruit for dessert; Tuesday: meat; Wednesday: vegetarian dish and a dessert; Thursday:
fish; Friday: buffet-style with calculated leftovers from the menu every day, Monday to
Thursday. Each weekly schedule had a balance between different categories of ingredients
consistent with the nutritional recommendations, and took into account the feasibility in
preparing the meals and incorporating calculated leftovers from the menu every day, Monday
to Thursday, to be utilised on Fridays. Tap water was served and available at the tables
with the NND lunch meals.</p><p>The NND meals were free of charge for all 3rd- and 4th-grade children at the
participating schools. The lunch break was 20 min when having a packed lunch but increased
to 25 min at school A and from 25 min up to 40 min at school B when getting the NND.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Food intake and edible plate waste</title><p>The amount of food intake and edible plate waste at lunch were measured for five
consecutive days by weighing each child's lunch before and after eating. To ensure that
the children had time to get used to the new NND diet the measurements were taken at the
end of the intervention period. The method used was developed by Sabinsky <italic>et
al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> and adapted by Thorsen &#x00026; Biltoft-Jensen<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Beverages were not included in this study. Food intake and edible
plate waste = 5 g were regarded as no intake or no waste.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Recording food intake and edible plate waste for packed lunch from home</title><p>Before lunch break solid polystyrene plates and trays tagged with class, date and
identity numbers were distributed to all children in the classrooms. The children were
asked to unpack their packed lunches from home, place their food on the plate and to
separate items and open up the sandwiches, so all food items would be observable. The
children brought their food to the weighing station outside the classroom where a trained
assistant weighed the plate (Vera 67002, with a precision of &#x000b1; 1 g; Soehnle) and then to
the photograph station where another trained assistant took a photograph of the plate
(Nikon COOLPIX S 210 digital camera). When the children had finished eating the procedure
was repeated. Any package or wrapping that was weighed the first time (yoghurt and noodle
cups, muesli bar wrappings, etc.) was left on the plate and also weighed the second time.
If the plate waste also included non-edible food items (fruit peel, wrapping, etc.) these
were removed and the plate and edible waste were weighed again. The photographs were used
for confirming the weight data. The weights of the plates were subtracted from the pre-
and post-measures and also the served weight was adjusted for non-edible items. The
relative edible plate waste was also calculated by comparing the edible plate waste with
the total amount of edible food served.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Recording food intake and edible plate waste for the new Nordic diet lunch</title><p>The same procedure as described above for packed lunches brought from home was used
except that the measurements were taken near the buffet. If the children chose to have a
second serving the procedure was repeated and the NND food was weighed and photographed
before and after eating.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Self-reported smiley rating from the Web-based Dietary Assessment Software for
Children</title><p>During the OPUS School Meal Study, dietary assessment at baseline, and at dietary periods
1 and 2 were obtained from each child using the Web-based Dietary Assessment Software for
Children (WebDASC)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. A self-reported smiley rating was included in the WebDASC to measure
the children's liking of the lunch on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = really bad, 2 = bad, 3 =
okay, 4 = good and 5 = really good). Since only two packed lunches were rated really bad
and two packed lunches were rated bad these two groups were combined.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Background information</title><p>At baseline each child together with at least one parent or custody holder underwent a
2-h in-depth interview by a trained interviewer including instructions in using the
dietary assessment tool, either at the school or at home<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The interview included background information like sex, age group and
socio-economic status of the household. The educational level of the household was
categorised according to the standard classifications of Statistics Denmark, i.e. as the
highest level of education achieved by a parent in the household<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The variable was divided into six different groups depending on the
educational level (lower secondary education; upper secondary education or equivalent;
vocational education; short higher education; bachelor's degree or equivalent; and
master's degree).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-7"><title>Data analyses and statistics</title><p>Analyses included standard descriptive statistics. Two types of outcomes were analysed:
binary (i.e. waste/no waste); and continuous (i.e. weight of food intake and edible plate
waste). Data were therefore modelled in two steps with regard to edible waste: first, a
logistic regression model with random effects fitted for the probability of waste/no
waste; and second, a model fitted for either total food intake or total or relative edible
plate waste data<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To analyse the percentage edible plate waste (in lunches having edible plate waste)
random-effects models were used for intake and waste (g). First a model was fitted with
two random effects (child and class) to take the design into account. The model was also
adjusted for school, sex, grade, dietary period, household education level and
intervention.</p><p>Since the study had a cluster-randomised cross-over design, classes were randomised to
receive the NND either in the first or in the second dietary period with five measurements
on each child in each period. This data structure resulted in two random effects: a child
effect and a class effect (the whole class is randomised together). Two schools were
analysed in the present study and treated as a fixed effect for both classes and schools.
All models included school, sex, year group and household education level as fixed effects
in the analysis. The assumptions underlying the models were tested using residual plots
and QQ plots. It was necessary to transform the continuous outcome of interest using the
logarithm but the results are presented on the original scale. The assumptions behind the
model to analyse percentage edible plate waste were tested using residual plots and it
turned out that the square root transformation gave the best results. The results are,
however, expressed on the original scale as differences in percentage
waste<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">

plate waste was significantly different for the meals where the meals with soup,
vegetarian/cake, and fish were served (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab04">Table 4</xref>).
These differences disappeared when the edible plate waste was expressed as a percentage of
the served meal weight (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab05">Table 5</xref>). So the larger
meals in weight and waste of the NND meals are taken into account.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study the children receiving the NND had on average a 6 % larger lunch
intake compared with the period when they had packed lunches. At the same time the average
edible food waste was higher for the NND (mean 88 g) than for packed lunches (mean 43 g).
Looking at the relative edible plate waste (comparing the edible plate waste with the total
amount of food served) the children on average had 29 % edible plate waste when eating the
NND compared with 16 % when eating packed lunches. This difference is mainly due to the fact
that more children had edible plate waste in the NND group than in the packed lunch group.
Among those having plate waste no significant difference was seen between having the NND and
having packed lunches.</p><p>The soup day and the vegetarian and cake day were the days with the highest food intake and
having the highest plate waste, indicating that the portion size needs to be adjusted for
these meals.</p><p>When adjusting the portion sizes also the energy density of the food needs to be
considered. In order to have an appropriate energy intake children need to eat bigger
portion sizes of the NND having a lower energy density (in average 560 kJ/100 g) compared
with packed lunches (740 kJ/100 g) which might be difficult for a child in a short lunch
break and therefore resulting in a large plate waste for the NND compared with packed
lunches<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a report on plate waste for Swedish school canteens the plate waste varied from 5 to 80
g per portion, depending on how much the children liked the food, measuring methods,
conditions at the school and attitudes among the children and the staff<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with the Swedish data the percentage edible plate waste for
the NND (29 %; equivalent to 88 g) meal was high. However, the percentage edible plate waste
varied according to the NND menu, with most waste on a soup day and the smallest amount of
waste on fish day.</p><p>Also, Buzby &#x00026; Guthrie<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> found that plate waste varied with meal type, with vegetables and salad
tending to be the most wasted items in the National School Lunch Program in the USA. The
data were collected from 1991 to 1992 by 3350 students using a 24 h recall (no lunches from
home). In that study, plate waste varied by age and sex; girls wasted more than boys.
Children under 11 years of age wasted 15 % of their food while older children wasted less
(11- to 14-year-olds wasted 12 %). In the present study we found no significant effect of
sex on percentage edible plate waste, but age group was highly significant on percentage
plate waste (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;0001).</p><p>Baik &#x00026; Lee<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> found that school children (aged 6&#x02013;9 years old) had plate waste from 15
to 19 % of the school lunch being served. In the present study the edible plate waste was 29
% for the NND, which is almost double the percentage compared with Baik &#x00026; Lee's
finding (15&#x02013;19 %)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> and the finding by Buzby &#x00026; Guthrie (12&#x02013;15 %)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Bergman <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> found that meal scheduling could influence plate waste; students ate
more and wasted less when eating lunch later during the school day and preferably after
recess. In the present study the lunch break was longer when having the NND compared with
packed lunches; up to 40 min lunch break at school B and 25 min at school A. This might
explain part of the 6 % higher intake for the NND compared with packed lunches and also the
higher food intake at school B compared with school A.</p><p>Liking school meals seems to be essential to reduce edible plate waste. In the present
study the percentage edible plate waste was 17 % larger when the children rated the meal as
really bad or bad compared with really good (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;001). Maybe not
surprisingly, packed lunches were rated higher than the different NND menus since parents
normally would prepare a packed lunch that their children like (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab02">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, an average percentage plate waste at 29 % for the NND is not sustainable
compared with other school meal systems having 12&#x02013;20 % plate waste<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, NND meals are very different from packed lunch so it
might take more than 3 months for the children to familiarise to the NND and to adjust
portion sizes. The latter is supported by the amount of served food being almost 80 g larger
for the NND (mean = 318 g) compared with packed lunches (mean = 241 g), which might be a
result of the not adjusted portion sizes and not simply because the children did not like
the NND meals. In order to make the NND meals sustainable it is crucial to ensure that the
children eat in accordance with the dietary recommendations and guidelines including
appropriate portion size.</p><p>Plate waste studies are expensive and time consuming in particular if the foods are weighed
at the beginning and the end of a meal. Other methods such as visual estimates by trained
observers or 24 h recalls by children do not take into account the actual plate
waste<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cohen <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> found the weighing method to be disruptive to normal lunch procedure and
observed and estimated the waste instead. In the present study the setting of the NND meals
was very different from the normal lunch procedure so it was decided to use the weighing
method as this was considered the most accurate method.</p><p>One of the principles of the NND is to be environmentally friendly, and minimising edible
plate waste is important because food wasted affects not only the cost of the meal but also
the climate footprint<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. When analysing the effect of climate optimising for the NND meals and
the recommended Nordic diet these diets were found to be 20 % more climate friendly than the
average Danish diet but these calculations did not include the 29 % edible plate waste for
NND meals found in the present study<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Interventions in real-life settings are complex systems that interact dynamically with the
key stakeholders and therefore the intervention has to be tailored to the needs of the
particular school environment in which it is implemented<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study large differences were seen between the two
schools and between the two year groups. One strategy to lower plate waste would be to
tailor the intervention at the specific school taking into account the specific challenges
at the school. Another strategy could be to network between the schools about the successes
and challenges. Children from the 3rd grade wasted 9 % less than children in the 4th grade
after adjusting for school, sex, education, period and intervention which is in contrast to
the findings of Buzby &#x00026; Guthrie<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The 4th graders seemed less guided by the teachers at lunch and often
in a hurry to play, whereas the 3rd graders followed more willingly the guidelines of the
teachers and the encouragements by chefs at the cafeterias. The two schools performed
differently; school A had 14 % more edible plate waste compared with school B. One
explanation for more plate waste could be that school A had a shorter lunch break than
school B or maybe because the key stakeholders at school B took more ownership of the OPUS
School Meal Study than at school A.</p><p>Serving smaller portion sizes would be another obvious strategy to reduce plate waste since
food intake and plate waste were higher for the NND compared with packed lunch, however,
this could result in insufficient energy intake for some children. In the present study it
was seen that the 3rd graders were served larger portions than the 4th graders which might
explain the 3rd graders higher food intake but not the lower 9 % lower plate waste (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref>). Also Andersen <italic>et
al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> find that 3rd graders have a higher food intake than 4th graders in a
study of all nine schools even though data were collected using a food record.</p><p>Strategies to reduce plate waste and getting children to like and eat a nutritious school
meal would be interesting from not only a nutritional and economic point of view but also an
environmental point of view. An earlier study of a Danish school-based meal programme showed
that the nutritional quality of lunch was improved when the children had lunch provided by
the school instead of packed lunch from home<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>31</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also an American school cafeteria study showed an impact on the
nutritional quality of the school meals when hiring a chef at the school cafeteria to make
the meals not only nutritious but also palatable<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another Danish school meal programme in Copenhagen (providing an
average of 3700 meals daily) served healthy and tasty meals at a price that all children
could afford in order to make equality in health by differentiating the price of the meal
depending on the parents&#x02019; income level<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>33</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A tailored long-term school lunch programme might be a way to get children in school to eat
in accordance with the dietary guidelines including proper portion sizes and thereby
diminishing food waste and maybe some of the socio-economics differences in food intake that
are found among school-aged children.</p><p>The present study was designed in such a way that the 4th grade at school A received the
NND in period 1 and the 3rd grade in period 2, while at school B it was the other way round.
Therefore it was not possible to distinguish between an interaction between the NND and
period and an interaction between year group and school. Also seasonality was not accounted
for in the data analysis. Another limitation of the study was that the eating environment
when eating packed lunches was not similar to that of the NND meals, thus favouring the NND
meals (longer lunch breaks and nicer eating environments when having the NND compared with
packed lunches). On the other hand, packed lunches could also have been affected by the
parents/children knowing of the measurement being performed. In the present study total food
intake (g), edible plate waste (g) and the relative plate waste (compared with the total
amount of served food) were analysed whereas the nutrient content of the meals eaten were
not analysed. The dietary effects of the NND were evaluated in a separate paper by Andersen
<italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of the OPUS School Meal Study was to test the effect of the
NND on multiple outcomes; and the study was designed so the meals were free of charge for
the participating children. In a real-life setting a school meal programme will not be free.
Another paper will address the cost of the OPUS School Meal Study.</p><p>Some strengths of the study are the study design, being a cluster-randomised cross-over
design, and the use of advanced statistical analyses taking advantage of the current
cluster-randomised cross-over design in a two-step logistic regression model brings
convincing results giving the study high power; furthermore, the assessments were taken
during a period of 5 d on the same children. Another strength is that the measurements were
taken after 3 months of having the NND meals, giving time for the children to get used to
the NND meals, which were very different from the usual packed lunch from home. The present
study demonstrates convincingly that school children 8&#x02013;11 years of age are willing to
consume more meals that may be unknown to them than described in the literature. We consider
that the use of liking measurements of whole meals is novel &#x02013; and a step forward from the
liking measurements of individual foods when taking a public health nutrition perspective
and the liking rating is effective as the food intake was 59 % larger when the meals were
rated really good compared with when the lunch was rated bad or really bad.</p><p>Finally, plate waste studies that weigh foods at the beginning and end of meals are
considered to provide detailed, accurate information<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">

consumed a significantly higher amount of food at lunch time during the NND period
compared with the period on packed lunches from home. The average edible food waste was
significantly higher during the NND period compared with the packed lunch period looking
at the absolute amounts, whereas the difference in percentage waste was not statistically
significant for the NND and packed lunch for meals having plate waste. The study showed
that the children's likings of the school meals were inversely associated with the edible
plate waste, indicating that likings are essential in attempts to reduce edible plate
waste in this age group. Even though some plate waste is inevitable in a school setting,
the present study suggests that careful measuring of plate waste together with knowledge
of the children's likings can be used to form new strategies to reduce plate waste and
getting children to eat nutritious school meals in an economic and environmentally
sustainable way.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to all the participating children, the teachers, the principals and the kitchen
