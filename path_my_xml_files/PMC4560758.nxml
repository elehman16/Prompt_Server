Patients received the same dose of pasireotide as at the end of the core study (300&#x02013;1,200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g bid). Dose titration was permitted according to efficacy or drug-related adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>40 patients completed 24&#x000a0;months&#x02019; treatment. Of the patients who entered the extension, 50.0&#x000a0;% (29/58) and 34.5&#x000a0;% (20/58) had controlled UFC (UFC&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;ULN) at months 12 and 24, respectively. The mean percentage decrease in UFC was 57.3&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI 40.7&#x02013;73.9; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;52) and 62.1&#x000a0;% (50.8&#x02013;73.5; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;33) after 12 and 24&#x000a0;months&#x02019; treatment, respectively. Improvements in clinical signs of Cushing&#x02019;s disease were sustained up to month 24. The most frequent drug-related adverse events in patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of pasireotide (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;162) from core baseline until the 24-month cut-off were diarrhea (55.6&#x000a0;%), nausea (48.1&#x000a0;%), hyperglycemia (38.9&#x000a0;%), and cholelithiasis (31.5&#x000a0;%).

The safety profile of pasireotide is typical for a somatostatin analogue, except for the frequency and degree of hyperglycemia; patients should be monitored for changes in glucose homeostasis. Pasireotide represents the first approved pituitary-targeted treatment for patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11102-014-0618-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pasireotide</kwd><kwd>Cushing&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Somatostatin analogue</kwd><kwd>Corticotroph tumor</kwd><kwd>Urinary free cortisol</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cushing&#x02019;s disease is a rare and debilitating disorder of hypercortisolism caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cushing&#x02019;s disease is associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to the development of several hypercortisolism-induced clinical complications, including central obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, as well as osteoporosis, psychiatric disorders and increased susceptibility to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy is the first-line therapy for most patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease. Second-line treatment options include repeat surgery, radiotherapy, bilateral adrenalectomy and medical therapy. Pasireotide (Signifor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is a multireceptor-targeted somatostatin analogue with a high affinity for somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (sst<sub>5</sub>), as well as activating sst<sub>1,2,3</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Pasireotide targets the underlying cause of Cushing&#x02019;s disease by activating sst<sub>5</sub> on corticotroph adenomas, resulting in the inhibition of ACTH secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of pasireotide has recently been evaluated in the largest prospective study of a medical therapy in Cushing&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The safety profile of pasireotide in this study was similar to that of other somatostatin analogues, except for the increased frequency and degree of hyperglycemia.

Patients who were eligible for entry into the core study were adults (&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age) with confirmed de novo, persistent or recurrent Cushing&#x02019;s disease. Cushing&#x02019;s disease was defined by a mean 24-h UFC level (calculated from four UFC samples collected within 14&#x000a0;days) &#x02265;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN; 145&#x000a0;nmol/24&#x000a0;h [52.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/24&#x000a0;h]), a morning plasma ACTH level &#x02265;5&#x000a0;ng/L (1.1&#x000a0;nmol/L), and a confirmed pituitary source of Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome. Key exclusion criteria were tumor compression of the optic chiasm causing visual-field defects, pituitary irradiation within the previous 10&#x000a0;years, mitotane treatment within the previous 6&#x000a0;months, symptomatic cholelithiasis, a glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) level &#x0003e;8&#x000a0;%, and de novo Cushing&#x02019;s disease in patients who were surgical candidates. Patients with a mean UFC level&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;ULN at month 12 or those considered, at the discretion of the investigator, to be achieving significant clinical benefit from pasireotide were eligible for entry into the extension.</p><p>The study was approved by the independent ethics committee, research ethics board or institutional review board at each center and complied with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki and local laws.

While escape from response has been reported during long-term treatment of Cushing&#x02019;s disease with the dopamine receptor agonist cabergoline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], a similar phenomenon has not been shown for pasireotide. Nevertheless, it is possible that a loss of pasireotide efficacy in a small number of patients may have contributed to the reduction in the number of responders during the extension study.</p><p>Reductions in UFC with pasireotide treatment were accompanied by rapid decreases in mean serum cortisol and plasma ACTH levels, which were initially observed in the core study and were maintained for the duration of the extension (serum cortisol and plasma ACTH levels decreased by 18.0 and 14.7&#x000a0;%, respectively, from core baseline to month 24). Sustained improvements in a number of clinical signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, and total cholesterol level, were also observed; changes in signs and symptoms during 12&#x000a0;months of treatment with pasireotide have been recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The data from the current 24-month study suggest that the initial efficacy and clinical benefit of pasireotide in patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease can be maintained over an extended 24-month time period. However, as changes in the dose of concomitant medications were not recorded during the 24-month treatment period, further studies are necessary to determine the effects of these therapies on the observed improvements in clinical signs and symptoms. Interestingly, a subanalysis of patients with hypertension at core baseline showed that 62.5&#x000a0;% (10/16) of those patients who did not receive antihypertensive drugs during the core study had a &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;mmHg decrease in diastolic blood pressure after 12&#x000a0;months of pasireotide treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Pasireotide showed a similar safety profile to that of other somatostatin analogues, except for the increased frequency and degree of hyperglycemia. The safety profile of pasireotide following 24&#x000a0;months&#x02019; treatment was similar to that reported at 12&#x000a0;months, with no new safety issues identified during the extension.</p><p>The development of hyperglycemia is a well-characterized effect of pasireotide treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Plasma glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels increased soon after initiation of pasireotide but did not deteriorate further over 2&#x000a0;years of treatment. The stabilization of plasma glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels over time may have resulted from a number of factors, including the administration of antidiabetic medication, correction of hypercortisolism, and patient discontinuations. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because of the smaller number of patients who entered the extension phase compared with the 12-month core study. Recent studies in healthy volunteers showed that hyperglycemia associated with pasireotide treatment results from a decrease in incretin and insulin secretion, with no change in insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Patients on pasireotide treatment should be closely monitored for changes in glucose homeostasis, and prompt intervention is warranted if hyperglycemia occurs.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that all the efficacy data are derived from the 58 patients who entered the extension based on the achievement of controlled UFC levels or significant clinical benefit during the core study. As such, it could be considered that these patients were &#x02018;pre-selected&#x02019; for a positive response to pasireotide. Nevertheless, these data are encouraging and suggest that patients who have a biochemical response to pasireotide respond rapidly (during the first 2&#x000a0;months of treatment) and can continue to respond over a sustained period of time. Non-responders could therefore be identified soon after initiating pasireotide treatment and treatment decisions made early in the therapeutic course, taking into account both biochemical and clinical response. Of note, the baseline characteristics of the patients entering the extension were similar to those of the overall core patient population, with no obvious characteristic predictive of a positive response to pasireotide treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Long-term use of pasireotide resulted in sustained improvements in mean UFC, serum cortisol and plasma ACTH. Significant improvements in blood pressure, weight and total cholesterol were also maintained for the duration of treatment. The safety profile of pasireotide was typical for a somatostatin analogue, except for changes in glucose homeostasis, which need to be closely monitored in patients receiving pasireotide treatment. This study shows that pasireotide provides sustained clinical benefit, supporting its use as a treatment for patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="11102_2014_618_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 22 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Clinical Trials Registration Number: NCT00434148.
