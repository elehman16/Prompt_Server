Low grade chronic inflammation is a characteristic of obese state and has an important role in pathogenesis and progression of chronic disease such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is becoming increasingly evident that over nutrition, physical inactivity and aging would result in hypersecretion inflammatory mediators and eventually lead to obesity-induced disorders.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Nutrition has a key role both in prevention and control of obesity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] For centuries rice has been traditional staple food in Asian countries and more than 70% of rice consumed is in the form of white rice (WR).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Several cohort studies indicate that higher WR intake is associated with elevated risk of diabetes.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In a prospective study conducted in Japan, the same result was obtained.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Recent studies shown that intake of whole grain as a component of healthy eating pattern has been associated with lower risk of chronic disease.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Brown rice (BR) is the unrefined whole grain contains various and important nutrient in bran layer that is located between white center and outer bran.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Removing bran layer results in losing potential health benefits of rice. Due to the milling process and different degree of processing, compared with WR, BR has a greater amount of dietary fiber, magnesium, vitamin B, &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), &#x003b3;-oryzanol (&#x003b3;-ORZ), Phytoestrogens, lignin and essential fatty acid.

Despite these benefits, Asian people prefer WR because WR is softer and tastier than BR.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies indicated no significant changes on body weight following BR consumption[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but the size of adipocytes was reduced by feeding with pre germinated BR in diabetic rats.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In this study diet with BR could reduce waist circumference, a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and enhanced weight loss. There are many reports which show the ability of fiber to slow down the process of absorption of nutrients by modifying the metabolic response to intake, its ability to lowering fasting insulin level, increase the excretion of biliary acid and the metabolic effects of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced in the bacterial fermentation of fiber.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>BR has 4 times as much dietary fiber as WR.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] arabinoxylan and &#x003b2;-glucan are growth substrates for beneficial bacteria such as <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Recent human studies reported relationships between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and obesity.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In a recent study, BR could increase large bowel SCFA and have a beneficially effect on the gut microbial composition in humans. Hence anti-obesity effects of BR may be related to the profile and activity of the intestinal microbiota.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Leptin is released from adipocytes and controls food intake and energy expenditure by brain mechanisms. GABA, an important component of rice bran, has the ability to prevent obesity by linking to leptin as the co-transmitter.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Finding from an animal study indicated that BR has the anti-obesity effect through down regulation of lipogenic gene.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>The organelle responsible for protein synthesis, folding and trafficking is endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Creating a toxic condition due to accumulation of newly synthesized unfolded proteins defined as ER stress, which induces apoptotic cell death.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] hypothalamic ER stress is linked to leptin resistance, which leads to dysregulation of appetite and energy expenditure in obese mice.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Furthermore hypothalamic ER stress influences the preference for dietary fat. &#x003b3;-ORZ (ferulate ester of triterpen alcohols) in bran layer acts as a chemical chaperone; so it can decrease hypothalamic ER stress, ameliorated hypothalamic leptin resistance and attenuate the preference for dietary fat.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Overall this evidence highlights that BR may have potential for the enhanced weight loss in humans.</p><p>There are conflicting results regarding the effect of BR on serum lipid profiles and FBG. In a recent study substituting WR with BR for 16 weeks was not associated with improvement in fasting serum glucose, insulin, Serum lipids among people with diabetes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Two recent short-term interventions indicated no significant benefits of substituting whole grains for refined grains on fasting glucose, insulin and blood lipids.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] But in the study with cross-over design diabetic patients were instructed to consume 180 g of rice 3 times a day for 6 week and blood glucose management, lipid related markers were improved on BR diet.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] These results were similar to the results of another study in which blood glucose and insulin reaction were lower for BR when compared with WR.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>Past studies have reported the favorable effects of dietary fiber on blood glucose concentration. Higher content of dietary fiber in BR (2 g/100 g) than in WR (0.4 g/100 g) might be responsible for this effect. Fiber in bran layer raps &#x003b1;-amylase, the enzyme to digest starch and substrates (saccharides) in the intestine, ultimately suppresses increasing in postprandial blood glucose levels.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] GABA that is richer in BR than WR (contents of GABA in raw BR and WR were 7 mg/100 and 3 mg/100 respectively), stimulate the pancreatic beta cell and insulin secretion from pancreas[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and injection GABA agonist to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats ameliorated the elevation of blood glucose concentration and increased their insulin levels.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>BR contains &#x003b3;-ORZ that are effective for improving hypercholesterolemia by suppressing cholesterol absorption from intestine, in both human and animal's models.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] BR diet can also suppress hypercholesterolemia via enhancing fecal bile acids secretion without affecting on the cholesterol synthesis of host liver.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Comparing with WR, BR contains more GABA with hypocholestrolemic effect, although the exact mechanisms are not yet clear.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] However in our study BR diet in comparison with WR diet, did not have any significant effects on serum lipid profiles and FBG. This might be related to the low amount of BR intake in the current study.</p><p>In the present study, we observed that comparing with WR diet; BR diet could reduce diastole blood pressure. This result was similar to the findings of the study which showed the BR intervention had a beneficial effect on diastole pressure among diabetic person.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Furthermore in another study consumption of diet with BR/whole wheat for 5 week could reduce blood pressure significantly in hypercholestrolemic patients.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Several mechanisms have been proposed to be responsible for the reduction in blood pressure, which occurs with increased fiber intake including increased water and electrolyte excretion with insoluble fiber intake. Past studies have shown that GABA is not only a neurotransmitter but also it can decrease blood pressure.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] The major bioactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, Angiotensin II, is an important growth factor causing hypertrophy and hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells that is believed to be pivotal for progression of hypertension. Extract from the bran layer of BR has a protective effect toward hypertension by interfering with signal transduction induced by Ang II.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</p><p>Few studies are available about the effects of whole grain or BR on inflammatory risk markers. hs-CRP is a strong inflammatory marker for predicting future cardiovascular events.[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] Compared with WR, BR ameliorated the increase in both plasma TNF-&#x003b1; and PAI-1 and decrease in adiponectin in diabetic rats.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This result was similar to another study which showed PAI-1 significantly decreased in diabetic rats by taking PGBR for 7 week.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Two previous studies did not find significant benefits of substituting whole grains for refined grains on interleukin-6 and hs-CRP. In a study consumption of 3 portions/d whole-grain foods for 12 week had not any effects on mentioned markers.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] This result was consistent with results from a 14-week pilot trial using a crossover design in 30 participants.[<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</p><p>In our short-term trial BR diet in comparison with WR diet, significantly reduced level of hs-CRP. The probabilistic mechanism can be explained through nuclear factor-kappa (NF-&#x003ba;B).

However, a few human studies are available about the effect of BR on inflammatory and cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of BR in cross-over design as the strong method for conducting this trial.</p><p>One important difference between our study and the other research was the amount of BR intake. The subjects were instructed to consume only 150 g BR accompany with weigh loss diet and some significantly effects were seen for mentioned variables. In the present study we just recommended food item but BR and WR were provided for participants. This limitation should be considered in interpretation the finding of this research. We analyzed patient food records and their diets controlled exactly.</p><p>In non-menopausal female, since lipid profiles variation may be affected by change in blood estrogen level, patient biochemical measurement were assessed based on menstrual date and all of them were in the same hormone phase. This study was conducted on healthy adults without any specific disorder; hence, our trial should have good external validity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>BR replacement in the diet as a staple food can be useful to improve weight loss, waist and hip circumference, BMI, diastole pressure and hs-CRP level significantly, among over weight and obese female adults. Our findings show that in overweight or obese female adults BR diet in comparison with WR diet resulted in decreased diastole blood pressure and inflammatory marker (hs-CRP). Furthermore, BR replacement in the diet can be useful to improve weight loss and visceral obesity significantly. Replacement of white rice by brown rice did not have any significant effects on serum lipid profiles and FBG. Therefore brown rice may be recommended for more use considering its benefits.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Food Security Research Center supported this research (391213).
