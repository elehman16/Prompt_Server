Though, it is not associated with any major systemic illness, such lesions will lead to social stigma, may affect the psychological status of the individual and has a major impact on self-esteem and perception of the self. Vitiligo is one of the oldest and commonest skin disorders affecting approximately 1&#x02013;2% of the human population.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Based on the dermatological outpatient's records, the incidence of vitiligo is found to be 0.25 to 2.5% in India.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>All skin disorders in Ayurveda are placed under the name of <italic>Kushtha</italic>. In Ayurveda, <italic>Shvitra</italic> is considered as one of the varieties of <italic>Kushtha</italic>,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] that can be correlated with vitiligo based on the similarities of signs and symptoms. It is caused due to vitiation of <italic>Tridosha</italic> and <italic>Dhatus</italic> like <italic>Rasa</italic> (lymph), <italic>Rakta</italic> (blood), <italic>Mamsa</italic> (muscles) and <italic>Meda</italic> (fats).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] According to <italic>Harita Samhita</italic>, vitiated <italic>Vata</italic> along with <italic>Pitta</italic> affects the <italic>Rakta Dhatu</italic> manifests <italic>Pandura Varna</italic> (whitish patches) on skin that is called as <italic>Shvitra</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Depending upon chronicity and involvement of deeper tissue (<italic>Dhatus</italic>), disease becomes difficult to treat.</p><p>A number of topical formulations are mentioned for management of <italic>Shvitra</italic>. Modern science uses Psoralen + Ultra Violet-A exposure therapy and corticosteroids in the treatment of vitiligo. But they are associated with side effects like burning, itching, nausea, tanning, eye damage, skin aging and skin cancer.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, there is a need to develop an effective formulation with less adverse effects. Ayurveda has ample of formulations that can be used safely in <italic>Shvitra</italic>. <italic>Apamarga Kshara Yoga</italic>[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] is one of such formulations. In the current study, it is planned to evaluate clinical efficacy of <italic>Apamarga Kshara Yoga</italic> in two different dosage forms i.e. <italic>Lepa</italic> and ointment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study is a randomized single blind one involving 50 patients with vitiligo fulfilling the inclusion criteria.
