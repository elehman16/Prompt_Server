The prevention of dental diseases is associated with a reduction in the number of microorganisms. The oral cavity is free of microorganisms at birth. There is a great variety of microbes in the oral cavity during the first day of life such as <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Neisseria</italic>, <italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, and coliforms. Transmission of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> was found to start even from the fourth month of a predentate child[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] either directly from the saliva of the mother or other family members or indirectly through fomites such as spoons, cups, toys, or contaminated toothbrushes.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Tooth brushing is one of the important procedures in prevention of dental caries. Toothbrushes are manufactured free of microorganisms. After a single use, however, toothbrushes may become contaminated with a wide array of bacteria, viruses, yeasts, and fungi, present both in the oral cavity and in the external environment.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In toothbrushes used by children in a day care center heavy growth of enteric yeasts and molds was reported.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Microorganisms can remain viable on toothbrush bristles for periods ranging from 24 hours to seven days.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The routine use of contaminated toothbrushes might contribute to disseminate microorganisms within the oral cavity of the same person or between different individuals. A method to reduce contamination of toothbrushes might be a helpful means to avoid re&#x02013;infection and cross&#x02013;infection risks. There are various methods for toothbrush decontamination, which include immersion in antimicrobial solutions like chlorhexidine,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] triclosan,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] cetylpyridinium chloride,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Listerine,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] ultraviolet (UV) radiation,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] spraying of disinfecting solutions on bristles,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] use of microwave oven[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] etc.</p><p>With the rise in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, there is considerable interest in the development of natural antimicrobial agents for control of infection. Several studies have proved antibacterial effects of garlic[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and tea tree oil extracts[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] on oral microorganisms.</p><p>Garlic (<italic>Allium sativum</italic>) is a flavor component used in a wide variety of dishes and has been used in native medicine since ancient times for the treatment of many diseases. There are a few reports on garlic antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms in which 2.5[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and 3%[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] concentrations showed good antimicrobial activity against <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The medicinal properties of the tea tree oil (TTO) were first reported by Penfold in the 1920s. The volatile essential oil is derived from the Australian native plant <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>. This oil is effective against a high number of gram&#x02013;positive and gram&#x02013;negative bacteria, viruses, protozoa, as well as fungi.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In some studies, maximum bactericidal concentrations of 2.5,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] 2,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] 0.25,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and 0.2%[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] TTO were reported against streptococcus species.</p><p>Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), which has been studied extensively for many years, is currently one of the safest and most efficient chemotherapeutic agents against <italic>S. mutans</italic> and dental caries. Different concentrations of 0.2%,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] 0.12%,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] 0.06%[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] CHX have been shown to act against <italic>S. mutans</italic>. CHX used as a mouth rinse or in dental gels applied by toothbrush has been reported to result in a low-to-moderate reduction in <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts in plaque and saliva, and in only a trend toward less caries.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) is a quarternary ammonium compound used in a wide variety of antiseptic mouth rinse products. CPC 0.07%[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and 0.05%[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have shown antibacterial activities.</p><p>Various UV toothbrush sanitizing devices are available in the market. Many of these new gadgets allow for multiple toothbrushes to be cleaned at the same time, and a number of them accommodate different sizes of brushes, like ones that are electric or kid-sized. UV radiation is effective against a number of bacteria, yeasts and viruses.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>There is limited information available comparing the potency of garlic, tea tree oil, CPC, CHX, and UV light as toothbrush disinfectants.</p><p>This study commenced with a null hypothesis: There is no difference in the antibacterial effect of garlic, tea tree oil, CPC, CHX and UV light against <italic>S.mutans</italic> as toothbrush disinfectants.</p><p>Hence, the present study was conducted with the following objectives:</p><p>

CHX exhibits a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and is often used as a positive control for the assessment of the anticariogenic potential of other agents.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] There was 100% reduction in <italic>S. mutans</italic> colonies from toothbrushes in some studies where 0.2% CHX was used with an immersion period of 12 hours[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and 24 hours.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Our study results proved that 0.2% CHX is effective as a toothbrush disinfectant against <italic>S. mutans</italic> with a reduction of 78.3%.</p><p>Cetylpyridinium chloride showed a significant reduction of 91.4% <italic>S.mutans</italic> counts in our study. In a clinical trial conducted for one week using 0.05% CPC spray showed significant decrease in toothbrush contamination[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] whereas another study employed Cepacol (antiseptic containing CPC), which showed 100% reduction of all bacteria after 20 minutes exposure.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</p><p>A study conducted using the same UV device showed 86% reduction, which may be due to the short duration (one week) of brushing period employed.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] An <italic>in vitro</italic> study[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] showed that the antibacterial effect of Violight was least compared to Listerine and 3% hydrogen peroxide. A reduction of 47.4% was observed in our study.</p><p>When the efficacy was compared among different antimicrobial agents used in the present study, 3% garlic had the highest efficacy followed by 0.05% CPC, 0.2% CHX, 0.2% TTO and the least efficacious was UV toothbrush sanitizing device.</p><p>A precise comparison of present study findings with others could not be done due to variations in age groups and methodology (brushing frequency, number of days of brushing), and differences in antimicrobial agents with varying concentrations, immersion timings, methods of application, and organisms analyzed. Microbiological analysis is dependent on methodological accuracy and crucial technical details, which makes comparing results difficult.</p><p>The present study considered only <italic>S. mutans</italic> for evaluation of the efficacy of disinfecting agents and did not take into account all other microorganisms present on toothbrushes. Only single immersion period (12 hours) was used. It also did not assess the acceptability of toothbrushes dipped in these solutions by the study subjects as antimicrobial agents are known to have bitter and altered taste especially with garlic, tea tree oil, and chlorhexidine. Therefore, further research is required to analyze various antimicrobial agents with different concentrations and different soaking time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The study showed that all antimicrobial agents were effective in reducing <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts in toothbrushes. However 3% garlic had the highest efficacy followed by 0.05% CPC, 0.2% CHX, 0.2% TTO, and UV toothbrush sanitizing device. Further clinical research is required to broaden our understanding of various antimicrobial agents, particularly natural agents, in the prevention of dental caries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
