Ejaculatory response is the efferent (motor) component of a spinal reflex that typically begins with sensory stimulation to the glans penis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] However, much less is known about this disorder than erectile dysfunction and there is a lack of a commonly accepted definition for this complaint. A specific ejaculatory latency was not defined because of the absence of normative data.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Ejaculation must occur before or very soon after.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Premature ejaculation is a very common male sexual disorder, affecting on an average 40% of the men worldwide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The World Health Organization (WHO) Second International Consultation on Sexual Health defined it as, &#x0201c;persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it, over which the sufferer has little or no voluntary control, which causes the sufferer and/or his partner bother or distress&#x0201d;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] An increased susceptibility to premature ejaculation in men from the Indian subcontinent has been reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Most modern research uses the Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time (IELT) as measured by a stopwatch.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] This technique, which was originally used by a psychoanalyst in 1973,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] has become the standard because of a study by the Dutch scientists.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p><italic>Vajikarana</italic> (aphrodisiac therapy) is one of the eight branches of <italic>Ayurveda</italic> that deals with the preservation and amplification of the sexual potency of a healthy man and conception of healthy progeny as well as management of defective semen, disturbed sexual potency, and spermatogenesis, along with treatment of seminal-related disorders in man.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] <italic>Vajikarana</italic> promotes the sexual capacity and performance as well as improves the physical, psychological, and social health of an individual.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In Ayurveda there is a concept of <italic>Shukragata Vata</italic>, which can be correlated with Premature Ejaculation.</p><p><italic>Shukragata Vata</italic> is a distinct pathological entity, characterized by a group of clinical presentations either related to the impairment of ejaculation or with the impairment of seminal properties.

In delayed ejaculation, although intravaginal ejaculation eventually occurs, it requires a long time and strenuous efforts at coital stimulation, and sexual arousal may be sluggish. It may be caused when the vitiated <italic>vata</italic> loses its <italic>drutatva</italic> or <italic>chalatva</italic> after the enlodgement, which leads to lack of sufficient stimulation (<italic>prerana</italic>) for ejaculation. It may also happen when the vitiated <italic>vata</italic> causes diminution of <italic>Shukra Dhatu by Shoshana Svabhava</italic>, and quantitatively less amount of <italic>Shukra</italic> is ejaculated after a long effort.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Seminal parameters are impaired when the vitiated <italic>vata</italic> afflicts the functional characteristics of <italic>Shukra</italic>, such as semen or spermatozoa.

As the disorder had a huge psychological component; counseling had a big role to play. The percentage of improvement was more than double in Group A compared to group B. Voluntary control over ejaculation improved in both Groups A and B, with statistical significance of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001. Patient satisfaction improved in both the groups with statistical significance, because of the effect of <italic>Stambhanakaraka Yoga</italic> on <italic>Vata</italic> and <italic>Manas</italic>.

Partner satisfaction was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in both Groups of A and B. The fact that the subject was taking treatment made the spouse feel that her partner was having a problem and made her compromise a little during the act, due to which the patient felt that he was improving. This could be the reason that the placebo group also showed statistically significant results. However, the percentage of improvement was two times more in group A than in group B. The performance anxiety was considerably reduced in Group A and B with statistically high significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The reduction in the performance anxiety and improvement in the ejaculatory performance coincided, showing a strong positive correlation between them.</p><p>Improvement in the mean number of penile thrusts was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in Group A and significant in Group B (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Considering the number of penile thrusts, the effect of therapy was more than double when compared to Placebo.</p><p>The ability to delay ejaculation and the severity of the problem were assessed with the four itemed subscale of the GRISS Questionnaire for high reliability and good validity. The first criterion enquired the &#x02018;ability to delay ejaculation during intercourse when he may think he may be coming too quickly,&#x02019; this was aimed at understanding the maintenance of the internal cue, identification of ejaculatory inevitability, and voluntary control over ejaculation. Almost all the subjects answered &#x02018;never&#x02019;. Statistically high significant improvements (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) were noted in Groups A and B, respectively. From the foregoing observations it could be inferred that <italic>Stambhanakaraka Yoga</italic> provided a certain degree of significant voluntary control over ejaculation in comparison with the placebo. This could be due to the direct effect of <italic>Akarakarabha</italic> and <italic>Tulasi</italic> on <italic>Vata</italic> especially on the <italic>Apana Vata</italic>. The effect could be due to the reduction in the shortness of nerve latency time or decrease in the rapidity of reflexes.</p><p>The second criterion was to examine whether the subject was enjoying the sexual act for a sufficient duration of time without early ejaculation. In Group A, the percentage of improvement was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>The third criterion was to enquire about the incidence of ejaculation immediately after penetration; 46.75% improvement was seen in Group A, which was statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and 19.04% improvement was seen in Group B, which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p>The last criterion of the analysis is the incidence of ejaculation before penetration, which in group A was relieved in a statistically highly significant manner (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The improvement in group B was also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Hence, in a nutshell it can be conceptualized that an ejaculation before penetration or just after penetration, and when purely the psychological factors are operating can be managed even with placebo and psychological counseling alone; whereas, <italic>Stambhanakaraka Yoga</italic> considerably increases the duration of the sexual act. This therapy is more efficacious in imparting a certain degree of voluntary control over ejaculation.</p><p>On Hamilton's anxiety rating scale, Group A improved in a statistically highly significant manner (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas, group B improved in a statistically significant manner (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). From this it could be concluded that although only psychological counseling or Placebo was able to reduce anxiety to some extent, when psychological counseling along with <italic>Stambhanakaraka Yoga</italic> was given it provided encouraging results. The seminal parameters were nearly within the normal range [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T10">Table 9</xref>]. <italic>Shukragata Vata</italic> is a clinical condition characterized by early ejaculation, and inability to conceive.
