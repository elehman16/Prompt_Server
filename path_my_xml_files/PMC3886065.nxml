pathogens to the extent that destruction of the periodontium is arrested. A number
of different non-surgical and surgical therapies have been successful in achieving
this goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The primary non-surgical approach involves mechanical scaling and
root planing (SRP). The beneficial effects of SRP arise from a reduction in the
microbial burden in the periodontal pocket, or a shift towards a less pathogenic
microflora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the efficacy of SRP
may be compromised at tooth sites with deep periodontal pockets. Furthermore, the
long term success of SRP may be affected by remaining bacterial virulence factors
and ineffective personal plaque control.</p><p>Several antimicrobial agents have been attempted systemically as an adjunct to
mechanical treatment of the periodontal disease. However, the efficacy of these
means have been limited by systemic side effects, inability to reach the site of
action in adequate concentrations and inability to maintain adequate drug levels for
a sufficient time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Controlled local delivery of the local antimicrobial agents
were subsequently developed that were successful in maintaining the higher
concentration of drug in the periodontal pocket for longer periods than systemically
delivered methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Many of well controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of various locally
delivered antimicrobial agents have demonstrated better clinical response with
doxycycline, when used as an adjunct to SPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Locally used doxycycline has
been shown to concentrate in crevicular fluid, successfully eliminate <italic>Actinobacillus
actinomycetemcomitans</italic> and demonstrates a wide spectrum of activity against other
suspected periodontal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Large multicenter human clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have shown favourable
responses following the use of doxycycline hyclate when delivered subgingivally to
human periodontal pocket in a biodegradable controlled release delivery system.
However, there is a paucity of literature on the efficacy of doxycyline hyclate in
the south Asian population.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of
doxycyline hyclate 10% (Atridox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, CollaGenx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Newtown, PA, USA)
as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in providing additional benefits compared
to scaling and root planing with placebo in the treatment of chronic
periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p><bold>Study population and design</bold></p><p>Sixty systemically healthy, 25 male and 35 female (aged 30 to 45 years, mean age =
36.8 &#x000b1; 4.87 years), were selected for the study. The subjects had to comply with
following criteria:</p><p>(i) positive for the diagnosis of generalized chronic periodontitis, as assessed on
the basis of clinical attachment level (CAL), measured using a William's graduated
periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA),</p><p>(ii) good general health,</p><p>(iii) negative for hypersensitive to doxycycline,</p><p>(iv) negative for the use of any antibiotic or anti-inflammatory drugs within the 6
months preceding the beginning of the study.</p><p>Pregnant or nursing females were excluded from the study. The subjects were not
allowed to take any antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, or chlorhexidine-based
mouth rinses, during the entire period of the study.</p><p>After the proper examination and diagnosis, all the patients received oral hygiene
instructions. Six weeks following the initial therapy, plaque index (PI) and
periodontal bleeding index (PBI) were taken to evaluate the oral hygiene status and
patient compliance with oral hygiene instructions.</p><p>One persistent pocket of 5 - 7 mm probing depth surrounding a molar/premolar with a
clinically healthy crown was chosen as the experimental site in each patient. An
attempt was made to select the sites/teeth identical in terms of severity of the
periodontal disease. A comparable number of sites, from the upper and lower dental
arches were selected. Patients were divided into two groups: test group (treated by
SPR followed by local delivery of doxycycline hyclate 10%), and control group
(treated by SPR followed by local delivery of a gel containing glycerine as
placebo).</p><p>Clinical measurements were recorded at 6 weeks following the initial visits
(baseline) and again at 6 months. Full mouth supragingival plaque was assessed by
using PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Gingival inflammation was
assessed by PBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The probing
measurements recorded for assessment of the results were probing pocket depth (PPD),
CAL and gingival recession (REC). These measurements were recorded at 6 sites of
each experimental tooth; for later calculations, the mean of 6 sites was taken into
consideration. All the probing measurements were made with William's graduated
periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).</p><p>The purpose and design of this clinical trial was explained to the patients and the
informed consent was signed by every patient. The study protocol was approved by the
ethical committee of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, India.</p><p><bold>Clinical Procedures</bold></p><p>After recording the PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the PBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], probing measurements were carried out. PPD
and CAL were measured as the distance from bottom of the pocket to the most apical
portion of the gingival margin and the cemento-enamel junction, respectively. The
same operator (V.D.), who was blinded to the treatment groups, collected the
clinical data.</p><p>SRP was done using Hoe scalers and standard Gracey currettes (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL,
USA) under the local anaesthesia for the test and control group patients.</p><p>In the test quadrants, the periodontal pockets were treated by 10% doxycycline
hyclate in bioabsorbable vehicle, which was supplied as an Atrigel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (CollaGenx
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Newtown PA, USA) delivery system consisting of the two
syringes. Syringe A contained the polymer of poly lactic acid DL-Lactide (PLA),
dissolved in biocompatible carrier N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Syringe B contained
10% doxycycline hyclate, which was equivalent to 50 mg of the doxycycline. These two
syringes were coupled together just prior to use and was mixed for 100 cycles. Once
mixed, the doxycyline hyclate 10% was allowed to set at room temperature for 15
minutes and then was mixed for another 10 cycles before the use. A 23 gauge blunt
cannula was attached to the delivery syringe and gel was expressed into the
periodontal pocket. Any overflow of material was gently packed into the pocket with
a moist tip of curette in order to speed up coagulation of the polymer. The control
sites were treated by SRP followed by local delivery of a gel containing glycerine
as placebo.</p><p>The patients were recalled at 6 months and the clinical measurements recorded at the
baseline were repeated again.</p><p>The means and standard deviations of PPD, CAL, REC, PI and PBI at the baseline and at
the 6 months examination were calculated for both groups. The Student's paired
t-test was used to compare the data from the baseline to those at the 6 months for
each treatment group and between treatment groups. The level of significance was set
at P &#x0003c; 0.05. All statistical analysis was carried out with the aid of statistical
software (SPSS version 12.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty periodontal pockets (test sites) were treated by SRP combined with subgingival
doxycyline hyclate 10% therapy, while thirty control sites were treated by SRP
combined with placebo in a total of 60 chronic periodontitis patients. During the
course of the study, the healing was uneventful. No periodontal pocket sites showed
adverse reaction to doxycyline hyclate 10%. None of the selected patients dropped
out before the termination of study.</p><p>At the baseline, PPD was 5.83 &#x000b1; 0.53 mm in the test group and 5.70 &#x000b1; 0.65 mm in the
control group. Similarly, mean CAL was 6.50 &#x000b1; 0.50 mm in the test group and 6.53 &#x000b1;
0.68 mm in the control group. The mean REC was 0.66 &#x000b1; 0.60 mm in the test group and
0.83 &#x000b1; 0.64 mm in the control group. At the baseline, no statistically significant
differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed between the test and
control groups, indicating that the randomization process was effective (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of periodontal probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level

delivered controlled drug therapy of doxycycline hyclate 10% (Atridox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, CollaGenx
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Newtown PA, USA) in conjunction with a non-surgical treatment
of periodontal pockets affected by the chronic periodontitis. During the active
treatment, doxycycline hyclate 10% was well tolerated with no side effects observed
in any of patients. At the baseline, the investigated parameters on the sites
treated with SRP + doxycycline hyclate 10% were similar to those of SRP +
Placebo.</p><p>The adjunctive use of locally delivered antibiotics can provide additional benefit
when compared to the conventional therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The present study
demonstrated significantly greater PPD reductions in the both groups. Similarly, at
the 6 months examination significant gain of CAL was observed in the test (2.0 &#x000b1;
0.64 mm) and control group (1.13 &#x000b1; 1.07 mm) compared to the baseline with
significantly higher (P &#x0003c; 0.001) CAL gain of 0.87 &#x000b1; 0.22 mm in the test group
compared to the control group.</p><p>The difference in PPD reductions observed was apparently higher than the other
studies with similar experimental design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, Gupta et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] in a study reported a reduction of
2.73 &#x000b1; 1.33 mm PPD at 3 months following the administration of doxycycline hyclate
10% as an adjunct to mechanical therapy in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
The authors also reported a gain of 1.73 &#x000b1; 0.90 mm in CAL after the 3 months.
Similarly, Garrett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] compared two multicenter studies findings
of the locally delivered doxycycline hyclate 10% as a monotherapy with SRP and
showed similar results for either PPD reduction (1.3 mm and 0.9 mm, respectively) or
CAL gain (0.8 mm and 0.7 mm, respectively). The results obtained in the present
study were somewhat better in comparison with previous studies. The possible reasons
were the exclusion of smokers from the study and stringent plaque control throughout
the follow-up period by patients. Furthermore, it is well established that the
organized structure of biofilm can block proper diffusion or even inactivate the
pharmacological agents subgingivally. Thus, previous biofilm removal could favour
greater efficacy of the antibiotic against subgingival pathogens, explaining the
differences favouring the adjunctive therapy found in the present study.</p><p>Considering both moderate and deep pockets, a difference of 2.42 &#x000b1; 0.53 mm and 3.21 &#x000b1;
0.95 mm respectively were observed at the 6 months period for PPD reduction and 1.42
&#x000b1; 0.53 mm and 2.17 &#x000b1; 0.57 mm for CAL gain at the 6 months examination both favouring
the test group. However, considering deep sites, the present study showed
significant differences in PPD reduction (0.71 &#x000b1; 0.22 mm, P = 0.006) and CAL gain
(0.88 &#x000b1; 0.23 mm, P = 0.000) favouring the test group. Indeed, residual subgingival
deposits are frequently observed after conventional instrumentation in the deep
sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The use of the local drug
delivery is beneficial as it will provide the concentrated amount of drug in the
pockets, which is of the greater significance when the pockets are deeper and the
subgingival mechanical instrumentation alone cannot be relied upon. In addition, the
proportion of sites showing attachment gain of 3 mm in the present study was
significantly greater for the treatment with doxycycline hyclate 10% + SPR (80%)
than for the control group (30%). Similarly, the proportion of sites showing PPD
reduction of 3 mm was significantly greater for the treatment with doxycycline
hyclate 10% (70%) than for the control group (53.3%). A greater proportion of sites
showing PPD reduction and CAL gain could represent an advantage in maintenance
therapy, limiting the need for surgical procedures to fewer non-responding sites and
eventually extending the period between recall visits.</p><p>The local delivery system may have provided bactericidal levels of the doxycycline
hyclate 10% to the periodontal pocket, which resulted in a reduction of the
subgingival bacterial bioburden which led to the positive clinical outcomes. The
sustained levels achievable with the locally delivered doxycycline provided
bactericidal concentrations (i.e., MIC 90s) among the vast majority of
microorganisms present in the biofilm and may have been able to adequately penetrate
the depth of the subgingival biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An
additional benefit of the local drug delivery system is that it is relatively simple
procedure to perform and moreover, patient acceptance is better as compared to
invasive procedures such as the surgical treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>From the analysis of results it can be concluded that the use of doxycycline hyclate
10% as an adjunct to scaling and root planing provides more favourable and
statistically significant reductions in periodontal probing depth and gains in
clinical attachment level compared to scaling and root planing. The use of
doxycycline hyclate 10% as an adjunct to the scaling and root planing may provide
additional benefits to the periodontal treatment, especially for the treatment of
deep pockets.</p><p>The present study had few limitations as well. The small sample size has limited
statistical analysis of results and a long term analysis is needed to determine the
stability of results. Most importantly microbial culture tests would have more
comprehensively demonstrated the beneficial effects of doxycycline hyclate 10%.</p><p>Further studies are needed to determine which type of the patients and lesions will
benefit most from the incorporation of subgingivally delivered controlled release
doxycycline as an adjunct to the non-surgical periodontal therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec sec-type="acknowledgments and disclosure statements"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest related to this study.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cobb</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group><source>Non-surgical pocket therapy: mechanical.
