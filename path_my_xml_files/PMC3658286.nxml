The prevalence, potential risk factors, and clinical significance of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) were investigated in 196 Nigerian children with SCA in stable state. These children had clinical evaluation and assessment of their mid-stream urine (MSU) for pyuria, culture, and sensitivity tests; urinalysis for proteinuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hematocrit, serum creatinine and uric acid estimation. Children with confirmed ASB were compared with those without ASB. Those with confirmed ASB were monitored for 6 months for persistence of significant growth, development of symptomatic UTI, and evaluation of renal functions. The prevalence of probable and confirmed ASB in this cohort of SCA children were 12.2% and 6.6%, respectively. Confirmed ASB was more prevalent among older (<italic>P</italic> = 0.046) and female (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) SCA children, particularly those with pyuria (odd Ratio, OR = 5.4, 95% confidence interval, CI = 2.7-11.0, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and proteinuria (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 3.9-8.7, <italic>P</italic> = 0.006). Previous symptomatic UTI was not associated with ASB. Also, the mean eGFR, serum creatinine, and uric acid were not different in the group with ASB and those without ASB (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). At the end of 6 month follow-up, two (15.4%) of the 13 children with ASB had persistence of significant growth, but none develop symptomatic UTI. Also, none of the two with persistent ASB had hypertension or deranged renal function. ASB is a significant problem in older age female SCA children, although renal functions were not different among those with and without ASB. A large scale randomized placebo-controlled trial of conventional treatment for ASB in SCA is advocated to define its long-term clinical significance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Asymptomatic</kwd><kwd>bacteriuria</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>nigerian</kwd><kwd>pyuria</kwd><kwd>sickle cell anaemia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a major cause of morbidity in children, especially those with sickle cell anemia (SCA), who have impaired immunological state and are susceptible to recurrent infections including UTI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Both symptomatic and asymptomatic UTI in SCA children commonly result from repeated infarctions of the kidney, papillary necrosis, and inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] This may ultimately lead to chronic kidney disease. In resource poor settings where renal replacement therapy is limited, early detection and management of ASB in SCA children may retard this progression.</p><p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is defined as 100,000 or more bacterial colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) of uncentrifuged clean voided mid-stream urine specimen processed within 1 h of collection from a child without symptoms, usually in repeated urine samples.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] ASB has been found to be more prevalent among children with SCA than their counterparts with normal hemoglobin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>It is important to regularly monitor the pattern of the organisms implicated in childhood UTI, and their antibiotic sensitivity to limit development of chronic kidney disease in this high-risk group of children. However, clinico-laboratory factors facilitating the development of ASB in children with SCA, as well as whether ASB is a warning sign to more serious renal disease in children with SCA are unclear. This present study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence and risk factors to ASB in children with SCA in a University Teaching Hospital. In addition, it sought to determine the immediate clinical significance of ASB in children with SCA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study population comprised a group of sickle cell anemia children attending the Pediatric hematology clinic of the hospital. In this prospective study, children with SCA in stable state, i.e., free of any crises; were screened for UTI to determine the prevalence, potential determinants, and clinical significance of ASB among them. The study was done over a year period from November 2010 to October 2011. Children who had fever, or any other symptom, whether related or unrelated to urinary tract, or those who had history suggestive of recurrent UTI or use of antibiotics in the previous 2 weeks were not included.</p><p>Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics and Research Committee of the hospital, and written consent was obtained from parents and care-givers of each subject.</p><p>The socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and social class of the parent were recorded. Also, the frequency of significant painful episode, hospitalization, and transfusion program in the previous 1 year was documented. Significant painful episode, for the purpose of this study was defined as an acute painful event requiring treatment at a healthcare facility or at home with either (a) parenteral or an equianalgesic dose of oral narcotics or (b) parenteral or an equianalgesic dose of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Nutritional status was assessed using the National Center for Health Statistics and WHO (NCHS/WHO) definition of wasting, underweight, and stunting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Those with weight-for height below two standard deviations (SD) were categorized as wasted. Blood pressure (BP) was measured with the age-appropriate Accuson mercurial sphygmomanometer by standard techniques. Using the Pediatric Task Force guidelines on BP control, children with systolic and or diastolic BP above the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile for age, gender, and height were categorized as hypertensive.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Aseptically collected midstream urines (MSUs) were obtained from each patient and sent on the same day within an hour of collection for microbiological analysis. However, urinalysis which was performed on aliquots of the MSU specimen using Combur-9<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> test strips was done immediately after collection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Proteinuria was defined as a protein reading of trace or greater on dipstick urinalysis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] After collection, urine was centrifuged at 2000 revolutions per minute for 5 min, and the sediment was examined for red blood cells, white blood cells, casts, and bacteria.</p><p>Bacterial culture was performed by streaking 0.002 mL of the midstream urine with a calibrated loop on MacConkey and 5% sheep blood agar plates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] These plates were then incubated at 35&#x000b0;C for 24 h under aerobic conditions.</p><p>Isolates were taken as significant if there were &#x02265;10<sup>5</sup> colony forming unit/mL (CFU/mL) with two or less isolates. Colony counts between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> were regarded as doubtful and urine culture was repeated, whereas counts &#x02264;10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL were considered as insignificant and therefore taken as negative. Mixed growths of more than two urinary tract pathogens even if in significant quantities, were regarded as contaminated. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the significant isolates was done by comparing the zones of inhibition of the test organism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The patients with significant isolate of at least 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL of a urinary tract pathogen in their first MSU were noted. Second urine samples were collected from these children, i.e., those with significant growth in their first urine sample, and those whose second urine samples yielded significant bacteriuria due to the same urinary tract pathogen with the same sensitivity pattern were regarded as having confirmed asymptomatic bacteriuria. Those whose only the first MSU had significant growth were categorized as having probable ASB.</p><p>Renal function was measured with estimated eGFR using Schwartz formula,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and determination of serum level of creatinine and uric acid in the laboratory of the hospital by standard procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The SCA children with confirmed ASB were assessed at the end of 6 months follow-up for persistence of significant growth in their MSU, development of symptomatic UTI, and evaluation of renal function among those with persistent ASB.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0. The prevalence of ASB (the ratio of the number of urines classified as ASB to the total number of collected MSU samples) was determined. Differences in the means of the study variables among those with confirmed ASB and those with sterile urine were determined by independent <italic>t</italic>-tests and their proportions by Chi-squared tests. Potential predictors of ASB such as age, gender, socioeconomic class, past history of symptomatic urinary tract infection, frequency of significant painful episodes, hospitalization and transfusion in the previous 1 year; nutritional status, steady state hematocrit, proteinuria, and pyuria were determined by logistic regression analysis. Also, differences in the measure of renal functions such as eGFR, serum creatinine, and uric acid of those with and without ASB were determined. The 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI) for this proportion and tests were considered significant if <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sociodemographic characteristics of children with sickle cell anemia</title><p>A total of 196 children with SCA who were eligible for the study were assessed during the period.

Of these 39 urine samples, 26 (66.7%) including the initial two with doubtful growths, and 24 of those with initial significant growths had insignificant growth on second culture. Only 13 samples had significant growth on second culture and the patients with those urine were regarded as having confirmed ASB. Twenty-four children whose only first MSU had significant growth were regarded as having probable ASB. Thus, the prevalence of confirmed ASB was 6.6% and that of probable ASB was 12.2%. The probable ASB group was made up of 15 children whose second MSU samples grew organisms that were different from the first urine sample, eight with no further growth, and one with contamination in the second MSU sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Isolated organisms and their sensitivity pattern in the children with confirmed asymptomatic bacteriuria</title><p>Gram-negative organisms were the commonest organisms isolated from the urine of these patients, with Escherichia coli being the leading organism.
