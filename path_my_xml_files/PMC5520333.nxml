The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that individuals diagnosed with T1D participate in regular exercise in attempts to improve different health outcomes such as weight loss and optimal glycemic control. However, routine practice of this intervention is significantly hampered by the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally, it is frequently observed that people with T1D, concerned about having hypoglycemic events while exercising, tend to increase their caloric intake excessively, eventually leading to vexing glucose variability and further challenging the execution of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Prior evidence has focused on the effects of certain therapeutic and dietary adjustments on patients&#x02019; performance when they participate in sports that involve continuous physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, recent publications demonstrate safety, evidenced by protection in terms of rates of hypoglycemic events by reducing degludec insulin dosage in subjects with T1D, even with different exercise intensity and modality (indexed by lactate threshold and potentiometers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Therefore, it is pertinent to study similar pharmacological and dietary interventions but with intermittent exercise. This exercise modality is more demanding on the body than continuous physical activity of the same average intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with a greater rise in body temperature (0.3&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and an added elevated blood lactate concentration when compared at a given percentage of VO<sub>2</sub> max [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Concomitantly, sweat loss during intermittent exercise can exceed sweat loss during continuous exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], thereby increasing the reliance on carbohydrate (CHO) as a substrate during this type of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">In contrast to continuous exercise that only comprises the workload intensity and the total duration, intermittent exercise consists of five main components: peak work load intensity, peak workload duration, recovery load, recovery duration, and the mean load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A clinical trial comparing continuous with intermittent physical activity in subjects with T1D showed that a lower amount of exogenous carbohydrate is required to maintain euglycemia during intermittent compared with continuous activity, and this finding was not related to increased hepatic glucose output but to significantly lower glucose disposal in intermittent compared with continuous activity. Metabolically, this was paralleled by increased levels of counter-regulatory hormones (mainly growth hormone and catecholamines), and substantially higher levels of lactate in intermittent activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">A realistic recommendation is that exercisers with diabetes mellitus should take in adequate carbohydrate, along with sufficient (albeit likely reduced) insulin before, during, and after prolonged moderate-intensity or high-intensity workouts to maintain and restore muscle and liver glycogen and blood glucose, especially during that window of opportunity for glycogen repletion right after the end of exercise (within 30&#x000a0;min to 2&#x000a0;h after) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">It is also important to note that the speed with which insulin is absorbed and its onset of action may be increased by both local heating and massage at or near the application site. In addition to changes in insulin dosage and CHO intake, exercise itself may be used to prevent hypoglycemia. For instance, performing a brief (10&#x000a0;s) maximal intensity sprint either before or after a moderate intensity exercise session may protect against hypoglycemia onset, at least in the short run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The effect that the modifications on blood glucose levels before, during, and after exercise have on the performance of athletes in this type of sport has not been accurately established, and evidence addressing this hypothesis is scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. To our knowledge there is only one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in adolescents with T1D that found that hypoglycemia, but not hyperglycemia, impaired both the patients&#x02019; sports performance (tennis, basketball, or soccer skills) and their cognitive function. However, this trial had some important limitations including the fact that the sport performance tests were of a relatively short duration and did not demonstrate how blood glucose levels affected mental and physical stamina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Campbell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] developed a 4-step method that succeeded in protecting participants with T1D from both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia throughout exercise periods and the 24-h interval following exercise sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This method includes the following interventions: (1) 75% reduction of pre-exercise rapid-acting insulin dose (or 50% if intermittent exercise) given before a meal containing 1&#x000a0;g carbohydrate&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>-1</sup> 60&#x000a0;min prior to physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; (2) post-exercise meal containing 1&#x000a0;g low-glycemic index (GI) carbohydrate&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>-1</sup> 60&#x000a0;min after physical activity with 50% reduction on rapid-acting insulin dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; (3) consumption of a bedtime snack containing 0.3&#x000a0;g carbohydrate&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>-1</sup> also with a low GI and omitting prandial insulin administration for this meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; and (4) 20% reduction of basal insulin across the day when physical activity is performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In clinical trials, this 4-step method has demonstrated that it is possible to optimize blood glucose level during and after exercise by making mealtime adjustments to both rapid-acting and basal insulin, and to pre-exercise and post-exercise carbohydrate composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, previous clinical trials have focused on evaluating patients&#x02019; performance in continuous forms of sports like running or cycling, whereas evidence supporting this 4-step strategy in intermittent activities such as soccer, tennis, and basketball, is still lacking.</p><p id="Par38">Therefore, we designed a protocol for a randomized, crossover, double-blinded, controlled trial to evaluate the effect that this 4-step strategy for blood glucose control will have on patients&#x02019; performance in a series of soccer training sessions and cognitive assessments, compared with usual care recommendations. Moreover, in this study protocol, we introduce the evaluation of this 4-step method in a more realistic &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; scenario of sports practice, with simulation exercises based on the soccer gameplay field. We hypothesize that participants using the 4-step method will yield a better performance both in soccer-simulated sessions and in cognitive function evaluations when compared to the implementation of the usual ADA recommendations. We also expect fewer glycemic derangements and better glycemic control before, during, and after the performance of physical activities, when applying the 4-step method on the participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research aim</title><p id="Par39">The aim of this research is to assess the safety (evaluated as rate of hypoglycemia) that this 4-step strategy has on patients with T1D after completing a series of simulated soccer tests.

We will also aim to identify an optimal pre-exercise blood glucose level associated with a better performance in simulated soccer tests.

On the day after exercise, participants will return to their usual full basal insulin dose. Moreover, the type of insulin used in the clinical trial will not differ from that used by the participants prior to enrolling in the study.

Nonetheless, several instructions in this document are intended to help prevent hypoglycemia. To prevent low blood glucose level during prolonged (&#x0003e;30&#x000a0;min), predominantly aerobic exercise, additional carbohydrate intake and/or reductions in the insulin dose are typically required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

We hypothesize that besides showing an adequate safety profile (same or reduced number of hypoglycemic events), the 4-step method will also allow the subjects to achieve a better performance both in soccer and in cognitive testing (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> for a summary of the planned study interventions and assessments).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>SPIRIT flow diagram.
