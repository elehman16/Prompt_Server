The rational of prefrontal stimulation has been adapted from the mode of action known from rTMS using motor-evoked potentials though little is known about the precise effect of rTMS at prefrontal sites. The objective of the current study is to investigate the inhibitory effect of prefrontal 1 Hz rTMS by stimulating the generators of event-related potentials (ERP) which are located in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, 1 Hz rTMS was applied offline over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in 18 healthy subjects who subsequently underwent a GoNogo task. Both active conditions were compared to sham rTMS within a randomized and counterbalanced cross-over design in one day. ERPs were recorded during task performance and the N2 and the P3 were analysed. After 1 Hz rTMS of the left DLPFC (but not of the MPFC), an inhibitory effect on the N2 amplitude was observed, which was related to inhibitory control. In contrast, after 1 Hz rTMS of the MPFC (but not at the left DLPFC) a trend towards an increased P3 amplitude was found. There was no significant modulation of latencies and behavioural data. The results argue in favour of an inhibitory effect of 1 Hz rTMS on N2 amplitudes in a GoNogo task. Our findings suggest that rTMS may mildly modulate prefrontally generated ERP immediately after stimulation, even where behavioural effects are not measurable. Thus, combined rTMS-ERP approaches need to be further established in order to serve as paradigms in experimental neuroscience and clinical research.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the last decade, prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become increasingly established as a treatment for various mental diseases. For this purpose the rationale of stimulation has been adapted from the mode of action known from motor-evoked potentials (MEP). For example, in major depression a hemispheric asymmetry is assumed due to lower activity in the left compared to the right hemisphere <xref rid="pone.0067136-Thibodeau1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Hence major depression is treated by left excitatory <xref rid="pone.0067136-Schutter1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> or right inhibitory prefrontal rTMS <xref rid="pone.0067136-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Analogue to the inhibiting motor effect <xref rid="pone.0067136-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 1 Hz rTMS was applied to the prefrontal cortex of patients afflicted by mental diseases characterized by hyperexcitability such as the Tourette syndrome <xref rid="pone.0067136-Mantovani1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067136-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, post-traumatic stress disorder <xref rid="pone.0067136-Watts1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> or obsessive compulsive disorder <xref rid="pone.0067136-Prasko1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Some imaging studies of prefrontal 1 Hz rTMS have been conducted showing decreasing <xref rid="pone.0067136-Speer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> or increasing metabolism <xref rid="pone.0067136-Knoch1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Likely, these contradictory results are attributed to indirect transsynaptical rTMS effects combined with brain activity measurements which are mediated by metabolism. Therefore, neural oscillations which can be directly measured comparable to MEPs of rTMS at motor sites &#x02013; such as event-related potentials (ERPs) &#x02013; are a promising tool to estimate the mode of action of prefrontal rTMS.</p><p>In neurophysiological research, the N2 and P3 in GoNogo tasks are considered as ERPs associated with inhibitory control <xref rid="pone.0067136-Bokura1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> &#x02013; an executive process that is aberrant in some mental diseases <xref rid="pone.0067136-Lipszyc1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Moreover, the N2 is assumed to be generated in prefrontal cortices, namely the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, <xref rid="pone.0067136-Bekker1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0067136-VanVeen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, <xref rid="pone.0067136-Lavric1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>), whereas the P3 is located in frontocentral <xref rid="pone.0067136-Fallgatter1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> but also in parietal regions <xref rid="pone.0067136-Brass1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Until today, two paradigms had been used to investigate the impact of 1 Hz rTMS on the mechanism of inhibitory control in neurophysiological research <xref rid="pone.0067136-Rollnik1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067136-Upton1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In one study, subjects performed a stop signal task immediately before and after a train of 1 Hz rTMS had been applied to the right and left DLPFC. However, neither a change in ERPs (N2, P3) nor in behavioural measures was detectable <xref rid="pone.0067136-Upton1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The second study investigated the error-related negativity (ERN, <xref rid="pone.0067136-Rollnik1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>) using a flanker task, which has been hypothesized to be functionally comparable to the N2 component <xref rid="pone.0067136-VanVeen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, although the dissociation of both has been demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0067136-Ridderinkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067136-Swick1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In this study, an attenuation of the ERN was found after applying 1 Hz rTMS at the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) but not after lateral frontal stimulation. Moreover, the authors found enhanced error positivity (Pe) and a decreased rate of corrections <xref rid="pone.0067136-Rollnik1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Though research of rTMS on ERPs has been conducted, no study was intended to estimate the mode of action of prefrontal rTMS. Some studies have explored 1 Hz rTMS effects by positron emissions tomography (PET) leading to contradictory results <xref rid="pone.0067136-Speer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067136-Knoch1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Here, the mode of action of prefrontal 1 Hz rTMS is investigated in a GoNogo task by stimulating the generators of the N2 component known to be located in the prefrontal cortex. Therefore three different 1 Hz rTMS conditions (active left DLPFC, active MPFC and sham rTMS) are applied offline in a crossover design followed by ERP recording during a GoNogo paradigm. The N2 is analysed in both active conditions in contrast to sham control in the context of the P3 and behavioural data. As it is assumed that one train of prefrontal 1 Hz rTMS would have only a short inhibitory effect <xref rid="pone.0067136-Nyffeler1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, an inhibitory influence on the N2 amplitude could be expected immediately after 1 Hz rTMS (t1: 0&#x02013;15 min) but not in a delayed time frame (t2: 16&#x02013;30 min). Since it is presumed to modulate the generators of the N2, a differential effect on Go- and Nogo-trials is not expected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1 Ethics Statement</title><p>The experiment was conducted in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethical review committee of the Ludwig Maximillians University&#x02019;s medical faculty (project 239&#x02013;98, Amendment 1).

All subjects were na&#x000ef;ve to TMS and were paid for their participation. The subjects were recruited by local announcement. As a first step, a telephone interview was conducted to obtain information about possible neurological or psychiatric diseases of the subjects. Secondly, the subjects were invited to a preliminary investigation where a neuropsychological screening of executive functions was accomplished and the resting motor threshold (RMT) was determined. Only subjects with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders and a neuropsychological performance at average or above were included.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>3 GoNogo Task</title><p>ERPs were elicited by a visual GoNogo task (1200 stimuli) using 75% Go- and 25% Nogo-trails. Stimuli for Go- and Nogo-trials were circles filled with and without a grid pattern which were presented in the centre of the screen. The order of the stimuli was pseudo-randomized with a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) of 900, 1000, 1100, 1200 or 1300 ms. Participants were instructed to press a button as fast as possible when the Go-stimulus appeared and to withhold their response when the Nogo-stimulus emerged. Stimulus disappeared as soon as the button had been pressed thus subjects could influence the speed of the task. The task was divided into two halves (t1: 0&#x02013;15 min; t2: 16&#x02013;30 min) to analyse the immediate and the delayed effect of 1 Hz rTMS. Each half consisted of two blocks. The influence of handedness was controlled by the alteration of the performing hand within t1 and t2 resulting in four possible sequences (right/left &#x02013; right/left; right/left &#x02013; left/right; left/right &#x02013; left/right; left/right &#x02013; right/left). Each sequence of handedness was held constant within the experiment but was pseudo-randomized and counterbalanced between subjects. Previous to the task, a training session was available presenting an acoustic warning signal when the subject made a mistake (64 stimuli, ISI: 1000 ms).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>4 rTMS</title><p>The experiment was conducted in a crossover design during a single day <xref rid="pone.0067136-Grossheinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Subjects were seated in a comfortable chair with a distance to the monitor of approximately 1 m (approx. 39 in). After a baseline measurement (including the training session), a train of rTMS was applied at three stimulation sites (MPFC, left DLPFC, sham control) in a fully counterbalanced (six possible sequences performed three times) and randomized order to control for possible carry-over and/or sequence effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067136-g001">Figure 1</xref>). After each rTMS train the subject performed the GoNogo task, which lasted approximately 30 min. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during task performance at baseline and after TMS application. The interval between stimulation conditions was 50 min to exclude carry-over effects, as the rTMS protocol was expected to induce post-stimulation effects lasting only few minutes <xref rid="pone.0067136-Nyffeler1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0067136-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0067136.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental crossover design counterbalanced for stimulation sites.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0067136.g001"/></fig><p>A Magstim Super Rapid Magnetic Stimulator (Magstim Company Ltd, Whitland, UK) with a figure-8-shaped 70 mm coil was used for rTMS. RTM was determined on a separate day prior to the experimental session. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and defined as the minimum stimulus intensity that produced a liminal motor-evoked potential (&#x0003e;50 &#x000b5; in at least 50% of 10 trials). Stimulation sites were defined on the basis of the International 10&#x02013;20 EEG system. The frontopolar region targeting the ACC was stimulated at Fz <xref rid="pone.0067136-Kanda1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and left DLPFC was stimulated at the F3 position <xref rid="pone.0067136-Herwig1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. For sham rTMS the auditory cortex was chosen corresponding to the T3 electrode intending not to interfere with the visual task. For sham rTMS, the coil was held at an angle of 45&#x000b0; to the scalp to be sure not to exert an effective stimulation. Stimulations were applied at 120% of the individual RMT with a frequency of 1 Hz for 10 minutes (600 impulses). During rTMS, the respective electrode was transiently removed and replaced immediately afterwards.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>5 EEG-recording</title><p>EEG was recorded with 33 Ag/AgCl electrodes referred to Cz (32 channels: Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, C3, C4, P3, P4, T5, T6, T3, T4, O1, O2, Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz, A1, A2, T1, T2, Fc5, Fc6, Fc1, Fc2, Cp5, Cp6, P9, P10). An EEG-Cap was used with removable electrodes to allow for application of rTMS. Electrodes were positioned according to the International 10&#x02013;20 system. For the recording of eye movements an additional electrode (EOG) was positioned 1 cm lateral to the left eye. Electrode skin impedance was less than 5 k&#x003a9; at the beginning of the session.

Additionally a prominent &#x02018;electrode &#x000d7; trial type&#x02019; effect was observed demonstrating a larger GoNogo difference at Cz than at Fz in any condition for the N2 amplitude. This finding suggests that Cz reflected the GoNogo discrepancy in this experiment the best. Moreover, in line with our hypothesis, an inhibitory effect of 1 Hz rTMS was found which was only visible at Cz. Interestingly, a recent study described the Cz electrode as the best to measure conflict monitoring and response inhibition <xref rid="pone.0067136-Kropotov1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The relationship of the N2 amplitude with the personality trait DIS and ES of the SSS-V may also support that 1 Hz rTMS influenced a neurophysiological component which is related to processes of impulsive control <xref rid="pone.0067136-Roberti1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Moreover, sensation seeking is known as a heritable trait <xref rid="pone.0067136-Stoel1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and sensation seeking as measured by the SSS-V is well investigated in terms of a neurobiological background. For example, the subscale DIS was associated with low cortisol levels <xref rid="pone.0067136-Ballenger1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and the total score of SSS was related to low salivary cortisol levels <xref rid="pone.0067136-Shabani1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Another investigation discovered a relation between the DIS subscale of the SSS-V and the serotonergic systems in humans. Among other results the authors found that high compared with low disinhibited individuals exhibited low cortisol responses to a serotonergic challenge (ipsapirone) in a game designed to produce aggression <xref rid="pone.0067136-Netter1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.

No effect was observed on behavioural measures when 1 Hz rTMS was applied to the left and right DLPFC in a stop signal task <xref rid="pone.0067136-Upton1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Additionally no impact of 1 Hz rTMS on reaction times and errors rates in a flanker task was found though an attenuation of the ERN was reported after 1 Hz rTMS at the MPFC <xref rid="pone.0067136-Rollnik1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore the study is in line with previous findings and suggests that ERP measures may be more sensitive to the impact of rTMS than behavioural data.</p><p>In addition, the lack of behavioural results reported here is in line with the core assumption of endophenotype research. Gottesman and Gould (2003) introduced the endophenotype concept as &#x0201c;measurable components unseen by the unaided eye along the pathway between disease and distal genotype&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0067136-Gottesman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In this experiment, ERP measurements are not observable in contrast to open behaviour without any supporting tool. Hence, the endophenotype approach is one concept which explains why modifications of ERP data without any accompanying behavioural changes are not contradictory. Specifically, the N2 wave is proved to be heritable <xref rid="pone.0067136-Anokhin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, which is another criteria of the endophenotype concept <xref rid="pone.0067136-Gottesman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Interestingly, the N2 amplitude is assumed as endophenotype in disorders affecting inhibitory control as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) <xref rid="pone.0067136-Albrecht1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067136-Albrecht2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>In sum, modifications of ERP data accompanied by a lack of behavioural effects is not contradictory and in line with the endophenotype concept. This statement is underlined by the discussion of the N2 wave as endophenotype of ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>4 Limitations and Conclusions</title><p>In the current study the mode of action of prefrontal 1 Hz rTMS was investigated on N2 amplitudes in the context of behavioural performance and the P3 amplitude in a GoNogo task. Both active conditions were compared to sham rTMS within a randomized and counterbalanced cross-over design in one day.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, the cross-over design comparing two active and one sham rTMS conditions on the same day is definitely not optimal regarding potential carry-over effects between active and sham conditions, but it has the advantage to exclude interday-variability which may make it more difficult to detect small effects as observed in the current study. Though post-stimulation effects of rTMS are regularly very short-lived and the 1 Hz rTMS effect was observed immediately after stimulation and absent in a second time period, carry-over effects cannot be fully excluded. This argument is serious especially for the observed trend of an enhanced P3 amplitude after 1 Hz rTMS of MPFC as the P3 depend on generators within a complex network <xref rid="pone.0067136-Mulert1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Thus in future studies, rTMS sessions on separate days are recommended and crucial to replicate our experimental findings.</p><p>Second, rTMS was targeted based on electrode positions of the 10&#x02013;20 system, but not neuronavigated to a distinct anatomical location. Recently, it has been shown that standard targets and even anatomical targets are not reliable as the individual connectivity of such targets may be highly variable <xref rid="pone.0067136-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Thus, one may consider using individually defined target regions based on resting state connectivity in conjunction with neuronavigated rTMS in future studies.</p><p>As hypothesized, an inhibiting effect after 1 Hz rTMS of the left DLPFC was observed on the N2 amplitude which may be related to inhibitory control in a GoNogo task. Unexpected a trend for an excitatory effect was found after 1 Hz rTMS at the MPFC on the P3 amplitude, which should be regarded with caution due to the exploratory nature of this finding.</p><p>Despite the fact that replication of our findings is needed, this study supports the idea of establishing ERP-based paradigms for prefrontal rTMS which may serve as experimental means for testing rTMS protocols in a similar manner as motor cortex paradigms have been used previously.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0067136.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
