This study was approved by Ethics Committee of our hospital, all procedures were performed in accordance with ethical approval institutional guidelines.</p><p>After overnight fasting, blood sample was collected for measurement of Apelin-13, Procollagen type-I N propeptide (PINP) and Cross-linked carboxy terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (ICTP) on the second day after admission. Serum level of Apelin-13 were measured with commercial human enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits, and the serum level of PINP and ICTP was measured with radioimmunoassay method. In addition, BMD was tested with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner by two experienced technicians. The measurement of BMD in each subject was performed at left hip and lumbar spine from L1 to L4. To evaluate the level of BMD, T-scores were used and classified based on the World Health Organization criteria: T-score &#x02264;&#x02212;2.5 SD indicates osteoporosis; T-score &#x0003e;&#x02212;2.5 and &#x0003c;&#x02212;1.0 SD indicates osteopenia; T-score &#x02265;&#x02212;1.0 indicates normal.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The included patients were divided into normal, osteopenia and osteoporosis group according to the outcome of BMD measurements.</p><p>SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis and p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.

To the best of our knowledge, few studies have been carried out in this field.</p><p>It is apparent that patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus are at high risk of fracture. However, some studies indicated that patients presented generally normal or increased BMD<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Although some other factors, such as diabetic complications, may lead to increased risk of fall and fracture in these patients, the main reason may be attributed to the value of BMD.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In the current study, we found the level of Apelin-13 in osteoporosis and osteopenia group was significantly lower than that in normal group, and multivariate analysis showed that in all included patients the level of Apelin-13 was positively correlated to the value of BMD, demonstrating that Apelin-13 may be a protective factor for osteoporosis in patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>In addition, PINP, an osteoblast-derived protein, is one biological response marker during treatment for osteoporosis.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> At the same time, ICTP, as a specific component of type I collagen, generates from damaged mature bone matrix, and can represent a sensitive indicator of bone resorption in vivo.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Subsequently, in the current study we evaluate the relation between Apelin-13, ICTP and PINP to detect the influence of Apelin-13 on osteoporosis. We found a close relationship between Apelin-13, PINP and ICTP; the level of Apelin-13 was positively correlated to PINP, but negatively correlated to ICTP. This demonstrated that Apelin-13 may be a biological marker in supervising bone resorption or formation.</p><p>Some authors studied the relation between osteoporosis and Type-2 diabetes mellitus and related risk factors for osteoporosis. In a study of forty patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus, Zhang and colleagues found that the prevalence of osteoporosis is closely related with gender, BMI, disease course and glucose level.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In another study of 87 patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus, Wang found that between normal control group and osteoporosis group, there were significant differences in gender, age, weight and height, but no differences in BMI and disease course.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In the current study, we found there were significant differences in age and gender, but not in disease course, BMI, weight, and height among the three groups. In terms of the risk factors related to osteoporosis in Type-2 diabetes mellitus, some viewpoints are similar, but some are different, which may be attributed to many factors such as sample size and patient selection. However, most of the studies demonstrated that gender is correlated to the occurrence of osteoporosis in Type-2 diabetes. The difference in BMD distribution between genders may be explained by the differences in endocrine and paracrine factors, and the rapid decrease of sex steroid levels in postmenopausal women aggravates the bone loss.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, we found that the level of Apelin-13 was negatively related to age, demonstrating the risk of osteoporosis may be added with age, this conclusion was consistent with previous studies.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that there was a close relationship between Apelin-13, BMD, ICTP and PINP, suggesting that Apelin-13 plays an important role in the occurrence of osteoporosis in patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus. However, the current study has its limitations. First, the close relationship between Apelin-13, BMD, ICTP and PINP were found, but their interaction and related mechanism were still unclear. Second, in this study only patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus were included and no normal controls were recruited, but the level of Apelin-13 as well as abovementioned relations in normal populations may be different. Third, the sample size was small and some comparisons showed no significance, in a study with large scale sample the results may be different. Thus, all these issues need to be studied and resolved in future.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Author`s Contribution</title><p><bold>SPL</bold> conceived, designed and did statistical analysis &#x00026;
