However, both COX-2 inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs may be associated with adverse cardiovascular side effects. Data from randomised and observational studies suggest that celecoxib has similar cardiovascular toxicity to traditional NSAIDs. The overall safety balance of a strategy of celecoxib therapy versus traditional NSAID therapy is unknown. The European Medicines Agency &#x000a0;requested studies of the cardiovascular safety of celecoxib within Europe. The Standard care versus Celecoxib Outcome Trial (SCOT) compares the cardiovascular safety of celecoxib with traditional NSAID therapy in the setting of the European Union healthcare system.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>SCOT is a large streamlined safety study conducted in Scotland, England, Denmark and the Netherlands using the Prospective Randomised Open Blinded Endpoint design. Patients aged over 60&#x02005;years with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, free from established cardiovascular disease and requiring chronic NSAID therapy, are randomised to celecoxib or their previous traditional NSAID. They are then followed up for events by record-linkage within their normal healthcare setting. The hypothesis is non-inferiority with a confidence limit of 1.4. The primary endpoint is the first occurrence of hospitalisation or death for the Anti-Platelet Trialists&#x02019; Collaboration (APTC) cardiovascular endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. Secondary endpoints are (1) first hospitalisation or death for upper gastrointestinal ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation or obstruction); (2) first occurrence of hospitalised upper gastrointestinal ulcer complications or APTC endpoint; (3) first hospitalisation for heart failure; (4) first hospitalisation for APTC endpoint plus heart failure; (5) all-cause mortality and (6) first hospitalisation for new or worsening renal failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>SCOT has been approved by the relevant ethics committees.

SCOT is a streamlined safety trial with good external validity as it is conducted in the normal care setting. The limitations of the study include the need to extrapolate from the results to guide therapy in younger patients and in patients without a history of using NSAIDS and the lack of traditional study follow-up visits, although it has been shown that record-linkage can be used effectively in trial follow-up to detect events.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastrointestinal toxicity is one of the most common serious drug adverse events requiring hospitalisation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Upper gastrointestinal complications result in considerable morbidity and mortality. The cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective NSAIDs gained popularity based on evidence that they are associated with a lower incidence of ulcer-related upper gastrointestinal tract complications compared with traditional non-selective NSAID therapy. However, the withdrawal of rofecoxib<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> due to cardiovascular toxicity and the suggestion that most NSAIDs are probably associated with increased cardiovascular adverse events when compared with placebo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> have led to the need for further prospective studies on the safety of other COX-2 inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs.</p><p>The cardiovascular safety profile of COX-2 inhibitors was brought into question following the results of two placebo-controlled studies designed to test the hypothesis that the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib might prevent colorectal adenomas and colorectal tumours. The Adenomatous Polyp Prevention on Vioxx Trial randomised patients with a history of colorectal adenomas to rofecoxib 25&#x02005;mg or placebo and reported an excess of cardiovascular thrombotic events in the group treated with rofecoxib.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> The Prevention of Sporadic Colorectal Adenomas with Celecoxib (APC) Trial randomised patients with previous colorectal adenomas to celecoxib 400&#x02005;mg twice daily, celecoxib 200&#x02005;mg twice daily or placebo and reported a dose-related increase in the risk of cardiovascular events in the celecoxib groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> However, the Prevention of Colorectal Sporadic Adenomatous Polyps (PreSAP) Trial did not show a significant increase in cardiovascular events with celecoxib 400&#x02005;mg given once per day versus placebo in patients with previous colorectal adenomas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> In the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-Inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT), which was stopped early due to the findings of the APC trial, there was a suggestion of an increased risk of cardiovascular events with naproxen but not celecoxib compared with placebo, although this study was underpowered, and the cardiovascular results must therefore be interpreted with caution. In a later meta-analysis of six randomised double-blind placebo controlled trials of celecoxib in non-arthritis conditions, which included analysis of the APC, PreSAP and ADAPT studies and three other smaller studies (MA27, The Diabetic Macular Edema Trial and the Celecoxib/Selenium Trial), there was no evidence of increased cardiovascular risk with celecoxib in low-risk patients but there was a dose-dependent increase in cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></p><p>In the Multinational Etoricoxib and Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term programme, which compared cardiovascular outcomes with etoricoxib 60 or 90&#x02005;mg daily and diclofenac 150&#x02005;mg daily in patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, the rates of thrombotic cardiovascular events were similar in patients randomised to either drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></p><p>In trials of celecoxib versus traditional NSAIDs, no evidence of increased cardiovascular toxicity has been seen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> In large observational studies, celecoxib has not been found to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk versus other NSAIDs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> or non-use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> At present, much of the available data comes from observational studies and while it seems clear that rofecoxib increased cardiovascular risk, many traditional NSAIDs may also pose considerable risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>

This paper describes the design and rationale for The Standard care versus Celecoxib Outcome Trial (SCOT), which is a prospective trial randomising patients without a history of cardiovascular disease to celecoxib or traditional NSAID and measuring cardiovascular outcomes that is expected to report in 2014. This trial, which started recruiting in 2008, is a large streamlined safety study of celecoxib versus traditional NSAIDs in patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis that aims to address the relative cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of the two treatment strategies in a real-world setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Overall trial design</title><p>SCOT is an active comparator, streamlined clinical trial with a Prospective, Randomised, Open label, Blinded Endpoint evaluation (PROBE) design.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> It aims to compare the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of continuing with current traditional NSAID therapy versus switching to celecoxib therapy in patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

Written informed consent is obtained from participants. The research nurse records baseline variables, takes blood and urine for baseline biochemistry and haematology and records the medical history. Blood samples are analysed at the local health service laboratory according to usual practice. Serum for future analyses and blood for future genetic analyses are stored by regional centres. Subjects who have given informed consent and meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are randomised to receive celecoxib or to continue on their usual traditional NSAID therapy. Randomisation is performed by contacting a central randomisation facility based at the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow by telephone or via a web-based service.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Stratification of randomisation</title><p>Prior to the start of the study, a group of general practitioners&#x02019; databases in Scotland and the centralised dispensing database in Denmark were screened to identify the distribution of usage of different NSAIDs. On this basis, each NSAID with a frequency of usage &#x0003e;12% (ibuprofen and diclofenac) was assigned its own stratum. Other NSAIDs were pooled into a single stratum for the purpose of randomisation. The allocated therapy is prescribed using the normal health service prescription form. Thus, therapy is provided to patients in an open-label fashion in order to mimic normal care as closely as possible.</p><p>After randomisation, a health service prescription is issued for the randomised drug and the patient's case records and computer file are marked to show that they are participating in SCOT. Repeat prescriptions are issued according to normal clinical practice and patients take their medication according to clinical need. This method is &#x02018;naturalistic&#x02019; in that it most closely mimics the real world of NSAID use.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Trial treatments</title><p>The trial treatments are either celecoxib (Celebrex) or any other licensed, non-selective traditional NSAID listed in the British National Formulary section 10.1.1 (ibuprofen, aceclofenac, acemetacin, dexibuprofen, dexketoprofen, diclofenac sodium, diflunisal, etodolac, fenbufen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indometacin, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, meloxicam, nabumetone, naproxen, piroxicam, sulindac, tenoxicam, tiaprofenic acid and Arthrotec (diclofenac plus misoprostol)).</p><p>Celecoxib is prescribed at standard licensed doses of up to 200&#x02005;mg twice daily&#x02014;the dose is adjusted as necessary up to this maximum limit to provide adequate symptomatic relief.

The celecoxib run-in was carried out in all patients completing screening for the study. They were asked to discontinue their current NSAID and enter a 2-week (14&#x000b1;7&#x02005;days) open-label run-in of treatment with celecoxib as two to four 100&#x02005;mg tablets taken daily in single or divided doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002295F2">figure 2</xref>). During the run-in period, the dose of celecoxib was titrated to achieve equivalent pain control to their previous NSAID therapy. At the end of this period, subjects who had taken at least one dose of celecoxib and who did not express a strong preference for either their previous treatment or celecoxib were eligible for randomisation.

For example, in the Therapeutic Arthritis Research and Gastrointestinal Event Trial, only 60% of subjects completed the trial and 31&#x02013;37% of subjects withdrew from randomised therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> In the CLASS study, less than 50% of those randomised completed the study and there was differential dropout between the two treatment arms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> A similar trial run-in phase was used in the Heart Protection Study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> It was hoped that by having a celecoxib run-in period, dropouts after randomisation would be avoided. However, after a review of the data on the level of dropouts after the first few years of the trial, it was clear that the celecoxib run-in period was resulting in different rates of randomisation in different centres with hardly any being excluded in some centres and a high proportion being excluded in others. For this reason, the protocol was amended to remove the run-in period and to perform randomisation on the day of screening if the subject was eligible. This amendment was implemented in each region on different dates but was completed by September 2010. Since then, up to October 2012, around 3500 further patients were randomised without a run-in period. We have since formally evaluated the influence of the presence or absence of the celecoxib run-in period on study dropout rates and found no significant difference (adjusted OR for dropout at 180&#x02005;days in patients with the celecoxib run-in period was 1.28 (95% CI 0.76 to 2.14).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Trial endpoints</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>The primary endpoint is the first occurrence of hospitalisation or death for the Anti-Platelet Trialists&#x02019; Collaboration &#x000a0;cardiovascular endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death.</p><p>The secondary and tertiary endpoints and further planned analyses are listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx3">box 3</xref>.</p><boxed-text id="bx3" position="float"><label>Box 3</label><caption><title>Secondary and tertiary endpoints and further analyses</title></caption><p>Secondary endpoints</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>First occurrence of hospitalisation or death for upper gastrointestinal ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation or obstruction).</p></list-item><list-item><p>First occurrence of hospitalised upper gastrointestinal ulcer complications or Anti-Platelet Trialists&#x02019; Collaboration (APTC) endpoint.</p></list-item><list-item><p>First hospitalisation for heart failure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>First occurrence of hospitalisation for APTC endpoint plus heart failure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All cause mortality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>First hospitalisation for new or worsening renal failure.</p></list-item></list><p>Tertiary endpoints</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>First occurrence of hospitalisation or death for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation or obstruction not due to ulcers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>First occurrence of hospitalisation or death for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation or obstruction.</p></list-item><list-item><p>First occurrence of hospitalisation or death for all episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation or obstruction.</p></list-item></list><p>Further planned analyses</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Myocardial infarction as a whole and as the components of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and non ST elevation myocardial infarction.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Non-fatal stroke.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cardiovascular death.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Analyses of GI subcomponents</p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Hospitalisation or death for all episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hospitalisation or death for all episodes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hospitalisation or death for all episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding.</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>All uncomplicated upper gastrointestinal ulcers detected during the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All upper gastrointestinal ulcers (complicated and uncomplicated) detected during the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>New prescription for ulcer healing drugs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All hospitalisations.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Assessment of study endpoints, adverse events and serious adverse events</title><p>The principal mode of collection of study endpoints, adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) in SCOT is by record-linkage from national population healthcare databases. Record-linkage retrieves electronic records of hospitalisations and deaths for individual patients within the study from central databases. Hospitalisation discharge diagnoses are coded and causes of death are reported. Any events of particular interest (potential study endpoints) are investigated further and confirmed by retrieving the original case records. Record-linkage has previously been demonstrated to be highly effective in the follow-up of patients for study events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Any treatment-related adverse events and SAEs detected and reported by research staff or physicians manually are also collected and investigated.</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Mortality data by record-linkage</title><p>Mortality and certified cause-specific mortality are retrieved from national mortality record systems by record-linkage at approximately 3 monthly intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Morbidity data by record-linkage</title><p>Hospitalisations are retrieved by record-linkage from national systems at approximately 3 monthly intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Data abstraction for endpoint adjudication</title><p>For each death, and for each hospitalisation that is a potential endpoint, primary care and secondary care records and, if appropriate, full death certification data are retrieved. Diagnostic validation forms are filled in to supplement scanned images of original case records relating to the endpoints in question. The scanned images of case records and the data validation forms are collated. Any record of randomised treatment is removed before these collated documents are passed to the relevant (cardiovascular or gastrointestinal) endpoint committee for adjudication as to the hospital diagnosis or the cause of death.

Adverse events are defined as abnormal test findings, clinically significant symptoms and signs, changes in physical examination findings or hypersensitivity. An SAE or a serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: results in death, is life-threatening (immediate risk of death), requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.</p><p>For these adverse events, further information is obtained to determine the outcome of the adverse event and to confirm whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the sponsor. Physicians assess causality, and the expectedness of any SAE thought to be related to a study drug, on the web portal. Follow-up of SAEs continues until the event has resolved or the patient has died. In this study, primary and secondary study endpoints and their associated symptoms and laboratory abnormalities are not reported as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Drug Reactions. Further, adverse events that are neither considered to be serious nor related to randomised treatment are not reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data analysis/statistical method</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Sample size determination</title><p>Originally, the study was powered at 90% to exclude a 30% poorer outcome on celecoxib compared with traditional NSAIDs (HR=1.3) in the primary endpoint with a non-inferiority analysis between the two treatment strategies. However, owing to slower than expected recruitment and lower than expected event rates, the trial steering committee made the decision to revise the power of the study to 80% and the non-inferiority limit to 1.4 in October 2011.</p><p>The statistical method to be used will involve a stratified Cox proportional hazards model including the randomisation strata and the randomised treatment group as covariates. Statistical significance for the treatment differences will be based on the Wald statistics and on two-sided 95% CIs for the estimated HR comparing celecoxib to non-selective NSAIDs. The original power calculations suggested that, for an average duration of 2&#x02005;years&#x02019; exposure to treatment with a 30% non-inferiority limit and an NSAID-exposed CV event rate of 2% per year, the study would require 6841 subjects in each treatment group or 13&#x02005;682 subjects in total and 611 patients with endpoints (based on an intention-to-treat analysis). Since an on-treatment analysis would result in reduced follow-up that was difficult to predict a priori, follow-up would be continued until 611 endpoints were identified in the per-protocol population. Following the revision to the power calculation made in 2011 (power 80%, non-inferiority limit 1.4), the number of primary endpoints required to achieve adequate power in the per-protocol population decreased to 277.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>A full Statistical Analysis Plan has been developed.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> It is a randomised, double-blind, parallel group study of cardiovascular safety in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis patients with, or at high risk of, cardiovascular disease comparing celecoxib with naproxen and ibuprofen.</p><p>Traditional trials have good internal validity but less external validity. A large streamlined safety trial is expected to have good external validity. However, such a trial becomes more observational with time and internal validity becomes less reliable. The results of PRECISION and SCOT are likely to be available by around 2014, and we believe that the results will inform clinical practice in a more reliable way than previous studies of the cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs. We believe that naturalistic trials such as SCOT will be essential in shaping healthcare policy in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e385" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002295.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e386" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002295.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> The manuscript was written by the authors on behalf of the SCOT Study Group collaborators as listed below, many of whom provided critical input to the manuscript.
