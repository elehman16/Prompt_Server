For pneumonia with chest indrawing in children aged 3&#x02013;59 months, injectable penicillin and hospitalization was the recommended treatment. This increased the health care cost and exposure to nosocomial infections. We compared the clinical and cost outcomes of a seven day treatment with oral amoxicillin with the first 48&#x000a0;h of treatment given in the hospital (hospital group) or at home (home group).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted an open-label, multi-center, two-arm randomized clinical trial at six tertiary hospitals in India. Children aged 3 to 59&#x000a0;months with chest indrawing pneumonia were randomized to home or hospital group. Clinical outcomes, treatment adherence, and patient safety were monitored through home visits on day 3, 5, 8, and 14 with an additional visit for the home group at 24&#x000a0;h. Clinical outcomes included treatment failure rates up to 7&#x000a0;days (primary outcome) and between 8&#x02013;14 days (secondary outcome) using the intention to treat and per protocol analyses. Cost outcomes included direct medical, direct non-medical and indirect costs for a random 17&#x000a0;% subsample using the micro-costing technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>1118 children were enrolled and randomized to home (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;554) or hospital group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;564). Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. Overall treatment failure rate was 11.5&#x000a0;% (per protocol analysis). The hospital group was significantly more likely to fail treatment than the home group in the intention to treat analysis. Predictors with increased risk of treatment failure at any time were age 3&#x02013;11 months, receiving antibiotics within 48&#x000a0;h prior to enrolment and use of high polluting fuel. Death rates at 7 or 14&#x000a0;days did not differ significantly. (Difference &#x02212;0.0&#x000a0;%; 95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;0.5 to 0.5). The median total treatment cost was Rs. 399 for the home group versus Rs. 602 for the hospital group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), for the same effect of 5&#x000a0;% failure rate at the end of 7&#x000a0;days of treatment in the random subsample.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Home based oral amoxicillin treatment was equivalent to hospital treatment for first 48&#x000a0;h in selected children of chest indrawing pneumonia and was cheaper. Consistent with the recent WHO simplified guidelines, management with home based oral amoxicillin for select children with only fast breathing and chest-indrawing can be a cost effective intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01386840">NCT01386840</ext-link>, registered 25<sup>th</sup> June 2011 and the Indian Council of Medical Research REFCTRI/2010/000629.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12887-015-0510-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Severe pneumonia</kwd><kwd>Lower chest indrawing</kwd><kwd>Hospitalization</kwd><kwd>Oral amoxicillin</kwd><kwd>Cost effective</kwd><kwd>Randomized trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Pneumonia is the single largest killer of children under the age of five worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The disease kills over two million children under the age of five every year&#x02014; nearly one fourth (400,000) of these deaths occur in India alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. About half of pneumonia cases in India are caused by bacteria and could be treated with antibiotics. However, only 13&#x000a0;% of Indian children under the age of five with suspected pneumonia receive antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The 2008 WHO guidelines for treatment of non-severe pneumonia (cough, fever and fast breathing) recommend health workers to provide oral antibiotics for three days at home but urgent referral for hospitalization for parenteral (injectable) antibiotics and other supportive therapy after administration of first dose of antibiotics, if the child has severe pneumonia (cough, fever, fast breathing and lower chest indrawing) or very severe disease (pneumonia with the presence of WHO defined danger signs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Often inability to access a referral facility deprives these children from getting appropriate care. For many families, seeking treatment for their children at a health care facility is often logistically and financially burdensome thus denying them early administration of antibiotics within 48&#x000a0;h that can potentially improve their outcomes. Additionally transport to a distant facility can entail serious delays in effective treatment. Many children with severe pneumonia referred for admission to a hospital could die in transit or reach too sick to be saved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, when hospitalized, the children with severe pneumonia are vulnerable to nosocomial infections in crowded hospital wards and are also at risk of needle-borne infections due to parenteral therapy. Two important studies have addressed such barriers to the recommended treatment of severe pneumonia. The first study was intended to determine whether oral antibiotics are equivalent to injectable antibiotics when both are given in the hospital. This was an open label equivalency study called APPIS (Amoxicillin Penicillin Pneumonia International Study), which was a large multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing injectable penicillin versus oral amoxicillin given for 7&#x000a0;days to children in the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The second study was called &#x0201c;NO-SHOTS&#x0201d; (New Outpatient Short-Course Home Oral Therapy for Severe Pneumonia Study) and was a randomized, open-label equivalency trial done at seven study sites in Pakistan and compared initial hospitalization and parenteral ampicillin for 48&#x000a0;h followed by 3&#x000a0;days of oral amoxicillin at home, to 5&#x000a0;days of home-based treatment with oral amoxicillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. NO-SHOTS showed that home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin is equivalent to hospital based treatment with parenteral ampicillin in selected children aged 3&#x02013;59 months with WHO defined severe pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Later, another study- the MASS study (Multicenter Amoxicillin Severe pneumonia Study) showed that clinical treatment failure and adverse event rates among children with severe pneumonia treated at home with oral amoxicillin did not substantially differ across geographic areas (Bangladesh, Ghana, Vietnam and Egypt) and hence home-based therapy of severe pneumonia could possibly be applied to a wide variety of settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus oral amoxicillin at home has proven clinically efficacious in various settings across the world for treatment of selected children with WHO defined severe pneumonia. The Lancet Series on Childhood Pneumonia and Diarrhoea has reported that case management is one of the three most effective interventions to reduce pneumonia deaths in children but also noted that the cost effectiveness of these interventions in national health systems needs urgent assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. So the cost savings or cost-effectiveness of home-based oral antibiotic treatment for WHO defined severe pneumonia in childhood would be important to inform public policy and has not been previously evaluated.</p><p>Therefore our objective was to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a 7-day home-based course of oral amoxicillin as compared to oral amoxicillin administered for the first 48&#x000a0;h in the hospital followed by 5&#x000a0;days of home-administration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted an open labelled multi-center prospective two-arm randomized clinical trial at 6 referral hospitals in India (Chandigarh, Chennai, Nagpur, Pune, Sewagram and Aligarh) to evaluate the difference of rates of treatment failures of a 7-day course of oral amoxicillin when administered at home as compared to a 7-day course of oral amoxicillin administered for the first 48&#x000a0;h in the hospital followed by 5&#x000a0;days of home-administration to treat WHO defined severe pneumonia in children aged 3&#x02013;59 months. In addition to the clinical outcomes, the costs of treating severe pneumonia, the differences in costs of treatment in the two study groups and the cost-effectiveness of the two alternative treatment strategy was also assessed in this trial.</p><p>The study was approved by the institutional ethics committees of: Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Nagpur; Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Chandigarh; Government General Hospital, Chennai; B.J.

A separate list was generated for each site and the individual patient assignments were placed in a series of sealed opaque envelopes that were opened for serially eligible patients. The eligible study participants were randomly allocated to either the hospital group in which syrup amoxicillin (50&#x000a0;mg/kg/d in two divided doses) was administered in hospital for initial two days by hospital staff followed by administration at home for five days by the care-giver, or, to the home group in which the first dose of amoxicillin was administered in hospital and subsequent doses were administered by the care-giver at home for seven days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>Clinical and demographic data was collected at baseline along with throat swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate. Both groups were followed up through home visits on day 3, 5, 8 &#x00026; 14 and home group had an additional home visit at 24&#x000a0;h. During these follow-up home visits, data regarding outcomes were collected. This included clinical deterioration of disease any time after enrolment, change of antibiotics, hospitalization, serious adverse events considered related to amoxicillin, left against medical advice (LAMA), voluntary withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>Treatment failure was defined as presence of any one of the following conditions - clinical deterioration of disease any time after enrolment that required change of antibiotics, hospitalization (any time for the children in the home managed group or clinical decision to extend the hospitalization longer than 48&#x000a0;h in the hospitalized group), an occurrence of a serious adverse event related to amoxicillin, left against medical advice (LAMA), voluntary withdrawal of consent from the study, or loss to follow up. Clinical deterioration was defined as appearance of signs of very severe disease such as persistent vomiting (vomiting repeated three times within an hour due to any reason), central cyanosis, grunt, stridor, abnormal sleepiness or difficulty to wake, inability to drink, SpO2&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;85&#x000a0;%, convulsions, or death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Antibiotics would be changed if there was clinical deterioration, developing a co-morbid condition, or, persisting fever&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;98.6&#x000a0;&#x000b0;F with lower chest indrawing even after 3<sup>rd</sup> day, or, fever alone at day 5, or, lower chest indrawing alone (non responsive to three doses of nebulisation with bronchodilator) at day 5 (as reported by the mother), or, persistence of fast breathing after day 7 which is unresponsive to three doses of nebulization with bronchodilator. Rigorous training and retraining of the research physicians using standard operating procedures was used to minimize the biases that may arise due to lack of uniformity in assessing clinical signs between treatment groups and across sites. Strong quality monitoring processes were also established. An additional file describes the relevant standard operating procedures in details [see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Cost outcomes</title><p>Cost data were collected for 17.2&#x000a0;% patients starting from before enrolment till day 14 or till the patient recovered whichever was earlier. Three distinct types of forms were used at enrolment, daily in the hospital and at each visit respectively. The cost data were also collected for those patients who left against medical advice. The forms included information about the service provider and the type of service. We disregarded fixed costs that were common for the two strategies. The protocol driven costs, such as investigations required for the study but not otherwise conducted routinely, were excluded from calculation of these costs. The variable costs i.e. direct medical, direct non-medical and indirect costs of the two treatment arms were measured using micro-costing technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p><bold>Direct medical costs</bold> included costs of medical resources utilized by the patient at the out-patient and during hospital stay as calculated from the patient's perspective eg cost of medications, physician and nurses services and other paramedical services, bed cost, and the laboratory investigations.</p><p><bold>Direct non-medical costs</bold> included the cost of travelling to the hospital for the patient and the family, cost of food to the family and patient during hospitalization and other incidental cost to the family attributed to the illness.</p><p><bold>Indirect costs</bold> were measured by the lost wages for employed parents or guardians attending to the participant.</p><p>The median differences in costs and the predictors of total cost were analyzed as cost data was not normally distributed. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the two treatment strategies was also assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size estimates were based to detect equivalence and on the hypothesis that children who were treated with oral amoxicillin at home would experience a failure rate of 15&#x000a0;%, and, would be within 5&#x000a0;% of those treated for first 48&#x000a0;h in hospital. The estimated sample size was 1,234 i.e. 617 per group. The sample size was calculated for the clinical trial but provided 90&#x000a0;% power for a two-tailed alternative hypothesis to calculate a mean difference in costs between the two interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups were compared using chi-square tests for categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous variables. We conducted the analysis using both intention to treat (analyzed as randomized) and per protocol analysis (included all clinical causes of treatment failure, but excluded treatment failure due to lost to follow up, LAMA, and voluntary withdrawal from the study). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative hazards (RH) of treatment failure in the two groups up to 14&#x000a0;days and to explore associations between the same baseline explanatory covariates (age, feeding status, immunization, antibiotics prior to 48&#x000a0;h, weight for age Z scores, body temperature, respiratory rates, oxygen saturation, auscultatory wheeze, crackles, radiological infiltrates, number of rooms in the house and type of fuel used for cooking) and outcome. We used forward step wise method and identified explanatory candidate variables (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.1) for inclusion in adjusted models as plausible predictors of treatment failure. The Kaplan-Meier curves for the cumulative probability of treatment success were also plotted for the two groups and the overall difference in their rates of treatment success was examined using the log-rank test. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 10 data analysis software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Economic analysis</title><p>The medians of the direct medical, direct non-medical and indirect costs and their inter-quartile ranges were calculated. Group differences in median costs of the treatment strategies were assessed using the median test. Univariate analysis was conducted for the predictors of cost variation, such as data on patient demographic characteristics, clinical history, length of stay and other utilization of resources for treatment of this episode of pneumonia before entry of patients into the trial. Multivariable regression analysis (OLS, with log transformation) was also used to predict total costs across the cost categories using pre-randomization variables, the alternate treatment strategies and other covariates that relate to resource consumption. Differences were considered statistically significant if they had a two-tailed<italic> p</italic> value less than 0.05. The hypothesis, that home treatment is more cost-effective than hospital treatment, was also tested by comparing the cost-effectiveness ratios. The incremental cost-effectiveness was estimated as the difference in the predicted total costs in the numerator and the difference in effects i.e. the number of patients cured (1-treatment failure) or the number of cases of treatment failure avoided in the denominator.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Results</title><p>The study was conducted from October 2008 to March 2011.

Although the rates of clinical deterioration were similar over the 14&#x000a0;day follow up, the treatment failure rate was more in the hospital group (18.1&#x000a0;% vs 10.8&#x000a0;%), due to higher rates of LAMA/voluntary withdrawal (5.3&#x000a0;% in hospital group vs 0.5&#x000a0;% in home group), one of the criteria for the composite outcome &#x0201c;treatment failure&#x0201d;.

Secondly, children who are hospitalized are closely monitored by skilled research staff for presence of signs of clinical deterioration and are also likely to experience a change in antibiotic (also a criterion for treatment failure) by a treating physician.

The high rate of LAMA in the hospital group (5.1&#x000a0;%) demonstrates that hospitalization is a barrier to children receiving a full course of treatment and perhaps the caregivers prefer to have their children who otherwise do not have co-morbid conditions such as those listed out in the Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, treated at home.</p><p>The baseline characteristics predictive of treatment failure were known risk factors such as younger age 3&#x02013;11 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], those who received antibiotics less than 48&#x000a0;h prior to enrollment (perhaps clinically sicker children) and use of solid fuels for household cooking, a known risk factor for poor treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Also, all other sites had lower failure rates than Chandigarh. This was mostly because of persistence of LCI at 48&#x000a0;h contributed mostly by children of hyperreactive airway disease. National Family Health Survey 2005&#x02013;06 has reported the northern states to have higher prevalence and symptoms of acute respiratory infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Chandigarh is in the northern states of India and has colder winters than the remaining sites and reports higher incidence of hyperreactive airway disease. Also, Chandigarh site was a referral tertiary care hospital with larger patient load.</p><p>A recent systematic review has reported results of 4 trials, (2 multi-centric hospital based studies and 2 community based cluster trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. They reported non inferiority of Oral amoxicillin administered either in hospital or community for treatment of severe pneumonia as compared to standard treatment by injectable penicillin. The two community based cluster trials compared oral amoxicillin administered at home by community health workers to administration of cotrimoxazole in the community followed by standard of care of receiving parenteral therapy at hospital. The hospital based studies compared the use of oral amoxicillin for management of WHO defined severe pneumonia to either injectable penicillin or ampicillin for 48&#x000a0;h. None of these studies compared the use of oral amoxicillin administered for the first 48&#x000a0;h under hospital supervision to ambulatory management at home with oral amoxicillin. This is the only study that not only reports the overall response of severe pneumonia to oral amoxicillin whether administered at home or hospital but also provides the cost effectiveness of the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Is oral Amoxicillin cost effective?</title><p>The total cost of treating severe pneumonia in hospital for the first 48&#x000a0;h was significantly more than being treated at home. There were no significant differences between the two groups in costs of outpatient visits, but significantly higher costs were observed in the hospital group for the costs of hospitalization and for non-medical costs, which includes expenditure of the caregiver on travel or meal costs when taking care of the child. This was despite the fact that cost of hospitalization was perhaps an underestimate of the true costs as only variable costs were measured, and, because the costs of treatment and hospitalization are subsidized at Indian government hospitals. These results thus suggest that it will be cost efficient to manage children with WHO defined severe pneumonia at home with oral amoxicillin.</p><p>This is an important finding because WHO has recommended that children with severe pneumonia must be hospitalised which increases the cost of treatment due to daily bed charge, cost of services of medical personnel, cost of medications, monitoring, lost wages, cost of food for caretakers etc. If the treatment at home for a subgroup of severe pneumonia patients without high risk features, is as effective as treating in the hospital then it will be cost effective to recommend treatment guidelines for management of severe pneumonia at home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Can these results be generalized?</title><p>Exclusion of children with additional risk factors such as measles, severe malnutrition, and those with radiological consolidation could apparently limit the external validity of the results. However, these were uncommon reasons for exclusion as most seriously ill children with presence of danger signs would be immediately admitted to hospital and would not undergo the screening process. Of the 6634 patients of severe pneumonia that presented to the 6 tertiary care hospitals, only 16.9&#x000a0;% were eligible to participate to receive oral amoxicillin. The most common reason for exclusion in this study at screening was refusal of consent to participate if the child were to be randomized to hospital group. This trend was also observed after the randomization to hospital group when a large number of children left against medical advice and were declared treatment failure by definition despite no clinical deterioration. The other reasons for exclusion were wheeze or lower chest indrawing responding to nebulization (11&#x000a0;%) or having received an antibiotic for longer than 48&#x000a0;h (4.7&#x000a0;%). Thus, since children with co-morbid conditions were not included in the trial these results are largely generalizable to patients with severe pneumonia who don&#x02019;t have co-morbidities or danger signs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>Excluding patients with consolidation could also exclude those with bacterial pneumonia, while those children with fever, wheeze and infiltrates are more likely to be of nonbacterial causes or viral pneumonias.</p><p>Children with allergic bronchitis, asthma, bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia can also manifest with clinical signs of WHO defined severe pneumonia of cough with LCI. Excluding children whose LCI disappeared after nebulization with bronchodilators or those with a past history of wheeze or bronchodilators administration ensured that we minimize inclusion of children with allergic bronchitis or asthma. In developing countries, mixed viral and bacterial infections are not uncommon, and hence need to be treated with antibiotics. However, admitting these children as severe pneumonia will be an additional cost for the Government and for the patient&#x02019;s family.</p><p>The limitation in recording the cost data was that it was based partially on recall and partially on documents. It was also difficult to collect the cost data from patients who left against medical advice and those who had treatment failure. The sample size calculation was based on the clinical outcomes and not for the economic analysis. This may have influenced the validity of the cost effectiveness analysis.</p><p>Lastly, multiplicity of end points or a composite of end points of treatment failure that includes many conditions such as clinical deterioration, hospitalization, development of co-morbid conditions, changing antibiotics etc. do provide statistical efficiency but at the risk of difficulties with interpretation. Similarly, including treatment failures due to leaving against medical advice, lost to follow up or voluntary withdrawal can overestimate treatment failures and may not indicate true clinical deterioration, again causing difficulties with interpretation. Therefore, we analyzed treatment failure on intention to treat as well as per protocol basis.</p><p>Finally, this is the only trial that has evaluated the cost effectiveness and efficacy of oral amoxicillin administered at the hospital for first 48&#x000a0;h as compared to home administered oral amoxicillin to complete a course of 7&#x000a0;day treatment of WHO defined severe pneumonia in children at tertiary care hospitals as it not only reports the overall response of severe pneumonia to oral amoxicillin whether administered at home or hospital but also provides the costs of treatment and the differences in cost in the hospitalized and home group. This is an important strength of the study and will help greatly to guide policy for the case management of severe pneumonia in the developing countries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study results suggest that in selected children aged 3&#x02013;59 months with chest indrawing pneumonia and without any of the study exclusion criteria, home based treatment of with oral amoxicillin is equivalent to 48&#x000a0;h of hospital administered oral amoxicillin followed by home based treatment. However, the results of this study should be generalized with due consideration of the fact that the selected participants had a limited spectrum of presentation which may not be true in the real life scenario.</p><p>This study also concludes that cost of treatment of severe pneumonia with oral amoxicillin in the hospital for initial 48&#x000a0;h followed by continuing it at home for 5&#x000a0;days is significantly more than the cost of treatment with oral amoxicillin at home for 7&#x000a0;days.</p><p>Hence, consistent with the recent WHO simplified guidelines, it will be cost effective to manage select stable children with only fast breathing and chest-indrawing or WHO defined chest indrawing pneumonia at home with oral amoxicillin.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12887_2015_510_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
