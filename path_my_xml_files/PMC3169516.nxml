The likelihood of success of MDA depends on the intensity and seasonality of malaria transmission, the efficacy of the intervention in rapidly clearing all malaria parasite stages and the degree to which symptomatic and asymptomatic parasite carriers participate in the intervention. The impact of MDA with the gametocytocidal drug combination sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus artesunate (AS) plus primaquine (PQ, single dose 0.75 mg/kg) on malaria transmission was determined in an area of very low and seasonal malaria transmission in northern Tanzania.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a cluster-randomized trial in four villages in Lower Moshi, Tanzania, eight clusters (1,110 individuals; cluster size 47- 209) were randomized to observed treatment with SP+AS+PQ and eight clusters (2,347 individuals, cluster size 55- 737) to treatment with placebo over three days. Intervention and control clusters were 1km apart; households that were located between clusters were treated as buffer zones where all individuals received SP+AS+PQ but were not selected for the evaluation. Passive case detection was done for the entire cohort and active case detection in 149 children aged 1-10 year from the intervention arm and 143 from the control arm. Four cross-sectional surveys assessed parasite carriage by microscopy and molecular methods during a five-month follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The coverage rate in the intervention arm was 93.0% (1,117/1,201). Parasite prevalence by molecular detection methods was 2.2-2.7% prior to the intervention and undetectable during follow-up in both the control and intervention clusters. None of the slides collected during cross-sectional surveys had microscopically detectable parasite densities. Three clinical malaria episodes occurred in the intervention (n = 1) and control clusters (n = 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study illustrates the possibility to achieve high coverage with a three-day intervention but also the difficulty in defining suitable outcome measures to evaluate interventions in areas of very low malaria transmission intensity. The decline in transmission intensity prior to the intervention made it impossible to assess the impact of MDA in the chosen study setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00509015">NCT00509015</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Recent reports on a reduction of malaria transmission in several parts of sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have resulted in optimism about the possibility to eliminate malaria in some malaria endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Significant reductions in the number of clinical malaria cases were attributed to the wide-scale implementation of vector control measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], high coverage of insecticide-treated bed nets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the introduction of effective artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. ACT has excellent cure rates in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and has an additional advantage of reducing malaria transmission in comparison to previous first-line treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, even at very low levels of transmission intensity, the employment of ACT in the first-line treatment of malaria may not result in the elimination of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This is because the impact of treatment on transmission intensity is greatly influenced by the proportion of parasite carriers that carry the infection asymptomatically and that are therefore unlikely to seek anti-malarial treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Asymptomatic parasite carriers form an important source of infection to mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and frequently harbour parasites at densities below the microscopic detection limit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Sub-microscopic parasite carriage may be most relevant for malaria transmission in areas of low endemicity, where the relative proportion of parasite carriers that are missed by microscopy is greatest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These low-density infections should therefore be included in interventions that aim to target the human infectious reservoir.</p><p>There are two possible approaches to include asymptomatic carriers in treatment campaigns: i) mass-screening and treatment of all parasite carriers (MSAT) and ii) mass treatment without prior screening for parasitaemia, i.e. mass drug administration (MDA). Large-scale and rapid detection of sub-microscopic parasite densities under field conditions is currently complicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] primarily due to the sensitivity and turn-around time of the tests available. An MDA approach may, therefore, be the most straightforward method. Several MDA interventions were undertaken in the late 1950's when the World Health Organization recommended MDA as a tool for malaria control when other methods had failed (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). Despite successes of MDA in isolated areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], positive but not always well-documented experiences from China (described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]) and a report from Cambodia suggesting that ACT treatment campaigns contributed towards a large reduction in transmission intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], no MDA programme has succeeded in eliminating malaria or leading to a sustainable reduction in the burden of malaria in areas in sub Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Despite these sobering results in the past, there is currently a renewed interest in MDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] because of the previous successes in malaria control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; highly efficacious anti-malarial drugs with a transmission reducing potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and new insights in the nature of malaria transmission using sensitive parasite detection methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Mathematical modelling has shown that malaria transmission is, in theory, susceptible to mass treatment programmes if all subjects within an endemic community could be given anti-malarials that clear parasitaemia during a period of absent or very low vector densities in areas where the intensity of transmission is already low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The current manuscript reports on a cluster-randomized trial of MDA with a gametocytocidal drug combination of an ACT combined with primaquine in an area of very low transmission intensity in Tanzania.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study area and participants</title><p>This study was conducted in the area of Lower Moshi (latitude 3&#x000b0;61'-3&#x000b0;68'S; longitude 37&#x000b0;32'-37&#x000b0;38'E), northern Tanzania. The area of Lower Moshi lies on an altitude of ~700 meter between the Maasai savannah and foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro. In 2005, malaria transmission was hypoendemic with an estimated entomologic inoculation rate of 3.4 (95% CI 0.7-9.9) infectious bites per person per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Mosquitoes are practically absent in the period January-March and more prevalent in March-May and October-November following seasonal rains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Four villages were included in the current study: Kiruani, Majengo, Magadini and Korongo. The total population was 5,094 inhabitants, as determined by a census several weeks before the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Consenting procedure and ethical issues</title><p>Consent was obtained at three levels. Firstly, village meetings were organized 4-5 months prior to the intervention. During these meetings the study was explained to all village leaders and local ten-cell leaders (representatives of approximately 10 households, <italic>balozi's</italic>) and verbal approval was obtained from these local leaders. The necessity to allow individual households and household members to decide on participation was also explained in order to minimize the binding influence of local authorities. Secondly, verbal household consent was obtained 2-3 months before the intervention during a final census visit in which each household was visited, members were enumerated and their name, gender and age recorded. During this census visit the purpose of the study, its procedures and the practical consequences of participation were explained in detail to all adult household members. Participant information sheets were provided to each head of household and the same information was posted at central places in the village on poster format. Thirdly, individual consent was obtained on the day of the intervention. Prior to drug administration, written consent was obtained from all literate adults, literate household members were asked to sign for consenting illiterate adults. Parents or guardians were asked to consent for children (aged 1-18 years); written consent was also asked for children aged &#x02265; 10 years. Ethical approval was given by the ethical board of the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol. IX/491) and the Tanzanian Food and Drug Authority (CE.57/180/01/8).</p></sec><sec><title>Cluster definition and randomisation</title><p>All households and structures in the study area were geo-located using a hand-held global positioning system unit (Trimble GeoExplorer III, California, US).

Where possible, clusters were based on geographically confined groups of households. There was no minimum or maximum population size of clusters but the minimum distance between clusters was set at 1 km, based on the average dispersal range of anophelines in densely populated African settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

Three health facilities in the study area were involved in passive case detection. Each household was provided with a household identification card that contained the names of household members, information on their sub-village, village leader and household number that allowed geo-locating the households. With this household identification card, all household members were entitled free access to treatment at the health facilities. Upon arrival at the health facility, household number, name, age and gender were recorded by the responsible medical doctor or clinical officer. Temperature was measured and a slide and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) prepared. Diagnosis was based on the RDT result and parasitaemic individuals with (history of) fever were treated with artemether-lumefantrine according to national guidelines. For active case detection, 150 children (aged 1-10 years) from intervention clusters and 150 children (aged 1-10 years) from placebo clusters were randomly selected to be followed-up for six months. Caretakers of these children were provided with a simple symptom diary and asked to record the daily occurrence of fever, headache and body pains. Every fourteen days a trained fieldworker visited the child, examined their symptom diary and measured their temperature. In case of (history of) fever, an RDT was used to determine the presence of parasites.

Diagnosis was based on the RDT; those positive by RDT with (a history of) fever were treated with artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Novartis, France) according to national guidelines.</p><p>Slides were Giemsa-stained and read by two independent microscopists, each examining 100 high power fields before declaring a slide negative.

RNA samples were tested by quantitative nucleic acid sequence based amplification (QT-NASBA) on a NucliSens EasyQ analyzer (bioM&#x000e9;rieux, Boxtel, the Netherland) for 18S rRNA parasite detection as described elsewhere with a sensitivity of ~20 parasites/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]; 18S rRNA is present in all asexual parasites and gametocytes. The time to positivity, i.e., the time point during amplification at which the number of target amplicons detected exceeded the mean for three negative controls plus 20 standard deviations, was calculated. Those positive in the 18S QT-NASBA, were scheduled for testing in the gametocyte specific Pfs25 QT-NASBA, that has a detection limit of 20-100 gametocytes/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. For an initial analysis, 150 samples were randomly selected from the pre-intervention survey (75 intervention and 75 control arm) and 100 samples per follow-up cross sectional survey (50 intervention and 50 control arm).</p></sec><sec><title>Transmission intensity by entomological inoculation rate</title><p>Mosquitoes were collected in the period October 2007 - July 2008 in the sub-villages Korongo, Magadini and Kiruani. Ten households were selected from each sub-village, 5 from the intervention and 5 from the control clusters for each village. Households were selected to be representative of the typical housing structures in the villages, mud wall and corrugated iron roof. Mosquitoes were caught with a standard Centre for Disease Control light traps (CDC, Atlanta, USA). Traps were hung at the end of an occupied bed with a bed net that was newly provided by the investigators. Traps were set for 12 hours, from 7 pm to 7 am [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].

A pilot study indicated that parasites were cleared completely within 14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and it was assumed that MDA would reduce parasite carriage in the intervention clusters to below 10%. Including 50 individuals per cluster in the post-intervention cross-sectional surveys and assuming a conservative estimate of k (0.5 coefficient of variation of true proportions between clusters within each group), 8 clusters per intervention arm were needed (Z<sub>&#x003b1;/2 </sub>= 1.96; Z<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>= 0.84). To be able to detect temporal variation in efficacy, the study aimed to collect 50 observations per cluster in the early transmission season (April-May) and 50 in the late transmission season (June-July). The number of children included in active case detection was based on an expected malaria incidence of 0.5 malaria episode/child/year in the control arm and a tenfold lower incidence in the intervention arm. Enrolling 150 children per treatment arm for six months would result in 900 person-months per arm, giving 80% power to detect the specified outcomes after, adjusting for correlation between observations from the same cluster.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Parasite prevalence by microscopy and molecular methods was compared between study arms using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to account for correlations between observations from the same cluster and the same survey.

Only one mosquito from a control cluster in Kiruani (May) was found to be infected with sporozoites (0.004%, 1/24,528), resulting in an estimated EIR for the study area of 0.63 infectious bites per person per year.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The current manuscript describes the first MDA study on the African continent since 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A coverage of 94% with at least one dose of anti-malarials was achieved; 93% with the full per protocol dose of three drugs given over three days. Despite this high participation rate, no impact of MDA on malaria transmission was observed. Parasite prevalence rates before and after the intervention, by microscopy and PCR, were too low to allow conclusions on the impact of the intervention.</p><p>The success of MDA depends on its capacity to reduce the prevalence of pathogens below a critical threshold level where re-emergence is unlikely and control can be maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. For malaria, this threshold prevalence is very low; the basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>), the number of secondary episodes arising from a single infectious human case in a fully susceptible population, can be well over 100 if malaria vectors are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The chance of achieving this threshold is highest when parasites are cleared from the human population towards the end of the dry season when very few mosquitoes are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The MDA intervention was completed three weeks before the increase in mosquito numbers following the seasonal rains and used a gametocytocidal drug combination of SP+AS+PQ that clears gametocytes in an average of 6.3 days; significantly quicker than after ACTs alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Despite the demanding three-day dosing scheme and logistical challenges to exclude pregnant women from treatment with AS and PQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], our coverage was high compared to that of previous malaria MDAs. Of the total population living in intervention clusters, 94% received at least one dose and 93% received a complete dose of efficacious anti-malarial drugs in the month preceding the start of the transmission season or immediately upon arrival in the area. In The Gambia in 1999, a coverage rate of 73% was achieved after one and of 88% after two rounds of drug administration. The drug combination given was SP plus a single dose of AS, given on a single day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Coverage of other reported MDA campaigns in Uganda (50%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], Nicaragua (70%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and Garki, Nigeria (85%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] were lower than that in the current setting. The successful malaria eradication campaign on Aneityum, Vanuatu, used 9 rounds of MDA in a population of 718 individuals with participation rates of 79-92% for each round [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The maximum number of tablets that had to be taken by adults on Aneityum was 13 on a single day, compared to 7 per day on the first two days and 10 on the third day in the current study. Although this indicates that a complicated dosing scheme and high tablet number do not preclude high participation rates, the number of tablets was mentioned as burdensome by some participants (Shekalaghe, unpublished data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>The intervention strategy that involved local village leaders and village representatives as part of the intervention teams is likely to have contributed to the high level of community participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The stepwise consent procedure and repeated village meetings gave inhabitants of the study area sufficient time to consider participation and opportunities to raise questions. A study on community perceptions of MDA in The Gambia concluded that knowledge about malaria was related to a higher individual participation rate and that people who had discussed the study with other villagers and those who understood the necessity for a high participation rate for MDA to work were also more likely to participate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. During community meetings the necessity for asymptomatic individuals to participate in order to achieve community benefits was strongly emphasized, although no attempt was made to quantify community understanding. The approach to give local leaders a central role in explaining the study purposes, drug administration and monitoring migration will also have influenced the response rate. Several opinion makers in The Gambia were antagonistic to the intervention and reduced participation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]; the current study received full participation of all 62 <italic>balozi's </italic>in the study area.</p><p>Despite its high coverage, no impact of MDA on the transmission in the area was observed. The study area was selected for its very low transmission intensity and marked seasonality with almost complete absence of vectors for several months per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The site selection and trial design were based on the assumption of a sub-microscopic parasite carriage of &#x02265; 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], that would maintain malaria transmission in the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and would form a suitable primary outcome measure for the intervention. Contrary to these expectations, malaria had all but disappeared from the area prior to the MDA intervention during which no major additional malaria specific control efforts were undertaken. Considerable reductions in transmission intensity without evident underlying causes have been reported across northern Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Reported use of insecticide treated net (ITN) in this period increased from 25.1% (490/1952) in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] to 36.1% (879/2434) in 2007. If these numbers reflected a change in effective ITN use, this could have resulted in a substantial reduction in parasite prevalence in the study area of low endemicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] although coverage remains too low to explain an almost complete elimination of malaria in the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Presumptive treatment with ACT could also have contributed to the decline in transmission intensity. Although treatment prescribing behaviour in the area was not quantified, presumptive treatment with artemether-lumefantrine, introduced as first-line treatment in 2007, was common practice and will have provided parasitaemic and non-parasitaemic individuals with a curative dose and effective prophylaxis for several weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Rainfall was unreliable in the period preceding the MDA intervention; being 34% of the preceding 10-year average in 2004, 35% in 2005, 116% in 2006 and 66% in 2007. A single treatment campaign for trachoma with azithromycin was undertaken by a non-governmental organisation with an unknown coverage level. Azithromycin has some anti-malarial activity at doses given for trachoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. These components may all have contributed to the fall in transmission intensity observed. The findings from this study also illustrate the limited understanding on the importance of sub-microscopic parasite densities for maintaining stable malaria transmission. In 2005, a large-scale survey was conducted in the study area and detected <italic>P. falciparum </italic>in 32.5% of the general population by PCR compared to 1.9% by microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The large proportion of sub-microscopic parasite carriers is typical for areas of low endemicity; in areas where the microscopic parasite prevalence is below 10%, microscopy on average detects just under a quarter of all parasite carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although low-density infections can be highly efficient in eliciting protective immunity in experimental infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], their dynamics are poorly understood in endemic settings. Harris and colleagues observed that in a low endemic area on the Solomon islands, parasites were carried at microscopically detectable densities by 2.2% of the population of whom &#x0003e; 85% were afebrile. The majority of parasite carriers in all age groups had parasites at densities below 500 parasites/&#x003bc;L and parasite prevalence increased almost four-fold when PCR was used for detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Low parasitaemia and frequent asymptomatic parasite carriage was also reported for an area of very low endemicity in Vanuatu where parasite prevalence by microscopy was 2-3% and &#x0003e; 80% of the parasite carriers harboured parasites asymptomatically and at a densities below 500 parasites/&#x003bc;L or below the microscopic threshold for detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. It is currently unknown how individuals with limited cumulative exposure to malaria manage to control malaria at low parasite densities or how long sub-microscopic infections persist. The average duration of malaria infections has been estimated at 210 days in area of intense malaria transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] where most infections are microscopically detectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The duration and gametocytaemic period of sub-microscopic infections, that dominate in low endemic areas, are currently unknown. These factors are crucial in determining the relative contribution of sub-microscopic infections, that are sufficient to infect mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], to malaria transmission in a population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This manuscript reports on the first MDA study in Africa in more than a decade and achieved an unsurpassed participation rate. Malaria transmission had practically vanished prior to the intervention, with no microscopic parasite carriers in ~2,400 slides and &#x0003c; 2% parasite carriage in the subset of samples that were tested for <italic>P. falciparum </italic>by QT-NASBA. Molecular parasite detection methods form a sensitive alternative to microscopy in low endemic settings but some important epidemiological and clinical aspects of sub-microscopic parasite carriage are currently poorly understood and need elucidation. The current study indicates that it is complicated to determine the impact of MDA on malaria transmission as stand-alone intervention; this requires a study area of very low and seasonal yet stable malaria transmission intensity. Future studies that aim to determine the impact of MDA in Africa will need to select areas with a higher pre-intervention level of malaria transmission intensity than the site in northern Tanzania where this study was conducted. Considering the current uncertainties about the stability and longevity of sub-microscopic parasite carriage, it may be advisable to base power calculations for these future MDA studies on microscopic parasite carriage in the population.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SAS contributed to data acquisition, data analysis interpretation, and to the preparation of the manuscript.
