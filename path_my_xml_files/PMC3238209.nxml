Risk of coronary heart disease is fourfold (in men) to eightfold (in women)more excessive in patients with TIDM as compared with that for the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Microvascular disease affects the tissues resulting in ischaemia. This microvascular disease is both structural (thickened basement membrane, capillary wall fragility and thrombosis) and functional (vasomotor neuropathy with defective microcirculation and abnormal endothelial function. Ischaemia also results from macrovascular disease (atherosclerosis) brought about by the direct metabolic injury, changes in vascular reactivity and accumulating endothelial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Development of atherosclerotic lesions in healthy subjects begins upon childhood. In children with type 1 diabetes who had died an unnatural death, an asymptomatic increase in the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>It has been demonstrated that high levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, VLDL, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), microalbuminuria, hypertension, low concentration of HDL and increased body mass index (BMI) are significantly associated with coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>This study was designed primarily to evaluate the impact of six months exercise program on glycemic control, plasma lipids values, blood pressure, frequency of hypoglycemia, anthropometric measurements and insulin requirements in a sample of adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This prospective randomized control study was conducted at Diabetes Specialized Clinic Children's Hospital, Ain Shams University from February 2009 to November 2009. A total of 196 patients (75 males, 121 females) were recruited for this study. The patients were regular attendees at the Clinic which cares for more than 1500 children, adolescents, and young adults with T1DM. To be eligible for the study patients had to satisfy the following criteria: 12-18 years old, diabetic with T1DM for at least 3 years and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &#x02265;7.5 (%)for the last six months before participating in the study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included: significant diabetic complications limiting exercise like (diabetic foot, retinopathy, severe neuropathy), uncontrolled hypertension, diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA), severe hypoglycemia within the past 3 months, patients on lipid lowering therapy.</p><p>Patients' mean age was 14.78 &#x000b1; 2.31 years, their disease duration ranged between 3 years and 10 years with a mean of 4.6 &#x000b1; 1.9 years. Patients included used human insulin in a dose ranging from 0.65 to 2.1 IU/Kg/day with a mean of 1.19 &#x000b1; 0.36 IU/Kg/day. All participants were on intensive insulin therapy.</p><p>Eligible patients were simply randomly assigned into two exercise intervention groups or in one control group as follows: Group (A) the control group, consisted of 48 patients that did not join the exercise program, group (B) consisted of 75 patients that attended the exercise sessions once/week and group (C) consisted of 73 patients that attended the exercise sessions three times/week. The attending diabetologist who randomly grouped the patients were different from those conducting the study. Of the 194 participants who were evaluated and joined the exercise program, only 148 patients completed the intervention arm of the study. Subjects participated after written information and informed consent from their parents. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ain Shams University before commencement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All subjects underwent the following:</p><sec><title>Detailed Questionnaire that included</title><p>Complete history taking including their ages, duration of diabetes, complications, insulin regimen, history of acute diabetic complications (hypoglycemic attacks, hyperglycemia and DKA, history of exercise(type, frequency, duration).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical assessment that included</title><p>Physical examination included: anthropometric measures; weight in kilograms (kg), height in centimetres (cm) were plotted against percentiles for age and sex according to Growth Charts. The body mass index (BMI) was first calculated as weight in kgs. divided by square of height in meters, then body mass index standard deviation score (BMI SDS) was calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Waist circumference (WC) in cm was measured at the part of the trunk located midway between the lower costal margin and the iliac crest while the patient was standing. Additionally, blood presure (systolic &#x00026; diastolic) in millimeters mercury (mmHg) was measured and recorded using an automatic sphygmomanometer in three different occassions after they were seated and allowed to rest for 15 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical investigations</title><p>All patients were asked not to exercise for three days before sample taking and lipid profile was taken after an over night fasting (12 hours). About 5 ml of venous blood was withdrawn from a prominent superficial vein using a clean venepuncture with minimal stasis, taken in a tube with EDTA, centrifuged and frozen. High density lipoproteins (HDL-c) were measured by precipitation method. Triglycerides (TG) were measured by enzymatic-calorimetric method. Cholesterol was measured by enzymatic-end point method. Low density lipoproteins (LDL-c) were measured by calculation methods i.e. Friedwaled equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] as follows:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1758-5996-2-47-i1.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>Dyslipidemia was defined as cholesterol &#x0003e;200 mg/dl, HDL-c &#x0003c;35 mg/dl, LDL-c &#x0003e;160 mg/dl, or triglycerides &#x0003e;150 mg/dl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The remaining part of sample was used to measure glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using the quantitative calorimetric determination of glyco- haemoglobin in whole blood, Stambio glycohaemoglobin procedure number 0350. Patients were asked to measure mean random blood glucose (MRBG) using Accu-Chek meter and reactive strips containing glucose dyeoxidase-reductase (Roch Diagnostics, Inc., Indianapolos) before and 6, 12 and18 hrs after they had excersised and to keep a detailed record in a diary for their previously mentioned blood glucose measurements. Baseline assessment of lipid profile, HbA1c measures and clinical parameters were performed before patients were randomized and occurred 1 to 14 days before classes started and were re-evaluated 6 months later after the exercise program.</p></sec><sec><title>The exercise program</title><sec><title>Groups B and C attended this program for 6 months that consisted of</title><p>A)An exercise training program according to Hornsby &#x00026; Albright [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] under supervision of our physiatrist who directed the exercise intervention arm of the study. It consisted of: 1) Aerobic exercises either cycling/treadmill. The session consisted of five minutes warming up period followed by twenty minutes of training period followed by five minutes of cooling down period. During exercise the heart rate was monitored to ensure maximal safe exercise limit. To adjust the workload target heart rate range(THRR) was used 'THRR = 220-age in years &#x000d7;(65-85%). If the heart rate of the patient exceeded the upper limit of THRR, then exercise intensity was slowed down but if it was less than the lower limit of THRR then exercise intensity was increased. The intensity of the exercise period was gradually increased according to THRR as the patients became conditioned during training.</p><p>2) Anaerobic exercises was performed on the treadmill which was achieved by interval training with intense short duration activity of 1-2 minutes with THRR reaching 85-95% of maximal heart rate. 3) Leg extension &#x00026; leg curl exercises were done using weight machines, the goal was to increase number of repetitions and improve performance. Progressive resistive exercises (PRE) (DeLorme technique)was used. The 10 repetition maximum (RM) was first determined for each patient. 10RM was assessed for bilateral leg extension and leg press using weight machines. The weight machines were adjusted to meet the requirements of each subject. The 10 RM refers to the greatest amount of weight that could be lifted or pushed 10 times, the patient then performed one set of 10 repetitions at 50% of the 10 RM, a second set of 10 repetitions at 75% of the 10 RM, and final set of 10 repetitions at the full 10 RM. All three sets were performed at each session for about 10 minutes with a brief rest period (of 2 minutes) in between sets. Every week, a new 10 RM was determined as strength increased. 4)Different free strength and endurance exercises(done for 10 minutes), were performed as well in the session to help strengthen the foot and leg muscles. Exercises included bent calf knee raises, standing calf lifts and toe curls. Exercises were repeated 10 times (one set) and number of sets increased gradually through the program by one set every other session.</p><p>5) Flexibility exercises (for 5 minutes) were included which was achieved by stretching, the goal was to maintain and increase range of motion (ROM) and improve gait.</p><p>6) Neuromuscular exercises was done (for 5 minutes) by co-ordination exercises which were used to improve balance &#x00026; co-ordination. The patients performed repetitions of heel to chin movements (10 repetitions) and heel to toe walking as well as walking sideways with crossing over feet, the patients did the different walks for five minutes each.</p><p>B) Balance exercise regimen which was performed according to Richardson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] on a firm surface for 10 minutes. They included warm up (ankle ROM with writing alphabet in the air with each foot), neck flexion, rotation and stretching while seated with eyes open then closed, foot inversion and eversion and bipedal wall slides with maximum knee flexion at 45&#x000cb;&#x00161;. They started with one set of 10 repetitions and increased gradually to 3 sets after 6 sessions. Strengthening to upper body using abdominal crunch exercises and back lifts with extended arms and using overweight pulley were also preformed. Patients were given a booklet illustrating the exercises needed to help with their independent practice. In the control group, patients were instructed not to undertake any formal exercise or change their physical activity level during the study period.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis were performed using the SPSS 10th version of Windows (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and range of numerical data. Frequency and percentage of non-numerical data, paired sample Student's t test was used to test the difference between pre and post of some parameters (for continuous variables). Independent sample Student's t test was used to test the difference between two groups (for continuous variables). Chi square test was used to compare between groups regarding non numerical variables. Correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient r) assessing strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. One way ANOVA test (F) was used to test difference between more than two means. The probability was considered to be statistically significant at P value &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One hundred and forty eight patients (76.3%) adhered to the supervised exercise sessions.

Despite the well-known benefit of physical activity in improving known risk factors for atherosclerosis, unfortunately this modality was ignored by parents and patients who fear the consequence of hypoglycemia, which can occur during, immediately after, or many hours after physical activity, making it one of limiting factors for its practice in children and adolescents with type 1 DM.</p><p>The frequency of hypoglycemia experienced by the intervention group was the same in comparison to the control group. Our results might be influenced by the fact that the exercise in this study is a planned one and patients do not exert any unscheduled activity. This will give the chance for an educated patient the ability to learn about his individual glucose response to exercise and eventually establish an individual strategy to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Framework to guide management of achieving blood glucose goals without excessive hypoglycemia during and after exercise can be accomplished through individualized meal planning, flexible insulin regimens and algorithms, self monitoring blood glucose and education promoting decision-making based on documentation and review of previous results.</p><p>Some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] found that the frequency of exercise had no significant influence on the frequency of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia with occurrence of seizure or loss of consciousness.</p><p>In their study in 2006, <bold><italic>DirecNet group </italic></bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] found that in youth with T1DM, prolonged moderate aerobic exercise results in a consistent reduction in plasma glucose and the frequent occurrence of hypoglycemia when pre-exercise glucose concentrations are &#x0003c;120 mg/dl. Moreover, treatment with 15 g of oral glucose is often insufficient to reliably treat hypoglycemia during exercise in these youngsters.</p><p>Of particular significance is the result of reduction in insulin requirements after performing exercise. The authors speculated that patients tend to reduce their insulin dosage to prevent exercise induced hypoglycemia. Moreover, exercise acutely lowers the blood glucose concentration to an extent that depends on its intensity, duration and the concurrent level of insulinaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It also increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle, putting in mind that this effect is higher in trained muscle than in untrained muscle, leading to a reduction in the insulin requirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Our results are in agreement with that of <bold><italic>Herbest et al. </italic></bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] who confirmed that RPA is associated with a lower insulin dosage as a long-term effect.

However, <bold><italic>Allen et al</italic></bold>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] have shown that the better control of glycemia (lower HbA<sub>1c </sub>level) due to regular exercise is related to more frequent mild and severe hypoglycemia and hence decreasing HbA1c levels. The reduction in HbA1c level over time is clinically significant, as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reported a 21% to 49% decreased risk for microvascular complications with every 1% decrease in HbA1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between physical fitness and HbA1c levels has been previously studied; however, the results were controversial. <bold><italic>Herbst et al</italic></bold>.

Ramalho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] evaluated the effect of aerobic versus resistance training on metabolic control in type-1 diabetes patients. Thirteen non-active patients, ranging in age from 13-30 yrs, were submitted to a 12-week aerobic exercise (Group A, n = 7) or resistance training (Group B, n = 6) period. Durak et al.

However, our training program aimed to combine the different elements of an exercise regimen (aerobic, anaerobic, strengthening, neuromuscular and balance) and to address various aspects in type1 diabetes patient to help improve their physical function and quality of life. We aimed to improve blood glucose control and insulin sensitivity, reduce body fat, reduce stress, increase cardiovascular benefits aswell as increase muscle strength and endurance. Flexibility exercises and stretching was used to help prevent injury and maintain and or increase range of motion of joints. The neuromuscular and balance training part of our program with special emphasis on the lower limbs was unique and aimed to improve the coordination, balance and physical function of patients.</p><p>In conclusion our results implicated that exercise might greatly benefit many patients with diabetes by improving their metabolic profile, dyslipidemia, aiding in their weight loss and maintaining their blood pressure; these effects may translate into an improved vascular disease risk profile in adolescents with diabetes. The challenge is to develop strategies that allow individuals with T1DM to participate in activities that are consistent with their lifestyle and culture in a safe and enjoyable manner, and discouraging sedentary activities, especially time spent in front of the TV or computer monitor. Exercise should be an important component of self -care activity in the management of patients with T1DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: Body mass index; Cm: Centimeter; GLUT4: Glucose transporter protein; HbA1c: Glycosylated haemoglobin; HIE: High intensity exercise; Kg: Kilograms; NEFA: Non-esterified fatty acids; PRE: Progressive resistive exercises; RM: Repetition maximum; RPA: Regular physical activity; SDS: Standard deviation Score; T1DM: Type 1 diabetes mellitus; THRR: Target heart rate range; U/kg/d: Unit/kilogram/day; WC: Waist circumference</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MAS participated in the concept, design of the study, data analysis, manuscript editing and review.
