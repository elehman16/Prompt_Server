Little is known however about the extent to which indicators in common use are based on research. The objective of this study is to measure the extent to which clinical quality indicators used in asthma management in children with outcome measurements can be linked to results in randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) reports.

Indicators are regularly used to assess the quality of care, and to identify and prioritise areas for improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A good indicator should say &#x0201c;as much about a system as possible in as few points as possible&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It should thus be important, relevant, valid, reliable, meaningful and understandable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, indicators should be easy to collect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and the costs of doing so should not outweigh any benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For these requirements to be met, indicators should be supported by a strong base of research evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The most common approach to indicator development is based on their extraction from clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], with the guidelines themselves based upon randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, the development of indicators typically requires a lengthy manual process of searching for and analysis of the research evidence underpinning guidelines. A lack of uniformity in reporting the rationale for selecting indicators also means that it may be difficult to know whether an indicator is solidly based on research evidence. A lack of rigour in indicator selection can introduce biases that limit their usefulness in measuring the quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The development of methods that assists in connecting candidate indicators with the research evidence should help increase the efficiency of indicator development, and may also improve confidence in the quality of studies based on indicators. There are a number of steps in the process of assessing the evidence base behind any given indicator, starting with searching for and then linking indicators to RCTs, and ending with an assessment of the strength of the evidence for the use of the indicator in those RCTs. Clinical indicators are measures of clinical activity results, and outcome measures serve a similar role in RCT reports. In this study we report on a standardised and simple method to link indicators to outcomes reported in clinical trials, using publicly available clinical concept resources.</p><p id="Par13">As a case study to support the development of methods to improve the efficiency and accuracy of indicator development, we examine the relationship between national level clinical quality indicators for asthma management in pre-adolescent children in the UK and the USA and recent RCT reports. Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects about 300 million people globally, with an estimated 250,000 deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is the most common chronic disease among children. There is currently no cure, but it can generally be managed and controlled with appropriate care (care in-line with clinical guidelines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many indicators have been developed for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and most are based on clinical practice guidelines. For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) quality standards for asthma are based on the British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (BTS/SIGN) clinical guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Indicators for children may also apply to older populations but there may be changes in indicators as individuals move into adolescence and then adulthood. In adolescence, individuals typically assume responsibility for their asthma care and potentially begin experimenting with higher-risk behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As a result non-adherence, morbidity and mortality appear to be greater among adolescents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par14">For this study we used a four-stage protocol for extracting indicators and linking them to outcome measures in the research literature (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram for the identification, extraction, and linking of indicators to outcome measures in randomised controlled trials</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2017_2324_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Of these, 39 indicators were included (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2), with an inter-rater agreement of 0.895 (Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa). Some 22 indicators were excluded because they were not associated with asthma management (15), were not process or outcome indicators (4), were not developed for national-level assessment (2) or did not apply to children below 12&#x000a0;years of age (2).</p><p id="Par48">From year 2005&#x02013;2014, 1104 RCTs were retrieved and after screening, 562 were included (Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7625). Validation of outcome measure extraction using a set of 50 randomly selected RCTs saw strong agreement (Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.805).</p><p id="Par49">The 39 indicators were described using 43 unique indicator phrases, and these were associated with 251 UMLS concepts. A total of 462 unique outcome phrases were identified from the RCT reports and these were associated with 1611 UMLS concepts.</p><p id="Par50">For 30 of the 39 indicators (77%) all of their descriptive phrases could be fully mapped to outcome phrases. For 7 indicators (19%), at least some of their indicator phrases could be mapped to outcomes using MetaMap. Only two indicators (5%) could not be mapped to any RCT outcome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The 30 fully mapped indicators were linked to outcomes via 34 phrases (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). Thus, about 95% of indicators (37/39) could be linked to at least some clinical trial reports using outcome measures, with a mean of 29.7 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). As Metamap was always able to generate concepts for indicators and outcomes, mapping failures were due to mismatches between the concepts assigned to indicators and to outcomes.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Number of RCTs that could be linked to each indicator, in descending order of frequency.

Also, most outcome measures were never used as indicators, with only 34/462 (7%) of all outcome phrases linking to indicators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par52">The process of assessing the evidence base behind an indicator requires methods to identify the clinical trials that are likely to contain that evidence. Using a standardised protocol that matched terms and phrases for indicators and outcomes to concepts in the UMLS, we were able to successfully link the vast majority of indicators used to track the management of asthma in children to randomised controlled trials.</p><p id="Par53">Our approach relies on the recognition that indicators are measures and that in clinical trial reports, outcome measures serve the same purpose. The next stage in assessing indicators would require an evaluation of the performance of the outcome measures used in the trial reports, and the nature of the indicator relationship with outcomes e.g. positively or negatively correlated. Outcome measures that are commonly used, that are relatively inexpensive and do not require specialised methods, and that repeatedly are able to distinguish the performance of different management approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], are those that are likely to be favoured.</p><p id="Par54">While there is a concern that many indicators are not based on RCT evidence, the indicators used in this study came from NQMC and NICE and were typically linked with references to the research literature. As such, they provided a gold standard to assess the effectiveness of the methods described here, which mapped terms used to describe indicators and outcomes to UMLS concepts, and then matched the indicators and outcomes with each other by finding common UMLS concepts. Our study shows that at least in the case of asthma management in children, the method is able in most cases to independently link indicator terms to clinical trial outcome terms, supporting its use when there is uncertainty about the evidence behind an indicator.</p><p id="Par55">A strength of the protocol used here to link indicators to trials is that it lends itself to full automation. While the search for documents and extraction of text phrases was undertaken manually, both tasks readily lend themselves to automation using modern search and text processing computational methods. There is currently strong interest in automating many of the processes associated with systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and it is just as plausible to apply this approach to the process of indicator assessment.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par56">To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilise a method that matches indicators with research evidence in clinical trials. Its strength is the use of a simple and systematic approach to identify candidate indicators using publicly available search and concept mapping tools, and the typically strong inter-rater agreements at each stage of the process. The use of the UMLS Metathesaurus and MetaMap allows indicators and outcome measures to be mapped in a repeatable and standard way.</p><p id="Par57">We however only examined the link between indicators and RCT evidence, and other forms of evidence are likely to be used in the assessment of candidate indicators. Our method relies on the easy identification of outcome measures in trial reports, as these often use the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) structure in their abstract. Identification of outcome measures in other forms of evidence may thus need to depend on detailed screening of text in abstracts or full papers, which is likely to have higher error rates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par58">Most of the terms used in quality indicators for asthma management in children can be linked to clinical trials using a robust method involving public resources, and this is the first stage in assessing the quality of indicators. The process of indicator development is a strong candidate for the use of automation tools, which have the potential to increase the quality and speed of indicator development.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par66">
