Thus, its applicability can be limited, for example, in patients with claustrophobia or extreme obesity <xref rid="pone.0083427-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Corwin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Berg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In recent years, MR scanners with specific patient-centered designs have been developed. Two promising approaches are short-bore and horizontal open configurations. Modern MR scanners with these configurations have already shown a potential for reducing claustrophobia and allowing imaging of extremely obese patients <xref rid="pone.0083427-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Bangard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Spouse1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-deBucourt1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Enders1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Previous studies have also demonstrated improved patient acceptability of open-configuration MR scanners <xref rid="pone.0083427-Bangard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Heuck1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Michel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Besides patient preference, diagnostic performance and thus image quality is crucial for a comparison of different MR systems. An open scanner configuration might impair image quality due to a potentially larger inhomogeneity of a vertical magnetic field. Moreover, until recently, such systems operated at rather low field strengths <xref rid="pone.0083427-Michel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Vahlensieck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, there is no study directly comparing the image quality of horizontal and vertical magnetic field MR systems.</p><p>The objective of this analysis was thus to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the image quality of two high-field MR scanners, one with a short (1.5 m) and wide (0.6 m) bore and one with a horizontal open configuration, for spinal imaging. The patients included in the analysis were part of a larger cohort. All patients were at increased risk to suffer from cluastrophobia as the objective of this randomized controlled study was to compare patient-centered MR systems. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare recent high-field MR scanners with patient-centered designs. The insights to be derived from this analysis are important to be able to define which further improvements in MR imaging technology might be necessary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Approval was obtained from the institutional review board at Charit&#x000e9;, Berlin.

A large solenoid coil (ST body/spine XL) was used on the horinzontal open MR scanner, and the spine-array coils that are integrated into the table were used on the short-bore scanner. Patients were examined head-first for imaging of the cervicothoracic spine and imaging of the whole spine. For thoracolumbar spine imaging, a feet-first approach was used. The basic MR sequences acquired were sagittal T2- and T1-weighted, and axial T2-weighted sequences.

Short-bore MR images had a higher image quality with less image noise, higher contrast and contour sharpness, and higher SNR values than MR images obtained with the open MR scanner (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083427-t003">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083427-t004">4</xref>). CNR values were also significantly higher in short-bore MR images, except for T1-weighted sequences of the cervicothoracic spine and axial T2-weighted sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083427-t004">Table 4</xref>). In MR imaging of the cervical spine, one reason for these findings might be increased motion of swallowing and fluid in that region. However, the quantitative contour sharpness was not impaired in these sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083427-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083427-g007">7</xref>). Regarding the lower CNR values in T1-weighted sequences, an explanation could be the generally lower contrast in T1-weighted images compared to T2-weighted images in spinal imaging. Mean values of the quantitative contour sharpness measurement were higher in T1-weighted MR images of both MR scanners, thus indicating a decreased contour sharpness. The scan durations were significantly longer for MR imaging with the open MR scanner and there was a trend to higher perceived pain and noise levels during open MR imaging (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083427-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Enders1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). This might have caused the increased motion artifacts, which were found in part of the MR images obtained with the open scanner (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083427-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The higher SNR, CNR, and quantitative contour sharpness which were achieved with the short-bore scanner may contribute to an increased sensitivity for the detection of pathologies. In our study, all examinations had diagnostic image quality. This might also be due to the appropriateness of all indications for MR imaging in this cohort <xref rid="pone.0083427-Enders1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-American2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-American3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, the lower image quality achieved with open MR imaging may impede accurate diagnosis for indications requiring the highest possible resolution, e.g., diagnosis of spinal multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Image quality is influenced by several factors. One reason for the superior image quality with short-bore MR imaging found in our study is the higher field strength of the short-bore scanner (1.5 Tesla versus 1 Tesla). Stronger magnetization and higher precession rates at high field strengths increase SNR and CNR. In the 0.5 to 1.5 T range SNR and CNR theoretically increase linearly with field strength <xref rid="pone.0083427-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The differences in field strengths as well as gradient strengths were also the main reason for the longer scanning times in open MR imaging <xref rid="pone.0083427-Enders1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Another factor influencing image quality is homogeneity of the main magnetic field (B0). The horizontal magnetic field of the short-bore MR scanner runs around the z-axis of the body, while the vertical field lines in the open scanner run in anteroposterior direction and become more inhomogenous with increasing distance from the center of the magnet. Therefore, the vertical magnetic field is potentially more inhomogeneous, which can lead to nonuniformities in SI, and thus further decrease SNR and reduce subjective image quality. However, to our knowledge, there is no study addressing this issue and its potential impact on image quality in vertical field MR imaging. The typical homogeneity which is guaranteed by the vendors is for the Panorama 45&#x000d7;45&#x000d7;45 cm, 2.8 parts per million (ppm) and 0.4 ppm for the Avanto. The different coils which were used on the two scanners also influence image quality. The spine-array coils which are integrated in the short-bore MR table were normally closer to the region of interest, which resulted in increased SNR in that region. In vertical magnetic fields, solenoid coils have to be used. Of the coils which are available for the horizontal open scanner, the ST body/spine coil was the optimal choice for spinal MR imaging (personal communication with Dr. Bernhard Schnackenburg, Philips). Previous studies have shown superior performance of solenoid coils compared to surface coils, particularly regarding SNR <xref rid="pone.0083427-Ballon1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Ham1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Theoretically, SNR increases with the filling of a solenoid coil. However, subgroup analyses revealed no correlation of either SNR or image quality with patients' BMI.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the image quality of two high-field MR scanners with specific patient-centered designs. Several other studies have compared the image quality of conventional closed MR scanners and found superior image quality for higher field strengths <xref rid="pone.0083427-Jack1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Maubon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Others have compared high-field closed with low-field open MR scanners. Michel et al. found poor image quality in MR pelvimetry with a low-field open MR scanner <xref rid="pone.0083427-Michel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Calabrese et al. concluded that open low-field contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the breast yielded good diagnostic performance in claustrophobic or oversized patients <xref rid="pone.0083427-Calabrese1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Mehdizade et al. found that diffusion-weighted MR imaging performed with a low-field open MR scanner was reliable for the evaluation of acute stroke <xref rid="pone.0083427-Mehdizade1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Regarding the restrictions of conventional MR imaging, horizontal open MR scanners have shown potential for facilitating imaging of patients with claustrophobia or extreme obesity <xref rid="pone.0083427-Bangard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-deBucourt1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Enders1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and a better patient acceptance is assumed for open MR scanners <xref rid="pone.0083427-Bangard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Heuck1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Michel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Reduced claustrophobia rates have also been found with recent short-bore MR scanners <xref rid="pone.0083427-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We have recently conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare horizontal open and short-bore MR scanners in patients at increased risk of claustrophobia during MR imaging and found a positive trend for open MR imaging <xref rid="pone.0083427-Enders1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, there were claustrophobia rates of over 25% for both scanners. Thus, more patient-centered MR configurations are needed.</p><p>Strengths of our study include randomization and restriction of the anatomical regions examined to make the comparison as reliable as possible. We also used comparable sequence parameters on both MR scanners, which were kept constant in all examinations, as adjustment can affect signal intensities and contrast between tissues. Moreover, patient baseline characteristics were well matched between the two groups.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, in order to obtain comparable sequence parameters on both MR scanners, compromises had to be made regarding the best possible image quality still providing comparability. As the parameters were kept constant, they were also not optimized for single examinations. The second limitation with a possible impact on image quality was the use of different gradient coils on the two MR scanners. However, this cannot be avoided. Third, there were differences in the acquisition times due to the different field and gradient strengths. Theoretically, a longer scan time makes motion artifacts more likely, especially in patients who might suffer from pain or claustrophobia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083427-t003">Table 3</xref>). However, the differences in image quality we saw are not attributable to more motion artifacts degrading the quality of images acquired with the open MR scanner, because the image quality scores were higher for short-bore MR imaging in sequences with equal artifact ratings, and there were no severe artifacts in any sequence. Fourth, the viewing window-level parameters were not consistent in all images as this is not feasible in clinical practice. Window leveling was performed automatically with a constant approach leading to the best possible image appearance for diagnostic evaluation. Last, it should be mentioned that there are now high-field MR scanners with an even shorter and wider bore which have already shown to reduce the scan abortion rate in claustrophobic patients <xref rid="pone.0083427-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, this improvement might come at the expense of image quality.</p><p>Future research should thus address image quality of MR scanners with a shorter and wider bore than the short-bore scanner which we used in our study. Moreover, further anatomical regions should be adressed regarding the comparison of high-field open versus short-bore MR imaging. This is particularly important because of the different demands on image quality depending on the medical indication and because of the different coils which are used for imaging of other anatomical regions. An intraindividual comparison could provide more insights into this issue and allow diagnostic comparison of the two scanners.</p><p>In conclusion, all examinations on both MR scanners were diagnostic, but qualitative and quantitative image quality parameters were rated higher for short-bore MR imaging. Most notable differences were found in overall image quality, mean SNR values, and quantitative contour sharpness. Previous studies have shown an advantage of open MR scanners regarding patient acceptance and imaging of claustrophobic or obese patients <xref rid="pone.0083427-Bangard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Spouse1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-deBucourt1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Heuck1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083427-Michel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, high claustrophobia rates have recently been found in patients at risk for both open and short-bore MR imaging <xref rid="pone.0083427-Enders1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Moreover, longer scanning times are required with recent open MR scanners. Thus, future developments should aim at designing more patient-centered MR scanners simultaneously providing high image quality without prolongation of scanning time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0083427.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>

<bold>Contour Sharpness Measurement Using ImageJ.</bold> A: In the example shown here a standardized line profile was drawn at a 90-degree angle over the contour of cerebrospinal fluid and spinal cord in a T1-weighted sagittal image of the cervicothoracic spine. The ROIs were drawn from the tissue with lower to the tissue with higher signal intensity. B: The grayscale pixel value profile was then calculated perpendicular to the axis of the line profile. C: The number of pixels (x-axis) that are neeeded for the signal to increase from 25% to 75% of the grayscale pixel value profile (colored section) was used as the measure of contour sharpness. Due to the different voxel sizes obtained with the two scanners the following formula was used to calculate the distance in mm: pixels measured in the grayscale pixel value profile x pixel length in mm.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0083427.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0083427-Hailey1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Hailey D (2006) Open magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners.
