The incidence of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) in women older than 50 years is more than 1 in 100 per year [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Approximately 25% of women older than 70 years and more than half the women older than 80 years have at least one OVCF [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As a result of OVCF, patients experience severe chronic pain, kyphosis, compromised mobility, pulmonary function reduction, and high mortality; therefore, it is necessary to adopt appropriate treatment modalities for OVCF [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) was first developed by Reiley et al. in 1998 and it became the mainstream treatment for OVCF [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In PKP, the morphology of the collapsed vertebral body was restored with inflated balloon catheters, and the vertebral body was stabilized with a cement injection [<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous reports have demonstrated that the advantages of PKP in comparison to conservative management have been well established in terms of pain reduction and functional outcome; however, some authors were also concerned about the complications associated with PKP, including cement extravasations and adjacent vertebral fractures [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, some reports showed that PKP and conservative treatment have equivalent efficacies, as seen at long-term follow-up [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, the methods used for the treatment of OVCF are still controversial.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and particularly the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence are very sensitive tools for detecting vertebral edema as a result of fresh fractures or microfractures [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In recent years, some authors have drawn our attention towards the use of MRI for differential diagnosis and predictive prognosis of VCF. For instance, Ogura et al. reported that STIR images were useful for differential diagnosis between malignant and benign VCFs [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, some studies suggested that characteristic signal changes on STIR images were effective in predicting subsequent pseudarthrosis resulting from OVCF and subsequent vertebral collapse after percutaneous vertebroplasty [<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To our knowledge, the relationship between treatment outcomes and MRI findings regarding OVCF has not been previously reported. We conducted a prospective clinical study with a series of consecutive patients with OVCF admitted to our hospital. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact and usefulness of characteristic signal change of a linear black signal on MRI on treatment-related decision making.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a single-center prospective randomized trial at the Shaoxing People&#x02019;s Hospital. The study was designed to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes between PKP and conservative treatments for treating OVCF with linear black signal on STIR images. Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of Shaoxing People&#x02019;s Hospital (No. 2014021). The study was initiated on October 1, 2014 and completed on March 30, 2017.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>Our inclusion criteria for this project were as follows: single level thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral fracture in patients older than 60 years, concordance of local pain and injured vertebra during clinical examination, and linear black signal detection on STIR image. Exclusion criteria included multilevel compression fractures, secondary osteoporosis (inflammation, endocrine disorders, and corticosteroids), burst fractures, radicular syndrome, primary bone tumors, and spinal metastases. After obtaining signed informed consent from patients before enrollment, patients were randomly divided into the PKP group and conservative treatment groups by the table of random numbers. The flow chart for categorization of patients into groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-24-50">Figure 1</xref>. Forty-one patients were available for analysis: 24 patients were treated with PKP and 17 patients were treated with conservative therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>MRI signal changes</title><p>Conventional vertebral column MRI examinations were performed in all patients, using a 3.0 Tesla MRI apparatus (Siemens Magnetom Symphony Quantum, Erlangen, Germany) with a spine coil. Routine sequences studied in patients with trauma consisted of T1-weighted spin echo (SE), T2-weighted SE sagittal, T2-weighted SE axial, and STIR sagittal sections. All MRI examinations were performed within one week after trauma. According to a previous study, the linear black signal change was defined as a linear black signal area of more than half the length of the fractured vertebral body on STIR image [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-medscimonit-24-50">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conservative therapy</title><p>Patients who refused PKP received systematic bed rest, back brace treatment, and analgesic therapy (i.e., celecoxib 200 mg, orally twice daily) for two weeks. Anti-osteoporosis treatment was administered to patients in the conservative treatment group for 12 months, which included 200 IU calcitonin, nasally administered daily (Novartis Pharma S.A.S. France), 0.25 &#x003bc;g calcitriol orally, administered daily, and 600 mg calcium carbonate, orally administered daily.</p></sec><sec><title>Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP)</title><p>The surgeries were performed by two surgeons. Under local anesthesia, the patient was positioned prone on a radiolucent table. A small skin puncture was made approximately 2.5 cm off the midline. With simultaneous viewing of anteroposterior and lateral projections of the spine by C-arm fluoroscopy, a transpedicular entry point into the vertebral body was identified. An 11-gauge needle was placed with the tip lateral to the pedicle projection in the anteroposterior view and parallel to the superior endplate in the lateral view. The working channel, which extends to the junction of the anterior and middle third of the vertebral body, was created. An inflatable balloon was inserted unilaterally into the fractured vertebral body through the working channel and gradually inflated to create a vertebral cavity. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the operator controlled the volume of the balloon to restore the damaged vertebral body until adequate kyphosis angle reduction was obtained. Thereafter, the balloons were deflated and removed; the void was filled with the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cement. Patients could move freely 24 hours postoperatively and they also received anti-osteoporosis treatment for 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Demographic data, including age, sex, fracture location, bone mineral density, and follow-up time were recorded. Two independent senior radiologists evaluated the radiographic outcomes, and clinical follow-up examinations of the patients were independently performed by an orthopedic specialist.</p><p>Clinical outcomes were evaluated by the visual analog scale (VAS) and the short-form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. VAS was used to record patients&#x02019; daily pain scores during the pretreatment and follow-up periods (post-treatment, one week, three months, six months, and one year). Eight dimensionality concepts were measured and analyzed according to the physical and mental health based on the SF-36, including physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical health (RP), bodily pain (BP), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE), social functioning (SF), general health perceptions (GH), general mental health (MH), and vitality (VT) [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The questionnaires were completed one year after therapy.</p><p>The anterior vertebral body height (AH) and the kyphosis angle were measured on radiographs preoperatively, postoperatively, and after one-year follow-up. The AH was defined as the percentage of the intact anterior height of the fractured vertebrae compared to the caudal vertebral body. The kyphosis angle was measured as the angle between the inferior endplate of the intact vertebra above and the superior endplate of the intact vertebra below. Additionally, nonunion of the fractured vertebrae was defined as the occurrence of an intravertebral vacuum cleft or change of vertebral height between standing and supine positions on lateral radiographs after at least one-year follow-up [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are expressed in terms of mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.

Galibert et al. first used this method to treat vertebral angioma [<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As soon as the pain relieving potential of this technique was detected, it was applied to the treatment of OVCF. Studies have indicated that PKP successfully reduces pain, substantially restores the morphology of the vertebrae, and significantly improves the quality of life [<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Conservative treatment for pain caused by OVCF includes analgesic medication, bed rest, and back braces. Some reports indicated that these therapies do not address spinal deformities. Pain and disability may be prolonged while the fractured vertebral body heals; however, some reports showed that conservative treatment and PKP have equivalent efficacies at long-term follow-up [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The controversies regarding the treatment for OVCF still exist. We found that some MRI characteristic signal changes could aid in deciding the most appropriate treatment for OVCF. A prospective clinical study was conducted to analyze the relationship between treatment outcomes and MRI findings for OVCF.</p><p>In our study, for patients with linear black signal changes, the VAS pain scores were significantly lower in the PKP group than in the conservative treatment group at the one-year follow-up. The PF, RP, and BP values in the PKP group were significantly higher than those in the conservative treatment group; there were significant differences observed. The PKP group had a significantly higher bone-union rate than the conservative treatment group. Therefore, PKP is superior to conservative treatment with regard to short-term and long-term pain relief, functional outcome, vertebral restoration, and bone-union. The first-choice treatment for patients with a linear black signal change should be PKP rather than conservative treatment.</p><p>The typical MRI findings in an acute vertebral compression fracture are hypointensity on T1-weighted images, hyperintensity or heterogeneous intensity on T2-weighted images, and hyperintensity on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images or on short-inversion time-inversion recovery images [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Characteristic signal changes on a STIR image, such as a linear black signal, have been previously reported by Hirotsugu et al. [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They also reported that the linear black signal area was a significant predictor of nonunion in OVCF. However, the histopathological findings correlated to this characteristic signal change have not been reported by previous studies [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-24-50" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We proposed that linear black signal area is an early post-traumatic avascular necrosis of the vertebral body, which may finally lead to nonunion of OVCF. Initial trauma may cause predominately trabecular microfractures in the linear black signal area, resulting in structural disruptions and microhemorrhages. These changes in the spongiosa lead to early osteonecrosis in the linear black signal area. Furthermore, because of impaired healing, a vicious circle develops, the trabecular fractures progress resulting in instability and vertebral body collapse, and then nonunion. However, in the PKP procedure, the stability of vertebral body is achieved, which could prevent progressive collapse and nonunion of vertebrae. In the further studies, biopsies could be used to show pathological change in the linear black signal area, and the relationship between the linear black signal change and the vertebral nonunion on MRI images should be verified in long-term follow-up.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study. First, it was conducted at a single center and the sample size was small. Therefore, future multi-center studies with larger patient numbers are necessary. Second, we only included patients whose date of fracture could be identified by the onset of pain or a specific injury. The enrolled patients underwent MRI to identify acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures within one week after trauma. Patients with a fracture age greater than one week were not included in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PKP is superior to conservative treatment in patients showing a linear black signal change with regard to pain relief, functional outcome, vertebral restoration, and bone-union, as seen at short-term and long-term follow-up.
