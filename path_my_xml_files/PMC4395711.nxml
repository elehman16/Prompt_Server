sequential learning according to two different types of practice schedules, distributed
practice schedule (two 12-hour inter-trial intervals) and massed practice schedule (two
10-minute inter-trial intervals) using a serial reaction time (SRT) task. [Subjects and
Methods] Thirty healthy subjects were recruited and then randomly and evenly assigned to
either the distributed practice group or the massed practice group. All subjects performed
three consecutive sessions of the SRT task following one of the two different types of
practice schedules. Distributed practice was scheduled for two 12-hour inter-session
intervals including sleeping time, whereas massed practice was administered for two
10-minute inter-session intervals. Response time (RT) and response accuracy (RA) were
measured in at pre-test, mid-test, and post-test. [Results] For RT, univariate analysis
demonstrated significant main effects in the within-group comparison of the three tests as
well as the interaction effect of two groups &#x000d7; three tests, whereas the between-group
comparison showed no significant effect. The results for RA showed no significant
differences in neither the between-group comparison nor the interaction effect of two
groups &#x000d7; three tests, whereas the within-group comparison of the three tests showed a
significant main effect. [Conclusion] Distributed practice led to enhancement of motor
skill acquisition at the first inter-session interval as well as at the second
inter-interval the following day, compared to massed practice. Consequentially, the
results of this study suggest that a distributed practice schedule can enhance the
effectiveness of motor sequential learning in 1-day learning as well as for two days
learning formats compared to massed practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Distributed practice</kwd><kwd>Massed practice</kwd><kwd>Spacing effect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Motor skill learning has become an important issue, due to the increasing involvement of
human movement behaviors in neuroscience, psychology, and physical education<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, until now, motor learning has
puzzled contemporary science, and its mechanisms and contributing factors remaining unclear.
How motor skills are acquired and processed by the neuromuscular system has become a topic
of interest. Furthermore, application methods for improving motor skills have been
spotlighted in order to increase the capability of motor performance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several factors related to
motor learning are already well known, in terms of amount of practice, types of feedback,
application period of feedback, practice schedule, and so forth<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is well known that the effectiveness of motor learning can vary according to the
practice schedule. Of these schedule types, distributed and massed practice schedules are
common in learning studies. Distributed practice utilizes temporal spacing intervals between
repetition of tasks usually of the order of hours or during a few days, whereas massed
practice consists of fewer and shorter inter-trial intervals during training sessions<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In general, motor skills are more effectively learned when there is a long resting time
between training intervals, a phenomenon called the spacing effect<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on this, many studies have tried to identify the
exact temporal period of inter-trial interval that maximize the effectiveness of motor skill
learning<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Traditionally, research on the spacing effect has been performed in the field of
experimental psychology, focusing on areas of memory and verbal learning<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have investigated whether
motor skill acquisition is more effective using distributed practice or massed practice. In
addition, there has been no consistent finding regarding inter-trial intervals between
repetition of tasks among previous studies<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, we compared motor skill learning between 1-day
learning and for two days learning formats as well as the effectiveness of motor sequential
learning of a serial reaction time (SRT) task according to practice schedules, i.e.,
distributed practice for two days versus massed practice in 1-day learning formats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty healthy subjects were recruited based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) no
previous history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, (2) no pathology of
musculoskeletal function in the upper limb, (3) right-handed as verified by the modified
Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, (4) no previous exposure to other sequential learning
experiments within the past 6 months. All subjects were randomly and evenly assigned to the
distributed practice group or massed practice group. Subjects in the distributed group did
not suffer from sleep disturbance during the practice session. All subjects understood the
purpose of the study and gave their written, informed consent to participation. This study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the local ethics committee in accordance
with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The SRT task was performed with a computer using stimulus presentation software program
(LAXTHA, Korea), which is composed of visual cues that assess the response time and accuracy
in performing a task. The visual cues were eight non-colored Arabic numbers randomly
presented in the center of a computer monitor in consecutive order without auditory cues.
When a visual cue (i.e. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight) appeared to a
subject, at the start of each trial, the subject selected the appropriate response key,
which ended the trial. At the end of each trial, there was a short fixed delay before
another cue was displayed. The SRT task for training consisted of three sessions, 12 blocks,
and 864 trials. One session included a total of four blocks with a resting time of 60
seconds between each block. One block consisted of total 72 trials, which were randomly
presented with equal probabilities of 12.5% for each of the eight cues. Thus, each cue was
presented nine times in one block, and it remained on the monitor until 1,000 milliseconds
had elapsed regardless of the subject&#x02019;s response. The default inter-stimuli interval was 500
milliseconds and was independent of the response time. Thus, each subject usually spent
under 10 minutes carrying out one session.</p><p>All subjects sat in front of a table with their right elbow flexed at approximately 90&#x000b0;.
Their right hand was placed on the response keys, which were composed of left, right, up,
and down arrows on the computer keyboard. For performance of the SRT task, subjects were
instructed to respond to each cue with a predetermined set of response keys: the &#x0201c;one&#x0201d; or
&#x0201c;eight&#x0201d; numbers meant that the subject had to press the &#x0201c;&#x02190;&#x0201d; button with the index finger,
the &#x0201c;two&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;seven&#x0201d; numbers indicated the &#x0201c;&#x02191;&#x0201d; button should be pressed with the middle
finger, the &#x0201c;three&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;six&#x0201d; numbers indicated the &#x0201c;&#x02192;&#x0201d; button should be pressed with the
ring finger, and the &#x0201c;four&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;five&#x0201d; numbers indicated the &#x0201c;&#x02193;&#x0201d; button should be pressed
with the middle finger. Following the visual cues, all subjects were asked to press the
button as quickly as possible according to the corresponding cues using the dominant right
hand.</p><p>The experimental paradigm consisted of three consecutive training sessions (i.e.,
first-session, second session, and third session) and three tests to assess response time
and accuracy (i.e., pre-test, mid-test immediately after the second session, post-test
immediately after the third session). All subjects were asked to perform a total of three
training sessions, with different spacing gaps according to their designated practice type,
that were identical in the composition of the SRT task. Subjects belonging to the
distributed practice group were allowed a resting time of 12 hours between sessions,
including sleeping time, whereas subjects in the massed practice group were provided a
resting time of 10 minutes between sessions. In addition, subjects in the distributed
practice group were instructed not to ingest alcohol or caffeine during the training
session. One demonstration and trial for each block of the SRT task with a different
sequence were presented prior to the actual experiment until they became familiar with the
task and experimental procedure.</p><p>Participants were not given the sequence information and were asked for the correct
sequence based on memory only after the experiment in order to measure passive motor
sequential learning. No one remembered the correct sequence in its entirety after the end of
the experiment. The response time from presentation of the visual stimuli to motor response
was measured in milliseconds, and the response accuracy was analyzed by percentile as the
proportion of correct responses in presented total stimuli in the pre-test, mid-test, and
post-test.</p><p>The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to compare the gender difference of the distributed
practice group and the massed practice group. The independent t-test was performed to
analyze differences in demographic (i.e., age) and dependent variables (i.e., response time
and response accuracy) in the first test between the two groups. Separate univariate
analyses of variance were carried out to compare between-group and group changes using 2
(groups: distributed practice group, massed practice group) &#x000d7; 2 (test sessions: pre-test and
mid-test or pre-test and post-test) ANOVA with repeated measures. PAWS, version 18.0 (SPSS
Inc., USA) was used for all statistical analyses, and differences with a p value lower than
0.05 were regarded as significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Improved motor response time and accuracy were observed in both practice groups, indicating
successful motor learning during the three training sessions. In the demographic data, no
significant differences were observed in terms of gender (distributed practiced group;

distributed practice schedule (two 12-hour inter-trial intervals) and a massed practice
schedule (two 10-minute inter-trial intervals) using SRT task. Our results show that,
distributed practice consisting of inter-trial intervals of 12 hours more effectively
enhanced motor skill acquisition than massed practice consisting of inter-trial intervals of
10 minutes. Distributed practice, in which the third trial was performed on the following
day, improved motor sequential learning more than massed practice, in which the trials were
performed provided in a 1-day learning format. Consequently, we confirmed that a distributed
practice schedule better enhances motor sequential learning in both 1-day learning and for
two days learning formats than a massed practice schedule.</p><p>The benefits of distributed practice have been researched since the late 1800s<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is well established that distributed
practice has advantages in terms of both implicit and explicit memories, basic memory tasks
using words, educational materials, motor skill acquisition, and so forth<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite abundant evidence that
distributed learning has benefits for memory and learning, studies of distributed learning
in the context of procedural learning or motor sequence acquisition are relatively few. Shea
et al<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. used three variations of a
key-press timing task, similar to our experimental design, and found that the spacing gap in
distributed practice scheduled within 1-day and during a few days intervals enhanced motor
performance in a delayed retention test. In addition, their other experiment using a dynamic
balance task provided the same result regarding the comparison of distributed and massed
practice. Previous studies have also suggested the benefits of distributed practice in
various procedural motor tasks, in terms of surgical skill training using virtual reality,
and discrete motor tasks, etc<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Likewise, prior studies corroborate our findings, showing that
inter-trial intervals play an important role in learning motor skills<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To explain the benefits of distributed practice, a theory of memory consolidation has been
proposed<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Memory consolidation is a term used as a category of processes in
which a memory trace is stabilized from a relatively unstable phase into a permanent
form<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have argued that a
relatively longer inter-trial interval provides the opportunity for memory consolidation
without interruption from additional practice<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Memory consolidation requires a
substantial period of time with no disruptions. In addition, Karni et al<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. suggested that relatively long periods of
rest and sleep between training sessions might improve motor performance. Thus, our findings
that distributed practice within 1-day and for two days intervals led to faster and more
accurate motor responses in the SRT task than massed practice can be attributed to the
improvement of explicit and implicit memory retention upon completion of memory
consolidation. However, our results also show that motor performance between the first and
second session within 1-day improved more than that between the second and third sessions
which were performed on different days. This result may be due to a celling effect. Our SRT
task paradigm was not complex, therefore as a long period of skill acquisition was not
required. Thus, we assume that our participants almost reached their maximal learning
capacity in the second training session.</p><p>Motor skill learning is an essential component for successfully performing physical
activities in daily life<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Understanding
the mechanisms of motor learning in the human nervous system remains an interesting
scientific issue in neuroscience. Numerous prior studies have attempted to determine the
factors that can enhance the acquisition and retention of motor skills<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, it is important to increase the
effectiveness of motor skill learning in the fields of neurological rehabilitation and sport
science. Therefore, we expect that these findings will help to develop efficient and
effective approaches for the facilitation of motor learning. However, this study had some
limitations. Retention of motor skills was not measured, and the amount of sleep the
previous night was not controlled. It is already known that implicit and explicit learning
are affected by sleep. In the future, studies will be required to take these elements into
consideration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Yeungnam University College Research Grants in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>LG</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The Olympic brain.
