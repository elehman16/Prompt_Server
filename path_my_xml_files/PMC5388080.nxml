The present study investigated the effects of 8 weeks of combined aerobic dance exercise and honey supplementation on blood immune function parameters in adult women. In this study, forty four healthy sedentary women (25&#x02013;40 year-old) were assigned into four groups with n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11 per group: sedentary without supplementation control (Con), honey supplementation (H), aerobic dance exercise (D) and combined aerobic dance exercise with honey supplementation (HD) groups. Aerobic dance exercise was carried out for one hour per session, three sessions per week for eight weeks. Honey drink was consumed by H and HD groups, in a dosage of 20&#x000a0;g of honey diluted in 300&#x000a0;ml of plain water, consumed 7 days a week for 8 weeks. In HD group, the participants were required to consume honey drink 30&#x000a0;min before performing exercise. Before and after 8 weeks of experimental period, blood samples were taken to determine the concentrations of immune parameters which include full blood counts and immunophenotyping measurements. It was found that after 8 weeks of experimental period, there were statistically significant increases in T cytotoxic (CD8) (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) in HD group. Additionally, the percentages increase in total lymphocyte counts, T helper (CD4), and T cytotoxic (CD8) counts after 8 weeks were the highest in HD group among all the groups. As conclusion, combined aerobic dance and honey supplementation may have potential to enhance immune functions in women.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Aerobic dance</kwd><kwd>Honey supplementation</kwd><kwd>Immune functions</kwd><kwd>Lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>T cytotoxic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Physical activity is believed to have close relationship with immune function.

The aerobic dance exercise program of this study consisted of 2 sessions of &#x02018;high and low impact&#x02019; and one session of a &#x02018;step board&#x02019; aerobic dance exercises in a week. The 1-hour session started with 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min of warm up period, 30&#x02013;35&#x000a0;min of aerobic dance activities, and ended with 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;min of cool down. The activities prescribed in the present aerobic dance exercise program involved continuous, controlled movement of legs and trunk, and intermittent movement of arms. Movements involved were side stepping, fast walking, forward and backward stepping, leg lifts, placing foot to the front, side and behind, knee bends, forward and side-lunging, heel raise and also high impact movement such as jumping. In the high-impact and low-impact aerobic dance exercise sessions, participants were required to do upper and lower limb movements according to the beats of the music played, which ranged from slow to fast. In the &#x02018;step board&#x02019; exercise sessions, participants were required to step up and down the step board while dancing. The intensity of aerobic dance exercise was estimated by using heart rate monitor (Polar, S710, USA) worn by participants throughout the dancing sessions. Besides, the participants were given pre-recorded CD containing aerobic dance workout, and they were required to follow the workout in the CD given at home if they missed any of the aerobic dance sessions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.3"><label>2.2.3</label><title>Honey supplementation</title><p>A honey drink was consumed by the participants in the honey (H) group and combined aerobic dance exercise and honey supplementation (HD) group in a dosage of 20&#x000a0;g<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> of Malaysian local Gelam honey diluted in 300&#x000a0;ml of plain water,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> for 7 days per week for a total of 8 weeks.

The reduction in WBC with exercise observed in the present study is inconsistent with most of the published studies which reported increases in total leukocytes and leukocytes subsets after exercise,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and the present findings may reflect that both the duration and the intensity of exercise in the present study need to be considered. The questions raised were whether the participants in the exercise alone group perceived the prescribed exercise in the current study as a type of stress, even though the participants' average heart rates recorded during exercise were ranging from 120 to 140 beats&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which was equivalent to 60%&#x02013;70% of the participants' maximum heart rate, reflecting that the intensity of the prescribed exercise in the present study was considered moderate. The reductions in WBC and neutrophil cell counts in exercise group may imply that the prescribed exercise of this study may have acted as a stress to reduce the WBC and neutrophil counts. This speculation is based on Moynihan et&#x000a0;al.,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> which mentioned that the circulating numbers and functional capacities of white blood cells may be decreased by repeated bouts of intense, prolonged exercise. The reason is probably related to increased levels of stress hormones during exercise and entry into the circulation of less mature white blood cells from the bone marrow.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Additionally, neutrophil is reported to be intensity dependent generally in which exercise at low to moderate intensity could enhance some aspects of neutrophils function, while maximum exercise suppressed neutrophil functions,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and can cause functional alterations in neutrophil function.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>It was hypothesized that when exercise and honey supplementation combined together in the present study, this combination may enhance immune function of the participants greater than if exercise or honey supplementation is carried out alone. The notable finding of the present study was that there were statistically significant increases in T cytotoxic (CD8) counts in HD group after 8 weeks of experimental period, implying that honey supplementation combined with aerobic dance exercise increased CD8 T cell counts greater than consumed honey and performed aerobic dance exercise alone. These findings supported our hypothesis. Similarly Kwon et&#x000a0;al.,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> reported that four weeks soybean supplementation combined with moderate intensity endurance swimming exercise could prevent impairment of T cell through changes of CD4/CD8 ratio in rats. Therefore, it is suggested that honey and its constituent also have the beneficial effects on CD8 T cell counts. The precise mechanism for inducing the beneficial effects on this immune function parameter in the present study is unclear. However, it is speculated that during exercise, more blood is needed by participants' body, therefore more vital nutrients in honey have been absorbed into participants' body during exercise.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> These vital nutrients enhanced immune functions of the participants by increasing the lymphocyte cell counts.</p><p>Another notable finding of the present study was that the percentage increases in total lymphocyte, T helper (CD4), and T cytotoxic (CD8) cell counts after 8 weeks were the highest in HD group among all the groups, even though statistically significant increases were not observed. Collectively, these findings may indicate that combined honey supplementation and aerobic dance exercise may have potential to enhance immune functions compared to honey supplementation alone or exercise alone. It is speculated that carbohydrate contained in honey may be able to modulate immune function either by reducing the stress effect of exercise,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Nehlsen-Cannarella et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> also reported that carbohydrate ingestion is associated with higher plasma glucose concentrations and it could attenuate stress hormones. In our present study, the findings reflect the effects of two months honey supplementation and aerobic dance exercise on the measured parameters, but not the acute effects such as a single session of honey supplementation and aerobic dance exercise on immune function parameters, and this may cause discrepancies between the present study results and other previous studies. For instance, Natale et&#x000a0;al.,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> found that exercise induced a significant increase in total T lymphocyte (CD3) cell counts immediately after exercise. Nevertheless, 3&#x000a0;h after exercise, the CD3 cell counts for peak aerobic exercise are 35% below baseline. They also found that circulating CD4 (T helper) cell counts showed a significant increase with peak aerobic exercise and prolonged exercise but not for resistance exercise, and the counts were subnormal 3&#x000a0;h after the peak aerobic exercise. Additionally, significant increased in CD8 T cell counts were observed immediately after exercise, but were restored to baseline 3&#x000a0;h after exercise. Their study have shown the changes of immune parameters during and a few hours after exercise, where the present study found that the changes in immune parameters occurred 14&#x000a0;h after the last exercise session of 8 weeks' intervention. Additionally, it was suggested that the difference in sampling time is one of the possible reason for variation in blood analysis results. In the present study, blood samples were collected for immune function test 14&#x000a0;h after exercise ended. It is believed that the sampling time used in the present study may have caused absence of some significant changes in certain measured immune parameters.</p><p>Mobilisation of NK cells is one of the most robust changes to the immune system in response to physical exercise.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The striking exercise-induced increase of NK cells count in peripheral pool is thought to translate into enhanced immune function, while post-exercise reduction in blood NK cells is proposed to increase one's susceptibility to infection.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> One of the most notable findings in the present study was that there was no significant changes in NK cells count in HD group, however great increase (+0.76%) in NK cell counts could be observed in D group with greatest percent difference between pre and post test among the groups. Based on this finding, aerobic dance exercise alone may have potential to increase NK cell counts.</p><p>Increase in NK cells count resulted from exercise has been reported by Shephard and Shek,<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> and Timmons.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Elevated NK cells in response to acute exercise were found in adults<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> and children.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> In another study, peak aerobic exercise induced significant increase in circulating NK cell counts immediately after exercise, however NK cells counts returned to baseline by 3&#x000a0;h post exercise.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> These changes are probably due to an enhanced state of readiness against potentially harmful pathogen in human.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> On the other hand, it was reported that high intensity exercise could induce suppression of NK cell function.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> The absence of reduction in NK cells induced by the aerobic dance exercise prescribed in the exercise group of the present study may reflect that the exercise intensity perceived by participants in the exercise group was not high enough for reducing the NK cells.</p><p>In the present study, it was found that NK cells decreased over time in HD group. A previous study which reported that combined carbohydrate intake with 60&#x000a0;min and high-intensity cycling was not associated with an alteration in innate immunity. Nevertheless, previous study mentioned that the effect of exercise on NK cell activity cannot be denied.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Furthermore, Timmons and Bar-Or<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> showed that NK cell function is neither enhanced nor reduced following exercise in young girls, however carbohydrate intake attenuates the NK cell subsets responses to exercise in children. In the present study, NK cells count reduced when exercise combined with honey (HD). Additionally, reduced in NK cells count was observed in honey supplementation alone (H) group. These observations were in agreement with statement mentioned by Nieman<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> that by maintaining higher plasma glucose levels and thus attenuating the cortisol and growth responses during exercise, carbohydrate beverage ingestion may reduce stress to the immune system in individuals.</p><p>In general, the discrepancy of the measured parameters between the present study and previous studies may be due to differences in type of exercise, duration of exercise, age range, types of nutritional supplementations given and particularly time of blood withdrawal after exercise. One of the limitations of the study is that despite statistical analysis of One-way ANOVA was performed to minimize the differences in the measured parameters among the groups at the beginning of the study, differences in certain measured blood parameters between the groups during pre test could not be avoided. Thus, the present study focused on the comparison of the variables between pre- and post-tests in each group. Another limitation of this study is that the sample size used is rather small. It is suggested that future studies with multicentric experimental conditions such as different types of exercise and nutritional supplementation, prolonged intervention period and repeated blood withdrawing after exercise, as well as larger sample size are needed for details and comprehensive findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study found that combination of aerobic dance exercise and honey supplementation elicited more beneficial effects on immune functions generally compared to aerobic dance exercise or honey supplementation alone in sedentary women. Therefore, supplementation of honey drink with 20&#x000a0;g of honey diluted in 300&#x000a0;ml of plain water combined with 3 days per week of aerobic dance exercise has potential to be proposed for formulating guidelines in planning exercise and nutrition promotion program for increasing immune functions in sedentary women.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors
