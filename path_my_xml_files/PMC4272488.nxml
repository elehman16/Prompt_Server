INTRODUCTION</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by symmetric inflammation of affected joints (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The disease affects 1% of the population (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and has been a significant cause of disability (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Over the last 3 decades, there have been significant improvements in patient outcomes associated with the introduction of MTX in the 1980 and the subsequent shift to its earlier and more intensive use. The development of therapies targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 has resulted in further improvement in outcomes, related to the capacity of these treatment to retard radiographic progression of RA. Even with the advances in disease management, a population of patients with refractory RA exists. In clinical trials that lead to approval of anti TNF therapies, 25-40% of patients failed to achieve a response on the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR 20) (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Reporting on the Swedish Society of Rheumatology registry of patients with RA treated with Etanercept between 1999-2003 found that 21% of RA patients initiating therapy with Etanercept were no longer receiving this therapy at 24 months (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A preliminary study from the Stockholm TNF antagonist follow up registry found that only 44% of patients were still taking their original therapy at 5 years, and 25% were no longer taking any of TNF L antagonist at all (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). While the etiology of RA remains elusive, its believed that unknown antigenic triggers, initiated within the background of genetic, environmental and hormonal influences, initiate a self perpetuating cascade of autoimmune inflammatory responses within synovial compartment (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Specific B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes endothelial cells, fibroblasts play putative roles in this process.</p><p>Recent research indicates that B cell may act at multiple levels of the inflammatory cascade by disrupting antigen presentation by T cells as well as inducing an increased expression of proinflammatory damage observed in RA (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD20+bcells.</p><p>CD20 is an attractive target for B cell depleting therapy because it is stable and highly expressed on B cells but no on stem cells or plasma cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGY</title><p>Eligible patients were hospitalized on Clinic of Rheumatology in University Clinic Centre in Prishtina.</p><p>Patients had RA at least 5 years, according to the ACR 1987 revised criteria (25), and had active disease, which was defined as &#x0003e;8swollen joints(of 66 joints assessed) and&#x0003e; 8 tender joints (of 68 joint assessed), a C reactive protein (CRP)level &#x0003e;16 mg/l or an ESR &#x0003e;28mm/hour, and radiographic evidence of at least 1 joint with a definite erosion.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Average of morning stifness before and after treatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MA-68-51-g001"/></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Percentage of treated patients according to their gender</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MA-68-51-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>3. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION</title><p>Eligible patients had to be taking MTX (10-25 mg week), for at least 12 weeks, with the least 4 weeks at a stable dosage. Patients of I group received intravenous infusions of RTX on days 1 and 15. Patients of 2 group received Etanercept 50 mg divided on two doses (two times a week). Both groups continued to take stable dosages of MTX (10-25 mg) weekly orally and received folate (5 mg/week), intravenous sol. Nacl 0.9%100 ml +Methylprednisolone amp. 100 mg +amp. Synopen 30 min before each infusion and oral Prednisone 60 mg on day 2-7, 30 mg on days 8-14 during 2 weeks.</p><p>Primary efficacy and safety were evaluated at 24 weeks, after 24 weeks patients entered a &#x0201c;post treatment period&#x0201d; and were followed up every 2 months for 18 months, for an overall study duration of 24 months.</p><p>Patients had longstanding (5 years), and active disease as determined by elevated levels of markers of inflammation, DAS 28, Genant modified Sharp radiographic scores and number of swollen and tender joints. A majority of patients in each group (85%)were RF positive. 89% of patients in both groups had received DMARDS other than MTX (Sulfasalazine 2.0 daily, Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg).</p><p>Glucocorticoids most commonly Prednisone and triamcinolone were taken by 61% of the RTX group and 65% of the Etanercept group. Notably at week 24 the swollen and tender joint counts, CRP levels and ERS were significantly decreased in both groups. The CRP level decreased by a mean of 8 mg/l in Rituximab treated patients and 7 mg/l in Etanercept group.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Gender structure of the patients in 1st and 2 nd group (Rituximab and Etanercept)of the patients in 1st and 2 nd group (Rituximab and Etanercept)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MA-68-51-g003"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Pain modality after treatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MA-68-51-g004"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Mean value of inflammatory markers before treatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MA-68-51-g005"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Average age of the sample axaminees</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MA-68-51-g006"/></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Average of stiffness in minutes before and after treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MA-68-51-g007"/></fig><p>ERS decreased by a mean of 18 mm/h in RTX treated patients, compared with decrease of 17 mm/h in Etanercept treated patients. Changes in radiographic end points at week 24 showed less progression of joint damage (joint narrowing, erosions).</p><p>RTX in RA treatment was associated with a mean decrease in RF levels (55%), whereas treatment in Etanercept group with a mean decrease in RF levels (49%).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>4. DISCUSSION</title><p>Overall 88 % of Rituximab treated patients reported no adverse event during treatment. Aes were mild or moderate (two patients during the first infusion had chest pain, fatigue, cough, headache). On ETN group 1 patient had nausea and injection site reaction which develop in 10% of patients (itching, pain, swelling.) In patients who experienced a severe infusion related reaction the infusion was immediately interrupted. After all symptoms disappeared the infusion was restarted at half the rate that had precipitated the reaction.</p><p>There were no reports of tuberculosis or opportunistic infections over the 24 weeks of this evaluation. For patients who experienced an infusion reaction the recommended treatment included acetaminophen /paracetamol plus intramuscular or slow intravenous administration of antihistamine (diphenhydramine HCL)and bronchodilator if indicated.</p><p>Etanercept, recombinant p 75 s TNR: Fc fusion protein</p><p>Has received approval from the US food and Drug Administration for patients with RA who had failed treatment with at least one other drug. The therapeutic effects mediated by Etanercept are rapid and sustained. Combining Etanercept with MTX was found to be safe and more effective than treatment with MTX alone in the treatment of RA.</p><p>Patients received subcutaneous injection of Etanercept 0.25 mg twice weekly for 24 weeks. In our study 13 patients with RA (inadequate response to 1-4 prior DMARDS) were randomized to have at least one of the following: ERS&#x0003e;28mm/h, CRP&#x0003e;16mg/l, morning stiffness at least 45 min. Etanercept produced a significantly greater improvement in all primary and secondary measures of disease activity. The most common Etanercept associated adverse event is injection site reaction, which develop in 37% of patients. This reaction is characterized by development of mild erythema, itching, pain and swelling. The frequency of injection site reaction diminishes with time. In most RA patients these reactions do not necessitate drug discontinuation or require treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. CONCLUSION</title><p>Our results demonstrate that a single course of two 1.000 mg infusions of Rituximab given 2 weeks apart, in combination with glucocorticoids and background MTX, produced significant clinical and functional benefits at 24 weeks in patients with longstanding and active RA who had an inadequate response to nonbiologic DMARDS.</p><p>The therapeutic effects mediated by Etanercept are rapid and sustained. Combining Etanercept with Metothrexate was found to be safe and more effective than treatment with MTX alone in the treatment of RA.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST: NONE DECLARED</bold></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Lange.
