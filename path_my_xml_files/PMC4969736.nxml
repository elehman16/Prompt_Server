Inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) using low-dose eflornithine (DFMO, CPP-1X), combined with maximal PA export using low-dose sulindac, results in greatly reduced levels of normal mucosal PAs. In a clinical trial, this combination (compared with placebo) reduced the 3-year incidence of subsequent high-risk adenomas by &#x0003e;90&#x000a0;%. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is characterized by marked up-regulation of ODC in normal intestinal epithelial and adenoma tissue, and therefore PA reduction might be a potential strategy to control progression of FAP-related intestinal polyposis. CPP FAP-310, a randomized, double-blind, Phase III trial was designed to examine the safety and efficacy of sulindac and DFMO (alone or in combination) for preventing a clinically relevant FAP-related progression event in individuals with FAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eligible adults with FAP will be randomized to: CPP-1X 750&#x000a0;mg and sulindac 150&#x000a0;mg, CPP-1X placebo and sulindac 150&#x000a0;mg, or CPP-1X 750&#x000a0;mg and sulindac placebo once daily for 24&#x000a0;months. Patients will be stratified based on time-to-event prognosis into one of the three treatment arms: best (ie, longest time to first FAP-related event [rectal/pouch polyposis]), intermediate (duodenal polyposis) and worst (pre-colectomy). Stage-specific, &#x0201c;delayed time to&#x0201d; FAP-related events are the primary endpoints. Change in polyp burden (upper and/or lower intestine) is a key secondary endpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The trial is ongoing. As of February 1, 2016, 214 individuals have been screened; 138 eligible subjects have been randomized to three treatment groups at 15 North American sites and 6 European sites. By disease strata, 26, 80 and 32 patients are included for assessment of polyp burden in the rectum/pouch, duodenal polyposis and pre-colectomy groups, respectively. Median age is 40&#x000a0;years; 59&#x000a0;% are men. The most common reasons for screening failure include minimal polyp burden (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22), withdrawal of consent (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) and extensive polyposis requiring immediate surgical intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9).

FAP is characterized by the early onset, usually in adolescence, and gradual development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon, rectum and duodenum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If left untreated there is a nearly 100&#x000a0;% risk of colorectal with an average age of diagnosis of 39&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Prophylactic surgery in young adults, including total colectomy with ileo -rectal anastomosis (IRA), is the mainstay of treatment and mitigates the development of colorectal cancer in most patients. Individuals with extensive rectal involvement usually undergo total proctocolectomy with ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Many such patients develop progressive polyposis in the retained rectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or ileal pouch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite excision of the main at-risk organ(s), many patients develop duodenal adenomas and require frequent surveillance and endoscopic or surgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is particularly problematic in patients with mesenteric desmoids disease. After colectomy, the main causes of morbidity and mortality in FAP are duodenal cancer and desmoid disease. Thus, there is an ongoing unmet need for an effective chemo-preventive option.</p><p>The <italic>APC</italic> gene suppresses the transcription of several oncogenes, including <italic>MYC</italic>, which in turn, regulates the expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). In patients with FAP, ODC enzyme activity and polyamine (PA) levels are markedly increased in the normal colonic mucosa relative to genotype negative family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, PA reduction might be a potential strategy to control the progression of FAP-related colorectal polyposis, and findings from molecular studies provide support for this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In a mouse model of FAP, the combination of eflornithine (difluoromethylornithine [DFMO], CPP-1X) and sulindac or celecoxib non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) led to marked reductions in intestinal tumors compared to each agent alone. Only the DFMO and sulindac combination reduced total intestinal PA contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>This Phase III, 2-year treatment trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel combination therapy in patients with FAP using clinically relevant outcomes such as delay in FAP-related excisional intervention involving the colon, rectum pouch and/or duodenum or delay in progression to more advanced duodenal polyposis, cancer or death.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether CPP-1X/sulindac combination therapy is superior to either given as monotherapy for 24&#x000a0;months among patients with FAP.

A doubling in event-free follow-up over 2&#x000a0;years corresponds to the design effect size, a hazard rate ratio of 0.4243 (ln 0.60)/(ln 0.30).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients randomized to study treatment; safety assessments will be performed on the safety population, which includes all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study drug. Baseline demographic characteristics will include age, gender, and race; clinical characteristics will include disease-related features and laboratory values. Continuous variables will be summarized as means (with SDs) or medians (with ranges), and categorical variables will be presented as frequency distributions and percentages.</p><p>For the primary, time-to-event analysis, a stratified log-rank test will be used, and data will be displayed using the Kaplan-Meier method. If an FAP-related event occurs, that patient will be recorded as having an observed or uncensored event and will be considered a treatment &#x0201c;failure.&#x0201d; Cox proportional hazard regression models will be used for secondary analyses.</p><p>For the between-treatment group comparisons, continuous data will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance, with baseline value, a binary indicator variable for the two highest-risk patient strata, and a binary indicator variable for treatment (combination versus monotherapy) as covariates. Categorical data will be analyzed using chi-square tests and Cochran-Mantel Haenszel tests to reflect the stratified randomization. Ordered categorical data will be analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests.</p><p>For the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29, each single item or multi-item subscale scores will be standardized to a scale of 0&#x02013;100 by applying a linear transformation.

For the EuroQoL EQ-5D, patient preferences (or utilities) will be assessed by determining preference weights among the treatment groups for individual health states, and quality-adjusted survival will be generated by multiplying the utility value by the amount of time spent in a specified health state. The modified version of the Cancer Worry Scale will be administered and scored as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (interim results)</title><p>As of February 1, 2016, 214 individuals have been screened, and 138 eligible subjects have been randomized to one of the three treatment groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

All subjects experiencing an SAE were stratified to the duodenal polyposis group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>FAP is a rare disease (1/10,000) with multiple, major unmet medical needs. The current initial standard of care is prophylactic colectomy or proctocolectomy, followed by regular and lifelong endoscopic evaluation, polypectomies or laser/cautery ablation and additional operations. Controlling the progression of colorectal polyposis burden, minimizing the development of high-grade dysplasia and avoiding interval cancer would provide patients and physicians with the ability to prevent or delay prophylactic surgery in younger patients to a more convenient time. Specific control of rectal polyposis may increase the likelihood that a colectomy with IRA can be performed as the initial procedure. Bowel function, anal incontinence and female fecundity may be improved without the pelvic dissection and ileal pouch required for proctocolectomy.</p><p>Approximately 50&#x000a0;% of patients with retained rectum or ileal pouch develop adenomatous disease requiring frequent endoscopies, polypectomies and ablation. Although cancer is infrequent, regular proctoscopies are inconvenient and increased post-polypectomy scarring can result in loss of compliance, increased stool frequency and increased fecal urgency.</p><p>Duodenal polyposis occurs in &#x0003e;90&#x000a0;% of patients and requires regular surveillance. Both advanced or symptomatic ampullary disease and large duodenal polyps require complex endoscopic and surgical procedures even in the absence of invasive cancer. This problem represents the major source of morbidity and premature mortality in FAP patients.</p><p>The CPP FAP-310 trial combines patients with all three major life-time FAP-related polyposis disease sites: (1) primary colorectal, (2) retained rectum/ileal pouch, and (3) advanced duodenal disease. The major objective of this clinical trial program is to defer or obviate the need for additional surgical interventions in FAP patients. Secondarily, the study will determine treatment effects on HRQoL.</p><p>The development of novel pharmacotherapies that effectively increase the time to FAP-related events are important for controlling the morbidity and mortality associated with this genetic disease. Sulindac has been used &#x0201c;off-label,&#x0201d; particularly to control colorectal polyposis. However, sulindac monotherapy for the treatment of duodenal polyposis has shown little to no efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Celecoxib was approved by the FDA in 1999 as an adjunct to endoscopy to treat FAP based on data from a 6-month trial demonstrating a 28&#x000a0;% reduction in polyp count in a defined segment of the bowel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, because regulatory post-market clinical studies were not completed, and evidence of clinical benefit was not provided, the indication for FAP was removed from celecoxib&#x02019;s product label.</p><p>In a study by Lynch and colleagues, the relative efficacy of combination therapy with DFMO and celecoxib versus celecoxib monotherapy was evaluated in FAP patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this trial, 112 patients were randomized, but only 68 patients were evaluable at 6&#x000a0;months (ie, baseline and 6-month endoscopy data for those who took most of their daily drug dosage by this time point). The study used three key endpoints. The primary endpoint was polyp counts in designated areas (&#x0201c;defined anatomic fields&#x0201d;) of the bowel. Secondary endpoints focused on changes in polyp burden (number and size) as determined using still images and video assessments. In the still images, the number and size of polyps were estimated in the &#x0201c;defined anatomic fields.&#x0201d; Open and closed forceps were used for size estimation. In the video assessment, five independent reviewers evaluated four segments of the colon and rectum, or if post-colectomy, only the rectum. Each segment was evaluated at 6&#x000a0;months and compared with baseline. Grades included: much better, better, the same, worse or much worse.</p><p>The primary endpoint data trend supported the benefit of the combination therapy, but because of the relatively small sample size, the difference was not statistically significant. When comparing polyp counts or burden in pre-defined areas of still photos, DFMO and celecoxib combination therapy was not superior to celecoxib monotherapy. However, when the polyp burden was assessed for the entire colorectum by multiple reviewers of blinded video-endoscopy, the DFMO/celecoxib group showed 93&#x000a0;% improvement and the celecoxib monotherapy group showed 36&#x000a0;% improvement (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). Clinical care and management decisions focus on the entire bowel polyp burden as well on high-risk adenomas (large and/or with high grade dysplasia). No data were presented with regard to high-grade dysplasia.</p><p>The Lynch report provided additional support for the proof-of-principle concept for the current trial; however, there are important differences in the trial designs. First, the previous study was short (ie, 6&#x000a0;months) and included a relatively small number of patients (ie, 68). By contrast, in the CPP FAP-310 trial, patients are receiving CPP-1X and sulindac combination therapy for 24&#x000a0;months, which is critical for determining clinically relevant outcomes. The target sample size is 150 patients, and nearly 95&#x000a0;% of this total is currently enrolled. In the previous study, the primary endpoint of counting polyps in small, designated areas of the colon is not clinically meaningful. The secondary endpoint of changes in global polyp burden is more predictive of clinical benefit.</p><p>In the celecoxib registration trial, patients received 200&#x000a0;mg/day or 800&#x000a0;mg/day celecoxib monotherapy, much higher than the standard NSAID dose. Two patients in the 800-mg group withdrew from the trial owing to an allergic reaction and dyspepsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the Lynch report, patients received 800&#x000a0;mg/day celecoxib. In the celecoxib and placebo group, 20&#x000a0;% (11/55) of patients reported fatigue, 20&#x000a0;% (11/55) experienced mucositis/stomatitis; 10&#x000a0;% (6/55) experienced diarrhea and 10&#x000a0;% (6/55) had nausea/vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the CPP FAP-310 study, the dose of sulindac is one-half that of a standard NSAID dose. For safety reasons, the use of low-dose sulindac is preferred, as the drug regimen is likely to be used for many years by patients with FAP.</p><p>For the CPP FAP-310 trial, the efficacy endpoints are based on specific input received from regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe and are focused on providing &#x0201c;clinically meaningful&#x0201d; results. That is, findings for which the effects of treatment are large and perceived to be of benefit from the patient&#x02019;s perspective. Indeed, avoiding or delaying major excisional interventions as defined in the FAP-310 trial is clearly meaningful to patients.</p><p>In general, the clinical management of FAP is driven by the progression of polyp burden, resulting in &#x0201c;FAP-related events,&#x0201d; as specified by these regulatory agencies. By extension, polyp burden regression is associated with delaying progression and mitigating FAP-related events. A delay in the time to colectomy or proctocolectomy is important to patients. Avoiding major resections of the duodenum greatly reduces morbidity and mortality. Preserving bowel function in the retained rectum or ileal pouch by reducing the need for repeated excisional interventions is an additional unmet medical need. All of these will be evaluated in the CPP FAP-310 trial, setting a precedent for the inclusion of more rigorous, clinically relevant efficacy assessments for this and future FAP trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADR, adverse drug reaction; AE, adverse event; ANCOVA, analysis of covariance; <italic>APC</italic>, <italic>adenomatous polyposis coli</italic> tumor-suppressor gene; BID, twice daily; CI, confidence interval; COX, cyclooxygenase; CPP-1X, eflornithine; DFMO, difluoromethylornithine; EORTC QLQ-C30, European Organization for Research and Treatment Center Quality of Life Questionnaire &#x02013; Core; EORTC QLQ-CR29, European Organization for Research and Treatment Center Quality of Life Questionnaire &#x02013; Colorectal Cancer Module; FAP, familial adenomatous polyposis; GI, gastrointestinal; HRQoL, health-related quality of life; IPAA, ileal-pouch anal anastomosis, InSiGHT, International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumors; IRA, ileo-rectal anastomosis; ITT, intent-to-treat population; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; QD, once daily; SAE, serious adverse event; SD, standard deviation</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12876_2016_494_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Study protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.
