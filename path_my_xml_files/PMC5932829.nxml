Common pathogenic features shared by cardiometabolic diseases are visceral and cardiac adiposity, low-grade inflammation and impaired glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is well known that regular endurance exercise reduces the volume of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and improves glycaemic control, and also overall lowers the risk of cardiometabolic disease substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The underlying mechanisms driving the exercise effects on VAT lipid metabolism are poorly understood, but they may involve the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). During intensive exercise, skeletal muscles secrete IL-6 into the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. IL-6 has been identified as a lipolytic agent, and a single infusion of recombinant human IL-6 at physiological concentrations increases lipolysis and fat oxidation in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This finding was replicated in vitro, with myotubes and adipocytes increasing fat oxidation and lipolysis following IL-6 stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Whether the exercise-induced reductions in VAT are caused by the lipolytic effects of IL-6 or other exercise factors is not known.</p><p id="Par40">Whereas substantial evidence exists regarding the training-induced reductions in VAT, the effect of exercise on cardiac adipose tissue is poorly elucidated. One study has shown that endurance exercise causes a reduction in epicardial adipose tissue thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Yet, it is unknown whether the exercise-mediated reduction in visceral fat is equipotent in epi- and pericardial fat (EAT and PAT, respectively). In addition, whether resistance exercise can similarly reduce EAT and PAT volume is unknown. Furthermore, whether the mechanism driving the possible effects of exercise on EAT and PAT involves IL-6 signalling remains to be investigated.</p><p id="Par41">Despite an extensive amount of research on IL-6 in rodents, it remains to be investigated how repetitive systemic spikes of IL-6 (as seen with exercise) affect glycaemic control in humans. On the basis of studies in mice, it is known that IL-6 improves glucose tolerance through a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-mediated increase in insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In humans, an acute increase in circulating IL-6 improves glycaemic control by delaying the rate of gastric emptying (in press&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). In humans, gastric emptying rate is a critical regulator of glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Yet, it remains to be investigated whether repetitive systemic spikes of muscle-derived IL-6 influence glycaemic control through changes in gastric emptying rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study hypotheses and aims</title><p id="Par42">We hypothesise that endurance exercise plus saline (placebo) is superior in mediating the reduction in visceral, epi- and pericardial adiposity and is superior in delaying gastric emptying compared with endurance exercise plus tocilizumab (IL-6 blocking agent); that is, if the null hypothesis is rejected and there is a difference between the two endurance exercise groups, the alternative hypothesis might be true.</p><p id="Par43">The primary aim of this study is to determine whether blocking IL-6 signalling will ameliorate the endurance exercise-mediated reductions in VAT volume. Secondary aims are to investigate the importance of endurance exercise-induced increases in IL-6 on EAT thickness/area/volume, glucose homeostasis and gastric emptying. Because it is not established if circulating levels of IL-6 are increased in response to resistance training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], it was not within the scope of this study to include a resistance exercise group receiving tocilizumab. However, as a separate distinctive aim, the resistance exercise plus placebo group was included to investigate the effects of resistance exercise vs. endurance exercise on VAT, EAT and glucose homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and study setting</title><p id="Par44">The study is designed as an exploratory, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial consisting of 12&#x000a0;weeks of endurance exercise (E) or no exercise (N) combined with monthly infusions of tocilizumab (T) or placebo (P), resulting in five groups (ET, EP, NT, NP and RP), where RP is a placebo group using resistance exercise rather than endurance exercise.

Participants of same race are chosen in order to limit the effect of racial background on lipid and glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Participants will receive an intravenous infusion of 8&#x000a0;mg/kg (maximal 800&#x000a0;mg) administered every 4&#x000a0;weeks during the 12-week intervention (a total of three times) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We chose to give the maximal recommended dose of tocilizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] because we aimed for maximal suppression of the effects of exercise-induced IL-6 secretion. Tocilizumab is generally well tolerated. Serious adverse reactions are rare but include infections and hypersensitivity reactions. Tocilizumab is purchased via the pharmacy at Rigshospitalet. It is prepared according to the recommendation (8&#x000a0;mg/kg) and diluted in NaCl 0.9% to a total volume of 100&#x000a0;ml. Qualified staff at CFAS are responsible for this procedure. The placebo consists of 100&#x000a0;ml of NaCl 0.9%.

The exercise programme follows current ACSM guidelines for vigorous exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and was chosen because exercise of similar intensity and duration is known to result in IL-6 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and lead to changes in VAT (the primary outcome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Training takes place at the Centre for Physical Activity Research CFAS using TechnoGym equipment (Pedan A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) and software programs which allow monitoring and registration of all exercise sessions. All exercise sessions are supervised. Maximal oxygen consumption rate (VO<sub>2</sub> max) and one-repetition maximum (RM) of two resistance exercises (knee extension and chest press) are determined at baseline and after the intervention for each participant. To control for factors that may influence the effect of the interventions, participants are instructed not to change their lifestyle during the intervention, with the exception of the intervention. A self-reported 3-day dietary intake record is obtained monthly during the intervention period. Furthermore, free-living physical activity is measured monthly using axial accelerometer-based physical activity monitors (AX3; Axivity, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) for a 4-day period. The monthly registrations are undertaken in relation to pre- and mid-testing as well as at post-testing on identical visits and on identical consecutive weekdays throughout the intervention to ensure comparable measurements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Endurance exercise</title><p id="Par49">High-intensity interval endurance exercise is performed on an ergometer bike.

This design was chosen because we are interested in measuring the physiological effect which is not influenced by lack of adherence, unlike the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle (with use of &#x0201c;conservative imputation&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Using the per-protocol design enables us to assess the true experimental effect of the medical and exercise intervention on the primary endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Because non-adherers generally differ from adherers with regard to motivational and prognostic factors, this introduces a bias in the per-protocol design. Yet, this bias is limited because the aim of this study is exploratory, with the aim of assessing the mechanism driving the exercise effects, which requires adherence rather than evaluation of treatment efficacy where differential prognostic factors would confound the effect measures.</p><p id="Par66">Patterns of non-adherence and other missing data will be investigated but will be assumed to be missing at random. In case of high non-adherence, high drop-out rate or skewed drop-out between intervention groups, a third-party biostatistician will perform analyses that adjust for such instances.

However, in contrast to confirmatory trials, the objectives of the exploratory 2TRAIN trial may not lead to simple tests of predefined hypotheses; that is, we will apply a more flexible approach to the statistical interpretation of the findings.

The overall study design is based on five groups (EP, ET, NT, NP and RP), and rather than looking only at the two according to the primary objective, we apply linear modelling based on generalised linear models (GLMs) in the analysis of the primary outcome. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models will be performed, which produces several diagnostic measures, provides contrasts and estimates for customised hypothesis tests, and it provides tests for means adjusted for covariates (e.g., least squares [LS] means adjusted for baseline variables). The GLM procedure handles models relating a continuous dependent variable to one or several independent variables. The independent variables can be either classification variables, which divide the observations into discrete groups (e.g., EP, ET, NT, NP and RP), or continuous variables (e.g., the level at baseline). We will analyse continuous outcomes using ANCOVA models, with a fixed factor for group (five levels) and adjust for the value at baseline. For each continuous outcome variable (after performing the overall ANCOVA model [five-group comparison]), we will obtain the <italic>P</italic> value and group contrast for the difference between the LS means: ET vs. EP (in analogy to a two-sample <italic>t</italic> test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]), independent of what the overall ANCOVA model indicates. Also, results following the ANCOVA model will be expressed as estimates of the group difference in the various pairwise comparisons (including ET vs. EP) in the changes from baseline, with 95% CIs to represent the precision of the estimates. To assess the adequacy of the linear models describing the observed data, as well as to check the assumptions for the systematic and random parts of the models, we will investigate the model features via the predicted values and the residuals; that is, the residuals have to be normally distributed (around 0) and be independent of the predicted values.</p><p id="Par71">All reported <italic>P</italic> values will be two-sided and will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons (despite having ten potential tests for each outcome variable [5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;{5&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1}/2]).

We anticipate the results to provide insight into the role of IL-6 in exercise-mediated changes in VAT, EAT and PAT and glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, we hope to gain valuable insight related to the exercise modalities that can be translated into efficient exercise programmes for subjects with increased risk for metabolic diseases. Understanding how exercise and IL-6 regulate VAT, EAT and PAT volumes and glucose homeostasis may inform novel therapeutic approaches in the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases.</p><p id="Par77">The study is a randomised controlled trial, and both participants and primary investigators are blinded with respect to the medical intervention of tocilizumab and the outcome assessments. It is not possible to blind participants with respect to the exercise intervention, and this may introduce a bias. To limit this bias, participants are urged not to change their lifestyle during the intervention, except from what they are randomised to, because this would potentially influence the outcomes of the intervention. The eating habits and activity levels of the participants are regularly assessed by use of dietary records and axial accelerometer-based physical activity monitors. It is important to acknowledge that the resistance and endurance exercise protocols are matched only in duration. This is a limitation which should be kept in mind when interpreting the effects of the different exercise modalities. To compare the intensity of the different exercise modalities, we ask the participants to wear a heart rate monitor during both resistance and endurance exercise sessions. Exercise intensity is determined by percentage of VO<sub>2</sub> max, and not by the peak power output, in line with previous studies by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Helgerud et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] previously showed VO<sub>2</sub> max to increase in response to high-intensity interval exercise training. Therefore, we believe that adjustment of exercise intensity according to percentage of VO<sub>2</sub> max accurately ensures high exercise intensities throughout the intervention in this study. In addition, the supervised nature of the exercise protocol will ensure participant adherence and intensity and thereby improve the homogeneity of each intervention. The measurement of the primary outcome by MRI follows the gold standard and will enable accurate estimations of changes in the VAT, EAT and PAT depots.</p><p id="Par78">The study includes five intervention groups (ET, EP, NT, NP and RP), and the endurance exercise groups with and without tocilizumab (ET vs. EP) are of primary interest.
