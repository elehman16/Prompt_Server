stroke patients&#x02019; upper extremity function and activities of daily living (ADL). [Subjects
and Methods] In this study, 29 stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups: an
experimental group (n=14) and a control group (n=15). The experimental group performed 10
minutes of mental practice once a day, 5 days a week for 2 weeks in combination with
conventional rehabilitation therapy. For the control group, general rehabilitation therapy
was provided during the same sessions as the experimental group. The Action Research Arm
Test (ARAT) and the Fugl-Myer assessment (FMA) were used to measure upper extremity
function, and the Modified Bathel Index (MBI) was used to measure daily activity
performance. [Results] After the intervention, the mental practice group showed
significant improvements in upper extremity function on the affected side and ADL scores
compared to the control group. [Conclusion] The results of this study demonstrate mental
practice intervention is effective at improving stroke patients&#x02019; upper extremity function
and daily activity performance. In follow-up studies, securing a greater number of
experimental subjects, and evaluation of the intervention&#x02019;s therapeutic durability are
required.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mental practice</kwd><kwd>Upper function</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is an illness causing disability due to an interruption in the blood supply to the
brain or a hemorrhage in the brain tissue caused by cerebrovascular disease, cardiac
disorder, or diabetes. As a cause of hemiparalysis, it is one of the leading causes of
functional limitation and disability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Functional disability of stroke patients shows different aspects depending on the area and
scope of damage, and it is commonly accompanied by various disabilities such as motor
disturbance, sense disturbance, cognitive disorders, and speech disorder<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Especially in hemiplegic stroke patients, serious disabilities arise in the upper and lower
extremities of one side. Quality of life markedly declines as daily activities become
limited due to asymmetrical walking patterns, decrease in walking speed, and lack of fine
motor skills of synkinesis in the upper extremity caused by increase in muscle tension of
the damaged side and decreased muscle strength<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, general rehabilitation training for hemiplegic stroke
patients focuses on functional improvement and strengthening of the muscles in the upper and
lower extremities of the damaged side.</p><p>For the improvement of upper and lower functions, physical therapy and occuptional therapy
provide training for muscle and functional improvement and fine motor. However, for most
patients, such rehabilitation training has many constraints of time, place, and expense.
Accordingly, in recent studies, clinical methods, such as mental practice for improvement of
the upper and lower functions, have been suggested<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mental practice is a method of learning motor skills and enhancing performance by means of
imagining movements in the head without moving the body<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, mental practice intervention, as a method of learning and
enhancing motor skills, have been introduced to such diverse fields as sports psychology,
cognitive psychology, and medical science<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The merits of this intervention are that the patient&#x02019;s concentration
and motivation can be enhanced without regard to time or place, and that training is
possible without expensive equipment<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
recent study reported that in a comparison of neuroscience actual performance of particular
motor tasks and imagining the movements, the brain region activated when the two tasks were
performed and the degrees of activation were similar<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In many of the recent studies of mental practice, improvements in various areas of upper
extremity function and daily activity performance of hemiplegic stroke patients have been
reported; however, since these studies lacked a control group or had a small number of
subjects, it is difficult to generalize their results. Also, the duration of therapy, number
of applications, and treatment times of each session varied across the studies, making it
difficult to decide how to apply therapy in general clinical situations<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hence, this study evaluated the effects of mental practice performed in combination with
conventional rehabilitation therapy on hemiplegic stroke patients over a duration of time
suitable for general clinical situations: 10 minutes once a day, 5 days a week, for 2
weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects for this study were 29 patients who were receiving hospital treatment for
hemiplegia at I Hospital and K Hospital in Korea. The subjects were chosen from among
volunteer patients who understood the objectives and content of this study and showed an
intent to actively participate in this study. All the subjects and their guardians agreed to
participation in the experiment and they provided written informed consent prior to their
participation in the study in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The general selection criteria of the subjects for this study were as follows: hemiplegia
for over 6 months; scores of over 24 points on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State
Examination; average scores below 2.26 in the movement imagery mental test; no communication
problems; hemineglect; or hearing or vision disorders. Additionally, subjects were only
included if, under conditions of pronation, and flexing of the wrist, they could display
function of at least 20&#x000b0; extension of the wrist, and at least 10&#x000b0; extension of the
metacarpophalangeal joint, while being able to hold and put down an object with the affected
side.</p><p>The general characteristics of the subjects are noted in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mental practice</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CON</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (Male/Female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11/4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60&#x000b1;10.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58&#x000b1;11.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Onset (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18&#x000b1;11.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16&#x000b1;11.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paretic side (Right/Left)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11/4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Continuous variables are shown as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).

experimental and control groups. The experimental group received conventional occupational
therapy for 20 minutes per session, once a day, 5 times a week, for 2 weeks, and carried out
mental practice for 10 minutes at the start of each session. The control group received
conventional occupational therapy and physical therapy 30 minutes per session, once a day, 5
times a week, for 2 weeks.</p><p>Mental practice was conducted in an occupational therapy room with a quiet atmosphere,
while the subjects&#x02019; physical and psychological states were stable in order to maintain the
subjects&#x02019; attention and concentration. All the training programs were 10 minutes in length
and were recorded in advance. The programs used in training were: turning a page, putting
beans, and stacking plastic cups.</p><p>The mental training comprised 3 stages: first, the preparation stage for mental practice;
then, the training stage according to the actual task; and lastly, the organizing stage for
mental practice training. In the preparation stage, to maintain psychological stability,
muscle relaxation training was performed for 2 minutes, and the actual task imagination and
training were performed for 6 minutes. The final mental practice training, the organizing
stage, was performed for 2 minutes in order to elicit psychological stability by inducing
return to reality.</p><p>This study had a pre- and post-test with control group design for an intervention of 2
weeks. Using clinical measures, pre- and post-test measurements were obtained one day before
and after the training.</p><p>Functional movements of the upper extremities were assessed using clinical measures, the
Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE)
section. The Fugl-Myer assessment is a performance-based measure and one of the most widely
used clinical assessments of upper extremity motor impairment; it is also disease-specific.
It measures 3 independent impairments balance, sensation, and voluntary movement of the
upper and lower extremities. All items are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0
to 2. This study used the FMA-UE section, which have a maximum possible score of 66<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The inter-rater reliability of the upper
limb section has been reported to range from 0.96 to 0.97, and the test-retest reliability
of the upper limb section has been reported to be 0.97 in chronic stroke survivors<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ARAT is a criterion-referred
assessment for evaluating specific changes in upper limb function after cortical damage. It
consists of 19 items divided into 4 subscales measuring functional movements, such as grip,
pinch, grasp, and gross movement. The performance of each item is rated on a 4-point scale,
ranging from 0 to 3, with 57 as the maximum obtainable score. For post-hemiplegic stroke
patients, the inter- and intra-rater reliabilities have both been reported to be 0.99<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects&#x02019; ADL was measured using the
Modified Barthel Index (MBI). The MBI is designed to measure the degree of independence of
subjects&#x02019; ADL and consists of a total of 15 specific ADL motions.</p><p>SPSS ver. 18.0 was used to calculate the means and standard deviations. Descriptive
statistics were used to analyze the general subject characteristics. Using the independent t
test, differences in upper function scores between the 2 groups were investigated. In all
analyses, significance was accepted at values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of upper extremity function and ADL of each group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Mental practice</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">CON</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARAT*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.7&#x000b1;9.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.5&#x000b1;9.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.1&#x000b1;9.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.0&#x000b1;9.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FMA-UE*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42.0&#x000b1;7.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.5&#x000b1;8.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.8&#x000b1;10.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.7&#x000b1;10.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MBI*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.3&#x000b1;12.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.7&#x000b1;12.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.2&#x000b1;12.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.2&#x000b1;12.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All variables are shown as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).

application of mental practice for stroke patients, to select proper protocols for mental
practice intervention that are easily applicable in general clinical situations from among
the various mental practice protocols which have elicited improved upper extremity function,
and to verify them.</p><p>The subjects of this study performed mental practice for 10 minutes, once a day, 5 times a
week, for 2 weeks, in combination with general rehabilitation therapy. Our results are in
agreement with Page et al., who showed there were improvements in upper extremity function
when mental practice training protocols were performed by stroke patients<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. They also support the results of Page et
al., who noted that the improvements in upper extremity function were enhanced when
conventional neurological rehabilitation therapy and mental training were conducted in
combination for stroke patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
this study, there were significant improvements not only in improved upper extremity
function, but also in daily activity performance of the mental training subjects. This
agrees with study results of Muller et al., who reported improvement of daily activity
performance after mental training<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In terms of therapy duration, frequency, and time, this study observed significant
improvements in upper extremity function of the subjects after performance of 10 minute
sessions, once a day, 5 times a week, for 2 weeks. However, Choi et al. conducted mental
training for 5 minutes per session, 6 times for 6 days, and reported that there was almost
no improvement effect on upper extremity function<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Apart from their study, most other studies which have reported
significant improvements in upper extremity function after mental training, mostly conducted
for a period of over 2 but less than 6 weeks, at frequencies of therapy of 3 to 5 times a
week, with treatment times ranging from 10 minutes to 3 hours per session<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. When implementing mental training for
improved upper extremity function, we suggest the optimal therapy mode is 10 minutes of
therapy time, 5 times a week for 2 weeks, as performed in this study</p><p>Limitations of this study include difficulty in generalizing the results of this study to
all stroke patients because of the small number of subjects in this study, and the lack of
assessment of long-term maintenance effects. Future studies should recruit greater numbers
of subjects and perform a follow-up evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sharp</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Brouwer</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Isokinetic strength training of the hemiparetic knee:
