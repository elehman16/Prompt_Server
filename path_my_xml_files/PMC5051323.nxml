<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and the abridged methods are reported here. The study was a cluster randomised controlled trial in 28 primary schools in urban Changzhi, Northern China. From each school, we selected one class in grade 5 (age &#x02248;10&#x02005;years). From each class, we randomly selected 10 children who met the inclusion criteria.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> From each child's family, we also enrolled two adults.

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The salt reduction education was delivered to the whole class in spite of only 10 children being selected for assessment. Children were asked to deliver the salt reduction message to the families, particularly children needed to persuade the persons who did the cooking to reduce the amount of salt used during food preparation at home. The duration of the intervention was one school term (&#x02248;3.5&#x02005;months).

First, the study for the first time has measured iodine intake using repeat 24&#x02005;hour urine collections in a large number of primary schoolchildren and their families in northern China. A conservative estimate showed that the median baseline iodine intake was 165&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day in children and 281&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day in adults. These intakes are adequate. According to the Chinese Nutrition Society's guideline, EAR (ie, daily intake meeting the requirement of one-half of the population) is 65&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day in children aged 7&#x02013;10&#x02005;years and 85&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day in adults, and recommended nutrient intake (RNI, ie, intake meeting the requirement of 97&#x02013;98% of the population) is 90&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day in children aged 7&#x02013;10 and 120&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day in adults.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The median iodine intakes in our study were 254% and 331% of EAR and 183% and 234% of RNI for children and adults, respectively. Additionally, the median iodine intakes were far below the UL of 300&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day in children and 600&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011168F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016011168F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Mean salt, median iodine intake and their 95% CIs in children (A) and adults (B). EAR, estimated average requirement; RNI, recommended nutrient intake; UL, tolerable upper limit.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016011168f01"/></fig><p>Second, our study is the first to have studied the effect of salt reduction, as currently recommended, on iodine status in a population where salt is universally iodised. The mean effect was a reduction in salt intake of 1.9&#x02005;g/day in children and 2.9&#x02005;g/day in adults which led to a decrease in iodine intake of 19.3% and 11.4% in children and adults, respectively. These mean effects represent the differences between the intervention and control group in the changes in salt and iodine from baseline to the end of the trial. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011168TB1">table 1</xref>, during the study, salt and iodine intake decreased in the intervention group and increased in the control group. If applying the mean reduction in iodine level (19.3% in children and 11.4% in adults) to all participants irrespective of their group allocation, the average iodine intake would be 133&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/day in children and 249&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/day in adults after salt reduction. These iodine levels are still adequate, and 205% and 293% of EAR and 148% and 208% of RNI for children and adults, respectively.</p><p>In our study, all 24&#x02005;hour urine collections were carefully supervised with the start and finish time recorded by trained research staff. It is certain that there was no over-collection. However, it is difficult to know whether there was any under-collection. Although the participants who admitted to having missed urine voids were asked to re-do 24&#x02005;hour urine collections, it is still possible that some participants did not report missing urine collection. Excluding potential incomplete 24&#x02005;hour urine collections, as expected, led to a slightly higher salt and iodine intake for baseline and end trial, and for the intervention and the control group. It is therefore likely that our main results have under-estimated the average salt and iodine intake of the study population. However, this is unlikely to alter the primary outcome, that is, the difference between the intervention and control group. Indeed, various sensitivity analyses have shown consistent findings (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> 2).</p><p>In Changzhi where our study was carried out, the iodine content in salt varied from 18 to 33&#x02005;mg/kg in 2013 (data were provided by the local salt manufacturer). Based on the iodine content in salt and the 24&#x02005;hour urinary sodium and iodine excretion, we estimated that &#x02248;80% of iodine in the diet was from iodised salt. The changes in 24&#x02005;hour urinary iodine observed in our study is consistent with that predicted from the changes in salt intake (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> 4). Therefore, any potential influence from other dietary sources would be small.</p><p>Despite 24&#x02005;hour urinary iodine is the most reliable biochemical marker for assessing iodine status, almost all previous surveys on iodine have used spot urine due to the apparent logistic challenges and costs in collecting 24&#x02005;hour urine. The WHO also endorsed the use of spot urine and provided cut-offs of median spot urinary iodine concentration to categorise population's iodine status.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, this has been inappropriately used by previous surveys to define the number of individuals who were iodine deficient.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our study demonstrates that, in the group of individuals classified as iodine deficient according to the WHO's criteria based on urinary iodine concentration, the median 24&#x02005;hour urinary iodine levels were well above EAR. These findings clearly illustrate the inappropriateness of spot urine in monitoring iodine status, and as a result, previous surveys would have over-estimated the prevalence of iodine deficiency. It is worth noting that our study did not collect spot urine; however, 24&#x02005;hour urinary iodine concentration is a better index than any of the spot urine iodine concentration (eg, casual, first morning void). Additionally, our study shows that it is entirely feasible to collect 24&#x02005;hour urine not only in adults but also in primary schoolchildren. The WHO has recommended 24&#x02005;hour urine collections for determining and monitoring population salt intake.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It will be more efficient and highly cost-effective if the iodine intake is monitored in the same population surveys using the same methods.</p><p>In China, since the introduction of universal salt iodisation in 1995, regular surveys using casual spot urine have been carried out to monitor the population's iodine status and adjust the iodine content in salt accordingly.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The surveys were largely conducted in primary schoolchildren aged 8&#x02013;10 because these children are readily accessible in schools and they have been assumed to have iodine intakes characteristic of general populations. At country level, the median spot urinary iodine in schoolchildren aged 8&#x02013;10 increased from 165&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/L in 1995 to over 300&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/L by 1999 and declined to 241 and 246&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/L in 2002 and 2005, respectively.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This was in parallel with the changes of iodine content in salt which increased from 16.2&#x02005;mg/kg in 1995 to 42.3&#x02005;mg/kg in 1999, then declined to 30.8&#x02005;mg/kg in 2005 and has remained at this level.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These changes reflect the alterations of the standard for &#x02018;qualified&#x02019; iodised salt set by the Chinese Ministry of Health.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Initially the regulation for iodine content was &#x02265;20&#x02005;mg/kg in 1995. As there was no upper limit, most salt producers tended to iodise salt with iodine over 40&#x02005;mg/kg. In 1997, an upper limit of 60&#x02005;mg/kg was set. National iodine survey at the time indicated an excessive population iodine intake and such data led to a reduction in the upper limit from 60 to 50&#x02005;mg/kg in 2002. The standard of 35&#x000b1;15 (or 20&#x02013;50)&#x02005;mg/kg had remained until 2012 when provinces were allowed to choose from the three standards, that is, 20 (14&#x02013;26), 25 (18&#x02013;33) and 30 (21&#x02013;39)&#x02005;mg/kg, depending on local diet and spot urinary iodine concentration.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>In our study site&#x02014;Changzhi, the changes in urinary iodine followed a similar pattern to that occurred nationally although some of the surveys showed a higher iodine level. The most recent survey in Changzhi was carried out in 2010 and showed that the median spot urinary iodine was 241, 284 and 310&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/L in schoolchildren aged 8, 9 and 10, respectively.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In our study which was performed in 2013, the median baseline 24&#x02005;hour urinary iodine concentration was 215.8&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/L for schoolchildren aged &#x02248;10&#x02005;years. The lower iodine level observed in our study could be largely due to the decrease in iodine content in salt following the change in the standard for iodised salt (ie, from 20&#x02013;50 to 18&#x02013;33&#x02005;mg/kg) in 2012.</p><p>Despite our study was carried out in Changzhi and included individuals who mainly ate home-made meals, the results could be broadly applicable to most parts of China for the following reasons: (1) universal salt iodisation is mandatory in China, and the food manufacturers and restaurants also use iodised salt; (2) the iodine content in salt (18&#x02013;33&#x02005;mg/kg) in Changzhi is similar to the national level (14&#x02013;39&#x02005;mg/kg);<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and (3) salt is the major source of iodine in the diet across China. Although there is a variation in iodine level from natural sources such as water and foods, iodised salt contributes to 60&#x02013;80% of total iodine intake in most parts of China.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In Changzhi where our study was carried out, iodised salt accounts for &#x02248;80% of iodine intake (ie, at the higher end of the range in China). The iodine intake in our study population was still adequate after an approximate 25% reduction in salt intake for 3.5&#x02005;months; it is therefore most likely that the same reduction in salt if achieved across China would not compromise iodine status. The findings of our study, however, may not be generalisable to populations in other countries due to a number of features in the setting, such as universal salt iodisation and high contribution of discretionary salt to total salt intake in the Chinese diet.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study demonstrates that in northern China where universal salt iodisation is mandatory, a reduction in salt intake by &#x02248;25% which is close to the WHO's target of 30% reduction by 2025 does not compromise iodine status as measured by repeat 24&#x02005;hour urinary iodine excretion in children and adults. These findings provide strong support for the WHO's recommendations to reduce population salt intake to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and to improve iodine intake by fortifying salt with iodine to prevent iodine deficiency.</p><p>Currently many countries have started salt reduction initiatives and also implemented salt iodisation programmes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, there is a lack of coordination between the two. To maximise the benefits, there is an urgent need for close coordination and collaboration, particularly in disseminating consistent messages and monitoring population salt and iodine intake using the same methods which will provide valuable data required for appropriate adjustment of the iodine level in salt after population salt intake is reduced. This will be the most cost-effective way in implementing the two important public health policies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Peter Sever, Francesco Cappuccio, Kiang Liu and Dong Zhao for their support and advice; the Changzhi Education Bureau, the head teachers and teachers of all participating schools, and children and their families who were involved in the research; all members of the field research team, particularly Jianhui Yuan, Yanbo Han, Peifen Duan, Zhifang Li, Jianbing Zhang, Cailing Wei, Yanli Zhai, Ruikai Zhu, Hui Yang and Xiaoyun Wang; Jun Ma, Haijun Wang, Yide Yang and Xiaorui Shang for their contribution and help with the development of the education materials; Yina Sun, Yan Ye and Yongmei Li for their contribution to the measurement of urinary iodine.
