An alternate analogy - win with the chin - or simple anatomic instructions may perform better.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Randomized controlled study comparing different instructions for enabling novices to adequately position a simulator mannequin's head and neck. Study volunteers included medical students and PGY1 residents in surgery and internal medicine. Subjects independently positioned a mannequin based upon their understanding of four randomly-assigned written instructions for: the sniffing position; the win with the chin analogy; anatomic instructions; and no instructions (control). Digital photographs following each instruction were analyzed by two airway experts for adequacy of overall positioning, and for the three components of airway positioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 81 volunteers. The positioning was adequate most often (43.2%) following the win with the chin analogy as compared with the other instructions (37.0% anatomic instructions; 19.8% control; 14.8% sniffing position analogy). Positioning following the sniffing position instructions was not different from no instruction (<italic>P </italic>= 0.53). The win with the chin and anatomic instructions were better than no instructions (<italic>P </italic>= 0.002 and <italic>P </italic>= 0.023, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The win with the chin analogy resulted in adequate airway positioning significantly more often than the sniffing position or control, and maintained atlanto-occipital extension when compared with providing anatomic instructions. Overall, win with the chin was a superior teaching analogy and could replace the sniffing position analogy.</p></sec></body></article>
