Fortnightly telephone calls from a Bengali worker followed, to reinforce advice and set new targets.

By contrast, the dietitian-led intervention which identified the sources of salt in the Bangladeshi diet and developed strategies to lower intake, achieved a reduction in dietary salt intake of over 100&#x02005;mmol/d. While mean urinary sodium excretion still remained well above the UK target of 100&#x02005;mmol/day,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> postintervention group results were more similar to those seen in the UK white population. This reduction in salt intake led to a highly significant fall of 8/3&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg in BP; very close to the figure predicted by meta-analyses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>The dietary approach used has also been shown to be effective in BP reduction with other ethnic groups with high dietary salt intakes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Behavioural intervention studies have previously demonstrated that knowledge is a key contributing factor to adherence to low-salt diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> and that lack of knowledge is a key barrier in dietary modification and adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> However, knowledge of the need to reduce dietary salt intake is not always enough to ensure dietary modification and adherence. This study shows that knowledge tailored to recipients&#x02019; needs and contexts, delivered in a practical and acceptable manner, can effect behavioural change and achieve health benefits.</p><p>Our previous studies showed that Bangladeshi patients with CKD have much higher intakes of salt than the general population, with much of the salt being added during home preparation of food rather than during processing, as is the case in the general population. Consequently, routine advice for salt reduction designed for predominantly white European populations was not appropriate for this group of patients, for whom the engagement of family members was crucial. This was particularly relevant for these study participants, who almost exclusively ate home-prepared meals in family groups.</p><p>We noted that over half of the Bangladeshi patients with CKD had raised BP throughout the day and night: the &#x02018;non-dipping&#x02019; effect. Previously &#x02018;non-dipping&#x02019; prevalence has been found to increase with worsening CKD, with 15% of normal subjects affected increasing to 75% in those with stage five CKD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Non-dipping has been associated with increased target-organ damage (heart, brain, kidney),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20 R21 R22">20&#x02013;22</xref> raised frequency of stroke and myocardial infarction,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> and higher cardiovascular mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Decreased salt intake and urinary sodium excretion led to greater reduction in night-time SBP compared with daytime, and the restoration of the normal physiological night-time dip in BP in many patients. In black salt-sensitive patients with hypertension salt restriction improved the circadian rhythm of BP with a return to dipping pattern.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Our study confirmed that salt reduction can change the pattern from &#x02018;non-dipper&#x02019; to &#x02018;dipper&#x02019;, and a recent review has concluded that the South Asian population is salt sensitive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> A return to a &#x02018;dipping&#x02019; BP pattern may lead to a significant reduction in the risk of vascular events for this patient group but long-term follow-up is required to demonstrate this.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Data supporting our findings were reported by MacGregor <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> who demonstrated that when urinary sodium excretion dropped by 100&#x02005;mmol/24&#x02005;h, subjects supine BP declined by 8/5&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg (p&#x0003c;0.01); a sodium reduction of 150&#x02005;mmol/24&#x02005;h led to a larger decline of 16/9&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg. Similarly, a modest salt reduction of 50&#x02005;mmol/24&#x02005;h (from a much lower baseline than in our participants: an average of 177&#x02005;mmol/24&#x02005;h) resulted in 7/3&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg drop in BP in a randomised trial in older people.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> A recent meta-analysis of 17 trials in hypertensive individuals over &#x02265;4&#x02005;weeks supports the approximate magnitude of this effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> A recent study of modest dietary sodium restriction in patients receiving ACE medicines showed 11mm&#x02005; Hg reduction in SBP in non-diabetic nephropathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Our study confirms this magnitude of association between reduction in sodium excretion and BP values. Moreover, our study is the first study to our knowledge of a population with CKD with traditionally high salt intake and hypertension with a follow-up period of 6&#x02005;months suggestive of sustained benefit in the tailored intervention approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strength of this study is that it delivered an effective salt reduction dietary intervention for this group of patients, and demonstrated participants&#x02019; adherence to dietary advice through 24&#x02005;h urinary sodium excretion. However, only single 24&#x02005;h urine collections and 24&#x02005;h ambulatory BP recordings were made. Further, treatment allocation could not be blinded. Therefore, ambulatory BP readings were analysed centrally in the hypertension unit by a statistician who was blinded to the treatment allocation<bold><italic>.</italic></bold> Hence the results were relatively less likely subject to bias. It remains uncertain whether reducing BP may translate into slowing of disease progression or reduction in cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Applicability and generalisability</title><p>The Bangladeshi population and indeed the South Asian group are known for a high dietary salt intake, are at a high risk of CKD and thus, hypertension development. Dietary salt reduction can safely and usefully be extended to other family members who may in time also be at risk of developing hypertension. Other ethnic groups with a high prevalence of CKD and hypertension, such as black African and Afro-Caribbean populations, may also benefit from tailored dietary interventions to reduce salt intake.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates the importance of tailoring dietary advice to patients&#x02019; contexts, cultures and needs, particularly for minority and high-risk groups. Healthcare professionals need education and training in methods to enable them to translate generic principles of healthy living and health promotion in such a way as to successfully deliver education and promote its application in the daily lives of their patients. Policy makers need to recognise the importance of resourcing complementary approaches to medication for effective BP control. An integrated approach, drawing on multiple successful approaches to hypertension reduction, offers the best option for BP management in patients with CKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="loca-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media xlink:href="heartjnl-2013-303688-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e704" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This is an original work that has not been published before and is not under consideration in any other journal.
