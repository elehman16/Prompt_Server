In recent years, several avian viruses have crossed the species barrier and directly infected humans, presenting a possible pandemic threat. One of these is avian influenza H5N1 virus, which has a mortality rate of more than 50% in the 600 laboratory-confirmed human cases reported by WHO since 2003 <xref rid="pone.0059674-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Current seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines rely on predicted antigens based on the previous season's circulating viruses, and do not allow for the sudden antigenic shift that leads to a pandemic; moreover development of a specific vaccine against a new pandemic virus takes time. Efforts are now focussed on the search for a universal influenza vaccine that can confer broad and long-lasting protection to all types of influenza.</p><p>Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is an intranasally administered vaccine, designed to induce an immune response resembling infection with wild-type influenza without causing disease <xref rid="pone.0059674-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Compared to conventional intramuscular inactivated vaccines (IIV), LAIV is believed to induce mucosal antibody responses and cellular immunity <xref rid="pone.0059674-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Moreover, LAIV can induce responses to antigenically mismatched influenza A strains <xref rid="pone.0059674-Ambrose1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It has been well documented that heterologous prime boost vaccination elicits high-magnitude, broad-based and long-lasting immunity in several different animal and disease models <xref rid="pone.0059674-Verrier1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0059674-McConkey1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0059674-Gomez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Recent work in mice, ferrets and monkeys demonstrated that a prime boost strategy of a DNA vaccine followed by seasonal IIV conferred protection against a range of influenza viruses by inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies against the stem cell region of the haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein <xref rid="pone.0059674-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>We describe here a pilot feasibility study designed to test the hypothesis that heterologous prime-boost immunization of healthy humans with seasonal trivalent LAIV and IIV would induce evidence of <italic>in vitro</italic> cross-protection against non-vaccine influenza viruses such as avian H5N1 and pandemic 2009 H1N1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) IRB (FWA00000015) and governed by ICH GCP guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Design</title><p>This was a randomized, open-label, pilot feasibility study of four two-dose vaccine regimens using two commercially available trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines to compare immune responses and <italic>in vitro</italic> cross-reactivity against avian H5N1 and pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses.

All subjects gave written informed consent prior to study participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Location</title><p>All vaccine doses were administered at the US Embassy Medical Unit, Bangkok, Thailand. Other clinical activities were conducted either at the US Embassy Medical Unit, Bangkok and/or the Department of Immunology and Medicine, AFRIMS, Bangkok.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Clinical Methods</title><p>Vaccine administration. The vaccines used were FluMist&#x000ae; intranasal live, attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccine (dose 0.1 mL per nostril, supplied by MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD); and Fluzone&#x000ae; inactivated influenza virus (IIV) vaccine (dose 0.5 mL intramuscularly, purchased in Thailand from Sanofi-Pasteur). Both vaccines contained the three strains for the 2009/10 northern hemisphere season: A/South Dakota/6/2007 (H1N1) (an A/Brisbane/59/2007-like), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) (an A/Brisbane/10/2007-like), and B/Brisbane/60/2008. Enrolled subjects were allocated consecutively numbered sealed envelopes containing one of four vaccine regimens: homologous prime boost regimen 1 (Group 1): LAIV two doses separated by 8 weeks (&#x000b1;7 days), n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5; homologous prime boost regimen 2 (Group 2): IIV two doses separated by 8 weeks (&#x000b1;7 days), n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5; heterologous prime boost regimen 1 (Group 3), LAIV single dose, followed by IIV single dose 8 weeks (&#x000b1;7 days) later, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8; heterologous prime boost regimen 2 (Group 4): IIV single dose followed by LAIV single dose 8 weeks (&#x000b1;7 days) later, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8. The randomization code was computer-generated and the key maintained by a research nurse independent from the study team.</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Antibody and cellular responses were measured in blood and following nasal irrigation with 20 ml warmed 0.9% saline two and four weeks after each vaccine dose and compared with baseline values. Blood for serum separation was collected in SST (Serum Separation Tube with clot activator and gel). For peripheral blood mononuclear cells, blood was collected in heparinized tubes and cells separated by histoplaque using Leucosep tubes. Serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. All laboratory staff were blinded as to allocation of vaccine regimens until the study database was locked.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Adverse event (AE) reporting</title><p>Because the current recommendation for healthy adults is to receive a single dose of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine, and because of a lack of published data on the safety of two doses in adults, detailed safety data was collected for the duration of this study. All subjects were asked to complete a Symptom Diary daily for 14 days following each dose of vaccine. All AEs that were reported and all concomitant medication used, whether or not attributed or related to vaccine administration, were recorded from the time of first phlebotomy until the end of study participation. AEs were documented individually, not by syndrome, and classified according to MedDRA&#x000ae; (the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities), which is international medical terminology developed under the auspices of the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. Each AE was described by its duration, an assessment of causality (vaccine, coexisting disease, due to concomitant medication, or others), relationship to vaccine (not related, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely), and whether specific therapy was required. The subject and investigator made an assessment of severity for each reported AE as follows: mild (self-limiting or minor symptoms that did not affect activities of daily living and did not require treatment); moderate (symptoms that required treatment in order to carry out activities of daily living); and severe (symptoms preventing activities of daily living and requiring out-patient treatment).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Laboratory Methods</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay</title><p>Sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme and subsequently heat-inactivated. The haemagglutination inhibition assay was performed by WHO standard methods using 8 HA units of influenza virus.

After 1&#x02013;2 h incubation at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO2, the mixtures were added to a pre-formed monolayer of MDCK cells and the plates were incubated for another 18 hours. MDCK monolayers were then washed with PBS and fixed in cold 80% acetone for 10 min. The presence of viral protein was detected by ELISA using a monoclonal antibody to the influenza A nucleoprotein (NP). The second antibody conjugated with peroxidase was added and incubated for another 1 h. Plates were washed, and specific enzyme substrate added. The reactions were stopped with 1 N sulphuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm. The average A490 was determined for quadruplicate wells of virus-infected (VC) and &#x02013;uninfected (CC) control wells, and a neutralizing endpoint determined by using a 50% specific signal calculation. The endpoint titre was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum with A490 value less than X, where X&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;[(average A490 of VC wells) - (average A490 of CC wells)]/2+(average A490 of CC wells).

Two of the 5 subjects who received 2 doses of IIV (Group 2) complained of more severe pain at the injection site following Dose 2 than following Dose 1 even though Dose 2 was administered into the other arm. The two heterologous prime boost regimens were not associated with any excess of reported AEs compared to the homologous prime boost regimens although the numbers in all groups are very small. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in this trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first prospective study in humans to test the hypothesis that prime boost regimens of seasonal influenza vaccine can be used to elicit production of sub-heterotypic antibodies. Our findings show that both homologous and heterologous prime boost immunization did not enhance serum HI and NT titres to 2009 pH1N1 and avian H5N1 as compared to a single dose of vaccine. Interestingly the increase of NT titres to both viruses was observed in subjects who had pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies at baseline; this supports previously reported findings <xref rid="pone.0059674-Gioia1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The observations provide more evidence that generation of cross-reactive antibodies are derived from activation of cross-reactive memory B-cells that recognize conserved epitopes in multiple influenza strains <xref rid="pone.0059674-Corti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0059674-Wrammert1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, this type of immunological response seems to be sporadic and may be influenced by genetic and/or viral factors. Several additional subjects, including one with a high baseline H5pp response, failed to enhance antibody titres further following seasonal vaccination. More work is needed to understand the complex factors involved in generation of cross-reactive antibody responses in given individuals.</p><p>Unlike IIV, LAIV induced modest serum antibody responses in all subjects regardless of whether LAIV was used as a prime or as a boost. These observations are in line with previous reports, which demonstrated modest serum HI titres after LAIV nasal vaccination <xref rid="pone.0059674-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0059674-Nakaya1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The biological mechanisms for protective immunity elicited by LAIV are believed to involve a local immune response in the lung via mucosal antibodies and T-cell responses <xref rid="pone.0059674-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recent reports have suggested a role for memory B cells localised to the lung conferring protection against disease <xref rid="pone.0059674-Onodera1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Neuraminidase activity is required for the release of newly budded virus from the infected cell surface. Studies in humans suggest that antibody to influenza neuraminidase is associated with resistance to clinical disease <xref rid="pone.0059674-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0059674-Monto1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In this study, serum NI titres against H5N1 and 2009 pH1N1 increased significantly in heterologous prime boost Group 3 (LAIV-IIV). However, it would be premature to draw conclusions from this since the sample size in this study was very small and more subjects in this group had detectable antibodies at baseline than in other groups.</p><p>Our findings confirm the efficacy of single dose trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in conferring robust antibody responses against vaccine viruses in healthy adults. The addition of a second (booster) dose in either homologous regimen (Groups 1 and 2) conferred no demonstrable benefit. Reassuringly the addition of the second dose had no impact on adverse event reporting in this group of healthy adults. The only observation of note was that 2 of 5 subjects in Group 2 complained of more intense pain following the second dose of IIV. A similar finding was observed in a study of healthy children aged 5&#x02013;8 years <xref rid="pone.0059674-NeuzilKM1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> where a significantly higher proportion of subjects reported pain following the second dose. Both prime boost regimens were also well tolerated with no excess of AEs after the second dose, including IIV given as Dose 2.</p><p>Both IIV and LAIV elicited recall CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses against vaccine antigens as detected by ICS staining of IFN-g and IL-2. In agreement with previous findings <xref rid="pone.0059674-Gioia1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>

<xref rid="pone.0059674-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> we detected pre-existing cross-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells specific to NP derived from 2009 pH1N1 and H5N1. The increases in cross-reactive T-cell responses were observed in some subjects but the prime boost vaccination regimen did not appear to result in superior cross-reactive T- cell responses. Unlike in the mouse model <xref rid="pone.0059674-Yap1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0059674-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0059674-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> the role of cross-reactive T-cells in protecting against influenza has not been well described in humans. A recent human challenge study with influenza demonstrated that pre-existing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to conserved NP and matrix protein could reduce severe illness in the absence of specific antibodies <xref rid="pone.0059674-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. One could speculate that cross-reactive T-cells may mediate heterosubtypic immunity in humans as well. Further studies are required to support this hypothesis.</p><p>This study was a pilot feasibility study and as such had a number of important limitations. Firstly the sample sizes are small and therefore unlikely to detect subtle trends or immunological responses generated in just a small proportion of subjects. The small size was off-set by having a relatively highly vaccinated group of subjects, with a high proportion of females, both of which were considered to increase the chances that favourable immunological responses would be observed <xref rid="pone.0059674-Eick1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0059674-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Secondly the study took place during the initial stages of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which had just reached Bangkok at the time the study commenced. Although none of the subjects developing cross-protective responses to pH1N1 2009 during the course of the study gave a history of influenza-like illness, it remains a possibility that the observed responses against pH1N1 2009 were in fact influenced by <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to natural disease. Even if this is the case, it cannot explain the robust serum antibody response to H5N1 observed in the single subject from Group 3. Finally the lack of good correlates of protection generated by LAIV discussed above may mean that we missed a cross-protective effect afforded by this vaccine given either as prime or boost.</p><p>Despite the fact that broad immune responses indicating significant cross-protection against pH1N1 2009 and avian H5N1 influenza viruses were not observed in the majority of prime boost recipients, <italic>in vitro</italic> cross-protection against one or other virus assessed by HI and/or NT was observed in several individuals; moreover most subjects developed detectable responses on NI assay and some developed cross-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against nucleoprotein, These results lend support to the current recommendation for administration of seasonal influenza vaccine at the outset of an influenza pandemic. Such a strategy may afford some protection to a sub-set of individuals, particularly those with a degree of pre-existing immunity. Our data support the administration a single dose of trivalent seasonal vaccine to those individuals at risk of disease who have not previously received that season's recommended seasonal influenza vaccine; however, based on our preliminary findings we do not have enough evidence to recommend administration of a second (prime boost) dose. Even if progression to clinical or severe disease is prevented in only a minority of recipients, seasonal influenza vaccine administration at the outset of a pandemic could represent a cost-effective public health strategy and buy valuable time while a specific vaccine is being developed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0059674.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Individual and geometric mean serum assay results against seasonal influenza A/H1N1 vaccine virus in 26 healthy human volunteers measured at baseline and two weeks following each dose of prime boost seasonal influenza vaccination (2 doses administered 8 weeks apart).
