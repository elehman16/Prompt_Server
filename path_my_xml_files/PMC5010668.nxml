The aim of this study has been to evaluate whether a course in cardiovascular nursing (CVN) can improve ambulance nurses&#x02019; (ANs&#x02019;) prehospital care of patients experiencing suspected ACS, related to pain intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial that was conducted in the ambulance services. Patients were allocated to one of two groups: in the first group, patients were treated by ANs who had attended the CVN course and in the second group patients were treated by ANs without this qualification. Inclusion criteria were: 1/pain raising suspicion of ACS, and 2/pain score &#x02265;4 on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The primary outcome was the estimated intensity of pain or discomfort according to VAS 15&#x000a0;min after randomisation. Secondary outcomes were estimated intensity of pain or discomfort on admission to hospital and further requirement of pain treatment, as well as symptoms such as paleness and/or cold sweat; nausea and/or vomiting; anxiety, dyspnea, degree of alertness, respiratory depression and aggressiveness. A further secondary outcome measured was survival to 30&#x000a0;days. Lastly, a final diagnosis was made. A total of 38 ANs attended the CVN course. There were 1,747 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The pain score did not differ significantly between the two groups fifteen minutes after randomisation (median value of VAS was 4.0 in both groups). On admission to hospital the pain score was significantly lower for patients treated by an AN who had attended the CVN course (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;332) compared with those treated by an AN who had not attended the course (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,415) (median 2.5 and 3.0 respectively, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001). The ANs who had attended the course used higher doses of morphine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>An educational intervention with a CVN course did not relate significantly to more efficient pain relief in suspected ACS during the first 15&#x000a0;min. However, this intervention was associated with more effective pain relief later on in the prehospital setting. Thus, a CVN course for ANs appears to be associated with reduced pain intensity among patients experiencing suspected ACS. This result needs however to be confirmed in further trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System (registration number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00792181?term=NCT00792181&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00792181</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acute coronary syndrome</kwd><kwd>Pain treatment</kwd><kwd>Lifeworld</kwd><kwd>Educational intervention</kwd><kwd>Ambulance services</kwd><kwd>Ambulance nurse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Bor&#x000e5;s</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Regional Executive Board, Region V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Sparbanksstiftelsen Sjuh&#x000e4;rad</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a common term used to describe a group of conditions resulting from acute myocardial ischemia (i.e. insufficient blood flow to heart muscle) and ranging from unstable angina pectoris to myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Acute myocardial infarction may present less typical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, pain or discomfort in the chest is one of the most common symptoms among patients calling the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Treatment of pain while caring for patients experiencing myocardial infarction is of paramount importance, not only for humane reasons but because the pain is associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system that leads to vasoconstriction and intensifies the work of the heart.</p><p>The influence of nursing care on chest pain intensity in patients experiencing suspected ACS is an unexplored area in the ambulance services, especially research focusing on the ambulance nurses&#x02019; (ANs&#x02019;) assessment and treatment of pain. There is a gap in knowledge regarding the assessment of pain, as well as of anxiety. These are aspects of the illness that are as important as the myocardial damage. The intensity of pain in ACS is a major healthcare interest since coronary heart disease is one of the most common causes of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There is a growing epidemic of coronary heart disease in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In many countries, cardiovascular disease causes more than twice as many deaths as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Nurses strive to provide direct contact with and care for the patient, and to relieve patients&#x02019; stress and anxiety through assessment, diagnosis and counselling. The ANs describe their care as focusing on the patient&#x02019;s physical disorder while simultaneously taking her/his lifeworld into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This care approach meets the criterion of encountering patients with openness and flexibility, based on the patients&#x02019; own experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to current understanding of patients with acute myocardial infarction, effective communication is a key aspect of the clinician-patient relationship in prehospital care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The relationship with the AN gives patients the feeling of being in a caring presence with gradually increasing comfort and hope of survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In the emergency department, the role of the registered nurse (RN) is assumed to be central to the provision of nursing care for patients with myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. RNs&#x02019; communication skills are vital to providing adequate pain and anxiety management. The role of nurses in a chest pain unit is reported to be vital when it comes to contributing to the relief of patients experiencing chest pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A similarly positive impact for patients with ACS has been shown in the coronary care unit regarding nurse-led early triage of chest pain patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>However, knowledge is insufficient concerning ANs&#x02019; importance in the prehospital setting for optimal pain treatment in cases of ACS. The ambulance services should be considered not only as a mode of transport but also as a place for initial diagnosis, triage and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to evaluate whether a course in CVN improves ANs&#x02019; prehospital care of patients experiencing suspected ACS, related to pain intensity. According to this aim, the following hypothesis was formulated: &#x0201c;ANs who had attended a CVN course treated patients differently from those who had not attended a CVN course, regarding pain relief for patients experiencing suspected ACS.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research design and setting</title><p>A cluster randomised, controlled trial (RCT) was used involving an educational intervention for ANs. The patients included in the study were divided into two groups: A/those treated by an AN who had attended the CVN course (=educational intervention) and B/those who were treated by an AN without this qualification (=standard education), i.e. a control group.</p><p>In the EMS and the prehospital setting the procedure worked out in the following way: when the ambulance came to the patient with suspected ACS the ambulance staff included an AN with or without the CVN qualification. This meant in practice that if the AN had the CVN qualification, the patients belonged to the intervention group, while if the AN did not have the CVN qualification, they belonged to the control group. Thus the ANs&#x02019; qualification determined to which cluster the patient was allocated. Regardless of group allocation, and with the patients&#x02019; written informed consent, they were then randomised by an envelope method to treatment with midazolam or not. The primary results regarding midazolam were reported together with a consort flow diagram in Wireklint Sundstr&#x000f6;m et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The study setting was the EMS system in Western Sweden and in the city of Halmstad (six ambulance services and 1.5 million inhabitants).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The characteristics of participants</title><p>Patients were included in the study if they complained of pain or discomfort that aroused suspicion of ACS and if they reported pain &#x02265;4 on a visual analogue scale (VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. That the requirement for reported pain stipulated a level of at least 4 was because of a decision to exclude patients with less severe pain in order to focus on patients who were expected with certainty to require pain relief treatment.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: 1/Systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;mmHg, 2/age &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years, 3/under the influence of alcohol, 4/under the influence of drugs, 5/benzodiazepine abuse, 6/dementia, disorientation, 7/communication problems, 8/symptoms judged as being caused by trauma and 9/secondary transports (i.e. treatment already started).</p><p>This study used patients&#x02019; outcomes to measure the effect of the CVN course for ANs. The entrance criteria for ANs were an RN qualification and a Bachelor of Science Degree. In Sweden there are two levels of AN working in the EMS: 1) RNs (Bachelor of Science Degree) and 2) RNs in Specialist Nursing, Prehospital Emergency Care (specialist course, i.e. one-year Master of Science Degree) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Both groups (intervention and control) included ANs with the two possible education levels, but nobody had ever undergone the CVN course before. No prior power analysis was performed.</p><p>The study involved about 500 ANs, 60 ambulances and one ambulance boat. All the ambulances were staffed with at least one AN. The CVN courses ran from August 2007 to December 2009 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Three courses took place, attended by a total of 38 ANs. The RCT started on 1 May 2008. The last patient was recruited on 31 December 2010. All in all, 1,747 patients took part in the study.

The CVN was a course including caring assessment and treatment, as well as clinical cardiology focusing on patients with ACS. This education was expected to deepen the ANs&#x02019; knowledge and increase their possibilities of relieving and treating chest pain and anxiety as well as providing cardiovascular treatment. A lifeworld approach (which refers to Edmund Husserl&#x02019;s philosophy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] allowed caring and medicine to be applied simultaneously in a natural way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

However, there are a number of secondary outcome findings that suggest a connection between treatment allocation and outcome. These results should however be regarded as hypothesis-generating, since they all deal with secondary outcomes, and therefore need to be confirmed in further studies.</p><p>The results show that ANs who had attended the CVN course gave significantly higher doses of morphine (i.e. average 1&#x000a0;mg more morphine) compared to ANs without this qualification. This is important, especially since there were no significant differences in demographics, previous history or cardiopulmonary findings between the two groups. Despite this, the ANs who had attended the CVN course showed the courage to use their knowledge in pain treatment with morphine in line with earlier recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, the CVN course, although not associated with pain relief during the first 15&#x000a0;min, might improve patients&#x02019; pain relief in a prolonged perspective. These findings are exclusive for the ambulance services and harmonise with three earlier studies from the ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. With regard to intensive care nurses it is urgently necessary to reinforce their pain education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We emphasise that national consultation is needed concerning guidelines preparing RNs for patient care when it comes to therapy for patients with ACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. According to a European survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] there is variability in the content, teaching, learning and evaluation methods in post-registration cardiovascular nurse education programmes in Europe. The emphasis on interdisciplinary education that will foster more effective teamwork across multidisciplinary teams can offer many potential benefits. Pain relief should be approached using a holistic, systematic and evidence-based model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>In compliance with earlier studies we highlight the fact that healthcare providers can influence the outcome for patients with ACS by providing skilled, efficient, and coordinated prehospital care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and we also stress the need of both pain and anxiety relief in line with Frazier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>We found that ANs who had completed the CVN course reported patients&#x02019; anxiety at the time of randomisation with significantly greater frequency. One reasonable connection to education and training in cardiovascular nursing might be that improved knowledge of nursing care for patients with suspected ACS has increased the RNs&#x02019; awareness of and ability to recognise symptoms and signs of ACS. Therefore these results are in line with earlier studies that have noticed the need for management of anxiety after acute myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and that vulnerability and feelings of anxiety constitute a well-known experience for patients experiencing an acute myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>However, the present results are not sufficiently satisfactory on all points. Only 23&#x000a0;% and 14&#x000a0;% respectively of the patients were free from pain on admission to hospital (shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). These are remarkably poor results, especially when related to recommendations in the American Heart Association guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] for pain relief with the use of morphine in prehospital treatment. Inadequate analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] is still an issue in the prehospital setting of acute chest pain.</p><p>Our findings suggest that more education and training in cardiovascular nursing are utterly essential in order to meet patients&#x02019; need for and right to pain treatment and pain relief when ACS is suspected by the ambulance services, and also in order to meet new demands on professional development for ANs. It is likely that this type of education needs to be reinforced and intensified even further.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The present study is to our knowledge unique with regard to the lifeworld and interdisciplinary approach towards ACS with its endeavour to develop an understanding of the possible connections between ANs having attended the CVN course and patients&#x02019; estimated intensity of pain in the prehospital setting. We argue that this approach is a strength.</p><p>One limitation might be that both groups of nurses consisted of both RNs with only a Bachelor of Science Degree and RNs with this degree and also with a specialist Master&#x02019;s Degree. This means that theoretically, knowledge in Caring Science/Nursing varied in both groups. Another possibly more realistic limitation might be that before the course we did not measure the attitudes and opinions of the ANs involved concerning pain treatment with morphine, nor their overall interest in caring for these patients and patients experiencing from ACS. Perhaps there was a selection bias because the nurses who applied to the CVN course already had a positive attitude to pain treatment and caring for this patient group.</p><p>Finally, achieving a high rate of reliability must be regarded as problematical when there are many persons involved in the collection of data. Thus, involving several hundred RNs opens up the situation for deficiencies in implementation. The ambulance services are moreover a field that is inexperienced with regard to research. Taken all together, there are a number of circumstances that might lead to lack of reliability. We must take note of the fact that there is a risk of low reliability in this and other equivalent studies. The data in this study is also too limited to be able to function as a basis for a discussion about generalisability. These results should therefore solely be regarded as hypothesis-generating.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An educational intervention was not shown to relate significantly to the primary outcome of patients scoring lower on the VAS pain scale after 15&#x000a0;min. Thus, patients with estimated intensity of pain &#x02265;4 raising suspicion of ACS and treated by an AN who had recently completed the CVN course did not have less pain during the first 15&#x000a0;min after the ambulance&#x02019;s arrival on scene. However, our data suggests that such an intervention was connected to more effective pain relief later on but still in the prehospital setting.</p><p>This study underlines the ANs&#x02019; potential for assisting patients to experience less pain and achieve relief of symptoms despite illness deriving from ACS. Therefore, the results should encourage increased investments in the education of ANs whose work brings them into close contact with these patients. Further studies should be carried out for additional confirmation of the results found in the present trial and to identify factors associated with the prehospital care provided.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACS</term><def><p>Acute coronary syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AN</term><def><p>Ambulance nurse</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVN</term><def><p>Cardiovascular nursing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p>Electro cardiogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMS</term><def><p>Emergency medical services</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RN</term><def><p>Registered nurse</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the EMS organisations and their personnel in the Region of V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland and in the city of Halmstad, Sweden.
