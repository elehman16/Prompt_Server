To achieve this goal, highly skilled staffs are needed to serve in prehospital settings for critically ill and injured patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In the paramount conditions, Endotracheal Intubation (ETI) has 30% failure rate in prehospital settings by non-physicians.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although ETI is an optimal and lifesaving procedure for securing the airway,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] there are some limitations for using it in prehospital settings. The most important ones are that ETI, based on accepted guidelines,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] should be performed only by expert, skillful and current personnel like practitioners or paramedics; however, in most of the emergency settings, especially in suburban and rural areas, we lack such staffs due to financial crises. Furthermore, in some situations such as trauma patients, ETI should be done by paralyzing the patient to prevent the head movement or gag reflexes or laryngeal spasm. Using drugs in this area is prohibited for Emergency Medical Technician-Basic (EMT-B) and Emergency Medical Technician-Intermediate and controversial for paramedics. Because the intubation failure rate is relatively high, continual and multiple intubation attempts are associated highly with respiratory problems.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Finally, intubation is a time consuming and technically difficult procedure, which makes it unfeasible in some situations such as trauma patients suffering from bleeding.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>All the above mentioned problems cause a quarter of the prehospital patients encounter several complications during ETI such as misplacement of the tube, unsuccessful intubation and more than four times of laryngoscopy.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Therefore, we decided to evaluate if EMT care providers can use other options instead of ETI with lesser complications.</p><p>The two most available options with successful previous usage are laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and combitube, which has been used for several years by anesthesiologists.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The aim of this study was to compare success rate of insertion between Combitube, LMA, and ETI after enough instruction and training of healthcare staff with different degrees of professional experience. We used a manikin model to determine how groups of an emergency team with no previous airway management experience and background can perform these procedures in the prehospital settings compared with the skilled ones.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study method</title><p>The study was conducted in Tabriz Red Crescent Emergency Department. This project was approved by the human investigation committee of Tabriz University School of Medicine with consent waiver. Without explanation of the scenario to the participants, they were randomly assigned first to use one of the three devices. The selected equipment was arranged next to the manikin, within easy reach. The participants performing the airway management were given no assistance, and both the participants and examiners were blinded to the hypotheses of the project.</p><p>A 6.5 mm outside diameter (OD) non-cuffed endotracheal tube (Mallinckrodt, St Louis, MO), a Macintosh three laryngoscope blade and handle, a size 4 classic LMA (LMA of North America, San Diego, CA), a Combitube SA 41 F (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA), the lubricating gel, and finally, a Laerdal Airway Management Trainer (Laerdal Medical, Pucheim, Germany) were provided. All devices were used according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>No more than one attempt was permitted for insertion of the device, after which the procedure was considered to be failed. The time taken to secure the airway with the device was measured from the time the participant starting the procedure to the time they could effectively ventilate the manikin. The successful ventilation was defined as the complete and equal inflation of the both manikin's lungs using ambo bag attached to the end of device and checked by attending physicians. The unsuccessful procedure was defined as (a) taking more than 60 seconds to secure airway, (b) no ventilation, (c) esophageal intubation, and (d) no lung's inflation.</p><p>After the participants successfully secured the airway, the procedure was repeated by using the alternative device. At the conclusion of the trial, the participants were asked which of the three devices they preferred.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>The participants were randomly assigned from 200 volunteers, without considering work history, into two groups of experienced (<italic>n</italic> = 24) and inexperienced (<italic>n</italic> = 35). Experienced group included 16 paramedics, eight anesthetic technicians, and inexperienced group included 27 EMT-B and eight nurses.</p><p>The paramedics had attended the emergency courses for 2 years and had performed at least 25 intubations correctly. In Iran, the paramedics are approved for placing LMA, Combitube, and ETI unsupervised in the prehospital setting.</p><p>The EMT-B had not used these devices before and their curriculum, similar to other countries, consists of basic life-support training for at least 176 hours. In our country, nurses, similar to EMT-B personnel, does not have any previous experience of intubation and are not allowed to secure the airway.</p><p>To make EMT-B and nurses familiar with intubation devices, emergency medicine attending physicians administered a 2-hour training session with lectures and hands-on time with LMA, Combitube, and ETI 1 day prior to the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Because our data were not normally distributed, nonparametric statistical analysis was used for ordinal data. Categorical data such as success rate for insertions were changed to numbers and analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Descriptive statistics are also reported. Data were analyzed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software (SPSS version 14.0, SSPS Inc., Chicago) with a statistical significance set at the 0.05 level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The LMA, and Combitube insertion, and ETI were each attempted by 59 participants.

In our study, all participants from different levels of the health care system inserted the Combitube and LMA in a short time and high success rate. In fact, only by few hours of training and learning, all the groups were successful.</p><p>The success rate for insertion of the Combitube in the present study was higher than for the ETI. This result confirms other studies.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, Wahlen <italic>et al</italic>., presented that Combitube has higher risk of failure; it is difficult for na&#x000ef;ve participants and require time to insert.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In our manikin study, no one was unsuccessful inserting Combitube. The successful insertion of the Combitube in manikins has been reported almost without failure,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but in patients, it has been reported differently, such as 74%,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] 91.4%.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The differences between manikin and human are the major limitations of every manikin study.</p><p>Although subcutaneous emphysema and lacerations of the esophagus by using Combitube have been reported in a small number of cases,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Combitube is still the favorite device. It is shown that Combitube prevents from the aspiration in 93% of the cases.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] One can use it blindly and without a laryngoscope. The lack of requirement for direct visualization is an important advantageous in these situations. Therefore, Combitube is well-designed to be used in the difficult situations.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, in agreement with other studies,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] the mean of time to insertion of the Combitube was lower compared to the ETI. That's another considerable value of Combitube to save the time in emergency situations. LMA has similarly similar benefits of Combitube, except that it does not prevent from gastric aspiration.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Rumball <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] the same as our study, showed that Combitube is the most preferred device by a majority of emergency medical team.</p><p>Similar to other studies,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] anesthetic technicians did not insert Combitube faster than the other groups. This can be explained by the fact that Combitube is not the first choice in clinical anesthesia, and they do not practice it frequently, or insertion of it does not need any special experience.</p><p>In our study, the level of education only affected the success number of ETI. Anesthetics and paramedics, practicing this method frequently, were more successful as opposed to other two groups. However, no correlation was seen between groups with different experiences in the successful insertion of the LMA and Combitube. Trabold <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported no difference between different groups in the number of successful insertions of Combitube and ETI.</p><p>The ETI has different success rate between studies.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The different types of manikins and different setups can be the reason, but success rate of LMA and Combitube have always been high regardless of the setup or manikin's type.</p><p>Furthermore, there was no meaningful relation between participants and median time of insertion of one of the devices. This finding was also in accordance with others.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] This means that in spite the fact that different levels of experience have an impact on success rate of ETI intubation, there is no correlation between time to insertion of this device and different participants.</p><p>There is an unclear necessity to refresh one's learning of Combitube or LMA insertion.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] However, this is obvious for ETI, because of the deterioration in skills.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>Overall, total procedures in our study were done in a shorter time compared with other studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] This finding may be attributed to different start points. In our study, the initial time was defined as the interval between the time of handling the device and at the end of the insertion of the device. This initial and end time of the study could be different in other studies. In addition, this difference can be due to the use of different types of manikins.</p><p>Paramedics generally perform ETI few times a year and they cannot perform intubation in difficult situations. They are allowed to intubate only in respiratory arrest or low level of consciousness. Using devices such as LMA or Combitube that do not need any direct observation is a reasonable solution. On the other hand, lack of array of skilled personnel to intubate the airway in prehospital settings has lead to problems. In these settings and in situations where there is no access to paramedics and only the EMT-B personnel are available, or situations in which the nurse staff has exposure to the patients that need airway management, the LMA or Combitube are useful alternatives. These devices are easy-to-learn, easy-to-use, fast, and successful for anyone.</p><p>Based on our data, performing ETI is suggested to be used only by skilled and qualified medical team.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has several limitations. We used manikins for our study. The Manikin has several characteristics that may not reflect the reality. For example, in our study, we did not include airway trauma, vomiting, and airway secretions, which often occur in clinical situations. Studies have shown that training on manikin for LMA insertion is as effective as live patient training.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] However, there are many differences between human body and manikin. Therefore, comparing devices on manikin may not be directly applicable to clinical settings. Controlled clinical studies of these data in the prehospital setting need to be executed to confirm our hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Airway management time decreased and success rate increased significantly with the use of LMA and Combitube compared with ETI, regardless of the experience level. This study suggests that both Combitube and LMA may be acceptable choices for managing the airway in the pre-hospital setting for both experienced and particularly inexperienced EMS personnel.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank all the participants of our hospital who participated in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> No.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Garner</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rashford</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bartolacci</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Addition of physicians to paramedic helicopter services decreases blunt trauma mortality</article-title><source>Aust N Z J Surg</source><year>1999</year><volume>69</volume><fpage>697</fpage><lpage>701</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10527344</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sanson</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Di Bartolomeo</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Nardi</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Albanese</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Diani</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Raffin</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Road traffic accidents with vehicular entrapment: Incidence of major injuries and need for advanced life support</article-title><source>Eur J Emerg Med</source><year>1999</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>285</fpage><lpage>91</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10646914</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Winchell</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoyt</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Endotracheal intubation in the field improves survival in patients with severe head injury.
