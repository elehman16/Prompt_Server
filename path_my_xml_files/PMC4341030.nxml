fractures are common in the elderly population. To avoid the
poor outcome of internal fixation and for early mobilization,
hemiarthroplasty is performed. However, there is inadequate
evidence to support the choice between unipolar or bipolar
hemiarthroplasty. The aim of this study was to compare the
outcome of unipolar with the bipolar prosthesis in geriatric
patients. Methods: Forty-one patients above 60 years of age
and an acute displaced fracture of the femoral neck were
randomly allocated to treatment by either unipolar or bipolar
hemiarthroplasty, in the Department of Orthopaedics,
between September 2009 and October 2012. Functional
outcome was assessed and compared using Harris hip score
and radiological parameters with a follow-up of one year.
Results: The two groups of patients with mean age of 67.3 in
bipolar group and 75.6 in unipolar group did not differ in
their pre-injury characteristics and perioperative parameters.
The mean Harris hip score in bipolar and unipolar groups
was 86.18&#x000b1;12.18 and 79.79&#x000b1;15.55, respectively (p=0.183);
range of motion was 210.63&#x000b1;28.39 and 181.58&#x000b1;37(p=0.015)
with bipolar and unipolar groups, respectively. Functional
activities were better in the bipolar group. Complications
like painful hip, posterior dislocation, periprosthetic fracture
and acetabular erosion were encountered in unipolar
prostheses. Conclusion: The use of bipolar endoprosthesis in
the management of displaced femoral neck fractures in the
elderly was associated with better mean Harris hip score and
incidence of complications was limited. Hence, bipolar
would be a better option in elderly patients with fracture
neck of femur.</p><sec id="st1"><title>Key Words</title><p>Unipolar; Bipolar; Hemiarthroplasty</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fracture of the hip is a common injury. With increasing life
expectancy worldwide, the number of elderly individuals is
increasing, and it is estimated that the incidence of hip
fracture will rise from 1.66 million in 1990 to 6.26 million by
2050. According to the Swedish National Hip Fracture
Register, intracapsular fractures of the femoral neck constitute 53% of all hip fractures with 33% undisplaced and
67% displaced<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>The rationale for operative treatment by means of internal
fixation is to reduce the risk of secondary displacement from
undisplaced and displaced fractures, and to maintain fracture
reduction for displaced fractures. The main reasons for the
failing of internal fixation are avascular necrosis and nonunion.
Failure of internal fixation leads to a re-intervention
rate of 35% with decreased function and increased morbidity
as demonstrated by a meta-analysis by Lu Yao <xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>Replacement of the femoral head and neck with a prosthesis
offers a way to prevent complications of internal fixation and
is therefore an attractive alternative in the elderly patient<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.
There is however no consensus on how to treat patients with
a displaced intracapsular fracture between sixty and eighty
years of age. It is because of the poor clinical results that the
displaced intracapsular fracture is referred to as "the
unsolved fracture"<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>Moore and Bohlman<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> after removal of a giant cell tumor of
the femoral head, introduced hemiarthroplasty in 1940. Since
then it has also been used for the treatment of displaced
femoral neck fractures. It had the following features: solid
polished unipolar head with a collared, straight, fenestrated
stem designed for non-cemented use.</p><p>The development of bipolar hemiarthroplasty was based on
the clinical experience with limited success of unipolar
prosthesis due to progressive acetabular erosion and
protrusion.</p><p>Based on Charnley&#x02019;s pioneering arthroplasty principles, two
bipolar designs emerged in the early 1970&#x02019;s: the Bateman
and the Gilberty prostheses.</p><p>This is a prospective randomized study of the short-term
results of hemiarthoplasty using Austin Moore unipolar
prosthesis and bipolar prosthesis.</p><p>Outcomes at six weeks, three months, six months and 12
months were analyzed and compared using Modified Harris
hip score and radiographs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>The present study is of intracapsular fracture neck of femur
in elderly patients above the age of 60 years, irrespective of
gender, treated with hemiarthroplasty using uncemented
unipolar Austin Moore&#x02019;s prosthesis (AMP) in 20 patients and
bipolar endoprosthesis in 21 patients, in the Department of
Orthopaedics at Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences
(KIMS), Bangalore, selected on the basis of purposive
sampling (judgment sampling) method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). All
implants used were manufactured by Inor Medical Products,
Mumbai, India. All the patients were walking normally
before injury.</p><p>All patients were operated through a southern approach, and
received antibiotics and venous thromboembolism
prophylaxis. Postoperatively, full weight bearing was
allowed with the help of physiotherapists as per their
compliance. The patients were assessed preoperatively and
post operatively based on Harris hip score at intervals of six
weeks, three months, six months and one year. Sequential
radiographs were compared to assess diminishing joint
space, acetabular erosion, proximal migration and protrusion
of the acetabulum. Loosening, subsidence and angular shift
of the femoral stem were also assessed on these radiographs
Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were carried
out in the present study with Student t test (two tailed,
independent), inter group analysis on metric parameters.
Chi-square/ Fisher Exact test were used to find the
significance of study parameters on categorical scale
between two or more groups. Ethical clearance was obtained
from our institutional ethics committee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Patients who had unipolar prostheses were comparatively
older to those with bipolar prostheses (75.5 vs. 67.3,
P&#x0003c;0.01). Females constituted 65.8%. Mortality rate was
statistically similar in both groups, due to age related factors
(p=0.663). Mean length hospital stay was similar in both
groups (p=0.894).</p><p>All cases were analyzed based on the Harris hip score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">Table I</xref>). The total score was tabulated and graded as excellent,
good, fair, poor and failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">Table II</xref>).</p><p>Most of the complications were recorded with the unipolar
group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T3">Table III</xref>). All cases, one (4.7%) in the unipolar group
presented with posterior dislocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) on the 8th
post operative day, for which closed reduction was done
under GA and immobilized for one and half months and
there after mobilized successfully. Another case (4.7%) of
unipolar group presented with periprosthetic fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) after three months following trauma, which was managed
with open reduction and internal fixation with plate and
screws retaining the same prosthesis. The patient was mobilized after two months and he continued to have thigh
pain. A case of acetabular erosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) was noted in the
unipolar group. A single case of superficial infection was
recorded in each group, which responded to antibiotics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Comparison between 21 cases of bipolar hemiarthroplasty
and 20 cases of Austin-Moore prosthetic replacement for
femoral neck fractures in elderly patients over a one year
period has shown that patients with bipolar prostheses had
better functional outcomes in terms of range of motion,
ability to use public transport and ability to cut toe nails.
Mean Harris hip score was better with the bipolar group.</p><p>Lunceford Jr7 felt that the pain following hemiarthroplasty
should not be the reason for condemning the procedure. He
listed the following causes for pain: infection, improper
prosthetic seating, metallic corrosion and tissue reaction,
improper sized femoral head, contractures, periarticular
ossification, toggle or acetabular wandering and redundant
ligamentum teres.</p><p>Limping is a common consequence of hemiarthroplasty in
adults. Alteration in the abductor mechanism due to a
marginally greater excision of neck is the most probable
cause<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>Cornell et al<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> reported that patients with bipolar prosthesis
did better on walk tests and had better range of motion at six
months. Sabnis and Brenkel10 reported 14 % unipolar
patients walking unaided compared to 54% of bipolar
patients walking unaided.</p><p>Yamagata et al<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, in their classical study, reviewed 1001 cases
of hip hemiarthroplasty. There were 682 unipolar and 319
bipolar cases. Patients undergoing bipolar arthroplasty
exhibited higher hip scores and lower acetabular erosion
rates compared to the unipolar replacement.</p><p>Lestrange<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> reviewed 496 patients with bipolar replacement
for displaced femoral neck fractures and compared them
with patients having fixed-head prosthesis. He found that the
bipolar prosthesis offered advantages over one-piece designs
in terms of stability, decreased acetabular erosion and
improved function.</p><p>D&#x02019;Arcy and Devas<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> reported incidence of dislocation
following prosthetic replacement ranging from 0.3% and
10%.</p><p>Dislocation following hemiarthroplasty was due to the
disruption of the posterior stabilizers while performing the
posterior approach, ultimately leading to failure and
dislocation<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. The dislocated hemiarthroplasties have a lower
center-edge angle of Wiberg and the patients with low offset hips were more inherently unstable and hence prone to
dislocation. The posterior approach is associated with higher
dislocation rate<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Sikorski and Barrington<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> reported
dislocation rates of 10% in the unipolar prosthesis. Blewitt
and Mortimore<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> reviewed cases of dislocation in a series
of 1000 consecutive hemiarthroplasties. Recurrent
dislocation can be related to component malalignment or
improper soft tissue tensioning.</p><p>Bochner et al<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> observed that dislocation occurs less
frequently with bipolar prostheses. The theoretical advantage
of the bipolar prosthesis is that the combined arc of motion
of the dual joint should reduce the incidence of dislocation,
because most of the motion during activities of daily living
should take place at the inner articulation. Attarian<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported
that bipolar prosthesis has a self-aligning acetabular
component, which finds a correct orientation on its own
(self-centering mechanism), and the incidence of subluxation
and dislocation is low.</p><p>Whittaker et al<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> reporting in a series of 160 hemiarthroplasty
cases noted the rate of joint spacing in a 5-year study was
64% with the unipolar prosthesis. Acetabular erosion occurs
as a result of impact causing injury to the acetabular cartilage
at the time of the trauma, especially as the elderly often
sustain injury by a fall directly on the hip.</p><p>Excessive pressure on the acetabular cartilage after
arthroplasty also produces erosion when insufficient femoral
neck is resected. The exact matching of the size of the
prosthetic head is particularly important as too large a head
produces ring wear of the acetabulum and too small a head
increases point bearing with subsequent wear. Finally, the
cemented metal implant within the upper part of the femoral
shaft will be more likely to transmit the impact of each step
with greater stress across the prosthesis to bone interface
than would normal bone in which there is considerable
resilience<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>Skala-Rosenbaum et al<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> observed that prosthesis migration
depended on the position of the head, CE angle and position
of the prosthetic stem in the medullary canal. The resection
level of the femoral neck and the subsequent position of the
prosthetic head is a significant factor influencing the
progress of acetabular erosion.</p><fig id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table I</label><graphic xlink:href="MOJ_Vol7_Issue2_06_T1"/></fig><fig id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table II</label><caption><p>: Harris hip score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MOJ_Vol7_Issue2_06_T2"/></fig><fig id="T3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table III</label><caption><p>: Complications</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MOJ_Vol7_Issue2_06_T3"/></fig><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>: Post operative radiograph of unipolar prosthesis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MOJ_Vol7_Issue2_06_F1"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>: Post operative radiograph of bipolar prosthesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MOJ_Vol7_Issue2_06_F2"/></fig><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>: Periprosthetic fracture of unipolar prosthesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MOJ_Vol7_Issue2_06_F3"/></fig><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>: Posterior dislocation of unipolar prosthesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MOJ_Vol7_Issue2_06_F4"/></fig><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>: Acetabular erosion in unipolar prosthesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MOJ_Vol7_Issue2_06_F5"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Which type of hemiarthroplasty should we select for the
