Beta-glucans are natural polysaccharides consisting of a backbone of (1,3)-beta-glycosidic linked <sc>d</sc>-glucose subunits, with irregular beta-(1,6)-linked side chains of various length. They are major structural components of the cell walls of brewers&#x02019; yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, fungi and some bacteria. Depending on the source, there are clear differences between beta-glucans in their solubility, molecular mass, tertiary structure, degree of branching, polymer charge and solution conformation, all of which in turn impact their immune modulating effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Accordingly, beta-glucans having a (1,3)-beta chain with (1,6)-beta branching are more effective than &#x000df;-(1,3) branching alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>A properly functioning immune system is crucial to defend against invading pathogens, including common cold viruses. During a cold episode, the virus comes into contact with receptors on epithelial cells of the respiratory tract which in turn triggers a cascade of innate and adaptive immune response mediated by the release of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The common cold is a well-known and, in most cases, harmless infection, typically affecting adults 2&#x02013;5 times per year but resulting in significant effects on health, well-being and labour productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed, each cold episode experienced by working adults leads to an average of 8.7 lost work hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Very recently, the effect of an insoluble yeast (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-<sc>d</sc>-glucan on common cold has been demonstrated in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this study, the incidence of common cold episodes was used as a model system to determine the effect of beta-glucan supplementation on the body&#x02019;s defence mechanism. The present interventional trial was conducted to substantiate these data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and investigational product</title><p>Two hundred and twenty-four healthy subjects with recurring common colds were included in the study. They had to meet the following inclusion criteria: age&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;18&#x02013;70&#x000a0;years, written consent to participate, and at least three common cold infections within the last 6&#x000a0;months. The main exclusion criteria were as follows: acute or chronic upper airways disease, chronic cough, chronic rhinitis (e.g. allergic rhinitis) or asthma, severe organ or systemic disorders, stomach or intestinal diseases, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency diseases, vaccination against influenza or swine flu within 21&#x000a0;days before the study start, suspected swine flu or influenza, body temperature &#x02265;38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, known sensibility to one of the ingredients of the study product, pregnancy or nursing, use of immunosuppressants or stimulants, use of pre- and probiotics.</p><p>The sample size calculation was determined by the previously observed effect size and the requirements of a significance level of 5.0&#x000a0;% (two-sided) and a power of 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One study site missed the predetermined difference of the average cold incidence between study groups and, thus, was excluded from further analysis. From the remaining 164 subjects, two were excluded from the intention to treat (ITT) population due to absence of available values after baseline leaving 162 subjects for the ITT analysis. Furthermore, 16 subjects were excluded from the per protocol (PP) analysis, either due to early termination (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5) or due to poor compliance (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11), resulting in 146 subjects. Hence, 146 subjects remained for PP analysis.</p><p>The beta-glucan preparation is an insoluble (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan made from brewers&#x02019; yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), with a purity of at least 85&#x000a0;% on dry matter (branching factor approximately: 1,3 [backbone]: 1,6 [side chain]: 1,3/1,6 [branching]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10:1:0.6). Moreover, it contains &#x0003c;2&#x000a0;% &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-Mannan, &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;% fat, &#x0003c;2&#x000a0;% protein and &#x0003c;2&#x000a0;% ash on dry matter. The dry matter is more than 94&#x000a0;%.</p><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a total of 900&#x000a0;mg of either insoluble yeast beta-glucan (Yestimun<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> provided by Leiber GmbH, Germany) or placebo, each provided in two capsules per day, which were consumed at breakfast and supper. Detection of clinical effects like a reduction in common cold infections was demonstrated recently at a daily dosage of 900&#x000a0;mg insoluble beta-glucan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The placebo product was maltodextrin. Verum and placebo capsules were identical in shape, colour, size and taste. The randomization code was created by an independent statistician prior to study start. The random numbers in blocks of 4 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the two study groups.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Charit&#x000e9;, Berlin, Germany and was carried out in accordance with the Helsinki declaration and ICH GCP E6. Participants gave written informed consent prior to the study. The study was registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.org/">http://www.isrctn.org/</ext-link>) as ISRCTN16094368.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a multi-centric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two parallel arms in healthy subjects with recurring common cold episodes. The study was performed between October 2010 and May 2011. The subjects were enrolled at 7 study sites. During the study period of 16&#x000a0;weeks, a total of 3 routine visits were performed: at baseline, after 8&#x000a0;weeks and at the end after 16&#x000a0;weeks. In addition, one episode visit was conducted on the 5th day of each cold episode. Hence, the total number of visits per subject varies depended on the number of common cold episodes. During an infection, the subjects were instructed to record and assess their cold symptoms for a period of 14&#x000a0;days for each occurring episode.</p><p>Compliance was determined by counting returned capsules. Sufficient compliance was considered if &#x0003e;75 and &#x0003c;125&#x000a0;% of the capsules were consumed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary objective of the present study, the incidence of common cold episodes, was defined as the number of common cold infections during the study period. Further, severity and duration of cold episodes were assessed.</p><p> A cold episode was defined by the occurrence of at least two of the following cold symptoms: sore throat, feeling of lump in the throat/difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, cough, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion. These symptoms had to be rated with at least one point. Upon occurrence of the cold episode, the subjects had to document ten predefined common cold symptoms (headache, joint pain, sore throat, feeling of lump in the throat/difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cold-related sleeping difficulties, fever) in an episode diary. The evaluation was carried out on a rating scale (0 points&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;symptom free, 1 point&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;mild symptoms, 2 points&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderate symptoms, 3 points&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severe symptoms). The occurrence of fever was rated three points. By summation of the scores of the individual symptoms, a sum of scores (=total score) was calculated. All episodes were documented by the participants in a diary and confirmed by an investigator during the episode visit on the 5th day of each cold episode. The investigators examination includes the auscultation of the lungs, the control of the subject&#x02019;s diary, the recording of possible vaccination against influenza/swine flu, the assessment and documentation of cold symptoms, any use of antibiotics as well as any changes in the concomitant illness and medications and the recording of sick leave days.</p><p>In seven cases, a cold episode occurred within first 4&#x000a0;days of treatment. Due to the presumed date of infection prior to intake of the investigational product (prophylactic effect not assessable), these episodes were not considered in the analysis.</p><p>As concurrent variables, the efficacy and tolerability of the investigational product was evaluated by both the subjects and the investigators at the end of the study. The following ratings were used for it: &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d; &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d;. The safety and tolerability of the product was additionally evaluated by the documentation of adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the variables contained in the data collection were presented descriptively using their statistical key data or their frequency distribution and statistically analysed in view of the group specific differences (<italic>p</italic><sub>&#x003c7;</sub>-value).

In addition, consumption of yeast (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan caused a milder progression of the severe common cold episodes. This is in line with a recently published trial demonstrating the prophylactic effect of the same yeast (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan preparation on the incidence and severity of common cold infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, since the susceptibility to get a common cold is closely related to the body&#x02019;s immune status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], both studies independently suggest the potential of yeast (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan to stimulate the host immune system in order to provide defence against common cold viral attacks.</p><p>The innate immune response to invading pathogens depends largely on the recognition of compounds commonly known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by so-called pattern recognition receptors (PRR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Beta-glucans are considered as one of the major PAMPs for the PPR-mediated sensing of fungal infection. One of the key PRR for beta-glucans are suggested to be dectin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], although other receptors like toll-like receptors (TLR) and complement receptor 3 (CR3) also play a major role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. According to in vitro studies, binding of beta-glucan to dectin-1 activates antigen-presenting cells like macrophages and dendritic cells and induces a cascade of innate and adaptive immune response which ultimately results in the eradication of the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, Goodridge et al. demonstrated that although both soluble as well as particulate beta-glucan polymers are able to bind to the dectin receptor, only the particulate beta-glucan was able to activate the dectin-1 signalling, which in turn triggers phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The exact mode of action, however, depends at least in part on the route of administration. In terms of oral administration, the protection is primarily explained by the interaction of beta-glucans with pinocytic M-cells located in Payer&#x02019;s patches of the small intestine. After activation, these cells are transported to lymph nodes where other cells of the immune system like macrophages are activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In mice, orally administered yeast beta-glucan were taken up by gastrointestinal macrophages and shuttled to spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Within the bone marrow, the beta-glucan molecules were processed to small soluble biologically active fragments. This in turn is suggested to trigger the innate and adaptive immune response. Indeed, orally administered yeast beta-glucans induced the innate immunity as shown by a higher phagocytic activity and oxidative metabolism of immune cells in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The positive effect of yeast beta-glucan administration on the specific humoral and cellular immunity was further demonstrated. In weaned piglets, yeast beta-glucan administration increased serum levels of antibodies and modulated immune response by mitigating the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines after immunological challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Fleischer and co-workers studied the effect of yeast beta-glucan on the immune system of chickens and pregnant pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As a result, administration with yeast beta-glucan increased the level of immune globulins and thereby reduced the infection rates and mortality in growing chicks, breeding pigs and their offspring.</p><p>A proprietary insoluble yeast beta-glucan supplementation reduced the symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract infections but not the incidence in marathon runners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Likewise, the same preparation did not impact the incidence of common cold in healthy subjects in two independent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Even though the number of infections was not different, none of the subjects supplemented with beta-glucan missed school or work due to colds as opposed to placebo in the study conducted by Feldman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This is in contrast to our study, demonstrating an effect size of 25&#x000a0;% with yeast beta-glucan supplementation. The difference might be explained by varying study conditions, study populations, applied dosages and the purity of the applied beta-glucan preparation. Indeed, the immunomodulatory activity of beta-glucans from the same source might differ considerably by the level of purity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the present study proved the safety and tolerability of an insoluble (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan preparation made of brewers&#x02019; yeast. This is in line with results of controlled animal and human studies demonstrating no signs of toxicity after oral application of yeast (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our study in healthy subjects, together with a very recently published trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], confirms the postulation of an immunostimulatory effect of a highly purified yeast (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan preparation. This indicates the improvement in the body&#x02019;s defence against pathogens. Notably, a reduction in common cold episodes by 20&#x02013;25&#x000a0;% was independently demonstrated for two independent study populations in two different winter seasons, which underlines the robustness of the effect and biological relevance of this yeast (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan preparation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The study was funded by Leiber GmbH (Bramsche, Germany).
