It is the most abundant amino acid in plasma as well as skeletal muscle and accounts for more than 60% of the total intramuscular free amino acid pool <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]</sup>.Glutamine is largely synthesized in skeletal muscles and precursors to gluconeogenesis in the liver. Physical exercise is known to affect glutamine synthesis and to modulate glutamine uptake <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]</sup>. Strenuous physical exercise as well as exhaustive training programs lead to glutamine depletion due to lowered synthesis and enhanced uptake by liver and immune cells <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This might be the reason why Glutamine is a popular dietary supplement consumed for purported ergogenic benefits of increased strength, quicker recovery, decreased frequency of respiratory infections, and prevention of overtraining <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]</sup>. However, a lack of evidence has been demonstrated for definitive positive ergogenic benefits as a result of glutamine supplementation <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, Carbohydrate ingested before and during exercise provides an alternate source of muscle fuel that can support moderate and moderately high-intensity physical activity <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]</sup>. Maltodextrin is a carbohydrate polymer utilized preferentially as diet recourse in exercise. The gastric emptying for glucose polymer is faster than glucose solutions, avoiding a sudden drop in blood glucose and hyperinsulinaemia induced hypoglycaemia during exercise <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]</sup>. Athletes in long-duration types of sports (e.g. runners, triathletes and cyclists) benefit from the use of carbohydrate and glutamine together. Glutamine is an intermediate metabolite in the Krebs cycle and thus acts in gluconeogenesis by saving phosphocreatine (CP) deposits and glycogen in muscle fibers, particularly type I (aerobic) fibers, thereby increasing the tolerance to exercise <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]</sup>. However, there are few studies about the effect of glutamine on the performance of athletes. Moreover, the related mechanisms are still unclear. Also, there is a lack of research about the use of glutamine in some sports in which athletes need to do power-like competitions more than twice within 3-5 hours. In some sports such as martial arts, wrestling, swimming and others of that kind, athletes compete more than twice in short intervals within 3-5 hours. These types of athletes need to keep anaerobic power in optimum range for any competition. Maintenance of power during consecutive competition is a critical requisite to success. We think there is a paucity of practical investigations about the effect of combination of glutamine and carbohydrate supplementation on such sports, in which athletes have to compete consequently within a few hours. Furthermore, we believe in this study, there are some novelties such as utilization of supplementation 2 hours before exercise, conducting three repeated bouts of anaerobic power-like trial and use of standard RAST protocol. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether supplementation of peptide glutamine and carbohydrate would prevent anaerobic power decrease during repeated competitions.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>METHODS AND SUBJECTS</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Participants</title><p>This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Furthermore, before undergoing the tests, the subjects were given explanations about the assessment procedures, the study objectives, and the possible benefits and risks. Measurement of body composition was obtained prior to test using the three-site skin-fold caliper method <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]</sup>. Each subject was weighed prior to the test. All the participants completed a Running-based Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST) <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]</sup>. Then, maximum power (Max power) output was calculated in pre-test for each subject. Before testing, each subject performed a sub-maximal sprint to familiarize themselves with the test procedure. Immediately after baseline testing, subjects were randomly divided, on a Max power output value basis, to four groups: 1) G group (oral ingestion of glutamine at the dose of 0.25 g/kg body mass in 250 ml of water +30 gram sweetener), 2) M group (a single carbohydrate at a concentration of 50g of maltodextrin in 250 ml of water + 30 gram sweetener), 3) GM group (carbohydrate at a concentration of 50g of maltodextrin + glutamine at the dose of 0.25 g/kg body mass in 250 ml of water + 30 gram sweetener) and, 4) P group (250 ml of water + 30 gram sweetener) in a double-blind fashion. These supplements were administered two hours before test. Recent research has indicated that high doses of oral glutamine supplementation (0.3 g/kg) do not cause any harmful side effects <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]</sup>. Two hours after supplementation, each subject performed RAST three times with 1-hour intervals.

The test consists of six times 35m discontinuous sprints. Each sprint represents a maximal effort with 10 seconds allowed between each sprint for the turnaround. After completion of each RAST, subjects were allowed a 5 minute cool-down period at low to moderate aerobic power immediately followed by a 45 minute inactive recovery period. Maximal and minimal power (Min power) output was expressed in watts (W) and defined as the highest and lowest power output in six times 35m discontinuous sprints, respectively. Fatigue index indicates the decrease in power from the highest to the lowest anaerobic power output. Fatigue index was defined as the difference between the Max and Min power output divided by total time for 6 sprints. Power output and fatigue index were calculated by the following equations: 1) Power: Weight (kg) x Distance (m<sup>2</sup>)/Time (s<sup>3</sup>) and 2) Fatigue index (W/S): (Max power &#x02013; Min power)/Total time for 6 sprints (s).

According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>, there is a significant decrease in Max power in <italic>P</italic> group in time series (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). However, no decline was seen in time series in other groups indicating a possible effect of supplementations in sustaining Max power. In addition, there is significant difference between the P and GM group in the third bout, indicating stronger influence of the combination of maltodextrin and glutamine in comparison with pure consumption of glutamine or maltodextrin only (P&#x0003c; 0.05). According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>, the results of Min power and Max power are the same. Regarding fatigue index, there are no significant differences in time series and among groups (P&#x0003e; 0.05). There are some explanations about the effect of all supplements compared with placebo and stronger effect of the combination of maltodextrin and glutamine:</p><p>Preview studies showed that the beneficial effect of pre-exercise CHO feeding could be attributed to the increase in liver glycogen and alternatively an increase muscle glycogen for potential oxidation during exercise <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]</sup>. In addition, the observed improvements in performance with CHO ingestion have been attributed to maintenance of plasma glucose and glycogen availability <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]</sup>. In this context, CHO supplementation has been shown to increase the amount of work that can be performed <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>]</sup>. However, several studies have not observed positive effects of pre-exercise CHO feedings <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]</sup>. Differences in the training status of the subjects, amount of CHO ingested and the failure of the pre-exercise CHO feeding to alter glycogen metabolism may have been the potential causes for the discrepancy between these studies.</p><p>Furthermore, the type of CHO supplementation is very important. It has been suggested that because of their lower osmolalities, glucose polymer solutions (i.e. maltodextrins) would be preferable to isocaloric glucose solutions as a source of ingested CHO before and during exercise <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]</sup>. Ruffo et al, Observed that maltodextrin supplementation before exercise increased muscle and hepatic glycogen storage <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]</sup>. It seems the present study can be explained similar to other studies; in which prevention of Max and Min power decrease in M group is due to increased muscle and hepatic glycogen storage or maintenance of plasma glucose and glycogen availability.</p><p>On the other hand, glutamine supplementation managed to prevent decrease of Max and Min power in comparison with P group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figures 1</xref> and, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">2</xref>). It has been shown that ingestion of pure glutamine has been able to promote muscle glycogen re-synthesis during recovery from exhaustive exercise <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]</sup>. It has also been reported that glutamine stimulates the activity of hepatic glycogen synthesis <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]</sup>. Glutamine is readily taken up into skeletal muscle via the high-capacity, sodium-dependent system, <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]</sup> resulting in an increased intramuscular glutamine concentration <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]</sup>. Variner et al found that intravenous administration of glutamine promotes muscle glycogen re-synthesis during recovery after exhaustive exercise, possibly because glutamine acts as a glycogenic substrate and/or through an activator of glycogen synthase<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]</sup>. Strenuous physical exercise as well as exhaustive training programs lead to glutamine depletion due to lowered synthesis and enhanced uptake by liver and immune cells <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, one interesting study carried out among tri-athletes found that glutamine supplementation was efficiently absorbed and was not used for enterocyte proliferation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]</sup>, thus making it easier for the athletes receiving the supplementation to maintain their glycemic levels and ensuring greater exercise tolerance <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Finally, GM supplementation has been shown to be more effective than separate G or M supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">2</xref>). The stronger effect of GM supplementation is possibly due to greater storage of carbohydrate in sites other than skeletal muscle, the most likely candidate being the liver <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]</sup>. Studies developed among cyclists and runners have also found greater tolerance to effort when these athletes were supplemented with peptide glutamine and carbohydrate. This is because glutamine is an intermediate metabolite of the Krebs cycle, and is thus thought to act in gluconeogenesis, thereby increasing the efficiency of this metabolic process <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]</sup>. Hence, a higher efficiency of gluconeogenesis for energy production by muscle glycogen is of fundamental importance for higher performance in sports. Additionally, in soccer players, a tendency towards a lower subjective perception of sub-maximal effort was observed among those who received glutamine and maltodextrin supplementation compared with those who received pure maltodextrin supplementation <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is important to critically evaluate the results and the whole study. The present study has certain limitations that need to be taken into account when considering the study itself and its contributions to the field. Peptide glutamine has often been used for immunological support in immunosuppressed patients. Only a few studies have used peptide glutamine as an ergogenic aid for improving athletic performance. In our study, we used this supplement in acute manner with excellent results, though in a small sample. However, we do not know whether chronic use of this supplement would lead to the same results in our study population. Thus, we suggest that more research with different designs should be carried out in order to compare whether other models of peptide glutamine use might be more efficient in increasing the levels of anaerobic power among athletes. This field of research remains open and some of the limitations of this current study may be seen as fruitful avenues for future research on this topic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclussion" id="S0009"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It seems acute supplementation of glutamine and maltodextrin combination, 2 hours before exercises is more efficient in prevention of anaerobic power decrease than consumption of carbohydrate or glutamine alone in repeated bouts of RAST protocol.
