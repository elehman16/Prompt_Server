A random sample from the most recent census in three coastal regions of Guerrero state in Mexico will generate 90 study clusters and the equivalent sampling frame in Managua, Nicaragua will generate 60 clusters, making a total of 150 clusters each of 137&#x02013;140 households. After a baseline study, computer-driven randomisation will allocate to intervention one half of the sites, stratified by country, evidence of recent dengue virus infection in children aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years and, in Nicaragua, level of community organisation. Following a common evidence-based education protocol, each cluster will develop and implement its own collective interventions including house-to-house visits, school-based programmes and inter-community visits.

In Nicaragua and Mexico, as in most dengue endemic countries, the national pesticide-dependent approaches have failed to curb the spread of this mosquito-borne disease. Several reviews have shown pace-spraying with pesticide to kill adult mosquitoes to be of little value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Multiple serotypes of dengue virus continue to move northward through Latin America.</p><p id="Par5">Failure to curb the dengue epidemic has led to resurgence of interest in community mobilisation for its vector control. A 2007 systematic review of community-based dengue control programmes, including two randomised controlled trials, found only weak evidence &#x0201c;that community-based dengue control programmes alone and in combination with other control activities can enhance the effectiveness of dengue control programmes&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, none of these earlier studies used clustered designs.</p><p id="Par6">Several cluster trials have since shown an impact on vector densities. A team in Cuba published a trial of community mobilisation in 16 clusters compared with 16 controls, using vector breeding indices as the outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In India, community-level provision of water container covers, clean-up campaigns, and dissemination of dengue information through schoolchildren also reduced vector density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In Thailand, community volunteers reduced vector density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. No impact could be detected in a comparison of two communities in the Philippines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">A 2011 systematic review of 22 studies involving education messages for community-based dengue prevention concluded that these were effective in reducing entomological indices, but none measured dengue occurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A recent systematic review of 14 studies of <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</italic> found ample evidence that this reduced the number of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> breeding forms but only one study provided any evidence of impact on dengue risk; the study reported one dengue case in the intervention area and 15 cases in the control area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The literature suggests that non-pesticide measures <italic>should</italic> prevent dengue, but there is very little direct evidence of this.

By the fourth year of the feasibility study (2007), twice as many households in the intervention sites (15.5%) as in the control sites (7.1%) said they participated directly in community dengue control exercises, and 50.7% in intervention and 39.5% in control sites reported having looked for larvae in their water stores over the last week.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)</title><p id="Par16">Using an ANOVA framework for the 20 control communities in 2007, we estimated an ICC of 0.78 for the saliva samples of 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;year-old children and 0.396 for households positive for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae and/or pupae.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Comment</title><p id="Par17">As with many studies of this type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the feasibility study in Nicaragua was not randomised. We therefore did not evaluate the impact on dengue but estimated parameters needed to design the main study. The Nicaraguan study fine-tuned a dengue-specific intervention strategy called &#x0201c;socialising of evidence for participatory action&#x0201d; (SEPA). The study demonstrated feasibility of Camino Verde in vector control, with likely gains for the intervention communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The long history of community mobilisation in Nicaragua raises issues of replicability in other contexts.

An explicit objective is to develop a sustainable community-oriented vector control approach that reduces the need for pesticides in water used in or around homes or areas that children frequent, or likely to be used with food or even as drinking water.</p><p id="Par21">Specific objectives are (1) Determine entomological and serological status of the virus-vector-host ecosystem as well as knowledge, attitudes and behaviour underlying community-led interventions; (2) In partnership with intervention communities, translate this knowledge on dengue vector behaviour and immunology into household and community action against dengue; (3) Identify the impact of informed community mobilisation on dengue risk and its added effectiveness regarding other infections, social capital and longer term economic welfare.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Design of the study</title><p id="Par22">This parallel group pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial will test informed community mobilisation in dengue control, measured by risk of dengue virus infection, occurrence of self-reported dengue cases, and vector density. The baseline will include a household questionnaire, entomological assessment and saliva samples from children aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years. After the baseline survey, a sampling statistician not associated with the trial will randomise the 150 sites to intervention or control, stratified by area, entomological indices and serological evidence of recent dengue virus infection in children. Interventions will be based on evidence of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> infestation, explanation of the dengue vector life cycle, and information on how to prevent larvae and pupae from becoming adult mosquitoes. Different ways of transmitting this knowledge and acting upon it will be designed and implemented by the participating communities. The intervention will run for at least a full year. A multi-method impact survey will cover all 150 clusters with no in-cluster sampling. This will measure risk of dengue virus infection, disease reports, and entomological indices of the vector <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>.

Between 2003 and 2007, registered dengue cases in Mexico increased 10-fold to 48,456. Guerrero now reports a high rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever (35/100,000), second in the country only to Quintana Roo, with all four serotypes well established. The Nicaraguan and Mexican government strategy for control of the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito rests on insertion of a packet of temephos (trade name Abate) in household water containers, known in both countries as &#x0201c;abatizaci&#x000f3;n&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par24">Participants are residents in a random sample of 150 clusters (100&#x02013;120 households each) from the latest census in each country. In Mexico, a stratified last-stage-random sample generated 90 enumeration areas, 30 representing each of three regions (Costa Grande, Acapulco and Costa Chica regions of Guerrero state). In Nicaragua, 60 enumeration areas represent of the capital city, Managua, where approximately one-fourth of the Nicaraguan population resides.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par25">&#x0201c;Socialising of evidence for participatory action&#x0201d; (SEPA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ciet.org/en/method/sepa-communication">http://www.ciet.org/en/method/sepa-communication/</ext-link>), was fine-tuned during the Managua feasibility study.

In Nicaragua, the four-year feasibility study has already provided a good idea of the change process so their emphasis may be more on the quantitative data. Both Mexican and Nicaraguan peer process evaluations will involve members of the research team from one cluster or region visiting another cluster or region and gathering both quantitative and qualitative information to provide project management and community leaders with actionable details about the intervention process, to inform any necessary mid-course corrections. In both countries, the inter-community visits and process evaluation will provide encouragement and training for intervention field staff and communities alike.</p><p id="Par32">Quantitative information will include data on the last time a member of the cluster&#x02019;s own research team visited the household and data on larval/pupal infestation as found by the monitoring team.

During household visits, the interviewer will ask children to spit 0.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;ml of saliva into a plastic receptacle. Returning fieldworkers will transport samples to the CIET laboratories in Acapulco and the Ministry of Health National Virology Laboratory in Managua, divided into labelled aliquots and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until processing. We will process the pre- and post-season samples side-by-side by capture ELISA and will consider an increase in IgG antibody units of greater than or equal to two-fold indicative of increased dengue virus infection risk.

The simultaneous evaluation in control and intervention sites will account for temporal effects. Serological status, reports of dengue illness, and vector indices lend themselves to analysis as continuous variables. Recent infection in children, adopting a cut-off of a two-fold increase of IgG units between samples, and pupae-positive households, are both dichotomized variables; the percent of households with serological evidence of recent infection in any child or with larvae/pupae-positive entomology serves as a continuous variable in each site.

We will add new arrivals to the study but will not follow those leaving the household clusters. There is no reason to expect differential out-migration between intervention and control clusters. Self-selection (decision not to participate or not to answer certain questions) is a concern, given the structured engagement implied by the intervention. Those who opt not to respond may be less involved with dengue control &#x02013; thus reducing the measured effect. We will analyse missing data using Amelia II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] to impute values for missing data with an EM algorithm for the primary outcome (serological evidence of recent dengue virus infection). Estimates will reconcile data from ten imputed data sets using Rubin&#x02019;s approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] in the R package Zelig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Economic analysis</title><p id="Par45">The sample size estimate for this trial uses relatively rare primary outcomes, so it will be adequately powered to consider economic implications of the intervention, which could be profound. Informed community mobilisation could reduce dengue rates directly but, by increasing social engagement, it could also increase the proportion of the population enabled to benefit from other prevention interventions, increasing their impact correspondingly. The dengue virus infection end-point (serology) is most relevant for economic analysis of the direct impact, although reduction of entomological indices also has resonance. By costing the intervention, it should be possible to document the costs of dengue cases avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Documenting the real cost of preventing dengue will be less simple. A cost-benefit approach will be relevant, with benefits identified and qualified by communities themselves. Individuals who opt to reduce their own dengue risk probably do so based on perceived costs and benefits of prevention &#x02013; we have called this the individual &#x0201c;cost benefit equation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This equation can lead to very different decisions from those imagined by dengue control programmes, especially in the context of abatizaci&#x000f3;n, which removes choice and changes the way people estimate their own value in the choices they make.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Implications for health services</title><p id="Par46">The case to be made is that informed community mobilisation reduces dengue risks, without reliance on imported pesticide. A secondary case is that the costs compare favourably with the gains of doing this; pesticide-free prevention requires less treatment of cases, less work time lost, and less importation of expensive pesticides.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Software</title><p id="Par47">CIETmap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] is a hybrid vector-raster GIS software with seamless linkages between epidemiological analysis and mapping. The package provides a windows-like interface with the popular open-source statistical programming language R.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Power calculation</title><p id="Par48">Data from the feasibility study in Managua facilitated sample size estimation. Using the dengue serology results as the principal outcome, control communities in 2004&#x02013;8 showed a range of 1.5% to 7.4% (k-statistic 0.328). Follow-up of 40 children in each of 150 clusters (75 clusters per arm) would detect a 33.3% reduction in incidence (4.5% to 3%) with 80% power at a significance level of 5%. These calculations assume no interaction effects and a two-sided test with cluster as unit of primary analysis in unmatched parallel groups. Calculations used a spreadsheet based on the trial simulator devised by Taylor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Randomisation</title><sec id="Sec31"><title>Allocation concealment</title><p id="Par49">Randomisation will be conducted centrally by a sampling statistician who is not engaged in the rest of the study. Computer-generated random numbers will determine intervention status in each stratum, defined by the baseline study. The intervention will begin promptly after randomisation with disclosure of intervention status at that time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par50">The prevention efforts will be obvious to residents in the intervention sites, and some outcomes (particularly conscious knowledge) could be influenced by knowledge of intervention status. The main outcome indicators (reduction in serological evidence of recent dengue virus infection or entomological indices) would be less susceptible to this bias. To prevent potential bias, interviewers should ideally be unaware if they are interviewing in intervention or control clusters. Data managers will be unaware of intervention status of clusters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Contamination</title><p id="Par51">There may be some contamination of the control clusters: through people interacting between the clusters at the individual or household level; through schools (children from control clusters going to schools in the intervention clusters); and through local government or NGOs taking up the emerging evidence to guide interventions in control clusters. Perhaps a bigger concern, in urban areas, is that mosquitoes from neighbouring households influence rates in the intervention sites and that children may get bitten by infected mosquitoes outside of their intervention site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Both types of contamination will reduce the measured difference between control and intervention clusters. We cannot avoid this effect. We will document spread of the intervention beyond the sites in several regards: (i) mechanisms for generalising evidence, (ii) uptake at policy level and in the public discourse, (iii) new initiatives or changes in approach by agencies involved in dengue control, and (iv) impact in the control clusters as well as in the intervention clusters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Ethical considerations</title><sec id="Sec35"><title>Ethical review</title><p id="Par52">The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of California, Berkeley, and the CIET IRB reviewed the Nicaraguan arm.

In the household survey, no names or identifiers will be recorded next to individual responses. Unique number labels will be used to link saliva specimens to questionnaire responses, without identifying the person by name. In individual follow-up for repeat samples, we will record the name of the child in order to match this from visit to visit and to be able to deliver results of the tests to parents or guardians.

Many national governments have used temephos in household water stores. The WHO approval to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] cites the lack of evidence of toxicity.</p><p id="Par61">Temephos is not licensed for human consumption in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; the US Environmental Protection Agency says temephos &#x0201c;&#x02026;has no food uses, is not likely to be found in drinking water, and is not used in or around homes or areas that children frequent&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Studies not sponsored by the producers have documented animal toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and genotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Resistance of the mosquito to this pesticide is already well documented and is a growing concern, given the variable coverage and consistency of many government-initiated programmes using temephos for dengue control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We could not identify any community-based randomised controlled trials showing a protective effect of temephos against dengue virus infection.</p><p id="Par62">Given the current government commitment to temephos, it will take a while to generate full participation of state and local authorities. Assuming the intervention is successful, there is an ethical obligation to implement it also in control communities. As this is unlikely within the 3-year time period of this project, other funds will be sought for that purpose.</p><p id="Par63">There is also a strong community-building component integrated into the trial design; one of the goals is to measure the impact of the intervention on social capital.
