We investigated whether consumption of a food-based micronutrient-rich snack increased markers of blood micronutrient concentrations when compared with a control snack. Non-pregnant women (<italic>n</italic> 222) aged 14&#x02013;35 years living in a Mumbai slum were randomised to receive a treatment snack (containing green leafy vegetables, dried fruit and whole milk powder), or a control snack containing foods of low micronutrient content such as wheat flour, potato and tapioca. The snacks were consumed under observation 6&#x000a0;d per week for 12 weeks, compliance was recorded, and blood was collected at 0 and 12 weeks. Food-frequency data were collected at both time points. Compliance (defined as the proportion of women who consumed &#x02265;&#x000a0;3 snacks/week) was &#x0003e;85&#x000a0;% in both groups. We assessed the effects of group allocation on 12-week nutrient concentrations using ANCOVA models with respective 0-week concentrations, BMI, compliance, standard of living, fruit and green leafy vegetable consumption and use of synthetic nutrients as covariates. The treatment snack significantly increased &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations (treatment effect: 47&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;nmol/l, 95&#x000a0;% CI 6&#x000b7;5, 87&#x000b7;7). There was no effect of group allocation on concentrations of ferritin, retinol, ascorbate, folate or vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. The present study shows that locally sourced foods can be made into acceptable snacks that may increase serum &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations among women of reproductive age. However, no increase in circulating concentrations of the other nutrients measured was observed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Food-based interventions</kwd><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>Micronutrient status</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> CRP, C-reactive protein; MMNP, Mumbai Maternal Nutrition Project</p></notes></front><body><p>Multiple micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent among women of reproductive age in India<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> of studies investigating the intake of micronutrients among women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries has found that in Asia, intakes of several micronutrients were frequently below the WHO/FAO Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The majority of studies reviewed have found that intakes of Fe, folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> were less than half of the EAR, and between 25 and 77&#x000a0;% of women in Asia had mean intakes of vitamin A and vitamin C below the EAR. No data on carotenoid intakes were reported in the review. The authors suggested that these findings may reflect the cereal-based diets that are commonly consumed in such populations, which tend to be low in fruit, vegetables and animal foods. Low micronutrient intakes have adverse implications for women's risk of anaemia, infectious disease and chronic conditions such as cancer. Optimal offspring health is also dependent on adequate maternal nutrition.</p><p>Animal foods are relatively expensive, <sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup> and a large proportion of the Indian population are vegetarian. Milk, fruit and green leafy vegetables are a good source of micronutrients, but intakes of these foods are low, with national survey data indicating that in 2005&#x02013;6 over 50&#x000a0;% of Indian women consumed fruit less than once per week<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. When these data were broken down by region and demographic group, over two-thirds of women living in Mumbai slum areas (<italic>n</italic> 803) consumed green leafy vegetables on a daily basis. However, only frequency data were collected in the survey, and several Indian preparations contain very small amounts of green leafy vegetables (&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;g) such as coriander for seasoning. It is, therefore, possible that the proportion of women who consumed a 100&#x000a0;g portion daily as recommended in the Indian National Institute of Nutrition guidelines<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> would be considerably smaller than the proportion cited above. A quarter of women reported consuming fruit daily, and approximately 40&#x000a0;% ate fruit less than once per week. Over 15&#x000a0;% of women never consumed milk or curd (yogurt), and 56&#x000a0;% consumed these items less than once per week. Recent quantitative data on dietary intake collected from women living in North Indian slums show that intakes of fruit and vegetables were very low<sup>(</sup>

The MMNP intervention was based on the results of the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study, an observational investigation in a rural area near the city of Pune, which reported that maternal intakes of green leafy vegetables, fruit and milk during pregnancy were positively associated with offspring birth size measurements<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. The MMNP was designed to investigate the effect of maternal consumption of a snack containing green leafy vegetables, fruit and milk for at least 3 months before conception and throughout pregnancy on infant size and mortality. The treatment snack was designed in such a way that in addition to the women's habitual diet, a daily intake of &#x02265;&#x000a0;75th centile of green leafy vegetables (25&#x000a0;g), fruit (10&#x000a0;g) and milk (12&#x000a0;g) as reported in the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study would be achieved.</p><p>The present study was a randomised controlled trial of the MMNP intervention model, and was undertaken to examine its effects on micronutrient status among a separate group of non-pregnant women. Baseline status was not assessed in the main MMNP trial in order to minimise blood collection which may have been a deterrent to participation. The present study was conducted approximately 10 miles away from the MMNP study area, and the participants were not enrolled in the MMNP at any time.</p><p>The present study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the JJ Hospital Ethics Committee, Mumbai.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Participants and settings</title><p>The participants lived in the Shivaji Nagar slum area of Mumbai with inadequate access to safe water and sanitation, poor structural quality of housing and overcrowding.

As there is a significant migration rate in the study area, we asked women to enrol only if they intended to remain in the study area for at least 3 months. A power calculation showed that a sample size of eighty-two per group was necessary to demonstrate a difference in the proportion of vitamin A deficiency (defined as serum retinol &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/l) of the order of 35&#x000a0;% in the control group <italic>v</italic>. 10&#x000a0;% in the treatment group at 90&#x000a0;% power and at the 0&#x000b7;05 significance level<sup>(</sup>

Written informed consent was obtained from all women who agreed to participate. Those who met the inclusion criteria (<italic>n</italic> 222) were enrolled and randomised to the treatment or control arm of the study. Randomisation was stratified by age and BMI to ensure that the groups did not differ by these variables. The treatment and control snacks were outwardly similar, but their contents were different. To achieve a degree of allocation concealment, we created two treatment and two control groups, each with an independent set of recipes. The women were given colour-coded identity cards based on group allocation. There were no differences in the amounts and types of green leafy vegetables, fruit and milk powder in the treatment snacks. A total of four different snacks were produced daily, in an unpredictable pattern. The snacks were packaged in colour-coded bags to match the women's identity cards and ensure that they were correctly distributed. The staff who measured outcomes were blinded to the women's allocation groups. The two treatment groups and the two control groups were merged for analysis.</p><p>Baseline data and venous blood samples were collected before the start of supplementation and within 7&#x000a0;d of enrolment. Demographic data and information on synthetic micronutrient supplement intake in the form of tablets or tonics were collected by means of a questionnaire. A 221-item interviewer-administered FFQ developed for this sample<sup>(</sup>

This was in order to assess any changes in intakes of these foods over the supplementation period. Height was measured to the nearest millimetre using a portable stadiometer (Seca), and weight to the nearest 100&#x000a0;g using electronic scales (Salter). BMI was expressed as kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>During the 12-week supplementation period, women were asked to visit a local community centre 6&#x000a0;d per week (Monday to Saturday) to receive the snacks and consume them under observation. The centre was &#x02264;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;minutes' walk from the women's homes. Consumption of the snacks was recorded by a project health worker. Compliance with the intervention was defined as consumption of a mean of &#x02265;&#x000a0;3 supplements per week over the 12-week period. Follow-up blood samples were collected at 12 weeks after the beginning of supplementation. Women who were found to be moderately or severely anaemic (Hb &#x0003c;&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;g/l) at baseline or at 12 weeks were offered Fe tablets. Women who were mildly anaemic (Hb 100&#x02013;119&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;g/l) were informed of their status, and advised to consult a doctor and consider taking Fe supplements. Anaemic women were eligible to remain in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>Women were given one cooked snack per d such as a &#x02018;samosa&#x02019; or &#x02018;patty&#x02019; made from locally available food ingredients. The treatment snacks were designed to provide women with 25&#x000a0;g fresh green leafy vegetables (e.g. spinach, <italic>Colocasia</italic>, coriander and fenugreek leaves), 10&#x000a0;g dried fruit (e.g. Figs, dates and raisins) and 12&#x000a0;g whole milk powder in addition to their habitual diet. The control snacks contained foods, such as potato, sago or tapioca. Both types of snacks were prepared with binding ingredients, such as wheat or maize flour, to which spices were added. The snacks were cooked by shallow frying in sunflower oil. Several varieties of the treatment (<italic>n</italic> 5) and control snacks (<italic>n</italic> 7) were developed, to prevent monotony. The average weight of the snacks was approximately 65&#x000a0;g (treatment) and 36&#x000a0;g (control). The women were advised to consume the snacks in addition to their habitual diet. One snack per d was given to the women at a time least likely to interfere with their usual intake, between 15.00 and 18.00 hours, Monday to Saturday.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Nutrient content of the intervention</title><p>Before nutrient analysis, the snacks were frozen in Mumbai and transported on dry ice to the UK, where they were analysed at Eclipse Laboratories (Cambridge, UK) for micronutrient content.

The system used one anti-ferritin antibody for solid-phase (microtitre wells) immobilisation and another mouse monoclonal anti-ferritin antibody in the antibody&#x02013;enzyme (horseradish peroxidase) conjugate solution. The test sample was allowed to react simultaneously with the antibodies, resulting in the ferritin molecules being sandwiched between the solid phase and enzyme-linked antibodies. After incubation at room temperature for 60&#x000a0;min, the wells were washed with water to remove unbound antibodies.

For each sample, &#x003b2;-carotene was measured at 450&#x000a0;nm using an Empower 2-controlled HPLC system (Waters Ltd), with a photodiode array detector. Simultaneously, the internal standard was measured at 284&#x000a0;nm, and the ratio of the responses calculated (response factor). &#x003b2;-Carotene calibration lines were obtained from semi-pure, commercially available &#x003b2;-carotene.

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study aimed to assess the effects of consumption of a micronutrient-rich food-based intervention on the nutritional status of low-income group Indian women. We found that consumption of the treatment snacks for 12 weeks was associated with a small increase in &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations relative to the control group. The mean difference in the change between groups was 47&#x000a0;nmol/l, which was just over 12&#x000a0;% of baseline &#x003b2;-carotene values. The CV of the assay was of a similar magnitude, but due to the randomised design, it could be reasonably expected that the measurement error would not differ between the groups. There was no significant effect of the intervention allocation on the change in the concentrations of any of the other micronutrients studied.</p><p>In the UK, the effect of adding 85&#x000a0;g/d of raw watercress to the usual diet for 8 weeks was an increase in &#x003b2;-carotene levels by a mean of 100&#x000a0;nmol/l<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Considering the quantity of green leafy vegetables in the intervention in the present study, it would appear that the effect size is consistent with this finding.</p><p>The treatment effect in the present study was considerably smaller than that in studies where alterations to the entire dietary pattern such as increasing daily intake of fruit and vegetables from two to ten portions per d were implemented. Such interventions have achieved up to a fivefold increase in &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations<sup>(</sup>

It is questionable how sustainable such changes to diets would be in the Indian slum population.</p><p>There are inconsistent effects of vitamin A-rich foods on nutritional status among populations in Asia and Africa. Among Bangladeshi men, vitamin A pool size was increased following a spinach intervention<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. However, a recent study in Bangladesh assessed the effect of the consumption of bio-fortified orange-fleshed sweet potato on vitamin A pool size among vitamin A-deficient women living in a low-income area of Dhaka city<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>34</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The potato intervention increased circulating &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations, but there was no effect on vitamin A stores. This finding indicated that the conversion of &#x003b2;-carotene to vitamin A was limited in this population. The authors concluded that protein deficiencies among these women may have led to reduced synthesis of BCMO1 (&#x003b2;-carotene 15,15&#x02032;-monooxygenase 1), which, in turn, would reduce the conversion of &#x003b2;-carotene to retinol.</p><p>Over three-quarters of the women in the present study had retinol and folate concentrations above the cut-offs for deficiency. Therefore, it is possible that the majority of the women in this sample were not deficient in these nutrients. In addition, the duration of the supplementation period may have been too short for retinol status to be altered. It was necessary for us to achieve a balance between resources, compliance with the protocol and observing an effect of the supplement on micronutrient status. Furthermore, in the case of vitamin C, the content in the snacks was low, probably due to the cooking process. There was some experimentation with different methods of cooking, and preparing the snacks to preserve vitamin C content, but the most acceptable method to the women was shallow frying, and this method was used, as it was important to achieve adherence to the protocol.</p><p>A study on a small group of healthy young females in Pune, West India, compared the short-term effects of consumption of a green leafy vegetable meal with a standard meal without green leafy vegetables<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. No difference in plasma &#x003b2;-carotene or vitamin C concentrations between the two groups was observed 4&#x000a0;h after the meal. However, after a 3-week intervention period constituting daily supplementation with 100&#x000a0;g cooked green leafy vegetables and 10&#x000a0;g oil, there was a significant increase in plasma concentrations of both nutrients. The authors concluded that an intake of 100&#x000a0;g green leafy vegetables per d plus 10&#x000a0;g oil could be an effective strategy for improving micronutrient status of young Indian women. The treatment snacks in the present study contained approximately 25&#x000a0;g green leafy vegetables per serving; it is possible that there is a &#x02018;threshold nutrient intake&#x02019; above which a change in nutrient concentration would be observed. For example, consumption of four snacks per d may have led to significant increases in the concentrations of the other nutrients, and a more marked increase in &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations in the treatment group.</p><p>We assessed the possible impact of inflammation on ferritin status using CRP concentrations; however, this did not alter the lack of association with treatment allocation. The snacks contained almost 4&#x000a0;mg Fe per serving. However, it is likely that there was insufficient bioavailable Fe in the snacks due to the inhibition of Fe uptake, attributable, in turn, to frequent consumption of phytate-containing cereal-based foods, tea containing polyphenols, milk protein and polyphenols in green leafy vegetables in the snacks themselves.</p><p>The present study had several strengths and limitations. Before the study, there was a paucity of data on the effect of long-term food-based interventions on the nutritional status of women in low-income settings. We used a randomised controlled design, but as with many food-based intervention studies, it was not possible to blind the intervention. It is unlikely that this would have influenced the findings, given that the outcomes were objectively assessed, and the group allocations were not known to the laboratory staff who made the nutrient concentration measurements. A strength of the study is that all of the participants started and completed the intervention at the same time, thus creating an internal control for seasonal changes in food intakes.</p><p>The sample size calculation was based on serum retinol concentrations, as this was the nutrient for which data were available for the Indian population. Based on previously published data, we had perhaps overestimated the proportion of women who would be retinol deficient, and it is possible that the study was underpowered for other nutrients, for which no status data of this sample were available. It would have been of interest to have measured the change in Zn status, as green leafy vegetables are a source of this mineral, but circulating Zn concentrations are tightly regulated, and this would have required a different methodology which was not feasible within the present study.</p><p>It is possible that the women might have changed their habitual diet on account of being enrolled in the study; it is also conceivable that women in the treatment group reduced their consumption of green leafy vegetables because they were aware of the snack intervention. Women in the control group may have done the opposite, thus negating the effect of the snacks on micronutrient status. Our data suggest that this did happen to a certain extent in the present study, and the effect size that we have shown in relation to &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations may be an underestimation. A similar phenomenon was observed in the UK school fruit scheme, whereby children who received fruit at school were given less fruit at home, and so an intervention designed to increase children's intake of fruit by one portion per d resulted in only a 0&#x000b7;5 portion per d increase<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>, and this was perhaps due to the parents' assumption that children required less fruit at home in the context of the school fruit scheme<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>37</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. This phenomenon poses a crucial challenge to the design of food-based interventions.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study indicated that small changes in intakes of fruit, green leafy vegetables and milk in a food-based snack intervention might have led to increased levels of circulating &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations in the sample chosen.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the study participants and their families for their time and commitment to the study; staff from Apnalaya and Centre for Study of Social Change, Mumbai, for their contribution to the fieldwork; Diabetes Unit, King Edward Memorial Hospital, Pune, Medical Research Council Human Nutrition Research Unit, Cambridge, ALS Food and Pharmaceutical and Nair Hospital, Mumbai, for laboratory analyses and advice on assay preparation.</p><p>The present study was funded by the Wellcome Trust, ICICI Bank and the Medical Research Council Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit.</p><p>The authors' contributions are as follows: S.
