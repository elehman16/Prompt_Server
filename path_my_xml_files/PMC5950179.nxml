The aims of the current study were first, to identify barriers to the feasibility and acceptability of implementing calorie labelling in preparation for a larger trial, and second, to estimate the potential impact of calorie labelling on energy purchased in worksite cafeterias.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Six worksite cafeterias were randomised to the intervention starting at one of six fortnightly periods, using a stepped wedge design. The trial was conducted between August and December 2016, across 17 study weeks. The intervention comprised labelling all cafeteria products for which such information was available with their calorie content (e.g. &#x0201c;250&#x000a0;Calories&#x0201d;) displayed in the same font style and size as for price. A post-intervention survey with cafeteria patrons and interviews with managers and caterers were used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Intervention impact was assessed using generalised linear mixed modelling. The primary outcome was the total energy (kcal) purchased from intervention items in each cafeteria each day.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Recruitment and retention of worksite cafeterias proved feasible, with post-intervention feedback suggesting high levels of intervention acceptability. Several barriers to intervention implementation were identified, including chefs&#x02019; discretion at implementing recipes and the manual recording of sales data. There was no overall effect of the intervention: -0.4% (95%CI -3.8 to 2.9, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.803). One site showed a statistically significant effect of the intervention, with an estimated 6.6% reduction (95%CI -12.9 to &#x02212;&#x02009;0.3, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.044) in energy purchased in the day following the introduction of calorie labelling, an effect that diminished over time. The remaining five sites did not show robust changes in energy purchased when calorie labelling was introduced.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">A calorie labelling intervention was acceptable to both cafeteria operators and customers. The predicted effect of labelling to reduce energy purchased was only evident at one out of six sites studied. Before progressing to a full trial, the calorie labelling intervention needs to be optimised, and a number of operational issues resolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN52923504">ISRCTN52923504</ext-link>; Registered: 22/09/2016; retrospectively registered.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12966-018-0671-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Physical micro-environment</kwd><kwd>Choice architecture</kwd><kwd>Nudging</kwd><kwd>Stepped wedge trial</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Healthier eating</kwd><kwd>Workplace interventions</kwd><kwd>Calorie labelling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Department of Health (England)</institution></funding-source><award-id>PR-UN-0409-10109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marteau</surname><given-names>Theresa M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Insititute of Grocery Distribution</institution></funding-source><award-id>RG83425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marteau</surname><given-names>Theresa M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106679/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pechey</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">In the UK context, poor diets are the leading modifiable risk factor for excess mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Encouraging people to make healthier food choices whilst reducing excess consumption of food and drink is therefore core to improving health outcomes in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current estimates suggest that about one-third of a working adult&#x02019;s daily energy intake is consumed whilst at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], making the workplace a potentially important setting for dietary interventions. To date, evidence regarding this potential is limited in quantity and quality.</p><p id="Par7">A systematic review examining workplace dietary interventions suggested that workplace interventions may lead to small increases in fruit and vegetable consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, this review was based on four studies using self-reported outcome measures of fruit and vegetable consumption, following interventions that were mainly information-based (including different kinds of nutritional education campaigns communicated using posters, leaflets, and group workshops delivered at workplaces). Current evidence suggests that information-based interventions that rely on people&#x02019;s conscious engagement with the material presented are most often insufficient to change the routine and habitual behaviours characteristic of food selection and consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. More promising for behavior change are interventions that involve altering cues in physical micro-environments that are proximal to and shape much of our behaviour, often without awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Such interventions are often referred to as &#x02018;choice architecture&#x02019; or nudging interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In line with the above, a recent systematic review examining choice-architecture dietary interventions in the workplace found that such interventions have the potential to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, increase sales of healthy options, and reduce total calories purchased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite the promising findings, the multi-component nature of many of the interventions precluded isolating the effectiveness of individual interventions and the frequent use of self-report measures of purchasing undermined confidence in the validity of the results of many of the studies. The authors concluded that larger trials using designs that can isolate the effects of individual interventions are needed to ascertain whether the promise of choice architecture interventions in worksite cafeterias can be realised.</p><p id="Par9">Labelling is one intervention for reducing consumption of food which was deployed in some of the choice-architecture intervention studies reviewed by Allan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The results of a recent Cochrane review of nutritional labelling indicate the promise of this approach, finding that calorie labelling at point of consumption in restaurant settings has the potential to reduce average daily energy intake from food and drinks by an estimated 7.8% per meal (with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 2.5% to 13.1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the synthesised effect size was based on limited evidence derived from three randomised controlled trials in US restaurant settings. Moreover, there were no studies in worksite cafeterias that met the review inclusion criteria. The present research aims to fill this gap by examining the impact of calorie labelling in worksite cafeterias and extending the reach of the labelling beyond menus (to include both product and shelf labelling).</p><p id="Par10">This study is part of a pilot trial testing the impact of each of three physical micro-environment interventions - calorie labelling, portion size, and availability of healthier options - to reduce energy purchased in workplace cafeterias in preparation for a future larger trial (for the published protocol see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). The three interventions were implemented and evaluated separately, involving a total of 18 sites. We report here the results of the calorie labelling intervention, which involved labelling foods and non-alcoholic drinks with their energy (kcal) content in six worksite cafeterias.</p><p id="Par11">The aims of the present study are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par12">to assess the feasibility of recruiting eligible worksites, and identify potential barriers to the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the labelling intervention; and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">to estimate the potential impact of calorie labelling upon energy purchased.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample</title><p id="Par14">Six English worksite cafeterias were recruited from the 1027 companies that are members of the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. IGD is a charity set up to inform and educate the food and grocery industry about best practice. Worksites from any region within England were eligible. Selection criteria for study sites were as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par15">Site size: employing more than 350</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">Ability to provide at least weekly data on sales of individual items and their energy content</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par17">We identified 39 sites that seemed likely to meet the two criteria, based on information available to IGD and contacted the managers of these sites. As such, our sampling frame included food and grocery industry worksites who wanted to encourage healthier eating amongst their workforce and supported the current research as part of this initiative. Twenty-one sites did not meet the criteria. Of the 18 that did, six were selected to implement the calorie labelling intervention (based on readiness to participate in the study, since this was the first intervention implemented), with the remaining 12 selected to implement, the availability and portion size interventions. Enrolment of sites into the study was completed by a research assistant (EC). Managers of participating worksites provided their consent for the cafeteria to be included in the present trial before the study period commenced.

Linear models were used to estimate the potential impact of the intervention and associated effect sizes. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) were fitted to examine the impact on total energy (kcal) purchased per day from intervention items controlling for the total transactions, adjusted for time trends (using day relative to the intervention start date as a random slope per site) and with random effects for worksite.</p><p id="Par36">Initial analyses were conducted to confirm the selected time frame level of daily (as opposed to weekly) sales due to day-level events that occurred irregularly during the study period affecting sales in cafeterias such as corporate training events. Analysing the data at the week-level would have biased the estimates by not taking into account unexpected events across time at the different sites. A daily time frame was also selected since the conditional distribution of the daily outcome was compatible with the model assumptions and, since there were no time-dependencies present in the data after controlling for total transactions, time and other variables. Uncharacteristic days &#x02013; such as days showing large changes in energy purchased due to corporate events - were included as dummy variables to allow for an unbiased estimate of the intervention effect (see Results for more details).</p><p id="Par37">It was not appropriate to attempt to exclude outliers, as the non-stationary nature of the data meant that many arbitrary assumptions would have been required in defining outliers. The intervention was fitted as six dummy fixed effects for each site.

Of the 18 eligible worksites six sites received the labelling intervention (with the 12 remaining worksites randomised to receive the availability and size interventions, see published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). All six worksite cafeterias recruited for the intervention successfully completed the baseline and intervention periods (attrition rate of 0%), attesting to the feasibility of recruiting and retaining eligible worksites (see also Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for the flow of participating sites throughout the study).</p><p id="Par40">The feasibility of implementing the intervention varied greatly between sites, with the proportion of items suitable for labelling ranging from 50% to 99%. In addition, for the items that could be labelled, several barriers to implementation were identified. First, the energy estimates of the cooked meals provided by the sites may have been under- or over-estimated depending on the recipes used. We checked these estimates by comparing the energy content of randomly selected non-packaged items to energy estimates from three published recipes matching the item description. In addition, the precision of the energy estimates of the cooked meals may have been compromised due to meals at some sites being prepared &#x0201c;at the chef&#x02019;s discretion&#x0201d; in using recipes. In the present study we were not able to verify whether the energy estimates provided by the chefs matched their execution of the recipes. Second, the precision of sales data was variable. In one site, all the sales data were manually recorded, and a few other sites sold multiple items under the same till button. The site that manually recorded the data used their stock records to validate the data, and for the few items where the same till button was used to record sales we used the median energy estimate of all items captured under the single button.</p><p id="Par41">The acceptability of the intervention was generally high amongst those who took part in the post-study survey. Very few employees participated in the survey (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;192, approximately 4% of the total number of employees based at the six sites). Participants were asked &#x0201c;<italic>How did you feel about the introduction of calorie labels?&#x0201d;</italic> (rated on a five-point scale from <italic>Very displeased</italic> to <italic>Very pleased</italic>, with an additional option of choosing <italic>Didn&#x02019;t notice the labels</italic>). Of those who completed the survey, 63% were either pleased or very pleased about the introduction of calorie labelling, 18.8% were neither pleased nor displeased, 0.5% were displeased or very displeased, whilst 17.7% reported not noticing the changes in labelling. Participants also responded to the question <italic>&#x0201c;Would you like calorie labels to remain in place permanently?&#x0201d;</italic> (rated on a five-point scale from <italic>No, definitely not</italic> to <italic>Yes, definitely</italic>). The majority (74%) self-reported they would like calorie labelling to remain in place permanently (answering either <italic>Yes, definitely</italic> or <italic>Yes, probably</italic>), 22.9% didn&#x02019;t mind, whilst only 3.1% objected to calorie labelling remaining in place permanently (answering either <italic>No, probably not</italic> or <italic>No, definitely not</italic>). Similarly high levels of acceptability were reported amongst worksite managers during their post-intervention interviews. We carried out a thematic analysis on the points raised by the worksite managers (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for more details on the themes and sub-themes identified). Overall, worksite managers were receptive and highly supportive of the intervention seeing it as adding rather than taking something away from patrons. They commented that the initial implementation of calorie labelling was labour-intensive and time-consuming due to the gathering of information and production of calorie labelling. However, once this was done, the intervention was easy to maintain. The managers were also gratified to note the absence of negative feedback and the high acceptability of the intervention expressed by the cafeteria patrons.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Themes identified from semi-structured interviews with worksite managers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Themes</th><th>Sub Themes</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">Information Provided</td><td>Clear information (5 of 6 Sites)</td><td>

Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1 provides a detailed breakdown of non-compliant items per site and denotes the date when unlabelled items were labelled as per protocol in each site.

The total energy purchased from intervention items per day and week at each site varied widely, revealing different underlying trends at different sites. As can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, graphically presenting the total energy sold at each site revealed the following: (i) time trends in the data, varying by site and by pre- and post-intervention, which had to be accommodated; (ii) strong weekday effects (e.g.<italic>,</italic> with less energy purchased on Fridays); and (iii) regular features in some of the sites that had to be accounted for by dummy variables. For example, at Site 1 there were three staff training days just before the intervention, when many more people used the restaurant; whilst at Site 3 there was a week pre-intervention and a week post-intervention where external people attended meetings, inflating the total daily calories purchased. Finally, at Site 5 there was a regular event on the first Tuesday of almost every month causing an almost doubling of the daily total calories purchased. Although management were unable to determine the cause of this, it was too regular an occurrence to have happened by chance.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Total energy sold per day for intervention items across the six sites with information displayed for day of the week</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12966_2018_671_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par44">Furthermore, as can be seen in the graphical presentation of the transaction data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), at Site 3 the total number of transactions appeared to fall markedly. Investigations suggested that this was due to a change in processing, when a &#x0201c;group transaction&#x0201d; till was introduced on certain days. As transactions were used as a controlling covariate in the primary analysis, this feature also required modelling using a dummy variable.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Transactions per day for intervention items across the six sites with information displayed for day of the week</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12966_2018_671_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par45">Given the small sample size, there was limited scope to include explanatory terms in the modelling. The final model included number of transactions, time relative to the intervention, week-day and the five unusual features across the six sites as covariates.

Alternative models were also examined (see sensitivity analysis below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Primary outcome</title><p id="Par46">There was no overall effect of the intervention: -0.4% (95%CI -3.8 to 2.9, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.803, <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;916.5 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3667) total daily calories).

The conduct of the study was also feasible, with no sites dropping out of the intervention. Post-intervention feedback amongst cafeteria patrons and worksite managers and caterers suggested high levels of acceptability. There was no overall effect of calorie labelling upon energy purchased across six worksite cafeterias. A statistically significant reduction in total calories purchased from intervention items was apparent at Site 1, with an estimated 6.6% reduction, though this effect diminished over time returning to pre-intervention levels after approximately 60&#x000a0;days. The remaining five sites did not show robust changes in energy purchased when calorie labelling was introduced. We discuss first the estimated impact of the calorie labelling intervention and how it fits with prior empirical work before providing more details about the implementation of the intervention.</p><p id="Par53">The direction and the size of the effect at Site 1 fits recent systematic review evidence showing that calorie labelling has the potential to reduce the amount of energy purchased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The lack of a significant reduction in energy purchased in five out of the six worksites may have several explanations relating to barriers to intervention implementation, the nature of the intervention, and site differences. Accordingly, the present findings extend the mixed outcomes from synthesized evidence regarding different choice architecture interventions in worksites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], by showing that calorie labelling may work only in certain settings.</p><p id="Par54">The barriers to effective intervention implementation that could explain the lack of significant effects in five of the six sites, include the differential ability to intervene upon cafeteria products, chef&#x02019;s discretion at implementing cooked meal recipes, till button issues with recording sales data, and freely available foodstuffs in the cafeterias and elsewhere across the worksites. Sites differed in the proportion of cafeteria products that were labelled (50&#x02013;99%), due to availability of energy information. Due to the small sample size and resulting degrees of freedom in analyses, we could not model the moderating effects of partial implementation on the effectiveness of the labelling intervention, however future studies may explore whether the success of the intervention is proportional to the level of intervention implementation.</p><p id="Par55">In four of the six sites (Sites 2, 4, 5 and 6) there were a few items that were recorded under the same till button (e.g.<italic>,</italic> sales of different fizzy drinks recorded under the same till button). Since the different food/drink items may have had different energy content, we calculated the median energy content for the sales records of these till buttons. Since this was not an issue that affected many of the sold items, this should not have unduly influenced the statistical analyses, however it is possible that some of the intervention effect has been masked if energy labelling swayed cafeteria patrons from one item to another represented by the same till button. Catering managers of the six sites identified chef&#x02019;s discretion at implementing meal recipes as an additional barrier to intervention implementation. While this would have affected the accurate estimation of the energy content of food it would be expected to be similar pre- and post-intervention, and should not have unduly affected our results.</p><p id="Par56">Foodstuffs such as confectionery and fruits were available free to employees across the six worksites. Since the sites keep no record of the availability and intake of these freely available foodstuffs, we could not control for this factor in our analyses. Future studies should examine different ways of controlling for this extraneous variable.</p><p id="Par57">Calorie labels were designed to be prominent to the customer at the point of choice, and were presented in the same font style and size as the product price. These features may have also inadvertently decreased the impact of the intervention by making the calorie information less distinguishable from all the other information on the product label, thus dampening the potential impact of calorie labelling. Further studies, including laboratory experiments, are needed to elucidate whether design features of the labels could boost the effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p id="Par58">In addition, the demographic characteristics of the employees across the six sites varied widely which could explain the differences in pre- and post-intervention patterns in food purchasing across the six sites. Due to the small sample size in this pilot trial we were not able to examine the potential moderating effects of the sites&#x02019; demographic composition on calorie labelling. Future work of this nature should aim to increase the sample size to allow the testing of moderation effects. Furthermore, a larger sample size may have helped disentangle the intervention effect from possible time-confounding effects, which is a known limitation of stepped wedge designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par59">This pilot trial is one of the first to measure the impact of calorie labelling across multiple sites over a relatively extended time-period. As such, it is one of the largest studies to date to examine how calorie labelling affects purchasing in worksite cafeterias (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). A further strength of the current study is the use of a stepped wedge design which combines features of within- and between-subjects designs thus allowing the examination of changes in purchasing within each worksite cafeteria depending on the time-period (pre- vs. post-intervention), whilst at the same time allowing examination of differences in purchasing between worksites at different time-points.</p><p id="Par60">The above strengths notwithstanding, this study was limited in several respects. The present study sampled food and grocery industry worksites that wanted to encourage healthier eating amongst their workforce, and as such this may not be a fully representative sample of worksites. Sites were able to provide only aggregate sales data at site level, rather than sales for each individual worker. Additional individual-level data would have provided more power to allow more parameterised models to be fitted. Furthermore, purchasing rather than consumption of energy was the study outcome. This outcome may not reflect the actual consumption of the cafeteria patrons, since food obtained from other sources or food waste is not taken into account. Moreover, the energy content of non-intervention items could not be estimated accurately, thereby precluding the estimation of total energy purchased including both intervention and non-intervention items. Other limitations pertain to the duration of the baseline period as well as the difficulty with modelling the influence of the time-trend within the stepped wedge with a relatively small number of sites. For example, a longer baseline period would have allowed estimates of whether the total daily energy sold was in a steady state pre-intervention. In addition, the unexpected events caused noise within the data making it more difficult to detect possible intervention effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Implications for research and policy</title><p id="Par61">This pilot trial has identified some significant and complex challenges in estimating the effect of calorie labelling in real-world worksite settings. The present findings warrant further research addressing the main possible explanations for a weak or null effect of calorie labelling on sales. Such research includes evaluating the impact of more vivid calorie labels, addressing the barriers to implementation identified, and increasing the number of observations whilst decreasing variability within and between sites. In terms of policy implications, the present findings suggest that calorie labelling may, in certain settings, be effective in reducing the total energy purchased in worksite cafeterias. However, more research is needed to elucidate the boundary conditions that make calorie labelling more or less effective in different settings which might include the socio-demographic composition of worksite employees, prior motivations of employees to reduce energy consumption, as well as any other health initiatives implemented by the worksites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par62">A calorie labelling intervention was acceptable to both cafeteria operators and customers. The predicted effect of labelling to reduce energy purchased was only evident at one out of six sites studied. Before progressing to a full trial, the calorie labelling intervention needs to be optimised, and a number of operational issues resolved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
