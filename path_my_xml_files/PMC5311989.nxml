The aim of this study was 1) to test the performance of a diagnostic system for major depressive disorders (MDD), based on the identification by an ECA of specific symptoms (the MDD DSM 5 criteria) in outpatients; 2) to evaluate the acceptability of such an ECA. Patients completed two clinical interviews in a randomized order (ECA versus psychiatrist) and filled in the Acceptability E-scale (AES) to quantify the acceptability of the ECA. 179 outpatients were included in this study (mean age 46.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.9 years, 57.5% females). Among the 35 patients diagnosed with MDD by the psychiatrist, 14 (40%) patients exhibited mild, 12 (34.3%) moderate and 9 (25.7%) severe depressive symptoms. Sensitivity increased across the severity level of depressive symptoms and reached 73% for patients with severe depressive symptoms, while specificity remained above 95% for all three severity levels. The acceptability of the ECA evaluated by the AES was very good (25.4). We demonstrate here the validity and acceptability of an ECA to diagnose major depressive disorders. ECAs are promising tools to conduct standardized and well-accepted clinical interviews.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Face-to-face clinical interview is the gold standard to diagnose mental disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This type of interview is important for communicating empathy and elicit patients&#x02019; trust in order to collect accurate symptoms essential for a proper diagnosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Different procedures have been proposed to diagnose mental disorders. However a general agreement has been reached to consider guidelines of interview specified in the DSM-5 through a list of criteria to be checked as the most reliable and validated procedure to diagnose a mental disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Apart from diagnosis, severity of the disease can be evaluated through questionnaires that have been used to classify patients with mild, moderate or severe mental disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Several computerized interviews based on questionnaires have been used to evaluate patients with mental disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Moreover, software programs have been used to deliver computer-aided psychotherapy (CP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Such CP have been particularly used to treat patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). For example, The <italic>Beating the blues</italic> CP has been validated by two randomized controlled trials (RCT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and has been recommended for use in the NHS by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). However, none of these programs have been developed as a face-to-face interview to make a diagnosis of mental disorder based on the DSM-5 criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Among software programs, specific virtual agent software has been designed to improve the empathic relation with patients and the acceptability of such solutions. For example, software-driven virtual humans (i.e. embodied conversational agents or ECAs) are able to conduct a clinical interview as a real physician would<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. To do so, ECAs combine verbal, facial and gestural expressions in order to conduct a face-to-face interview<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. They thus attract and maintain the attention of patients by making the interaction more emotionally expressive, socially adapted and empathetic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The SIMSENSEI project by Dr Rizzo and colleagues involved a virtual agent to identify symptoms of depression, anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, these systems have not yet been tested in medical environments to compare the accuracy of a virtual agent versus a trained psychiatrist to diagnose MDD according to the DSM-5 criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>MDD is the most frequent chronic mental disorder and it affects 15% of the general population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. While it accounts for the main burden of all diseases in terms of &#x0201c;years lost due to disability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x0201d;, it is still largely under-diagnosed, possibly owing to the duration of clinical face-to-face interviews necessary to diagnose mood disorders. There is therefore a major challenge to develop innovative computerized tools to improve the diagnosis of mood disorders. DSM-5 has listed specific criteria to diagnose properly an MDD, which are now defined as a standard diagnostic procedure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Using ECA software specifically developed to conduct a face-to-face interview based on the DSM-5 criteria to improve diagnosis of MDD in the general population is thus a major challenge for public health.</p><p>The aim of this study was to develop a dedicated ECA able to conduct a face-to-face interview, identify specific symptoms and to diagnose MMD on the basis of the DSM-5 criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Two hypotheses were tested in the present study. We based the rationale of our work on the principal hypothesis that such an ECA would perform a valid diagnosis of MDD in comparison with a clinical interview conducted by a psychiatrist using the DSM 5 criteria. Because clinical expertise of trained physicians remains the gold standard in psychiatry to validate a diagnosis, we used the clinical interview conducted by a psychiatrist as the reference standard in this study. The secondary hypothesis of our work was that such an ECA would be judged acceptable on an acceptability scale rated by the patients.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Method</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were sleep patients referred to our Sleep Clinic in Bordeaux University Hospital recruited from November 2014 to June 2015 in a consecutive sample design.

ROC curves make it possible to complete the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive report. These parameters are a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups (diseased/normal). Sensitivity is the probability that a test result will be positive when the disorder is present (true positive rate, expressed as a percentage). Specificity is the probability that a test result will be negative when the disorder is not present (true negative rate, expressed as a percentage). Positive predictive value is the probability that the disorder is present when the test is positive (expressed as a percentage). Negative predictive value is the probability that the disorder is not present when the test is negative (expressed as a percentage).

Interestingly, about 20% of our patients seen in the sleep clinic reported MDD. This figure is consistent with previous studies and confirms the high prevalence of depression in the general population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>Patients found the face-to-face interview with the ECA very acceptable according to the AES scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The good level of acceptability suggests that the ECA can communicate empathy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, elicit patient trust, reduce the feeling of being judged by a human and reduce emotional barriers to disclose an affective state. This is in line with previous studies that found that patients readily accepted new technological tools in medicine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. This very encouraging result should prompt more research into extending the use of software-driven virtual humans to other chronic diseases, keeping in mind that clinicians are generally more reticent than patients to use such tools<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>Such ECAs offer the advantage of being potentially in interaction with decision/information systems to develop new medical approaches for managing major chronic diseases and optimizing health care systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Such solutions could be very useful to diagnose chronic diseases early and follow them up, which is very costly and time-consuming for healthcare providers. Moreover, the shortage of physicians combined with an increase in the number of patients due to the ageing of the population highlights the need for new technologies to support physicians in their daily practice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Even if the trend towards the development of electronic health (E-health) solutions is obvious, major challenges remain in their acceptance by patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The quality of human-machine interactions offered by ECAs is of paramount importance to promote their use. However, if ECA becomes the reference in the diagnosis and potential follow-up of patients, it will raise questions on the safety of information collected by the agents so a potential reticence could be observed in the medical community regarding the medical ethics related to these new tools. On the other hand, these systems could be integrated into decision support systems to optimize the follow up of chronic diseases and early interventions to prevent relapses. These new E-solutions now form part of the concept of precision medicine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and are extremely suited to the field of psychiatry where there are no objective paraclinical measures of the symptoms of the patients, unlike in cardiology or neurology (i.e. EKG or CT scan).</p><p>The validity of the MDD diagnosis performed by the ECA in comparison with the gold standard diagnosis of the psychiatrist was satisfactory. Its specificity was also good irrespective of the severity of the depressive symptoms, so the ECA efficiently identified patients without MDD. Sensitivity increased significantly in patients with severe depressive symptoms, showing that the ECA can efficiently diagnose patients with severe MDD. However, its sensitivity was lower in patients with mildly or moderately depressive symptoms so work is required to refine its diagnostic accuracy. Improvements in the ECA&#x02019;s semiologic non-verbal recognition skills (e.g. the ability to recognize facial expression or language prosody) and combining these with the expertise of affective computing research<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> could lead to great progress in the field of psychiatry.</p><p>While face-to-face interviews are the gold standard to diagnose mental disorders, several problems limit the clinician&#x02019;s capacity to conduct them efficiently. Firstly, only a limited time is available with each patient and the latter may feel intimidated about disclosing his/her affective state. Secondly, although such interviews are structured<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, clinicians do not always follow the procedure in accordance with the recommended guidelines, so significant variations may occur. The present proof of concept study shows that ECAs are a promising tool for conducting replicable, standardized and well-accepted clinical interviews in medical settings. Their use could thus save time in the clinician&#x02019;s busy daily schedule and increase the fidelity between different face-to-face interviews. These findings open up future perspectives for implementing ECAs in order to increase the satisfaction of patients with regard to the health-care system. Moreover, they could be incorporated into decision/information systems applied to medicine in order to increase the quality of care in chronic diseases.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Philip, P. <italic>et al</italic>.
