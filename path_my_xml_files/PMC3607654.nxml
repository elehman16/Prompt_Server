Ascorbate is a cofactor for a variety of metalloenzymes that are necessary for the biosynthesis of collagen, carnitine, neurotransmitters, and peptide hormones as well as the regulation of transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Ascorbate also acts as a potent water-soluble antioxidant, with the ability to scavenge a wide variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and regenerate other small molecule antioxidants from their respective radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Humans have lost the ability to synthesize ascorbate from glucose because of mutations in the gene encoding <sc>l</sc>-gulono-&#x003b3;-lactone oxidase, which is the terminal enzyme in the ascorbate biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Therefore, an adequate and regular dietary intake is essential to prevent hypovitaminosis C and the potentially fatal deficiency disease scurvy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Clinical manifestations of scurvy include blood vessel fragility and bleeding, which result in petechial and other hemorrhages, skin changes that result in follicular hyperkeratosis, impaired wound healing, gum swelling and bleeding, joint pain and effusions, anemia, weakness, and fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Many of these symptoms are attributed to the role of ascorbate in collagen and carnitine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>Plasma ascorbate status reflects recent dietary intake, whereas leukocyte concentrations are thought to more closely reflect tissue stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). However, whether leukocytes are an accurate model for the ascorbate status of other tissues is uncertain. Our previous study with vitamin C&#x02013;deficient Gulo knockout mice indicated that the maximal tissue uptake within different organs occurred at varying doses of ascorbate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Thus, the relative uptake of ascorbate by leukocytes may not be representative for all tissues or organs. Although ascorbate has previously been measured in skeletal muscle obtained at autopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the bioavailability of vitamin C to human skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle contains relatively low concentrations of ascorbate compared with in other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), but because of the large amount of skeletal muscle present in the body, it has been estimated to comprise &#x02264;67% of the total body vitamin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) and, thus, represents the major pool of vitamin C in the body. The accumulation of ascorbate in muscle tissue is thought to protect these metabolically active cells against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Therefore, vitamin C is likely to be essential for both skeletal muscle structure and function because of its dual role as an antioxidant and as an enzyme cofactor for collagen and carnitine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>Overall, it is likely that muscle tissue has a high requirement for and turnover of vitamin C. Therefore, the aims of the current study were to investigate the bioavailability of vitamin C to human skeletal muscle in relation to dietary intake and plasma concentrations and to compare this relation to the uptake of ascorbate by peripheral blood leukocytes. Zespri gold kiwifruit (<italic>Actinidia chinensis var. Hort 16A</italic>), which are an outstanding dietary source of vitamin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), were used as the intervention in this study. Our previous human study in which we investigated the bioavailability of vitamin C from gold kiwifruit indicated that the consumption of 0.5 kiwifruit/d resulted in a significant increase of plasma ascorbate concentrations in marginally deficient individuals, whereas the consumption of 2 kiwifruit/d was required to saturate the plasma, as shown by a significant increase in the urinary ascorbate excretion at this dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In the current study, we supplemented participants with 0.5 or 2 kiwifruit/d for 6 wk and measured ascorbate concentrations in plasma, urine, leukocytes, and skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) before and after intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>This study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures that involved human participants were approved by the Upper South Regional Ethics Committee (URA/11/02/003).

Exclusion criteria included being a recent smoker (within the past 1 y), having an allergy or intolerance to kiwifruit, consumption of vitamin C&#x02013;containing supplements (within the past 3 mo), taking prescription medication (within the past 3 mo), excessive alcohol consumption (&#x0003e;21 standard drinks/wk), high fruit and vegetable consumption (&#x0003e;5 servings/d), having diabetes or bleeding disorders, and fainting because of a fear of needles. Anthropometric measures were carried out to determine BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and a fasting venous blood sample was drawn to determine plasma ascorbate concentrations.</p><p>Sample-size calculations indicated that at 80% power and with &#x003b1; = 0.05, a sample size of 15 participants per intervention group would detect a minimum difference of 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol ascorbate/L as determined by using data derived from our vitamin C bioavailability study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). To allow for potential withdrawal because of the length of the study, 36 nonsmoking participants with below-average plasma ascorbate concentrations were enrolled by the study coordinator and provided signed informed consent.</p><p>Two healthy men volunteered to undergo muscle biopsies to act as a comparator group. Their anthropometric data were BMI of 24 and 27 and ages of 31 and 39 y.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study used a parallel-arm design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>), and participants were randomly assigned by the study coordinator into a low-dose group (0.5 kiwifruit/d) or a high-dose group (2 kiwifruit/d) by using a random-numbers chart. Blocking was used to account for the range in prestudy plasma ascorbate concentrations. The study was carried out in a phase I clinical trials unit and comprised a lead-in phase of 5 wk, an intervention phase of 6 wk, and a washout phase of 4 wk. Initially, participants were encouraged to reduce their dietary vitamin C intake by avoiding the consumption of juice and other vitamin C&#x02013;fortified beverages and by substituting high&#x02013;vitamin C&#x02013;containing foods with low&#x02013;vitamin C&#x02013;containing foods. Fasting venous blood samples were drawn weekly throughout the study to monitor participant plasma ascorbate concentrations derived from normal daily diets and the intervention. Twenty-four&#x02013;hour urine and extra blood for leukocyte isolations were collected at baseline (week 5), after intervention (week 11), and after washout (week 15). Muscle biopsies were carried out before and after intervention. Participants also completed 7-d food and beverage records on 4 occasions (at the beginning of the study, before intervention, after intervention, and after washout) to monitor their dietary vitamin C intakes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p>Study design.

At baseline, mean plasma ascorbate concentrations of study participants were marginally deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), and their skeletal muscle tissue ascorbate concentrations were similarly low, with a &#x0223c;3.5-fold uptake of ascorbate by muscle tissue observed after intervention. This uptake was significantly greater than the relative uptake of ascorbate by mononuclear cells and neutrophils, which suggestes that muscle is a more-labile compartment of whole-body vitamin C. Although kiwifruit was used as the source of vitamin C in this study, we (Carr et al, unpublished observations, June&#x02013;August 2012) and other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) have shown no differences in the comparative bioavailability of synthetic and fruit-derived vitamin C.</p><p>We also investigated the previously unreported relation between human skeletal muscle ascorbate status and vitamin C intake and plasma concentrations. Plasma ascorbate is generally thought to reflect recent dietary intake, whereas tissue status and, in particular, leukocyte ascorbate concentrations are thought to be more indicative of the total body status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We showed skeletal muscle ascorbate concentrations were strongly correlated with dietary intake and plasma ascorbate status. The correlations between leukocytes and plasma ascorbate concentrations were weaker, which suggested that muscle is more responsive to changes in circulating ascorbate concentrations than are leukocytes. This effect may reflect either a higher turnover of ascorbate in metabolically active skeletal muscle or differences in uptake between muscle cells and leukocytes.</p><p>Ascorbate is transported into muscle cells primarily via sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2), which is a high-affinity, low-capacity transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Although neutrophils express SVCT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) when their respiratory burst is activated, they primarily transport dehydroascorbic acid (the oxidized form of ascorbate) via the glucose transporters, followed by the intracellular reduction to ascorbate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Thus, the difference in relative uptake of ascorbate between muscle cells and leukocytes could be due to differences in expression concentrations of SVCT2 in each cell type.</p><p>Because muscle tissue appears to comprise a significantly more labile vitamin C pool than leukocytes, it is likely to be prone to depletion when vitamin C intake is inadequate. This inadequacy could have a number of implications. Skeletal muscle fibers are greatly dependent on fatty acid oxidation for their energy requirements, and carnitine plays a vital role in the regulation of skeletal muscle fuel selection and physiologic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Indeed, skeletal muscle contains &#x0223c;98% of the body's total store of carnitine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), and ascorbate is required for its synthesis through its action as a cofactor for the metalloenzymes trimethyllysine hydroxylase and &#x003b3;-butyrobetaine hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Carnitine deficiency has been reported in human skeletal muscle, and deficient biosynthesis has been implicated in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). The effect of vitamin C deficiency on human skeletal muscle carnitine concentrations has not been explored but has been shown to result in a &#x02264;50% reduction in skeletal muscle carnitine in guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Hence, it is possible that muscle concentrations could be similarly decreased in humans. Reduced muscle carnitine is associated with muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>) and may be associated with the symptom of fatigue observed in vitamin C&#x02013;deficient individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that reactive oxygen species are generated in skeletal muscle during exercise, and this generation has been associated with muscle damage and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Although a number of studies have shown that antioxidants such as ascorbate can attenuate the oxidative stress associated with exercise, whether this effect is desirable remains to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Instead, there may be beneficial adaptive responses to elevated concentrations of reactive oxygen species, such as the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, upregulation of redox-sensitive gene expression, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). As such, high-dose vitamin C supplementation is not recommended for athletes who are undergoing endurance exercise training; however, an adequate dietary intake of the vitamin is likely to be required for normal muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of the dietary analysis of our participants, it appears that a mean intake of &#x0223c;70 mg vitamin C/d is sufficient to saturate muscle tissue, whereas an intake of &#x0223c;30 mg/d is clearly inadequate. High nondietary intakes of vitamin C do not appear necessary to replenish normal muscle tissue, and the dietary intakes recommended in the United States and Canada (75 mg vitamin C/d for women and 90 mg vitamin C/d for men) should be sufficient. In contrast, the British and Australasian recommended dietary vitamin C intakes for adults of 40 and 45 mg/d, respectively, may not be sufficient to saturate muscle tissue, and additional studies need to be carried out to establish this.</p><p>Because of potential inaccuracies of dietary intake questionnaires and the variability between vitamin C intake and plasma concentrations in different individuals, due to genetic polymorphisms, smoking status and illness, plasma ascorbate concentrations are generally considered a more accurate marker of vitamin C status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). This relation has been confirmed by our study, whereby we observed a higher correlation between plasma ascorbate concentrations and muscle status than that between vitamin C intake and muscle status. When plasma ascorbate was separated into quintiles, we observed significantly lower muscle ascorbate at plasma concentrations &#x0003c;21 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L and significantly higher muscle ascorbate at plasma concentrations &#x0003e;47 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L. Lykkesfeldt and Poulsen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) suggested that plasma ascorbate concentrations between 23 and 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L should be considered suboptimal, and concentrations &#x0003c;23 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L should be considered deficient, and our muscle data supported this premise. Thus, plasma ascorbate concentrations &#x02265;50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L should be aimed for to optimize muscle tissue status. However, even at plasma ascorbate concentrations &#x02265;60 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol and greater, some individuals presented with relatively low muscle ascorbate concentrations. The reason for this variability is not certain and did not appear to be related to BMI (data not shown).</p><p>An early study by Schaus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) determined that pectoral muscle obtained from 63 individuals at autopsy contained 3.3 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g vitamin C/100 mg wet weight. This concentration is higher than that observed in our postintervention male participants and 2 healthy male volunteers (ie, &#x0223c;1.2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g ascorbate/100 mg wet weight), but likely reflected differences in methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Schaus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) observed higher vitamin C concentrations in the myocardium and pituitary of women; however, Schaus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) reported no significant differences between men and women for pectoral muscle or the cerebral cortex. Therefore, because of sex differences that are known to influence vitamin C status, more studies are needed to confirm if skeletal muscle ascorbate concentrations differ between men and women.</p><p>Overall, we have shown that skeletal muscle ascorbate exhibits a strong association with vitamin C intake and plasma concentrations, which indicated that muscle tissue is very responsive to recent vitamin C intake and, thus, represents a relatively labile pool. This premise was supported by an animal study that showed a mean ascorbate transit time &#x0003c;18 h in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Because of the accessibility and ease of sampling, leukocytes are often used as a model for tissue ascorbate status. However, it is apparent from our study that the uptake of ascorbate into mononuclear cells and neutrophils significantly underestimates the relative uptake of ascorbate into muscle tissue. Because of the multiple potential functions of ascorbate within muscle tissue, a daily vitamin C intake that provides plasma ascorbate concentrations &#x02265;50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L should be consumed to maintain an optimal skeletal muscle ascorbate status.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We express our gratitude to the young men who participated in this study, many of whom showed great dedication and perseverance.
