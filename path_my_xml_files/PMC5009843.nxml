Across the world, midazolam is the most commonly used premedicant in pediatric patients. The fact that no single route has achieved universal acceptance for its administration suggests that each route has its own merits and demerits.

To prevent preoperative anxiety of parental separation, pharmacological intervention by adequate pediatric sedation before induction of anesthesia was found to be more effective than behavioral intervention.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Midazolam, an ideal anxiolytic removes fear and anxiety in children; and makes child calm and sedated for smooth induction of anesthesia and rapid recovery in postoperative period.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Though it is administered by intravenous, intramuscular, rectal, sublingual, oral, and nasal routes, oral and intranasal routes are preferred for pediatric sedation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Earlier studies on midazolam by oral and intranasal routes used parenteral preparation of the drug. For intranasal route, it was used in the form of drops. Their results showed equal efficacy oral and intranasal midazolam or superiority of intranasal midazolam.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Bitter taste of parenteral form of midazolam, a limitation factor and cause for rejection and low compliance by oral route, is overcome by giving midazolam in syrup form.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] For intranasal route, the problem of volume retention in nasal cavity and effective dose availability is solved using concentrated, atomized nasal midazolam spray to have slow and uniform spraying of drug.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, comparative studies of these two forms are meager.</p><p>We used oral midazolam syrup and intranasal midazolam spray as a needleless, painless, user friendly system of drug administration and aimed to compare the efficacy of midazolam for preanesthetic sedation in pediatric patients. We compared effects of oral midazolam syrup and intranasal midazolam spray on sedation and anxiety of child before induction of anesthesia. Hypothesis put forward was that, there would not be difference in sedation level, anxiety level, acceptance of drug, drug response, hemodynamic changes, recovery, and complications when oral midazolam syrup or intranasal midazolam spray was used for pediatric sedation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After obtaining approval from Hospital Ethics Committee, a pilot study was conducted on 10 children from each group (oral and intranasal) to determine sample size. Sample size was determined with the help of software based on WHO publication &#x0201c;Sample size determination in Health Studies&#x0201d; by Lwanga and Lameshow.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Outcome parameter considered was satisfactory sedation score at 20 min. Six out of 10 children in oral group and 9 of 10 children in intranasal group developed satisfactory sedation score of 3 of more at 20 min of administration. A sample size of 18 for each group was adequate to allow power of 80 to detect a difference of 15 between the groups. To generalize the results, we selected a larger size of 30 children in each group.</p><p>This prospective, randomized, clinical study was carried out at a tertiary health care hospital during Sept 2011 to April 2012. Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I children of 1-5 years age group, weighing 8-18 kg scheduled for routine surgeries lasting for &#x0003c;75 min were included in this study. Preanesthetic evaluation was done and patients having upper gastrointestinal tract pathology, nasal infection or any nasal pathology, cyanotic spells, allergy to study drug, taking any other sedative or anti-convulsant medicine were excluded as response to drug may be altered. Investigations like hemoglobin concentration, blood cell count, and urine examination were carried out in all the patients. Blood urea and serum creatinine levels were obtained in patients who were posted for genitourinary surgical procedures. Written informed consent was obtained from the child's parents. To avoid selection bias, odd number children received intranasal midazolam spray and even number children received oral midazolam syrup.</p><p>All the patients were fasted for 4 h for breast milk and 6 h for nonhuman milk or light meal.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] No child received any form of sedation before arrival in the operating room. Baseline sedation score was noted using 5-point scale.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] After recording baseline pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation, Group O received oral midazolam syrup 0.5 mg/kg (2 mg/ml); Group IN received intranasal midazolam spray 0.2 mg/kg with half the dose administered in each nostril (5 mg/ml, each spray delivered 0.1 ml or 0.5 mg). The premedication was given either by the attending anesthesiologist or one of the parents using measuring cap or atomized nasal spray. While receiving oral midazolam or intranasal midazolam spray, the child sat facing forward on the parent's lap while their arms were gently restrained by one parental hand and the other hand used to tilt the forehead back 15&#x000b0;.</p><p>Acceptance of drug was noted as poor (refused to accept medication) - Score 1, moderate (accepted medication with difficulty) - Score 2, or good (accepted medication without complaint) - Score 3.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Children who were crying before drug administration were excluded from the observation of response to drug administration. Response to drug administration was noted as yes or no, depending on whether the child started crying after administration of drug.</p><p>The child was observed in the preoperative room for 20 min and state of sedation, and vital parameters were recorded at 5 min interval. Sedation score was labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 by observing the sedation status of child as agitated, alert, calm, drowsy or asleep respectively. Sedation Score 1 and 2 were considered as unsatisfactory while sedation Score 3, 4, and 5 were considered as satisfactory.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Complications such as nausea, vomiting, nasal irritation, hypoxia and hypertension were noted in both the groups and treated accordingly.</p><p>20 min after drug administration the child was separated from the parent and ease of separation noted as excellent, good, fair and poor. Separation Score 1 (patient un-afraid, co-operative) and Score 2 (slight fear or crying, quiet with assurance) were considered as satisfactory or acceptable and Score 3 (moderate fear, crying not quiet with assurance) and Score 4 (crying, need for restraint) were considered as unsatisfactory or said to have a difficult separation.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In the operation theater, to set up an intravenous line, gaseous induction was done uniformly with oxygen and sevoflurane (4-8%) mask. Acceptance to mask or response to gaseous induction was noted using 3-point criteria. The quality of anesthetic induction was evaluated as excellent, good or poor and score given was 1, 2, or 3. Score 1 and 2 were considered as satisfactory and score 3 was considered as unsatisfactory acceptance of mask.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In all patients, surgery was carried out under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Vital parameters (pulse rate, blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded during intraoperative period. After extubation, patient was shifted to recovery room.</p><p>In the recovery room, vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>) were monitored until the child was fully awake. Using a 10-point recovery room score (which included respiration, activity, consciousness, temperature and circulation, each on a scale of 0-2, to give a maximum cumulative total of 10,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) recovery assessment was done at 10 min intervals for 30 min from the time of extubation. Recovery score of 8 or more considered satisfactory and time taken for it was noted.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In postoperative period, the children were followed up for 24 hours to observe nausea, vomiting, nasal irritation, ulceration, etc.</p><p>All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, and/or number. Demographic data were analyzed by <italic>t</italic>-test and Chi-square test.
