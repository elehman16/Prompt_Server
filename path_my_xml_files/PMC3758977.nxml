Water quality, sanitation, handwashing and nutritional interventions can independently reduce enteric infections and growth faltering. There is little evidence that directly compares the effects of these individual and combined interventions on diarrhoea and growth when delivered to infants and young children. The objective of the WASH Benefits study is to help fill this knowledge gap.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>WASH Benefits includes two cluster-randomised trials to assess improvements in water quality, sanitation, handwashing and child nutrition&#x02014;alone and in combination&#x02014;to rural households with pregnant women in Kenya and Bangladesh. Geographically matched clusters (groups of household compounds in Bangladesh and villages in Kenya) will be randomised to one of six intervention arms or control. Intervention arms include water quality, sanitation, handwashing, nutrition, combined water+sanitation+handwashing (WSH) and WSH+nutrition. The studies will enrol newborn children (N=5760 in Bangladesh and N=8000 in Kenya) and measure outcomes at 12 and 24&#x02005;months after intervention delivery. Primary outcomes include child length-for-age Z-scores and caregiver-reported diarrhoea. Secondary outcomes include stunting prevalence, markers of environmental enteropathy and child development scores (verbal, motor and personal/social). We will estimate unadjusted and adjusted intention-to-treat effects using semiparametric estimators and permutation tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Study protocols have been reviewed and approved by human subjects review boards at the University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, and Innovations for Poverty Action.

Repeated insults from infection and undernutrition in the first years of life are believed to have profound negative consequences on health, cognitive development and human capital that span the life course.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2 R3 R4">2&#x02013;4</xref></p><p>The WASH Benefits study includes cluster randomised trials in Bangladesh and Kenya to address three important research questions related to the early life impacts of WASH and nutritional interventions. The first question is whether WASH and nutritional interventions can prevent linear growth faltering in the first 2&#x02005;years of life. The second is whether greater reductions in diarrhoea can be achieved by combining individual WASH interventions compared to delivering them in isolation. The third is whether the combined WASH and nutritional interventions jointly reduce diarrhoea or improve linear growth more than each component alone. Below, we briefly summarise the rationale for the conduct of randomised trials to address each of these areas of scientific uncertainty.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Question 1: Can WASH and nutritional interventions prevent early life linear growth faltering?</title><p>Children in low-income countries experience severe linear growth faltering in the first 18&#x02013;24&#x02005;months of life that is thought to be preventable, at least in part, by postnatal interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Interventions designed to improve nutrition among very young children measure length for age because it is a reliable, objective measure associated with subsequent child development at older ages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> During this early window, undernutrition and infection likely influence child development and human capital through additional pathways besides linear growth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9 R10">8&#x02013;10</xref> Unfortunately, measuring child development at very young ages is difficult<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> and documenting the full range of intervention impact thus requires longer term follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></p><p>In the first years of life, intervention trials and observational studies have implicated poor diet and infectious diseases as likely causes for a large share of child undernutrition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Interventions to promote breastfeeding, improve complementary feeding practices, or provide nutritional supplements can lead to small improvements in nutritional indicators and length for age,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15 R16">14&#x02013;16</xref> particularly among children who are at highest risk for severe stunting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Nevertheless, effects of nutritional interventions on linear growth (upper bound of 95% CI +0.79 Z-scores)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> fall far short of the median growth deficits observed in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, which are on the order of &#x02013;2.0 Z-scores.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></p><p>One hypothesis for the inability of nutritional interventions alone to prevent a large share of growth faltering by age 24&#x02005;months is that symptomatic and asymptomatic infections are important contributors to undernutrition. Symptomatic infection is common during the first years of life in low-income countries: on average, children under 24&#x02005;months suffer from three to four episodes of acute diarrhoea each year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>; respiratory infections and other infectious diseases, such as malaria, are also common in many settings. Observational studies show that repeated episodes of diarrhoea or parasitic infection are associated with increased risk of stunting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21 R22 R23 R24 R25 R26 R27">21&#x02013;27</xref> and subsequent cognitive deficits in childhood and later in life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Possible mechanisms for enteric infections leading to growth faltering include reduced nutrient absorption through lower intestinal contact time during episodes of acute diarrhoea, greater nutrient losses from persistent diarrhoea (eg, zinc) or intestinal bleeding (eg, hookworm infection), reduced appetite, and diversion of energy and nutrients from growth to the immune system to fight the infection.</p><p>In addition to symptomatic infection, a subclinical condition called environmental enteropathy (EE), also known as tropical enteropathy, may also contribute to early life growth faltering.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30 R31 R32">30&#x02013;32</xref> The aetiology of EE remains unknown, but the condition is generally characterised by a set of physiological changes to the small intestine's epithelial layer, which include villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, reduced absorptive capacity, increased permeability and inflammatory cell infiltration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> The causes are most likely related to repeated ingestion of pathogenic bacteria and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota, which together lead to chronic enteric inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Children with EE are believed to have impaired growth through two mechanisms: (1) reduced nutrient absorption due to decreased surface area in the small (upper) intestine and (2) elevated intestinal permeability, which increases translocation of antigenic molecules that stimulate the immune system and divert energy from growth. The combined effect of these two processes may impair a child's ability to effectively utilise nutrients in the existing diet for growth and development. EE is thought to be highly prevalent in low-income countries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> and develops early in life: by age 8&#x02005;months, 95% of a birth cohort in the Gambia showed signs of EE and on average children in the cohort exhibited signs of EE during 75% of their first year of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Studies of Peace Corps volunteers and immigrant populations have demonstrated that intestinal malabsorption and permeability typically return to normal levels within 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;years after individuals move from highly contaminated environments to cleaner environments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> Since community-based studies that measure intestinal structure through biopsies would be extremely difficult, investigators typically rely on biomarkers of intestinal permeability, inflammation and immune system stimulation as measures of subclinical EE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></p><p>It is possible that improved nutrition alone can reduce the negative effects of a limited number of episodes of infection on growth due to the improved ability of better-nourished children to fight off enteric infections and exhibit catch-up growth during the convalescent period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39 R40 R41 R42">39&#x02013;42</xref> Effective nutritional interventions may be able to prevent or shorten the duration of EE via several mechanisms, such as (1) strengthening epithelial barrier integrity and the immune response; (2) compensating for malabsorption, reallocation or losses of key nutrients during infection; (3) accelerating gut repair following infection; and (4) favouring the growth of beneficial gut microorganisms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> While it is possible that nutritional interventions alone may prevent or shorten the duration of EE, the limited evidence to date has been mixed,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> with some evidence for improvements in gut function following vitamin A,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> alanyl-glutamine supplementation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> and zinc supplementation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref> but there is no evidence for gut function improvement in trials that delivered probiotics,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> glutamine supplementation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> omega-3 fatty acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> or richly fortified complementary foods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref> As noted above, in many studies nutritional interventions have been insufficient to completely prevent growth faltering in low-income populations and in the context of repeated or chronic infection, improved nutrition may only be able to mitigate&#x02014;but not necessarily overcome&#x02014;some of the effects of enteric infection on growth. If acute infections and subclinical EE contribute significantly to growth faltering, then interventions to reduce enteric infections during the first years of life would be expected to improve linear growth, perhaps independent of nutritional interventions.</p><p>Unlike the large literature on child nutritional interventions, we are aware of only 10 studies that measure the effect of WASH interventions on child growth; a forthcoming systematic review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref> may perhaps identify more. Four studies have found no improvement in linear growth as a result of WASH interventions, despite demonstrating reductions in caregiver-reported diarrhoea in most cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52 R53 R54 R55 R56">52&#x02013;56</xref> A small randomised trial that enrolled children &#x0003c;12&#x02005;months and delivered handwashing promotion in Kathmandu slums additionally found no improvements in EE biomarkers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref> The authors hypothesised that handwashing alone was inadequate as sufficient protection from the slum environment to change intestinal physiology and suggested that more comprehensive environmental improvements may be necessary to reduce EE and improve growth.</p><p>Six studies have found positive associations between improved WASH conditions and child growth. Multiple cross-sectional or case&#x02013;control studies found that young children living in households with improved sanitation and water supply had better linear growth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref> A prospective birth cohort study in periurban Peru found that children living in households with home water supply and sewerage connections were 1&#x02005;cm taller by age 24&#x02005;months compared with children in households without them, and the effects of water supply and sewerage conditions were not mediated entirely by reductions in diarrhoea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref> A water quality intervention trial in rural Kenya found an average linear growth increase of 0.8&#x02005;cm among children &#x0003c;5&#x02005;years old after 1&#x02005;year of exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60 R61 R62">60&#x02013;62</xref> A prospective cohort from rural Bangladesh enrolled in a pilot for this study found that children raised in households with improved sanitation, hygiene and water quality conditions had lower levels of parasite infection, better growth and improved EE biomarkers compared to children raised in households without such access.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref> A trial to assess the impact of rural sanitation on diarrhoea includes length for age as a secondary outcome but is still underway.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref> Taken together, the mixed evidence to date does not conclusively link improved WASH conditions with improved child growth and the field would benefit from additional efficacy studies.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Question 2: Are combined WASH interventions more effective than single interventions?</title><p>In addition to quantifying the independent effects of WASH interventions, an important question is whether and how to combine sanitation, water quality and handwashing promotion interventions to cost-effectively achieve health gains. Many implementing groups have publicly embraced the notion that combining interventions to improve water quantity, water quality, sanitation, and hygiene results in added benefits. This claim is based, in part, on observational studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref> and theoretical modelling of pathogen transmission pathways.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref> However, the limited available evidence from randomised trials does not support this approach. In the only randomised controlled trial specifically designed to evaluate combined interventions, the two interventions evaluated were point-of-use water treatment and handwashing promotion with soap; individually, each intervention reduced child diarrhoea (51% and 64% reduction), but there was no additional reduction in diarrhoea among children exposed to both interventions (55% reduction).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref> These findings are consistent with the results of a meta-analysis of published interventions to improve WASH, which found that combined interventions led to no greater reduction in diarrhoeal disease than single interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></p><p>For WASH programmes, single interventions are less expensive and easier to scale than combined interventions. By complicating communication and behaviour change, combined interventions can potentially diminish the overall effect achievable from a single intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref> Understanding the marginal benefits of sanitation, water treatment and handwashing in the absence and presence of each of the other interventions will, therefore, be important for policy-makers (1) when deciding overall budgets for sanitation, water and handwashing; and (2) when weighing the trade-offs between allocating resources to an intense, expensive approach combining multiple interventions in a single site, or choosing the most cost-effective interventions and rolling them out at scale. This same reasoning applies to our third research question.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Question 3: Are there larger effects on diarrhoea or linear growth from combining (A) nutritional interventions with (B) a combined water, sanitation and handwashing intervention compared to each component alone?</title><p>In the 1960s, Scrimshaw <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref> proposed a theory that repeated infections interact with poor nutrition to cause a cycle of infection and malnutrition. Consistent with this earlier work, McDade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref> outlined a life history theory of immune function in which he posited that infants face a resource allocation trade-off between maintenance (fighting infection and physiological repair) and growth. During infection, the immune system diverts energy and nutrients away from growth; a developing infant prioritises survival and maintenance over growth. When resources are limited, the absolute level of energy or nutrients available to infants can be a major determinant of growth and physiological repair. An impaired gut in a child without access to sufficient energy or nutrients will further suffer from impaired healing, with subsequent decline in gut function and nutrient absorption for growth; thus begins a vicious cycle between infection and malnutrition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref> The potential contribution of infection to malnutrition and mortality risk was recently illustrated in a dramatic 35% reduction in all-cause mortality among severely malnourished Malawian children after the provision of prophylactic antibiotics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></p><p>Dewey and Mayers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> reviewed the evidence for the potential interaction between nutrition and infection on early child growth. The review identified just one study that suggested that infections could reduce the effectiveness of nutritional interventions and four trials that demonstrated that improved nutrition could limit the negative consequences of infection.

The nutrition intervention included growth monitoring, food supplementation for children who were not growing well and nutrition education. The medical care intervention improved access to vaccines and morbidity surveillance for acute illness. Both nutritional and medical service villages also received prenatal care for pregnant mothers, which included iron and folic acid supplements as well as food supplements for mothers who were underweight. The study found that the medical services intervention improved height and weight compared to control, and that the nutritional services intervention improved height and weight even more. The study found no additional benefit in combining nutrition and medical services above the nutritional services alone with respect to height and weight.

Our target sample size of pregnant women at enrolment is 5760 in Bangladesh and 8000 in Kenya. The Kenya cohort will be larger because we expect to find more variation in child length for age than in Bangladesh (sample size details below). Within study compounds, the study enrols all children &#x0003c;36&#x02005;months at baseline to measure diarrhoea outcomes over the study period; the study measures diarrhoea outcomes in a wider age group because older children are still at high risk for diarrhoeal disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></p><p>In both countries, compounds consist of multiple households (typically 3&#x02013;10 in Bangladesh and 1&#x02013;4 in Kenya), usually comprising blood relatives, who share a common courtyard. Compounds are eligible to participate if (1) they have a pregnant woman and (2) the woman plans to stay in the village for the next 12&#x02005;months. The study excludes households who do not own their home to help mitigate attrition during follow-up. The Kenya trial excludes villages that have chlorine dispensers at water sources installed by programmes separate from the present study. In Bangladesh, the study excludes households who report high iron in their drinking water most of the year because pilot studies showed it was difficult to maintain the appropriate chlorine residual for continued disinfection in high-iron water. In cases in which the respondent is unsure about iron content, field staff check the water's chlorine demand using Aquatabs and a digital Hach Pocket Colorimeter II; if residual chlorine is below 0.2&#x02005;mg/L after 30&#x02005;min staff exclude the household.

WASH Benefits is designed to measure intervention effects under conditions of high uptake in our target populations since our central hypotheses have not been tested rigorously in randomised studies. The enabling technologies and behavioural intervention packages were developed in the target populations over a 2-year period before the start of the trials. Details of the behaviour change theoretical frameworks and methods used in each country will be published in separate, forthcoming articles. Local promoters who are residents of the study villages deliver the interventions at the cluster level; each promoter completes at least 5&#x02005;days of training and also attends refresher courses periodically throughout the study period. Promoters visit and counsel study compounds weekly in the early phase of intervention, with visits declining in frequency over time; we anticipate visits as infrequent as one per month after 1&#x02005;year of intervention.</p><p>The environmental interventions in this study focus on modifying the compound environment to reduce infant exposure to enteric pathogens. The interventions focus on compound-level modifications because we assume that the dominant transmission pathways for the infants in our study will be within the compound. Since we expect on average 8&#x02013;10 household-compounds with eligible children per study cluster, we expect to intervene in a small fraction of each community. While point-of-use water quality, hygiene and nutrition interventions operate at a household level, some sanitation interventions may require wider coverage in a neighbourhood, community or other larger environment in order to effectively mitigate personal exposure. However, cost and logistical limitations prevented us from extending implementation beyond the compound. Furthermore, a pilot study suggested that the compound was a relevant unit of intervention for modifying infant exposure to environmental conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Control</title><p>It is possible that the simple act of regular visits by intervention promoters could lead to improvements in the primary outcomes through unknown channels that are independent of WASH or nutrition interventions. The WASH Benefits team discussed this possibility extensively in the year preceding the trials and the teams agreed to pursue slightly different strategies in the two countries. The Bangladesh team concluded that their intervention behaviour change model is so tightly integrated into the enabling technology components that the effect of a visit is inseparable from the WASH and nutrition interventions themselves; moreover, it is fairly common for mothers in the study area to be visited by community promoters associated with other programmes. The control arm in Bangladesh will be a &#x02018;passive&#x02019; control, meaning there is no promotion or intervention activity during the study.</p><p>The Kenya team was more concerned about the possibility of the promotion visits leading to changes in behaviours not related to WASH or nutrition that could nonetheless affect the primary outcomes since promoter visits are atypical in the Kenyan study area. For this reason, the Kenya team decided to include promoters in their control arm and to add a simple activity across all arms of the study: monthly measurement of mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) or measuring the pregnant woman's belly circumference prior to the birth. The key assumption for the Kenya design is that whatever non-WASH-related or nutrition-related behaviour changes occur in the intervention arms will also occur in the control arm. The Kenya control arm promoters do not promote any WASH, or nutrition messages, and strictly engage in measuring child MUAC and mother belly circumference. In all arms, children &#x0003e;6&#x02005;months old with MUAC &#x0003c;115&#x02005;mm are classified as severely malnourished and are referred to treatment (details mentioned below in Referral guidelines).</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Water quality</title><p>The Bangladesh study delivers a 10&#x02005;L, insulated water storage vessel and a free supply of chlorine tablets (Aquatabs brand, sodium dichloroisocyanurate) to enrolled households to improve the microbiological quality of their drinking water.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref> The Kenya study installs chlorine dispensers within the cluster boundary at public water sources used by study participants. All community members will be able to use the dispensers. After filling their water collection container (typically a 20&#x02005;L plastic jerry can) at the source, users can place the container under the dispenser and turn a knob to release 3&#x02005;mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite, an amount designed to yield 2&#x02005;mL/L of free chlorine residual after 30&#x02005;min for 20&#x02005;L of water.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref> The Kenya study also includes community level promotion of dispenser use and all households in the study compound receive bottles of sodium hypochlorite (6&#x02005;months&#x02019; supply) to facilitate householders&#x02019; water treatment during periods when they rely on rainwater harvesting (common during the rainy season) or if they use a water source in which a dispenser has not been installed. In both countries, the behaviour change strategies target the consistent provision of treated water to all children living in the household.</p></sec><sec id="s2c4"><title>Sanitation</title><p>Both the Bangladesh and Kenya studies include three enabling technologies in the compound-level sanitation intervention with the goals of reducing children's exposure to faeces in the household environment and increasing latrine use: (1) a locally developed sani-scoop dedicated to the removal of child and animal faeces from the compound,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref> (2) plastic child potties for children aged 6&#x02005;months and older until they use the latrine and (3) a new or upgraded latrine for each household in the compound. In Bangladesh, latrines are upgraded to a dual pit latrine with a water seal and super structure. In Kenya, plastic latrine slabs that include a tightly fitting hole-cover are installed to improve existing latrines that have a mud or wood floor. Simple pit latrines (unlined pits with an earthen superstructure and the plastic slab) are constructed in the compounds of study participants who do not have access to a latrine. The behaviour change strategies in both countries target the use of the latrine for defaecation and the safe disposal of faeces by all households in the compound to prevent contact by young children.</p></sec><sec id="s2c5"><title>Handwashing</title><p>Both country studies install two handwashing stations for enrolled households: one near the latrine and one near the cooking area. In Bangladesh, handwashing stations include a locally made bucket with a tap fitting (40&#x02005;L near the latrine and 16&#x02005;L near the cooking area), a stool, a bowl and a bottle to dispense soapy water. In Kenya, handwashing stations are constructed from locally available materials and include a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to two 5&#x02005;L jerry cans of clean water and soapy water.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref> In both countries the studies provide soap to families free of charge to replenish the handwashing stations. The behaviour change strategies of the intervention target handwashing with soapy water messaging at two critical times for caregivers: after defaecation/cleaning the child's anus and before food preparation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref> Promoters frame the concept of handwashing as a nurturing behaviour facilitated by the ease and convenience of a nearby handwashing station.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c6"><title>Combined water+sanitation+handwashing</title><p>In both countries, the combined water+sanitation+handwashing (WSH) intervention integrates all intervention components from the water quality, sanitation and handwashing arms. Intervention promoters sequence the interventions so that they are not introduced at the same time. In Bangladesh, the interventions are delivered sequentially in the following order: sanitation, handwashing and water treatment, with a minimum of 21&#x02005;days between each start date. In Kenya, all intervention technologies aside from latrine construction are provided at the same time but the behaviour change counselling is rolled out in the following sequence approximately spaced around 2&#x02005;weeks apart: handwashing and basic water treatment, sanitation, in-depth water treatment. The provision of latrines can range from one to several weeks after the start of work in a cluster in Kenya. The behaviour change strategy emphasises the interconnected aspect of WASH and the need to practice all behaviours in order to benefit from them.</p></sec><sec id="s2c7"><title>Nutrition</title><p>In both countries, the nutrition intervention strategy targets age-appropriate behaviours (pregnancy to 24&#x02005;months) including use of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs; aged 6&#x02013;24&#x02005;months).

LNS is administered daily using 10&#x02005;g sachets that can be mixed into pre-prepared meals (eg, porridge) or consumed directly from the sachet; a child eats two sachets per day. LNS is intended to supplement&#x02014;and not replace&#x02014;breastfeeding and locally available complementary foods, by providing 118&#x02005;kcal/day and including a broad suite of essential fatty acids and micronutrients at dosages appropriate for children in this age group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref> It has an 18-month shelf life, does not spoil at high temperatures and costs as little as US$0.08/day.

If an intervention has poor uptake, the team then needs to consider modifying or redoubling implementation efforts in that arm. To preserve external validity, each country team will document any adaptive changes used to modify the intervention. Investigators will be blinded to outcomes from the trial, so any adaptation to intervention will be based solely on information about intervention implementation and uptake.</p><p>Both country teams have in place a detailed implementation monitoring system. One of the outputs from the monitoring system is a summary of whether the implementation has achieved a limited set of critical benchmarks (see online supplementary appendix 2); benchmarks are intended to flag serious problems in implementation. If any of the uptake measures falls below its critical benchmark, then a qualitative team will review the monitoring and process documentation in the low-performing area, visit the site of the low uptake, meet with intervention promoters, supervisors and study participants and troubleshoot the cause of the low uptake. Because the interventions have each been piloted and the pilots achieved these benchmarks of uptake, we expect that uptake below the benchmark will indicate a problem where the intervention was not implemented as planned, and the investigation will identify what additional training or other support is required to achieve high intervention uptake.</p><p>Additional principles that we will follow with respect to adapting the interventions include:

The randomisation is pair-matched by geography, with adjacent clusters randomised in blocks. The rationale for using geography to match the randomisation is that it is logistically feasible; it may add efficiency to our effect estimation if geography is strongly correlated with our outcomes and it will help ensure that the different arms are balanced with respect to characteristics and events that are spatially clustered. In Bangladesh, the trial will randomise groups of eight geographically proximate clusters to one of the six intervention arms or the double-sized control arm with allocation probabilities of 2/8 for control and 1/8 for each intervention arm. In Kenya, the randomisation is identical but includes nine proximate clusters in each block with allocation probabilities of 2/9 for active control, 1/9 for each intervention arm and 1/9 for a potential passive control (not yet funded). Clusters allocated to a passive control arm in Kenya will enable the study to measure the effect of regular visits to the study's active control arm, if any, pending future funding.</p><p>The randomisation sequence generation and allocation for both trials will be conducted by the coordinating team at the University of California, Berkeley, using a random number generator in Stata V.12 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA) with a reproducible seed. Owing to the nature of the interventions, participants are not blinded to their treatment assignment. Principal investigators and primary analysts for the trial will remain blinded to the randomised group assignments until the primary analysis is complete. Cluster-level assignments will be under control of each country's lead data manager in separate data files that are independent from the main datasets of the study. Access to the treatment assignment information (even if blinded), will be limited to the core analysis team in each country until the primary results are published.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculations were based on the two primary outcomes: LAZ and caregiver-reported diarrhoea. We calculated the minimum detectable effect for LAZ measured at 2&#x02005;years using a standard equation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref> and for diarrhoea using a simulation-based approach to accommodate two levels of correlation in the outcome (within child and within cluster).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref> To inform our sample size calculations we used existing datasets from relevant populations. In Bangladesh, we used diarrhoea and anthropometric measurements from 982 children &#x0003c;36&#x02005;months, collected from 100 rural villages between 2007 and 2009.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">110</xref> In Kenya, we conducted the sample size calculations using diarrhoea data, collected from 1704 children in 95 control villages enrolled in a cluster-randomised trial of spring protection conducted in Western Province between 2005 and 2007<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>; we also conducted the sample size calculation with LAZ measurements from 310 children 4&#x02013;30&#x02005;months old in a pilot study in our study region. We selected final designs in each country to detect differences of +0.15 in LAZ and a relative risk of diarrhoea of 0.7 or smaller for a comparison of any intervention with the double-sized control arm. We chose the effect size for LAZ based on our team's expert opinion of the smallest effect that would be biologically meaningful and measurable given measurement error in field conditions (+0.15 Z equals 0.48&#x02005;cm in a 24-month-old girl). We chose the effect size for diarrhoea based on earlier WASH efficacy studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref> The control arm is double sized because it will be used in multiple hypothesis tests and, given available information, a 2:1 allocation ratio is close to the optimal allocation that minimises the variance for the six tests planned under our first hypothesis, below.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">112</xref>

Let Y be an outcome of interest and let T index the randomised group assignment, where T&#x02208; (C, W, S, H, WSH, N, NWSH).

Let Z be a set of indicators for matched blocks used in the randomisation. Finally, let &#x003c8; denote parameters of interest. In each comparison below, we define &#x003c8; as a difference between various randomised groups. For dichotomous outcomes like diarrhoea, this implies a risk difference.

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between intervention and control. The same control group (double sized) will be used in every comparison. The parameters of interest are the difference in means between the intervention groups and the control group.

Since the trials depart from an individually randomised design, we will bootstrap the dataset, resampling clusters in matched blocks with replacement and re-estimate our parameters of interest. Resampling matched blocks preserves the correlation structure in the data and retains any efficiency gains from the matched randomisation. Since we will have a large number of units to resample, the asymptotic assumptions will be reasonable, the bootstrap distribution will be smooth and percentile-based CIs will be accurate for all parameters of interest. We will examine the bootstrap estimate of the sampling distribution to confirm these assumptions. The SDs of the bootstrap distributions will provide estimates of SE.</p><p>We will complement our unadjusted analyses with a second set of estimates that are conditional on baseline covariates to potentially increase the efficiency of our analysis and reduce bias from any chance imbalances in prognostic covariates despite randomisation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">125</xref> It is straightforward to extend permutation tests to include covariate adjustment while still taking advantage of the exact distribution theory provided by randomised inference.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">118</xref>
