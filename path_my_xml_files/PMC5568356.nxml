Combination immunochemotherapy, such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR), is now standard first-line therapy. However, the majority of patients relapse and require further therapy, and so new, effective, targeted therapies that improve remission rates, reduce relapses, and have fewer side effects, are required. The FLAIR trial will assess whether ibrutinib plus rituximab (IR) is superior to FCR in terms of progression-free survival (PFS).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">FLAIR is a phase III, multicentre, randomised, controlled, open, parallel-group trial in patients with previously untreated CLL. A total of 754 participants will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive standard therapy with FCR or IR. Participants randomised to FCR will receive a maximum of six 28-day treatment cycles. Participants randomised to IR will receive six 28-day cycles of rituximab, and ibrutinib taken daily for 6&#x000a0;years until minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity has been recorded for the same amount of time as it took to become MRD negative, or until disease progression. The primary endpoint is PFS according to the International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) criteria.

The incidence of CLL increases with age and twice as many men are affected as women. CLL results from the clonal proliferation of B-cells and is diagnosed by the pattern of expression of various cell surface antigens on the CLL cells. Patients most commonly present with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and systemic symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss and malaise. The clinical course of CLL is highly variable with a median survival from diagnosis in the region of 7&#x000a0;years. Patients with more advanced disease (Binet&#x02019;s stages B, C and progressive stage A) have a significantly worse survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Therapy for CLL</title><p id="Par47">Over the last few years there has been substantial improvement in the treatment of CLL. First-line therapy has moved away from monotherapy using chlorambucil to combination immunochemotherapy such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) following evidence from large randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. FCR is the standard therapy, shown to improve survival over comparable treatments in fit and/or young patients, but only 75% tolerate a full six cycles. In addition, there is a small risk of developing late myelodysplasia and acute leukaemia, thought to be due to the FC chemotherapy. The majority of patients relapse and require further therapy that is more difficult to administer, and associated with significant morbidity and potential mortality. Eventually the majority of patients die from CLL. Hence, more effective, targeted therapies that improve remission rates and reduce relapses, with fewer side effects, are required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ibrutinib</title><p id="Par48">The proliferation of CLL cells in vivo is dependent on signalling through the B-cell receptor (BCR) which is expressed at low levels on CLL cells. BCR activation leads to the transduction of signals through a series of intracellular molecules resulting in CLL cell proliferation. This provides a series of potential therapeutic targets on the BCR signalling pathway. Bruton&#x02019;s tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a key component of the BCR pathway to the extent that individuals born with mutated Btk produce no B-cells. Ibrutinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] is an orally administered, small molecule selective irreversible inhibitor of Btk currently under investigation in B-cell malignancies including CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). In vitro, ibrutinib inhibits purified Btk and selected members of the kinase family with 10-fold specificity compared with off-target kinases. Ibrutinib has shown extremely promising results in relapsed, refractory CLL as well as in a small number of treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Rationale for proposed study</title><p id="Par49">Combination chemotherapy with FCR has been shown to be an effective treatment in patients with CLL who are able to tolerate it. However, FCR is associated with significant short- and long-term toxicity with virtually all patients relapsing and eventually becoming refractory to therapy before dying, either as a complication of the disease or its therapy (usually due to infection). Clear evidence that CLL-cell proliferation is dependent on stimulation through the B-cell receptor presents new potential targets for CLL treatment, particularly since this pathway is specific to B-cells. Several molecules on the B-cell receptor pathway have been targeted including Syk, PI3K delta and Btk, and all demonstrate activity. Of these agents it appears that ibrutinib is the most potent agent with relatively minor side effects in the early phase II trials, and the combination of ibrutinib with a monoclonal antibody should lead to a more rapid achievement of an objective response with the potential to stop ibrutinib earlier than with monotherapy. Therefore, the combination of ibrutinib and rituximab is a logical way to improve the therapy in CLL.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trial aims and objectives</title><p id="Par50">The trial aims to compare the effect on progression-free survival (PFS) of ibrutinib plus rituximab (IR) with that of FCR in young/fit patients with previously untreated CLL.</p><p id="Par51">The primary objective of the trial is to assess whether IR is superior to FCR in terms of PFS, as defined by IWCLL criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

The German CLL8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] trial showed a median PFS rate of 4.5&#x000a0;years in the FCR arm. To assess a superiority hazard ratio of 0.75 (that is, an improvement in median PFS to 6&#x000a0;years) with an overall 5% level of significance and 80% power, assuming a 4-year recruitment and a 4-year follow-up period, 355 participants are required per arm (710 participants overall). Accounting for a 5% dropout rate, which is in line with previous Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research (LICTR)-led trials in similar populations, 748 participants are required in order to observe 379 events.</p><p id="Par61">A formal interim analysis on PFS will be carried out and reported to the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) when half the required number of events have been observed.

In order to account for the interim analysis, the O&#x02019;Brien and Fleming method recommends increasing the maximum required sample size and number of events by a factor of 1.008. Therefore, 754 participants will be recruited to the FLAIR trial in order to observe 382 events (191 for the interim analysis).</p><p id="Par63">In order to recruit 754 participants over a 4-year period, the recruitment target is seven patients per month for the first 6&#x000a0;months whilst centres are opening to recruitment and 17 patients per month thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p id="Par64">Participants will be recruited from multiple research centres from around the UK.

Current treatments for CLL are moving away from standard chemotherapy regimens given over 6&#x000a0;months, towards longer-term treatment with more targeted small molecules. Treatment with ibrutinib is attractive to patients due to its oral administration and apparent low toxicity profile compared with FCR. In England, ibrutinib is currently only available through clinical trials in the front-line treatment setting for patients without the 17p deletion, and thus recruitment into the trial has been positive and above target.</p><p id="Par103">However, the superiority of ibrutinib over the most effective chemoimmunotherapy (FCR) has yet to been demonstrated and the long-term effects of ibrutinib have yet to be fully determined. This trial will follow up participants until death to understand the durability of any response over FCR.</p><p id="Par104">Novel, small molecules, such as ibrutinib, have a significant financial cost compared with FCR and so it is vital to collect health economic data. Ibrutinib is currently licensed for continuous use until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
