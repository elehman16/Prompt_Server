This study was performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of fimasartan and rosuvastatin when coadministered or administered alone as a single dose or as multiple doses to healthy Caucasians.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-six subjects were enrolled into an open-labeled, randomized, 6-sequence, 3-period, 3-way crossover study, and randomly received fimasartan (120 mg), rosuvastatin (20 mg) or both. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected up to 48 hours for fimasartan and 72 hours for rosuvastatin after the last dosing and plasma concentrations of study drugs were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to the last measurable time (AUC<sub>last</sub>), maximum plasma concentration at steady state (<italic>C</italic><sub>max,ss</sub>) and AUC to the end of the dosing period at steady state (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub>) were estimated using a non-compartmental method. Safety and tolerability were evaluated throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty subjects completed the study. After single dose administration, the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of fimasartan with or without rosuvastatin were 0.95 (0.80&#x02013;1.14) and 0.98 (0.91&#x02013;1.07) for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub>, respectively. The corresponding values for rosuvastatin with or without fimasartan were 1.32 (1.16&#x02013;1.50) and 0.97 (0.89&#x02013;1.05), respectively. After administration of multiple doses, the GMRs (90% CIs) for <italic>C</italic><sub>max,ss</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub> of fimasartan with or without rosuvastatin were 0.94 (0.74&#x02013;1.20) and 1.07 (0.90&#x02013;1.16), respectively. The corresponding values for rosuvastatin with or without fimasartan were 1.16 (1.02&#x02013;1.32) and 0.86 (0.79&#x02013;0.94), respectively. A total of 74 adverse events (AEs) were reported and incidences of AEs did not increase significantly with co-administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Co-administration of fimasartan and rosuvastatin did not result in clinically relevant changes in the systemic exposure of fimasartan or rosuvastatin after single and multiple administrations, and they were well tolerated.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>fimasartan</kwd><kwd>rosuvastatin</kwd><kwd>drug interaction</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>angiotensin II receptor antagonist</kwd><kwd>healthy subjects</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are now the leading cause of death globally.<xref rid="b1-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There are several risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol levels, and obesity.<xref rid="b3-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Among those factors, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are the 2 major contributing risk factors for CVD and many studies reported that it is important to control both factors to reduce morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In clinical practice, statins are commonly prescribed in combination with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).<xref rid="b6-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The co-administration of statins with ARBs was demonstrated to effectively reduce cardiovascular risk and enhance the inhibitory effect of ARBs on oxidative stress.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system (RAAS) is an important regulator of cardiovascular function and fluid-electrolyte homeostasis.

The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last measurable time point (AUC<sub>last</sub>) and area under the concentration-time curve during a dosing interval for tau from time 0 to 24 hours at steady state were calculated using the linear trapezoidal with linear interpolation method. A steady-state analysis was performed on the ln-transformed predose C<sub>trough</sub> concentrations on days 8, 9, and 10 using Helmert contrasts. Steady state was concluded at the time point where no more statistical difference (&#x003b1;=5%) was observed from 2 comparisons; 1) C<sub>trough</sub> day 8 vs mean of (C<sub>trough</sub> day 9 and C<sub>trough</sub> day 10), 2) C<sub>trough</sub> day 9 vs C<sub>trough</sub> day 10. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time (AUC<sub>inf</sub>) was calculated as the sum of the AUC<sub>last</sub> and the last quantifiable concentration divided by the slope of the final decline portion of the individual log-linear concentration-time curve. The maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), the time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) and maximum observed concentration at steady state; maximum concentration between dose time and dose time adding tau (at <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) (maximum plasma drug concentration at steady state [<italic>C</italic><sub>max,ss</sub>]) were taken directly from the observed values. The apparent clearance was calculated by dividing the dose by the AUC.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability assessment</title><p>Safety and tolerability were assessed in every subject who received at least 1 or more doses of study drugs. Safety and tolerability were evaluated by 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and all types of adverse events (AEs). Summary statistics for the 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory safety tests were computed and provided, as deemed clinically appropriate. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 19.0) and were summarized by treatment for the number of subjects reporting the AE and the number of AEs reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.3., SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and the level of significance was set at 0.05. Continuous variables were summarized using the number of observations (n), arithmetic mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum. Frequency counts were reported for categorical data when appropriate. The effect of administration on the PK parameters was assessed using the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of combination treatment to fimasartan or rosuvastatin alone for AUC<sub>last</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> after a single dose, AUC to the end of the dosing period at steady state (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub>), and <italic>C</italic><sub>max,ss</sub> after multiple doses.

Ratios of LSM were calculated using the exponentiation of the difference between treatment LSMs from the analyses on the ln-transformed parameters. These ratios were expressed as a percentage relative to the reference treatments. For safety and tolerability assessment, the number of AEs and subjects who had AEs was counted by treatment group. The results of vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory tests were also reviewed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study subjects</title><p>A total of 36 subjects entered the study and were randomized to study treatment, 6 of whom dropped out prior to completion of study, 3 subjects were excluded due to AEs (1 subject in sequence 4 who suffered an accident discontinued the study; 1 subject in sequence 4 was discontinued from the study after developing moderate epididymo-orchitis, the other subject in sequence 4 discontinued the study after experiencing ECG changes consistent with mild paroxysmal atrial flutter); 2 subjects in sequence 6 discontinued due to positive drug or alcohol lab tests; 1 subject in sequence 1 discontinued due to violation of procedural rules.

It is selectively transported from blood to liver by organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) which is encoded solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 1B1 gene.<xref rid="b25-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The OATP1B1 plays an important role for hepatobiliary elimination of fimasartan together with OATP2B1, and OATP1B3. Considering fimasartan and rosuvastatin are both substrates of OATP1B1, inhibition of OATP1B1 by fimasartan may explain the increase in rosuvastatin maximum exposure due to lower hepatic uptake and efflux of rosuvastatin as observed in the present study.<xref rid="b26-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Birmingham et al have reported that plasma exposure to rosuvastatin was significantly higher in Asian than Caucasian populations who live in the same environment.<xref rid="b27-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Their study has concluded that genetic variations of ABCG2 can partially explain the difference.<xref rid="b27-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In the current study, when comparing the observed PK profiles from our study in healthy fasted male Caucasians with the profiles in the previous study in healthy fasted male Korean subjects, Caucasians showed higher systemic exposure of rosuvastatin without or with fimasartan than Korean subjects with same dosage regimen probably due to different environment, such as diet.<xref rid="b28-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Our comparison is limited since the study environments were different and the genotype of patients was not assessed (eg, OATP1B1).</p><p>Regarding the safety and tolerability assessment results, 120 mg of fimasartan and 20 mg of rosuvastatin were well tolerated when administered together or alone. In this study, the most frequently reported TEAEs throughout the study were headache and dizziness experienced by 7 (19.4%) and 3 (8.0%) subjects, respectively, probably due to transient blood pressure lowering effect. These AEs have also been reported in previous clinical trials in healthy Korean subjects.<xref rid="b12-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b21-dddt-12-787" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Overall, coadministration of rosuvastatin and fimasartan did not increase the incidence of TEAEs.</p><p>In conclusion, coadministration of fimasartan and rosuvastatin did not cause a significant drug interaction in terms of drug systemic exposure, safety, and tolerability in the healthy male Caucasian subjects. Single and multiple doses of 120 mg fimasartan, administered alone and in combination with 20 mg rosuvastatin were well tolerated by healthy male Caucasian subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by Boryung Pharmaceutical Co.
