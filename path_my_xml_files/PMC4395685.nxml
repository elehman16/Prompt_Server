treadmill training (CVRTT) program on static balance abilities in patients with stroke.
[Subjects and Methods] Patients (n = 20) who suffered a stroke at least 6 months prior to
the study were recruited. All subjects underwent conventional physical therapy for
60&#x02005;min/day, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks. Additionally, the CVRTT group underwent
community-based virtual reality scene exposure combined with treadmill training for
30&#x02005;min/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks, whereas the control group underwent conventional
physical therapy, including muscle strengthening, balance training, and indoor and outdoor
gait training, for 30&#x02005;min/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks. Outcome measurements included the
anteroposterior, mediolateral, and total postural sway path lengths and speed, which were
recorded using the Balancia Software on a Wii Fit<sup>&#x02122;</sup> balance board. [Results] The
postural sway speed and anteroposterior and total postural sway path lengths were
significantly decreased in the CVRTT group. Overall, the CVRTT group showed significantly
greater improvement than the control group. [Conclusions] The present study results can be
used to support the use of CVRTT for effectively improving balance in stroke patients.
Moreover, we determined that a CVRTT program for stroke patients is both feasible and
suitable.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Community-based virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>To maintain balance, simultaneous and continuous processing of data from multiple systems,
including sensory information from visual, vestibular, and proprioception stimuli is
required<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, cognitive
integration, cerebellar function, and sensory and motor feedback are essential for
maintaining balance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance disorders
due to deficits in multiple mechanisms are frequently encountered in patients with stroke.
Balance is an important predictor of outcome in stroke rehabilitation. The utility of
balance and gait status in predicting overall outcomes, such as the length of hospital stay
and discharge destination, is recognized<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In patients with stroke, postural stability impairments may manifest during quiet stance as
increased postural sway<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After stroke, difficulties in balance control may be caused by several factors, such as
muscle weakness, impaired proprioception, asymmetry in weight bearing, spasticity, and
impaired motor control<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with a normal person in the same age group, an
individual with stroke has a nearly double the body sway and reduced stability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the movement of the center
of gravity is slowed due to asymmetric weight bearing, resulting in postural imbalance,
which markedly compromises the walking ability of a stroke patient<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance-related deficits are significant factors
contributing to the delayed recovery of activities of daily living, considering the limited
ability to stand or walk following a stroke. Decreased postural stability and balance
decreases an individual&#x02019;s confidence in movement and restricts participation in physical
activities. Furthermore, it increases an individual&#x02019;s risk of falling and promotes sedentary
lifestyles, which ultimately result in secondary disability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To ensure safe walking and successful physical activity in stroke patients, patients should
be able to maintain balance and avoid obstacles when unexpected changes occur<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, improving walking ability is one
of the most important goals in patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation.</p><p>Various training programs have been implemented to ameliorate balance impairment; however,
the reported training effects are difficult to generalize<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, training
effects are expected to be different between a clinical setting and community environment.
One frequently used training device is the treadmill, which can promote optimum balance
control during locomotion. Balance training combined with treadmill training reportedly
results in excellent improvement in terms of increased balance ability compared with
traditional rehabilitation methods in patients with stroke<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cho et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that treadmill training was effective for improving standing balance in patients
with stroke. However, treadmill training is primarily set up for level-ground walking;
hence, training involving level-ground walking on a treadmill would not represent various
daily activities, such as walking on an irregular surface, avoiding obstacles, and turning.
Thus, it may be incorrect to state that basic treadmill training enables patients to walk
successfully in real life, because environmental factors are not sufficiently simulated in
this training. To compensate for the drawbacks of such rehabilitation programs, virtual
reality (VR) training is proposed as an alternative measure<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>VR, occasionally referred to as immersive multimedia, is a computer-simulated environment
that can simulate the physical presence of real or imagined places. VR can recreate sensory
experiences, such as taste, sight, smell, sound, and touch<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. VR has been applied in neurologic rehabilitation programs, by
using equipment combined with environments similar to the real world<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, VR has the ability to create an interactive
and motivational environment that can be manipulated by the therapist to provide
individualized treatment in a safe environment<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of treadmill training combined
with community-based VR training on static balance in patients with chronic stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty chronic stroke patients voluntarily participated in the study. The subjects met the
following inclusion criteria: history of stroke onset of &#x0003e;6 months prior to the study, in
order to minimize the effects of natural recovery; ability to walk without using a walking
aid for a minimum of 15 m; Mini-Mental State Examination score of &#x0003e;24 out of 30; and
ability to comprehend and follow simple instructions. Individuals were excluded if they had
a neurological condition, orthopedic disease, or visual impairment.</p><p>The present study was approved by the Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board
(SYUIRB2011-003). Each participant was able to follow instructions and provided informed
consent by signing an approval form.</p><p>The 20 subjects were randomly assigned to either the community-based VR treadmill training
(CVRTT) group or the control group. All subjects were assessed using the Balancia Software
system (Balancia Software, version 1.0, Minstosys, Seoul, Republic of Korea, 2011) connected
to a Wii balance board (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan, 2012), in order to measure their static
balance ability before and after intervention.</p><p>All subjects underwent conventional physical therapy 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks.
In addition, the patients in the CVRTT group underwent VR scene exposure combined with
treadmill training for 30&#x02005;min/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks, whereas those in the control
group underwent conventional physical therapy, including muscle strengthening, balance
training, and indoor and outdoor gait training, for 30&#x02005;min/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks. Of
the 20 randomized participants, 17 completed the 4-week training program. The participants
who were excluded from the control group included 1 patient who was discharged from the
hospital and 2 patients who had low participation rates (&#x0003c;80%).</p><p>The CVRTT system included VR image and adjustable inclination treadmill equipment
(WNT-2000i, Wellness Track, Republic of Korea, 2009), laptop (NT-P210, Samsung, Republic of
Korea, 2009), video projector (PLC-XW55, Sanyo, Japan, 2006), and a 210 &#x000d7; 180&#x02005;cm (width &#x000d7;
height) screen. VR technology was used to control the speed of optic flow for each user by
adjusting the VR video for the treadmill speed. A VR video was displayed on a screen 3&#x02005;m in
front of the treadmill using a video projector. When the study participants increased their
speed, the speed of the VR video was also increased, using a laptop interface, in accordance
with the optic flow, to match the participant&#x02019;s real speed. This VR video comprised images
of community ambulation, such as walking on sidewalks, level walking, slope walking, and
walking over obstacles. The individuals in the CVRTT group performed treadmill training with
each VR video for 5&#x02005;min, followed by 2&#x02005;min of rest to minimize fatigue. In addition,
emergency stop devices were attached to each participant to ensure safety.</p><p>Control group training consisted of overground walking, stair walking, slope walking, and
unstable surface walking for 570&#x02005;m. An assistant helped to ensure the participant&#x02019;s safety
on the paralyzed side.</p><p>Static balance ability was assessed according to the postural sway path length and speed at
the center of pressure (COP) by using the Balancia Software system connected to a computer,
and a Wii balance force platform with 4 load cells. To measure static balance, the subjects
were asked to place their feet on a Wii Fit<sup>&#x02122;</sup> balance board with their feet spread
apart at shoulder width. The subjects were then asked to maintain their balance for 30&#x02005;s
while looking at a point on a wall 3&#x02005;m away. The static balance ability was measured by the
postural sway path length and speed at the COP using the Balancia software.</p><p>The SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the distribution of general characteristics and
outcome measures of the subjects; among these measures, gender and paretic side were
evaluated using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. A paired t-test was used to compare pre- and
post-test measurements of balance within groups, and the independent t-test was used to
compare the difference in balance before and after training between groups. The significance
level was set at 0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The CVRTT group showed a significant improvement in the anteroposterior postural sway path
length, which decreased from 0.46&#x02005;cm before training to 0.40&#x02005;cm after training (p &#x0003c;
0.05), whereas the control group demonstrated no significant improvement in anteroposterior
postural sway path length, which increased from 0.39&#x02005;cm before training to 0.47&#x02005;cm after
training. The mediolateral postural sway path length was not significantly different between
the 2 groups. However, the CVRTT group demonstrated a significantly improved total postural
sway path length, which decreased from 68.37&#x02005;cm before training to 63.02&#x02005;cm after training
(p &#x0003c; 0.05). The total postural sway path length did not significantly improve in the
control group (59.52&#x02005;cm before training to 62.01&#x02005;cm after training). Furthermore, the
postural sway speed significantly improved in the CVRTT group (2.28&#x02005;cm/s before training to
2.10&#x02005;cm/s after training; p &#x0003c; 0.05), but not in the control group (1.99&#x02005;cm/s before
training to 2.07&#x02005;cm/s after training). The CVRTT group showed significantly greater
improvements in multiple balance measures (p &#x0003c; 0.05) compared with the control group,
which suggests that the CVRTT program improves the static balance ability in patients
recovering from stroke (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of static balance ability within and between the groups (N=17)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="5" align="center" valign="middle">Parameters</th><th colspan="5" align="center" rowspan="1">Values</th><th rowspan="5" align="center" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Change values</th></tr><tr><th colspan="5" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">CVRTT group (n=10)</th><th rowspan="3" align="center" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Control group (n=7)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CVRTT group (n=10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=7)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-Pre</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">PSPL (cm)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A-P</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.46 (0.21)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.40 (0.21)<sup>**</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 0.39 (0.10)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 0.47 (0.10)</td><td align="center" rowspan="4" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> &#x02013;0.06 (0.05)<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.08 (0.14)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M-L</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.48 (0.47)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.36 (0.49)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.24 (0.06)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.33 (0.15)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;0.12 (0.19)<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.09 (0.11)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.37 (19.11)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.02 (13.56)<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.52 (10.36)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.01 (10.67)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;5.35 (6.72)<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.49 (2.32)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">APSS (cm/s)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.28 (0.64)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.10 (0.45)<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.99 (0.35)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.07 (0.36)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;0.18 (0.22)<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.08 (0.08)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are mean (SD), CVRTT: community-based virtual reality treadmill training;

of mass in proportion to the base of support<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and maintains posture during voluntary processes by appropriately
responding to perturbation<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance is
also essential for performing various activities of daily living and community
ambulation<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance can be negatively affected by proprioception dysfunction, muscle weakness, joint
immobility, pain, visual deficits, or loss of proprioception<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Significant impairments in balance are observed in patients with
neurologic problems, such as stroke and spinal cord damage. Approximately 25&#x02013;75% of stroke
patients have experienced a fall, and approximately 10&#x02013;25% of these cases require intensive
medical treatment<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Symptoms of postural imbalance in stroke patients are evident during standing, due to
increased weight bearing towards the non-paretic side. Decreased standing balance and loss
of the ability to shift weight towards the paretic leg can also develop after a stroke<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Difficulties in shifting weight towards
the paretic side can impair important functional movements, such as standing up from a
chair, moving, walking, turning, and walking upstairs<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thus, limitations in movements can decrease the range and amount of physical activities
that can be completed, and could lead to further decreases in postural balance, which may
ultimately result in the deterioration of physical health. Balance is an essential part of
life for stroke patients because it can prevent falls, promotes daily activities, and
supports independent lifestyles<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a previous study, Park et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that general treadmill training was not more effective at improving the balance
ability of stroke patients than conventional physical therapy. In another study, Cho et
al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> selected 22 chronic stroke
patients and assigned them to either a treadmill group with VR or without VR. Both groups
participated in each intervention for 30&#x02005;min/day, 3 times/week, for 6 weeks. However, there
was no significant difference in anteroposterior and mediolateral postural sway speeds and
lengths between the treadmill groups with VR and without VR. In contrast, in a recent study
on the effect of a VR treadmill program on static balance, Kim et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the Berg Balance Scale score was
significantly increased to a greater extent in the VR training group compared with the
control group without VR training.</p><p>In the present study, we examined the effects of CVRTT on static balance in chronic stroke
patients. In a recent study, Yang et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a balance skill program using VR treadmill training for 3
weeks, and reported that mediolateral postural sway was more significantly improved in the
VR treadmill group than in the control group (p = 0.038). According to their results, VR
treadmill training improved the mediolateral postural sway to a greater extent than that
noted in the control group.</p><p>In the present study, the CVRTT group showed a significant change in anteroposterior
postural sway path length (CVRTT group, from 46&#x02005;cm to 0.40&#x02005;cm), total postural sway path
length (CVRTT group, from 68.37&#x02005;cm to 63.02&#x02005;cm), and average postural sway speed (CVRTT
group, from 2.28&#x02005;cm/s to 2.10&#x02005;cm/s) compared with the control group. Furthermore, the static
balance in the CVRTT group was significantly improved as compared with the control group (p
&#x0003c; 0.05), which was similar to the findings of previous studies.</p><p>Based on the findings from our study, VR treadmill training with various community
environment conditions could yield increased static balance, which involves the maintenance
of a neutral position (i.e., midline orientation of body) in response to internal and
external postural perturbations. Moreover, motor learning during CVRTT, including various
environmental conditions, control of task grade, and sensory feedback, will influence the
motivation of patients as well as static balance for maintaining their body within the
limits of stability. According to the results of this study, we confirmed that VR treadmill
training has a positive effect on static balance measures and is an effective treatment
regimen for improving static balance in stroke patients.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, a relatively small sample size was used for this
study. Second, there was a lack of diversity in the dependent variables, because we only
measured static balance ability. Hence, future research with supplemental measures of
dynamic balance and gait ability should be conducted. Furthermore, to confirm the findings
of the present study, a follow-up study comparing groups performing VR treadmill training,
general treadmill training, and community gait training is needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Clinical usefulness of the virtual reality-based postural
