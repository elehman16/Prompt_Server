Two studies were conducted: (1) a nested case&#x02013;control study for studying biomarker associations with mortality, and (2) a study to compare DC and VS participants for biomarker changes. For (1), markers were determined at study entry and before death (latest level) for 85 deaths and for two controls (<italic>n</italic> = 170) matched on country, age, sex, and date of randomization. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated with logistic regression. For each biomarker, each of the three upper quartiles was compared to the lowest quartile. For (2), the biomarkers were assessed for 249 DC and 250 VS participants at study entry and 1 mo following randomization. Higher levels of hsCRP, IL-6, and D-dimer at study entry were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Unadjusted ORs (highest versus lowest quartile) were 2.0 (95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI], 1.0&#x02013;4.1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.05), 8.3 (95&#x00025; CI, 3.3&#x02013;20.8; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), and 12.4 (95&#x00025; CI, 4.2&#x02013;37.0; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), respectively. Associations were significant after adjustment, when the DC and VS groups were analyzed separately, and when latest levels were assessed. IL-6 and D-dimer increased at 1 mo by 30&#x00025; and 16&#x00025; in the DC group and by 0&#x00025; and 5&#x00025; in the VS group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 for treatment difference for both biomarkers); increases in the DC group were related to HIV-RNA levels at 1 mo (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). In an expanded case&#x02013;control analysis (four controls per case), the OR (DC/VS) for mortality was reduced from 1.8 (95&#x00025; CI, 1.1&#x02013;3.1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) to 1.5 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.8&#x02013;2.8) and 1.4 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.8&#x02013;2.5) after adjustment for latest levels of IL-6 and D-dimer, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>IL-6 and D-dimer were strongly related to all-cause mortality. Interrupting ART may further increase the risk of death by raising IL-6 and D-dimer levels.

HIV infects and destroys immune system cells (including CD4 cells, a type of lymphocyte). The first stage of HIV infection can involve a short flu-like illness but in the second stage, which can last many years, HIV replicates in the lymph glands (small immune system organs throughout the body) without causing any symptoms. Eventually, however, the immune system becomes so damaged that HIV-infected individuals begin to succumb to &#x0201c;opportunistic&#x0201d; infections (for example, bacterial pneumonia) and cancers (in particular, Karposi sarcoma) that the immune system would normally prevent. AIDS itself is characterized by one or more severe opportunistic infections or cancers (so-called AIDS-related diseases) and by a low blood CD4 cell count. HIV infections cannot be cured but antiretroviral therapy (ART)&#x02014;combinations of powerful antiretroviral drugs&#x02014;can keep them in check, so many HIV-positive people now have substantially improved life expectancy.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Unfortunately, the effectiveness of ART sometimes wanes over time and prolonged ART can cause unpleasant side effects. Consequently, alternative ART regimens are continually being tested in clinical trials. In the Strategies for Management of Anti-Retroviral Therapy (SMART) trial, for example, HIV-positive patients received either continuous ART (the viral suppression or VS arm), or ART only when their CD4 cell counts were below 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (the drug conservation or DC arm; the normal adult CD4 cell count is about 1,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>). Unexpectedly, more people died in the DC arm than in the VS arm from non-AIDS diseases (including heart and circulation problems), a result that led to the trial being stopped early. One possible explanation for these excess deaths is that increased HIV levels following ART interruption might have induced an inflammatory response (a non-specific immune response that occurs with infection or wounding) and/or a hypercoagulable state (a condition in which blood clots form inside undamaged blood vessels) and that these changes increased the risk of death from non-AIDS diseases. In this study, the researchers test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers measured the levels of proteins that indicate the presence of inflammation or increased coagulation (biomarkers) in stored blood samples from the 85 people who died during the SMART trial (55 and 30 of the participants assigned to receive DC and VS, respectively) and from 170 survivors who served as comparison (control) participants. (Two control participants were &#x0201c;matched&#x0201d; to each participant who had died (cases). In this &#x0201c;case-control&#x0201d; study, an increased risk of death was associated with higher levels at study entry of the inflammation biomarkers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and of the coagulation biomarker D-dimer. The risk of death among people with hsCRP values in the highest quarter of measured values was twice that among people with hsCRP values in the lowest quarter (this is expressed as an odds ratio of 2). For IL-6 and D-dimer, the equivalent odds ratios were 8.3 and 12.4, respectively. Furthermore, increases in hsCRP, IL-6 and D-dimer after study entry were associated with an increased risk of death. The researchers also measured blood levels of the same biomarkers in 250 randomly chosen patients from each of the two treatment arms. IL-6 levels increased by 30&#x00025; over the first month of the trial in the DC arm but were unchanged in the VS arm. Over the same period, D-dimer levels increased by 16&#x00025; and 5&#x00025; in the DC and VS arms, respectively. Increases in both markers in the DC arm were related to HIV RNA levels after one month.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that HIV-induced activation of inflammation and coagulation increases the risk of death among HIV-positive patients and that interrupting ART further increases this risk, possibly by increasing IL-6 and D-dimer levels. Because only a small number of people died in this study, the relationship between these biomarkers and death and illness among treated and untreated HIV-positive individuals needs to be confirmed in further studies. However, these findings suggest that the development of therapies that reduce the effect that HIV replication has on inflammation and blood coagulation, or that reduce IL-6 and D-dimer levels, might extend the life-expectancy of HIV-positive people.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050203">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050203</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information is available from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/hivinf.htm">HIV infection and AIDS</ext-link> and about the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/alerts/aids_smart.html">SMART trial</ext-link>

The episodic ART strategy was also associated with an 84&#x00025; (<italic>p</italic> = 0.007) increased risk of all-cause mortality. Most of the deaths that occurred were not attributable to AIDS-defining conditions [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have shown that HIV replication is an important determinant of endothelial dysfunction [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Participants were asked to consent to storing blood for future research, and only samples from consenting participants were used. The SMART study, including the consent for stored specimens, was approved by the institutional review board at each site and at the University of Minnesota, which served as the Statistical and Data Management Center. The institutional review board at the University of Minnesota also approved plans for analysis of stored specimens for consenting participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Treatments</title><p>In SMART, patients were randomized to one of two ART strategies. The viral suppression (VS) strategy aimed to maximally suppress viral replication by continuous use of ART. The drug conservation (DC) strategy entailed intermittent use of ART for periods defined by CD4&#x0002b; count thresholds. Use of ART was stopped (or deferred) until CD4&#x0002b; count dropped to less than 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, at which time ART was to be (re-)initiated and continued until the CD4&#x0002b; count rose above 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Upon confirmation that the CD4&#x0002b; count was over 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, ART was to be stopped and resumed again when CD4&#x0002b; count was below 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. During periods of ART use, the goal was to achieve maximal viral suppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Clinical Outcomes</title><p>Underlying cause of death was classified using the CoDe system by an Endpoint Review Committee blinded to treatment group [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

For the remaining 4,057 participants, consent was requested at the time of randomization for storing blood at either 4- or 12-mo intervals; 3,800 of these participants consented. Plasma specimens were collected using EDTA (lavender top) blood collection tubes and were shipped frozen to a central repository.</p><p>Only specimens obtained prior to 11 January 2006, were used for the analyses described in this paper. As previously reported, on that date investigators and ART-experienced participants were notified of a safety risk in the DC group, enrollment was stopped, and participants in the DC group were advised to restart ART [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Four inflammatory markers, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), IL-6, amyloid A, and amyloid P, and two coagulation markers, D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1&#x0002b;2 (F1.2), were measured by the Laboratory for Clinical Biochemistry Research at the University of Vermont for cases and controls and for a random sample of participants in each treatment group. Biomarkers for the random sample and the case&#x02013;control study were analyzed in the same batches blinded to treatment group (DC or VS) and case&#x02013;control status.

These matching factors were also chosen because they were clearly not on the causal pathway between the biomarkers and mortality.

The following covariates assessed at study entry were used for the adjusted analyses cited: age, self-reported race (categorized for this analysis as black versus other), use of ART and HIV-RNA level (no ART, versus ART and &#x02264;400 copies/ml, versus ART and &#x0003e;400 copies/ml), CD4&#x0002b; cell count, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), prior CVD, diabetes, use of blood pressure (BP) medication, use of lipid-lowering medication, total/HDL cholesterol, co-infection with hepatitis B or C, and treatment group.</p><p>For some biomarkers very large ORs for the associations with mortality were observed. To investigate the possibility that these large ORs were due to sparse data [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the number of covariates considered [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], or outliers, four sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) conditional logistic models that included only baseline covariates that were significant at the 0.10 level in a multivariable analysis with mortality (age, prior CVD, co-infection with hepatitis B or C, smoking, and baseline CD4&#x0002b; cell count); (2) unconditional logistic models; (3) conditional logistic models that excluded outliers, i.e., levels below the lower fence, defined as the lower quartile &#x02013; 1.5 &#x000d7; IQR or above the upper fence (upper quartile &#x0002b; 1.5 &#x000d7; IQR) [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; and (4) conditional logistic models that used four controls per case with controls only matched on date of randomization (&#x000b1; 3 mo).</p><p>The associations between baseline biomarker levels and mortality were considered for DC and VS participants separately. To assess whether associations between biomarker levels and mortality varied by treatment group, an interaction term (product of log<sub>10</sub> transformed biomarker and treatment group) was included in the logistic models. Similar methods were used for studying subgroups defined by prior disease history, co-infection with hepatitis, and baseline CD4&#x0002b; cell count.</p><p>For analyses of latest biomarker levels and mortality, log<sub>10</sub> transformed levels were used, and the study entry level of the biomarker that was the focus of the analysis was included as a covariate with other previously cited covariates. To assess the effects of biomarker differences between the DC and VS groups on the DC/VS OR for mortality, conditional logistic models that included the latest level of the biomarker as well as the treatment indicator were considered. For these analyses, deaths and the four controls matched on date of randomization were used. This expanded case&#x02013;control study (four instead of two controls) was used because there was a chance difference in the number of DC and VS controls with latest biomarker levels in the case&#x02013;control study with 1:2 matching. This resulted in an unadjusted DC versus VS difference in mortality that was not as great as previously reported [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Because the focus was on the risk of death in the DC versus VS group, a comparison protected by randomization, matching was limited to date of randomization to ensure latest biomarker levels were measured at approximately the same time for each death and the four matched controls.</p><p>The association between each biomarker and other covariates at study entry was studied using linear regression analysis. Biomarker changes after 1 mo were compared for DC and VS participants using analysis of covariance. The association of biomarker change (after log<sub>10</sub> transformation) and HIV-RNA change at 1 mo for DC participants with an HIV-RNA level &#x02264;400 copies/ml at study entry was studied using linear regression analysis.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.1) [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

In the model with two controls per case, the unadjusted OR for the DC versus the VS group was 1.3 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.8&#x02013;2.2). Because this OR was considerably lower than the hazard ratio previously reported for all-cause mortality [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], we explored reasons for it and created an expanded case&#x02013;control data set. A chance imbalance in the number of DC and VS participants selected as controls is the reason the OR was lower. Among the 170 controls, 99 were in the DC group and 71 were in the VS group. The expected number was 85 in each group. With the expanded case&#x02013;control study (four controls for each death), the unadjusted DC/VS OR for all-cause mortality was 1.8 (95&#x00025; CI, 1.1&#x02013;3.1). This estimate is identical to that previously reported [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With adjustment for latest level of IL-6, the OR was 1.5 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.8&#x02013;2.8); with adjustment for latest level of D-dimer the OR was 1.4 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.8&#x02013;2.5).</p><p>We also considered the effect of adjusting for both study entry and latest levels of IL-6 and D-dimer and of adjusting for HIV- RNA and CD4&#x0002b; cell count on the DC/VS OR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050203-st005">Table S5</xref>). Similar to an earlier report, adjustment for CD4&#x0002b; cell count had a greater effect on the OR (DC/VS) for mortality (OR = 1.2; 95&#x00025; CI, 0.7&#x02013;2.2) than adjustment for latest HIV-RNA levels (OR = 1.6; 95&#x00025; CI, 0.9&#x02013;2.9) [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With adjustment for latest levels of IL-6, D-dimer, CD4&#x0002b; cell count, and HIV-RNA, the OR (DC/VS) was 1.3 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.6&#x02013;2.6).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Elevated levels of either IL-6 or D-dimer at study entry were strongly related to all-cause mortality in the case&#x02013;control study. In the random sample, both D-dimer and IL-6 increased in the DC group compared to the VS group, particularly in the large subgroup on ART at entry with a suppressed HIV-RNA level. Increases in both markers in the DC group were related to the level of HIV-RNA after 1 mo. Finally, increases in these markers following randomization were associated with mortality. Taken together, these findings suggest that HIV-induced activation of inflammatory and coagulation pathways has an adverse effect on all-cause mortality among patients with relatively preserved CD4&#x0002b; counts, and that interrupting ART may further increase this risk by raising IL-6 and D-dimer levels. Further research on the relationship of these biomarkers with mortality and morbidity in treated and untreated HIV-infected individuals is warranted.</p><p>The associations between IL-6 and D-dimer levels at study entry with all-cause mortality were much stronger than in previous studies of non-HIV-infected populations that usually focused on CVD morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While these strong associations persisted in a number of different analyses, including subgroups defined by hepatitis co-infection, baseline CD4&#x0002b; cell count, and prior disease history, the relatively small number of deaths considered here compared to studies in the general population suggest that the results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation. Findings for deaths attributed to CVD or unwitnessed deaths were consistent with those for all-cause mortality, although the number of these deaths was small. The relationship of these biomarkers with CVD morbidity and mortality will be the subject of a separate report.</p><p>Patients in SMART were relatively healthy and did not have advanced HIV disease. Deaths were attributed to a variety of causes and were largely not due to AIDS, as would be expected in a cohort of patients with CD4&#x0002b; counts that averaged about 600 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> at entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050203-st001">Table S1</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Associations of D-dimer and IL-6 with all-cause mortality have been reported in other studies that included non-HIV-infected participants [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Relationships between elevated IL-6 and D-dimer levels and all-cause mortality were strong in both DC and VS patients. However, our findings for patients on continuous ART (VS group) require validation, as mortality rates were low. However, if substantiated, and because most patients in the VS group had HIV-RNA levels of 400 copies/ml or less at study entry, ongoing activation of these pathways may exist even in the presence of effective ART, consistent with data demonstrating ongoing viral replication, even in patients with HIV-RNA of less than 50 copies/ml [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Considering our finding that ART is associated with lower levels of these biomarkers, more aggressive ART that might lower IL-6 and D-dimer may warrant further investigation.</p><p>Increases in hsCRP, IL-6, and D-dimer from study entry to the visit preceding the death were associated with an increased risk of death. Whether the activation of tissue factors secondary to inflammation is the key event is likely but unproven in this study. Several alternative hypotheses are possible. One study showed that tissue factor, an initiator of coagulation, is generated by HIV-related proteins and could have pathologic effects [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Another study found that HIV-infected leukocytes transmigrate across the endothelium [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and this dissemination of virus could result in damage to multiple organs. Alternatively, circulating lipopolysaccharide, which has been shown to be higher in HIV-infected compared to uninfected individuals [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], induces tissue factor transcription, which in turn decreases F1.2 and soluble fibrin, resulting in fibrin split products such as D-dimer [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Lipopolysaccharide also activates monocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is also possible that elevations of inflammatory markers, such as hsCRP and IL-6, and of D-dimer are independent events. In analyses that considered the joint influence of IL-6 and D-dimer, each remained strongly associated with all-cause mortality. Specific therapies that reduce the inflammatory response to HIV and decrease hsCRP, IL-6, and D-dimer levels may warrant investigation as an approach for reducing risk of death among HIV-infected individuals [<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0050203-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>ART interruption resulted in increases in IL-6 and D-dimer, therefore the effect of these treatment differences on the DC/VS OR for mortality was explored. Adjustment for follow-up (latest) levels of IL-6 and D-dimer resulted in a modest reduction of the DC/VS OR for mortality, supporting the hypothesis that the excess risk of death in the ART interruption group may be explained by biological mechanisms for which IL-6 and D-dimer are markers.</p><p>There are some limitations in our work. Confidence intervals for ORs were wide due to the small number of deaths. While we selected six biomarkers from a large number of possible markers based on previous work in non-HIV-infected populations, some associations may have resulted from chance. This is less likely for the associations of IL-6 and D-dimer levels at study entry with all-cause mortality, which were highly significant. Cost considerations limited the number of controls for each death for which we could assess biomarkers. This reduced the statistical power to detect associations with mortality. The limited matching carried out, particularly for the expanded case&#x02013;control study with four controls, may have resulted in incomplete control of confounding factors. However, regression adjustment for a number of covariates did not alter our overall conclusions. We measured latest levels at the visit immediately prior to the event of interest. For biomarker levels proximal to death, it is possible that reverse causality (i.e., an already present disease process caused the increase in the biomarker instead of vice versa) may explain these findings. In addition, follow-up specimens were not available for 11 deaths and 29 controls, and this limited our ability to assess the prognostic importance of biomarker changes on mortality. Finally, while we did not find evidence for different associations with mortality for DC compared to VS patients, the number of events experienced by VS patients was small, limiting the power for those comparisons. Similarly, power for other subgroup analyses considered was also low.</p><p>In summary, elevated levels of D-dimer and IL-6 identify HIV-infected patients at high risk of death. The magnitude of the association is clinically relevant and reasons for it require further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050203-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>SMART Study Design and Flow Diagram for Case&#x02013;Control Study with 1:4 Matching for Deaths and Controls</title><p>Matching was on date of randomization to ensure latest levels for deaths, and controls were determined at similar time point following randomizations.</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0050203.sg001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050203-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Baseline Level of hsCRP (&#x003bc;g/ml) for Each of 85 Death&#x02013;Control Triads Ordered by hsCRP Level of Deaths Plotted on Logarithmic Scale (Log<sub>10</sub>)</title><p>Solid lines give median levels at baseline for deaths (4.3 &#x003bc;g/ml) and controls (2.1 &#x003bc;g/ml).
