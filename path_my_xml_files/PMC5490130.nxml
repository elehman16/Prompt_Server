Forty-two patients scheduled for lumbar spine surgery lasting &#x0003c;5 h between 20 and 65 years, of both sex, with body mass index of 18&#x02013;30 belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I and II were included in the study. Pregnant women, patients with bronchial asthma, and known drug allergy undergoing spine surgery were excluded from the study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 21), Group A (MMA group/study group) and Group B (conventional regime group/control group) by allocation sequence generated by computer-generated random number table.</p><p>Confirming the preanesthetic evaluation and consent, mandatory monitoring with bispectral index (BIS) and train of four (TOF, neuromuscular monitor) was instituted for monitoring throughout the surgery. For drug and fluid administration, intravenous access was secured. Patients were oxygenated by O<sub>2</sub> mask during study drug administration. All patients received midazolam 0.03 mg/kg, ondansetron 4 mg, and glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intravenously. Study drugs were prepared by assigned postgraduate students who were not participating in the study. Analgesic drugs were administered preemptively in both the groups before induction, providing sufficient time for the onset of action. MMA group received diclofenac sodium, paracetamol, and clonidine intravenously and skin infiltration with bupivacaine adrenaline. Conventional regime group received paracetamol intravenously and skin infiltration with saline adrenaline. Following study drug administration, patients were preoxygenated with 5 L 100% O<sub>2</sub> for 3 min. Fentanyl 3 &#x003bc;g/kg was given to all patients 2 min before induction with propofol, followed by atracurium 0.5 mg/kg to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in 60% N<sub>2</sub>O, and O<sub>2</sub>, and divided doses of atracurium. End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and end-tidal isoflurane concentration were continuously monitored using an infrared gas analyzer. The goal of anesthesia was to maintain the intraoperative heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) within &#x000b1;10% of preinduction values and a BIS of 50&#x02013;55. For the rise in HR and SBP up to 20% from the preinduction value, morphine 2 mg bolus was administered, if the rise was more than 20%, morphine 0.075 mg to 0.1 mg/kg was administered intravenously by the anesthesiologist monitoring the patient. At the conclusion of surgery, all patients were allowed to recover spontaneously to TOF of T<sub>2</sub>. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with glycopyrrolate 10 &#x003bc;g/kg and neostigmine 50 &#x003bc;g/kg. Tracheal extubation was done when the following criteria were met: BIS: 85&#x02013;88 and TOF T<sub>4</sub>/T<sub>1</sub> ratio &#x02265;0.9.
