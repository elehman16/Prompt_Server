It causes breathlessness and requires hospitalisation for invasive pleural drainages. Malignant effusions often herald advanced cancers and limited prognosis. Minimising time spent in hospital is of high priority to patients and their families. Various treatment strategies exist for the management of malignant effusions, though there is no consensus governing the best choice. Talc pleurodesis is the conventional management but requires hospitalisation (and substantial healthcare resources), can cause significant side effects, and has a suboptimal success rate. Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) allow ambulatory fluid drainage without hospitalisation, and are increasingly employed for management of malignant effusions. Previous studies have only investigated the length of hospital care immediately related to IPC insertion. Whether IPC management reduces time spent in hospital in the patients&#x02019; remaining lifespan is unknown. A strategy of malignant effusion management that reduces hospital admission days will allow patients to spend more time outside hospital, reduce costs and save healthcare resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The Australasian Malignant Pleural Effusion (AMPLE) trial is a multicentred, randomised trial designed to compare IPC with talc pleurodesis for the management of malignant pleural effusion. This study will randomise 146 adults with malignant pleural effusions (1:1) to IPC management or talc slurry pleurodesis. The primary end point is the total number of days spent in hospital (for any admissions) from treatment procedure to death or end of study follow-up. Secondary end points include hospital days specific to pleural effusion management, adverse events, self-reported symptom and quality-of-life scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The Sir Charles Gairdner Group Human Research Ethics Committee has approved the study as have the ethics boards of all the participating hospitals.

The average life expectancy for patients with this condition is 3 (for metastatic carcinomas) to 9&#x02005;months (for mesothelioma).

<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Talc pleurodesis also has a high failure rate, which necessitates further pleural interventions/drainages and hospital care. A randomised trial of 482 patients with malignant pleural effusions showed that talc pleurodesis, irrespective of whether delivered by thoracoscopic poudrage or talc slurry via tube thoracostomy, successfully controlled fluid recurrence in only &#x0223c;75% of patients at 1&#x02005;month, and 50% by 6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our recent study of pleurodesis in patients with mesothelioma also showed that 71% had fluid recurrence, and 32% required further pleural interventions.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Talc pleurodesis is known also to have significant side effects.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Pain and fever are common, and transient hypoxaemia in the several days following pleurodesis days has been reported.

Four comparisons of pleurodesis and IPC all found that patients undergoing pleurodesis were more likely to need subsequent pleural drainage procedures with a pooled failure rate of 22.1% (36/163), compared with 8.9% in IPC patients (21/236).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

The primary response data are likely to be highly skewed, and hence a non-parametric test would be more appropriate. To examine the potential benefit of reduction in hospital stay using IPC, we estimate 65 patients in each group are needed. The study will be able (with 80% power and &#x003b1;=0.05) to detect a difference of 5 or more days spent in hospital, based on preliminary estimates of 18&#x02005;days in the pleurodesis group (from the pilot study<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and a SD of 9.3. Allowing for a lost-to-follow-up rate of 12%, 73 patients per group will be needed, to make a total recruitment target of 146. This is a conservative estimate as no patient was lost to follow-up in the pilot study.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Statistical plan&#x02014;missing data</title><p>In common with many clinical studies, missing data may exist either in the form of total non-response (eg, attrition due to death or patient withdrawal) or item non-response (when some but not all the required information is collected from the patients). We will attempt to minimise the missing data due to item non-response. Throughout the duration of the trial, participants will have regular contact with the respiratory department, as well as with the research team. The patient will be asked to complete the forms while at clinic. This will maximise proper and complete data collection. The research team will document as accurately as possible the reasons for any non-completion or missing data, thereby minimising truly absent data. The expected dropout from patient death has been factored into the power calculation and is based on survival figures.

A modified EQ-5D will also be completed by the patient on day 8 after the intervention. Follow-up visits will be undertaken at 10&#x02013;14&#x02005;days, and then every 2&#x02005;weeks for 8&#x02005;weeks, monthly for 6&#x02005;months and every 3&#x02013;12&#x02005;months thereafter, provided it is feasible. Data will be collected on hospital admissions, details of any chemotherapy received and any adverse events. A clinical review will be conducted by the clinician in-charge. When patients are not, or cannot be, seen in clinic, they will receive a phone call from a study doctor or research nurse to enquire about symptoms at the intervention site. They will also complete the above questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="s1l"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The number of days spent in hospital (bed days) <italic>for any cause</italic> for <italic>all</italic> hospital admissions following intervention, until death or the end of the study follow-up. The primary end point is chosen as it is the most meaningful outcome for patients with cancer and their clinicians. Hospital admissions will be further categorised and the days of admissions directly attributable to the pleural effusion and/or its treatment will be recorded as &#x02018;effusion-related&#x02019; (a secondary end point).</p><p>Given the impossibility of blinding, hospital admissions will be decided by the independent treating physicians, not by the investigators, wherever possible. The reason(s) for admission must be documented and satisfy at least one of the following criteria:

Therefore day-case procedures including chemotherapy administration will not be included.</p><p>An independent assessor, not related to the clinical trial, will assess the validity of the hospital admissions for its justification and duration.

The primary end point, that is, total bed days for all hospital admissions will be analysed initially using a Mann-Whitney non-parametric test to compare the two treatment arms. Subsequent supporting analyses will be carried out using a negative binomial model with adjustments made for actual length of follow-up (accounting for death and withdrawals) and important covariates. The total effusion-related bed days for hospital admissions will be analysed similarly to the primary outcome variable. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to analyse time to death, serious adverse events and further pleural intervention. Summaries and frequencies of serious adverse events will be compared between the intervention groups using Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. VAS scores will be analysed using linear mixed effects models, including fixed effects of time and time dependent covariates as appropriate and random effects of individual.</p></sec><sec id="s1o"><title>Changes to the protocol after the start of the trial</title><p>The trial details documented here are consistent with AMPLE trial protocol V.4 (date: 05/05/2014).
