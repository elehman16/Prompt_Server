We recently found that the crude water-insoluble dietary fibers from several types of botanical foods maintained aqueous ethanol solutions. Additionally, the ethanol-absorbing ability of the dietary fibers correlated with the inhibition of the blood ethanol elevation by delaying gastric emptying. Moreover, we found that the synergism between tomatoes and alanine to reduce the absorption of alcohol in rats was attributable to the effect of alanine on precipitates, such as the crude water-insoluble dietary fibers of tomatoes. In the present study, we assess whether an alanine-fortified tomato (AFT) is effective in relieving acute alcohol-induced adverse effects by lowering the alcohol action in healthy human volunteers following the ingestion of alcohol with a meal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty healthy males ingested the AFT or sugar as the control, with 1.2&#x000a0;g/kg of alcohol and a micronutrient-fortified meal in a randomized cross-over study.

Alanine, is an amino acid that likely contributes to the formation of pyruvate by oxidative deamination. The metabolic pathways of alanine could generate nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which facilitates alcohol oxidation in the liver via the conversion of pyruvate to lactate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Ramchandani et al. reported that intravenous alcohol administration after eating meal increased alcohol elimination rates that was not due to the specific interaction with meal constituents involving high levels of protein, fat, or carbohydrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>However, we believe that food plays a more intensive role in alcohol pharmacokinetics, specifically to delay the gastric emptying of alcohol as a major factor involved in alcohol absorption. Several previous studies have shown that the delayed gastric emptying of ethanol strongly decreases BAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, little is known about the effects of dietary components on the regulation of the gastric emptying rate of alcohol and its effect on alcohol metabolism. Jones et al. reported that alcohol ingestion after eating a meal decreased BAC, regardless of the specific interactions with meal constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that the most important role of food in the context of alcohol ingestion is to prolong the retention of alcohol in the stomach regardless of the nutrient(s) involved.</p><p>Recently, we have demonstrated that the crude water-insoluble dietary fibers of several types of botanical foods besides tomatoes absorb ethanol-containing solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, the absorption of ethanol correlated with the inhibition of the blood ethanol elevation by delaying gastric emptying. Subsequently, we identified alanine as a dietary nutrient that can synergize with crude water-insoluble dietary fibers of tomatoes to lower the BAC in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the administration of tomato juice supplemented with alanine ameliorated the spontaneous motor activity in rats following the administration of a high dose of ethanol. We concluded that the precipitate of tomato and alanine synergized to decrease ethanol absorption.</p><p>Next, preliminary human studies were conducted to access the BAC lowering effect of the tomato and alanine combination. Tomato juice containing 0.6&#x000a0;g of water-insoluble dietary fiber with 5&#x000a0;g of alanine decreased the BAC and relieved the subjective sensations of drunkenness when moderate alcohol (500&#x000a0;mL beer) was ingested under fasting condition (unpublished data). Although tomatoes combined with alanine could have potential clinical significance regarding the adverse effects of alcohol ingestion, the verification of its effectiveness is needed in further studies. This is particularly essential as it has been established that the ingestion of a meal prior to the consumption of alcohol reduces the BAC and increases the level of alcohol elimination, as described above. However, few human trials have focused on the effectiveness of certain agent(s) or foods on BAC elevation following alcohol ingestion after or during meal consumption regardless of the type of food. Therefore, we conducted a randomized cross-over study to evaluate whether an alanine-fortified tomato (AFT) can modify the metabolism of alcohol. In addition, we assessed if AFT could also relieve the acute alcohol-induced adverse effects under the conditions of alcohol ingestion with a meal in human volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was proposed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Huma R &#x00026; D Co.

Tomato paste (2,000&#x000a0;g), dl-alanine (250&#x000a0;g) and tap water (2,750&#x000a0;g) were mixed well and the mixture was prepared as freeze-dried products that yielded a total of 880&#x000a0;g. The dry AFT product was stored in a desiccator attached to a vacuum aspirator at room temperature for use in Experiments 1 and 2. A commercially available table sugar was used as a control meal and shochu (20&#x000a0;% alcohol, v/v) was utilized as the alcohol in all experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>A non-blind, single-center, randomized cross-over design was used for this study. The study flowchart is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Subjects were scheduled to receive sugar (as a control) and AFT on two separate test days, 4&#x000a0;weeks apart in a randomized order. Prior to each Experiment (1 or 2), participants were instructed not to consume alcohol for two days prior. The timeline of the experiments (1 or 2) is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. On the day of the experiments, subjects were provided lunch at 12:00&#x000a0;pm in the Sekino Clinical Pharmacology Clinic (Tokyo, Japan). They had a free time until the start of the experiment at the institution. All of the subjects ingested a commercially available micronutrients-fortified food as meal (716&#x000a0;kcal, BALANCEUP, Asahi food &#x00026; healthcare Co., Ltd., Japan), shochu (1.2&#x000a0;g alcohol/kg body weight), and the mixed dry product of AFT (40&#x000a0;g, 150&#x000a0;kcal). The AFT was equivalent to approximately 400&#x000a0;g of raw tomato with 10.4&#x000a0;g alanine or sugar (38&#x000a0;g, 152&#x000a0;kcal) used as the control. All subjects refrained from eating foods except for the supper provided and the test meals. However, they were allowed to freely consume water throughout the trial. The volume of any consumed water and the excreted urine were recorded during the experiment. The energy and nutrient contents of the supper and each test meal are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The subjects ingested the supper and the alcoholic drink containing the test meal within 1&#x000a0;h. Peripheral blood specimens from the subjects were collected from the cubital vein at 18:00, 21:00, 00:00, and 6:00 (awakening time), as well as before and after the ingestion of each meal to determine the blood acetaldehyde, acetate, and plasma glucose levels. Serum alanine concentrations measured from each sample obtained at 18:00, 00:00, and 6:00. Breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) were monitored using AlcoQuant&#x000ae; 6020 plus (EnviteC, Germany) as a breath alcohol analyzer at 18:00, 19:00, 20:00, 21:00, 22:00, 23:00, 00:00, and 6:00. Urine specimens were also collected from 12:00 to 18:00, 18:00 to 21:00, 21:00 to 00:00, and 00:00 to 6:00. The volume and pH was recorded for each of the four urine samples. The subjective sensations following alcohol consumption were evaluated based on the questionnaire data. The subjects were required to answer 14 questionnaires at the same time that the BrAC was determined. After a wash out period of 4&#x000a0;weeks, the cross-over trial was performed using the same protocol.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The study flowchart showing the randomized cross-over study that was performed during a 4-week period</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12986_2016_87_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Timeline for experiment 1 and 2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12986_2016_87_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Total energy and nutrition expenditure of the supper and the test meals</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td/><td>Energy, kcal</td><td/><td>716</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Protein, g</td><td/><td>16.4</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Supper</td><td>Fat, g</td><td/><td>39.4</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Carbonhydrate, g</td><td/><td>74.0</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Dietary fiber, g</td><td/><td>12.0</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Alanine-fotified tomato</td><td/><td>Control (sugar)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Energy, kcal</td><td>150</td><td/><td>152</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Protein, g</td><td>14.1</td><td/><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Test meal</td><td/><td>(alanine: 10.4&#x000a0;g)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Fat, g</td><td>0.6</td><td/><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Carbonhydrate, g</td><td>18.2</td><td/><td>38.0</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Dietary fiber, g</td><td>4.0</td><td/><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>(insoluble: 2.4&#x000a0;g)</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The amount of carbohydrate includes that of dietary fiber</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Determination of alcohol metabolites and biochemical assessment</title><p>The blood acetaldehyde concentration was measured using a 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative method for acetaldehyde by ultraviolet detection (365&#x000a0;nm) using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique used in a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

Martin et al reported the biphasic effects of alcohol on a scale (a seven-item stimulant subscale and a seven-item sedative subscale), which held promise as a self-reporting measure of the impact of alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The stimulant items included the descriptions of elated, energized, excited, stimulated, talkative, up, and vigorous. The sedative items included difficulty concentrating, down, heavy head, inactive, sedated, slow thoughts, and sluggish. Each subject reported on each the 14 items as a subjective sensation on a 10&#x000a0;cm visual analog scale (VAS). The distance (cm) from the left edge of the line to the mark placed by the subject was measured at each time point. This measurement was then used in subsequent analyses as the sensation score from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) that best described their present feelings. The stimulant or sedative score added the score of each of the seven items, and the scores were expressed as the median, quartile as well as the lowest and highest data in box plots. Each of the seven items of the sedative subscale performed at 6:00 was box plotted in a similar way.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using Dr. SPSS II software (SPSS Inc.).

This effect is thought to be attributed to the ability of AFT to lower the alcohol concentration levels under the conditions of excess alcohol drinking with a meal. An alcohol dosage of 1.2&#x02013;1.75&#x000a0;g/kg has been used in several studies that have examined the effects of food materials or constituents on intoxication or the presence of a hangover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. An alcohol dosage of 1.2&#x000a0;g/kg was used in this study because of the difficulty in evaluating the physiological effects of the subjects after drinking excessive alcohol. Higher dosage leads to an increase in the vomiting of test meals as a result of acute alcohol intoxication. Unfortunately, one subject (No.10) in the control group vomited during Experiment 1 and was exempted from analyses. Moreover, the 20 healthy subjects who participated in the cross-over study were asked whether they were experiencing hangover symptoms (yes or no) on the subjective feeling score the next morning in both experiments. In our results, six subjects experienced hangover symptoms (response: yes; 30.0&#x000a0;%) in the control group, compared to only one individual (5.0&#x000a0;%) in the AFT group.</p><p>Deficiencies in the vitamin B complex, folic acid, and vitamin C are well recognized in alcohol abusers or alcoholics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Alcohol likely affects the absorption or metabolism of these vitamins. Thus, subjects in both experiments ingested the micronutrients-fortified foods as the provided meal to minimize the decrease in the blood vitamin levels from the excessive alcohol drinking. Therefore, the blood vitamin concentrations, apart from vitamin C (present in only small amounts in the foods consumed) significantly increased after alcohol ingestion. Blood vitamin C level in the AFT group did not decrease because tomatoes provided vitamin C to the subjects. Therefore, this study was conducted under the conditions of supplementation for the subjects via calories and micronutrients derived from the provided meal. In this regard, this study examined some variations related to acute ingestion of alcohol. Further studies are warranted to make sure of the effects of supplementation toward nutrients status in a body due to chronic alcohol ingestion.</p><p>In our results, we demonstrated that the combination of tomato and alanine decreased the BrAC in healthy male subjects. We believe that insoluble dietary fiber that exerts a synergistic action with alanine in tomatoes observed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] is the main mechanism by which this effect occurs. In addition, we confirmed that the ethanol-maintaining ability of dietary fiber in delaying the gastric emptying in the alcohol absorption process vanished because of heat processing under the dried condition of that (data not shown). The 12&#x000a0;g of dietary fiber in the meal was relevant for determining the effect of deactivation by thermal sterilization.</p><p>Blood acetaldehyde levels between both groups were not different. The peak values of blood acetaldehyde after ingesting of 0.4&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol in healthy Japanese men are <italic>ALDH2*1/*1</italic>: 4.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L, <italic>ALDH2*1/*2</italic>: 23.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L, and <italic>ALDH2*2/*2</italic>: 79.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L, respectively, as described by Mizoi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The peak acetaldehyde level of 0.21 or 0.33&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL (4.7 or 7.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) found in <italic>ALDH2*1/*1</italic> subjects after ingesting 1.2&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol in this study was lower than those of the <italic>ALDH2*1/*2</italic> and <italic>*2/*2</italic> types that received 0.4&#x000a0;g/kg of alcohol. Therefore, it seems that acetaldehyde is rapidly metabolized to acetate in both conditions, even following excessive alcohol consumption. Thus, the acetaldehyde levels would have had little effect on the physiological actions and subjective sensations that were obtained. However, blood acetate level in the AFT group was higher than that in the control group. It is suggested that an increased level of blood acetate during alcohol oxidation may be used as an indicator of enhanced alcohol elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As reported by Smith et al., it is likely that if the absorption rate of the alcohol dose is sufficiently slow to maintain the portal alcohol level below the Vmax of hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase, some alcohol will escape into the peripheral circulation in low level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Inhibition of gastric emptying would result in a decrease of the portal alcohol level. Thus, we believe that the combination of alanine and tomato effectively enhances alcohol elimination due to delayed gastric emptying in humans.</p><p>Some alterations of the metabolic functionality of the liver and other organs occurs in response to the presence of alcohol in the body and can result in low blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], as well as low alanine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The blood glucose levels only decreased a minor amount in both conditions, likely because of the glucide intake from the supper and test meals that provided glucose supplementation. In addition, the sensation score from the subjects after alcohol ingestion was undoubtedly not related to symptoms of hypoglycemia. The increase of alanine in the blood is likely to reflect a sufficient supply of NAD+, which is necessary to facilitate alcohol metabolism. Alanine supplementation that led to the elevated plasma alanine concentration in the AFT group was considered to be nutritionally essential for consecutive alcohol metabolism. Several hormonal alterations have been observed during the excessive ingestion of alcohol. In particular, hangover severity is likely proportional to the antidiuretic hormone level and metabolic acidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Alcohol causes the body to increase urinary output by inhibiting the release of anti-diuretic hormone (vasopressin), which prevents the kidneys from reabsorbing water. However, vasopressin levels increase as alcohol levels decline to zero, and during a hangover, this condition can result in additional fluid loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In our study, the plasma vasopressin levels in both groups remained relatively unchanged throughout the experiments. The volume of water that was consumed was greater than the total urinary volume in both groups. These results implied that the subjects experienced little fluid loss (dehydration) the next morning.</p><p>Eggleton et al. reported that urinary pH in all subjects who consumed 40&#x000a0;g of alcohol were lower than that found in control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this study, the urinary pH in both groups was significantly decreased. However, the pH of the AFT group was significantly higher than the control group at 21:00 and 00:00. In one study, the blood pH in a severe hangover group was markedly lower than that in a mild hangover group after 1.5&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol consumption and there was a good correlation between the hangover scale values and blood pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The decreased severity in urinary pH changes in the AFT group could be due to the lowering of blood alcohol levels during the experiment.</p><p>Self-reported (subjective) alcohol effects have often been measured with ratings of how intoxicated subjects perceive themselves. Alcohol produces both stimulant and sedative effects, in generally, the stimulant ratings are higher than sedative ratings during rising blood alcohol levels, and sedative ratings are higher than stimulant ratings during falling blood alcohol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our results indicated similar tendencies (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), as the stimulant effects in both conditions expressed as short-term effects in the initial phase of alcohol consumption, and the sedative effects confirmed as long-term ones in the control group from several hours later to the next morning. However, a sedative score of AFT condition at 6:00 (awakening time) was significantly lower than that of the control group. In particular, down, heavy head, and sluggish scores in the sedative items of AFT condition at 6:00 were significantly decreased than that of the control group. The morning after a night of excessive alcohol drinking, people wake up with unpleasant feelings. The experienced sensations are caused by the alcohol hangover that develops when alcohol disappears from the body. The hangover severity is most pronounced at 12 to 14&#x000a0;h after the starting of alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that an alcohol dosage that produces a peak blood alcohol level of at least 0.11 to 0.12&#x000a0;% is necessary to develop an alcohol hangover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In the present study, the estimated peak average blood alcohol concentrations in the subjects that were calculated from breath alcohol levels were 0.12&#x000a0;% in the control group and 0.10&#x000a0;% in the AFT group. The levels were close to that of being consciousness of a hangover. Thus, the highly retaining sedative scores resulted from discomfort sensations continued until next morning. Decreased sedative scores in AFT condition next morning could be considered because of the lowering alcohol levels during the experiment. There were no significant differences between the scores of the AFT group and those of the control group because of the existence of alcohol in the body during 19:00 to 00:00. This is despite the significant differences in the alcohol levels for both groups. Millar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] reported that subjective intoxication was equivalent in fed and fasted conditions for a high alcohol dose, although the meal ingestion prior to the consumption of alcohol reduced the peak blood alcohol level, which was similar to our results.</p><p>With regard to the limitations of this study, the randomized cross-over study conducted was an open-label design. We were not able to produce placebo foods that were confused with the alanine-fortified tomatoes. Thus, the significant difference between two groups did not allow adequate assessment of the effect of AFT ingestion. Accordingly, a double-blind trial needs to be performed using placebo foods to confirm our findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The BrAC and urinary pH alterations due to alcohol-induced metabolic acidosis were significantly decreased by the ingestion of AFT. Several subjective sensations after alcohol ingestion were also significantly reduced by AFT the morning after alcohol consumption. This study demonstrated that the simultaneous ingestion of AFT with excess alcohol under the condition of micronutrient-fortified meal consumption reduced the acute alcohol-induced adverse effects. This effect of AFT was found to be a result of the decreased levels of alcohol in healthy human volunteers and may have the potential to be used in a therapeutic or precautionary context in the future.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AFT</term><def><p>alanine-fortified tomato</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALDH</term><def><p>aldehyde dehydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BAC</term><def><p>blood alcohol concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BrAC</term><def><p>Breath alcohol concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAD+</term><def><p>nicotine adenine dinucleotide</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors have the following interests.
