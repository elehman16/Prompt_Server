Asian patients in this analysis were defined as all patients who self-identified their race as Asian to investigators from the following options provided on the case report form: white, black, Asian, or other. Asian patients were included from eight study sites in Japan (n = 35), five sites in Korea (n = 43), and two sites in Taiwan (n = 4); 23 other Asian patients also were included in this analysis.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. Patients received placebo or palbociclib 125 mg/d orally for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off; fulvestrant 500 mg was administered intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and then every 28 days (&#x000b1; 7 days) thereafter starting from day 1 of cycle 1.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In premenopausal patients, any luteinizing hormone&#x02013;releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist was administered starting at least 4 weeks before study therapy initiation. Patients who did not receive goserelin as their LHRH agonist before study entry were switched to goserelin from the time of random assignment through the entire study treatment period. The primary objective was investigator-assessed PFS; secondary objectives included clinical benefit response (CBR), objective response rate (ORR), survival probabilities, safety and tolerability, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). In April 2015, the independent data monitoring committee reviewed the results of the study and concluded that its primary objective had been met as the study crossed the prespecified Haybittle-Peto efficacy stopping boundary (&#x003b1; = .00135).<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The updated results of the overall population have been previously published, and these data (cutoff date: March 16, 2015) were also used in this present analysis.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>An institutional review board/independent ethics committee approved the protocol; the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

CBR was defined as the overall rate of complete response, partial response, or stable disease &#x02265; 24 weeks according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Objective response was defined as the overall complete response or partial response according to RECIST version 1.1. Using x-ray, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, tumor assessments were performed at baseline and every 8 weeks for the first year and then every 12 weeks. The type, incidence, severity, and seriousness of AEs and the relationship of AEs to study medications were recorded. Severity of AEs was graded on the basis of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. A serious AE was defined as an AE that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or results in congenital anomaly or birth defect. An AE could additionally be considered serious by the investigator if it jeopardized the patient or required intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes.</p><p>In addition, pharmacokinetic (PK) data and PROs were assessed by race. Trough PK samples for determination of palbociclib plasma concentrations were collected from all randomly assigned patients on day 15 of cycles 1 and 2. PROs were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30, a 30-item questionnaire that includes functional scales, symptom scales, and a global health status/quality-of-life (QOL) scale.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> For functional and global QOL scales, higher scores represent a better level of functioning.

PRO questionnaires were completed before dose on day 1 of cycles 1 to 4, then on day 1 of every other subsequent cycle starting with cycle 6, and finally, at the end of treatment. For PK assessments, a post hoc analysis was used for the comparison of racial subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Study assessments of efficacy, safety, and PROs were prespecified; efficacy subgroup analyses by various baseline variables, including race, were preplanned in the protocol and statistical analysis plan. Statistical analyses by race were conducted for exploratory purposes. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were summarized by treatment arm in a frequency table for Asians and non-Asians. Quantitative baseline variables, including age, weight, and height, were summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, median and range). Quantitative baseline variables were compared between the two treatment arms using a Wilcoxon two-sample test without adjusting for multiplicity. Efficacy analyses were performed using the intent-to-treat principle. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median PFS and the respective 95% CIs were provided for both treatment groups. PFS data between the treatment groups were compared using a log-rank test. HR was estimated from the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The odds ratio estimator and the exact test were used to compare the rates of binary efficacy end points. AEs were summarized using descriptive statistics in Asians who took one or more doses of study treatment. The within-patient averages of the palbociclib steady-state trough PK samples were summarized and compared across subgroups. PRO analyses were based on the PRO-evaluable population (ie, patients in the intent-to-treat population with a baseline assessment and one or more postbaseline assessments before the end of study treatment). Completion rates were summarized by cycle. Repeated-measures mixed-effects analyses were performed to compare on-treatment overall scores and changes from baseline between treatment groups while controlling for baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s6"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s7"><title>Patients</title><p>From October 7, 2013, to August 6, 2014, 105 Asians were enrolled onto the study (74 and 31 patients in the palbociclib and placebo arms, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>).

In the PALOMA-1 phase II study and PALOMA-2 phase III study of patients who had not previously received endocrine therapy, longer PFS was reported with palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Similarly, in the PALOMA-3 study, in patients who had previously received endocrine therapy, palbociclib plus fulvestrant resulted in longer PFS than fulvestrant alone.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Palbociclib has been approved in the United States and has been used in more than 48,000 patients since February 2015.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Palbociclib is also approved by regulatory authorities for advanced breast cancer in the following countries in Asia: Singapore, Malaysia, Macau, Hong Kong, and Korea. In many of these countries, palbociclib will be reviewed by health technology agencies, payers, or both. The positive clinical value of palbociclib in Asian patients should be considered alongside the economic implications.</p><p>Substantial clinical experience has been accumulated in white patients. Although few Asians were enrolled onto the PALOMA-1 study,<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> 21% of patients in the palbociclib arm and 18% of patients in the fulvestrant arm in PALOMA-3 were Asian.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This study adds to the limited body of literature assessing a CDK4/6 inhibitor in Asians and represents the largest patient experience with palbociclib in Asians. The present findings show that palbociclib plus fulvestrant improved PFS in Asians with HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC who experienced progression on prior endocrine therapy and that the safety profile of palbociclib plus fulvestrant in Asians was generally consistent with that observed in non-Asians. Together, these findings suggest that palbociclib is beneficial in patients who have not previously received endocrine therapy and in Asians and non-Asians who experienced relapse or progression during prior endocrine therapy.</p><p>Differences in racial background can be associated with variable efficacy outcomes and safety profiles.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> As a result of genetic variations in an enzyme responsible for doxorubicin metabolism,<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Asians have been shown to be more susceptible to myelosuppression induced by doxorubicin compared with whites.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In addition, a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia with docetaxel has been reported in Asians compared with whites.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Genetic differences associated with race also can lead to differences in treatment response and efficacy. In Koreans with MBC, CYP2D6*10/*10 genetic polymorphisms have been associated with reduced plasma concentrations of the tamoxifen active metabolites endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, as well as reduced clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or stable disease &#x02265; 24 weeks) and significantly shorter median time to progression (<italic>P</italic> = .0032).<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> These racial variations highlight the importance of evaluating the efficacy and safety of cancer medications within the Asian population.</p><p>Similar to findings from the present analysis, the most common AEs reported in the PALOMA-1 study with palbociclib were neutropenia and leukopenia.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In the PALOMA-3 study, nonhematologic AEs were predominantly mild or moderate in severity. Moreover, an important difference of treatment exposure was observed between Asians and non-Asians in the palbociclib arm, with higher percentages of Asians experiencing dose interruptions, dose reductions, and cycle delays than non-Asians. Interestingly, the rates of grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia were modestly higher in Asians than non-Asians. Because palbociclib exposure was similar in Asians and non-Asians, the increased rates of neutropenia cannot be explained by differential drug exposure across racial subgroups. Asian race, lower baseline ALT, and younger age were all predictors of a lower baseline ANC value. The Asians in PALOMA-3, on average, were younger and had a lower baseline ALT than the non-Asians, thus compounding effects of the covariates. Overall, in the PALOMA-3 patient population, a typical Asian patient (52 years old at enrollment with a baseline ALT of 17 U/L) had a baseline ANC value 19% lower than a typical non-Asian patient (58 years old at enrollment with a baseline ALT of 21 U/L), which may partially explain the higher rate of neutropenia observed in Asians. Importantly, race was not demonstrated to be a covariate on any of the PD response parameters, suggesting that there was no increased sensitivity to palbociclib-induced neutropenia in Asians.</p><p>MBC in premenopausal women is not well studied because clinical trials often exclude this patient population. One phase II study of 73 patients with HR-positive MBC showed that the efficacy of first-line therapy with letrozole plus goserelin in premenopausal patients was comparable with the efficacy of letrozole alone in postmenopausal patients<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>; these findings support additional research into assessing the efficacy of other treatments in combination with goserelin in premenopausal patients with breast cancer. MBC in premenopausal women is rare in the Western world; however, higher incidences are seen in Asian countries and in developing countries such as Mexico, Latin America, and Egypt, where breast cancer is more common in younger women and is frequently diagnosed at later stages as a result of suboptimal access to health care.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Palbociclib plus fulvestrant improved PFS in both premenopausal and postmenopausal Asians in PALOMA-3. Because of the small number of patients in this cohort, no formal statistical analysis could be performed. Nevertheless, palbociclib plus fulvestrant in addition to an LHRH agonist could be a reasonable treatment option for younger patients with breast cancer who are premenopausal, including Asian patients.</p><p>Assessing PROs is important to comprehensively define the risk-benefit profile of treatments. In the current study, Asians in the palbociclib group maintained good QOL throughout the study, which is important in establishing the benefit-risk profile of combination therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, as observed in the full study population, PFS was longer in Asians with HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC who received palbociclib plus fulvestrant versus those who received placebo plus fulvestrant. Furthermore, QOL was maintained in Asians who received palbociclib. The safety profile of palbociclib was consistent with that previously reported and was similar in Asians and non-Asians. The protocol-defined dosing modification instructions for palbociclib, including adjusting dose on the basis of individual tolerability, enabled Asians to avoid discontinuation from the study as a result of an AE, allowing them to stay on treatment as long as non-Asians and thus maintain the same efficacy benefit from combination therapy. Overall, palbociclib plus fulvestrant seems to be a reasonable treatment option in Asians with HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC that has progressed on prior endocrine therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="Supported-by"><p>Supported by Pfizer, New York, NY.</p></fn><fn id="fn2" fn-type="presented-at"><p>Presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Asia 2015 Congress, Singapore, December 18-21, 2015.</p></fn><fn id="fn3" fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial information: NCT01942135.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>See accompanying editorial on page <related-article id="d38e741" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1200/JGO.2017.009936">281</related-article></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We thank Yanke Yu (Pfizer, La Jolla, CA) for analysis provided for this article.
