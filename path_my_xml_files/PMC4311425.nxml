While a number of studies have suggested that there is little in the way of significant health behavior change following genetic testing for common diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], a notable exception has been genetic susceptibility testing for Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD). Multiple separate trials conducted as part of the Risk Evaluation and Education for Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (REVEAL) study have shown that cognitively normal adults with an affected parent or sibling who learned of an increased genetic risk for AD are more likely than those at population risk or those receiving non-genetic risk assessments to report changes in putative AD-prevention behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the study showed that individuals who learn of an increased genetic risk are more likely to report changes to advance planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These findings have led commentators to cite AD genetic susceptibility testing as an example of the personal utility genetic risk assessments can provide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The inconsistencies between REVEAL study findings and research from the field at-large raises questions about what may differ between studies. Certainly, the lack of well-proven prevention and treatment strategies distinguishes AD from other common diseases, but the public tends to believe that lifestyle, diet, and mental activity are important determinants of AD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is also possible that the REVEAL study enrolled participants who were more motivated to pursue lifestyle modifications than other studies. While nearly all studies of genetic risk disclosure have enrolled self-selected populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the REVEAL study is distinctive in its proportion of participants who self-referred to the study compared to the proportion who were actively recruited. Individuals who self-refer to an intervention not only tend to have stronger personal and family histories of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and stronger concerns about developing the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but are also more likely to engage in intervention activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These factors may help explain why self-referred populations are frequently more likely to report behavior changes following an intervention than actively recruited populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Understanding how individuals who proactively seek a genetic risk assessment may differ from individuals who are responding to investigator-driven offers of testing may help reconcile inconsistent findings across studies and inform future models for genetic services. The analysis that follows compared self-referred participants (SRPs) and actively recruited participants (ARPs) from the second and third trials of the REVEAL study. First, we examined the characteristics of each enrolled cohort, expanding upon analyses of data from the first REVEAL study trial &#x02013; which enrolled ARPs exclusively from research registries &#x02013; by comparing a wider range of demographic and psychosocial characteristics. We then compared the percentage of participants who received a genetic risk assessment. Finally, we examined associations between SRPs and ARPs in terms of their behavioral outcomes, namely changes to mental activities, diet, exercise, dietary supplement use, medications, long-term care insurance coverage, and retirement plans. We hypothesized that self-referred participants would be more likely to report changes to health behaviors and advance planning than ARPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview and study population</title><p>We conducted secondary analyses on data from the REVEAL study, a series of multicenter randomized controlled trials examining the psychological and behavioral impact of providing AD genetic risk information based on <italic>APOE</italic> genotyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Analyses were conducted on data from the second and third study trials (data from the first trial were omitted because the scales and timing used to measure health behavior changes and beliefs about AD and genetic testing greatly differed from those used in the second and third trials). In each trial, study sites recruited participants through a combination of strategies described in more detail below. Individuals with two or more AD-affected first degree relatives (FDRs), from families where the average AD onset age was under 60&#x000a0;years, or who scored below an education-adjusted 87 on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] were excluded from participation. Individuals with severe psychiatric disorders, defined as scoring above 25 on the Beck Anxiety Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or above 26 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], were also excluded. In the second trial, which tested condensed education and disclosure protocols, eligibility criteria required all participants to have a single AD-affected FDR. In the third trial, which compared phone versus in-person disclosure as well as disclosing pleiotropic versus AD-only information, approximately 25% of participants had no AD-affected FDRs, while 75% had one AD-affected FDR. A more comprehensive overview of the REVEAL study has been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The multidisciplinary REVEAL study group designed the study protocol and risk disclosure procedures, which was reviewed by an external advisory board. The Boston University Medical Campus Institutional Review Board (IRB), Howard University Medical IRB, University Hospitals IRB, University of Michigan Medical School IRB, and Weill Cornell Medical College IRB approved the final protocol, Participants provided informed consent by telephone at the time of study enrollment, then again in writing prior to the blood draw for genotyping.</p><p>After completion of a phone interview and written pre-education questionnaire, participants received education about testing.

Participants then met individually in person with a genetic counselor. Those still interested in pursuing a genetic risk assessment provided blood, which was genotyped at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified facility. Approximately one month after the blood draw, participants received risk curves tailored to their gender, race, AD family history (whether or not the participant had an AD-affected FDR), and genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. They were also told their <italic>APOE</italic> genotype and numeric estimates of their cumulative lifetime (potential range: 6% to 73%) and remaining risk for AD (cumulative incidence from current age to the age of 85&#x000a0;years). Following genetic risk disclosure, REVEAL study researchers followed participants for the period of one year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Demographic characteristics</title><p>Participants self-reported all demographic characteristics, including age, race, gender, education, income, employment status, and number of AD-affected relatives.

SRPs comprised a greater percentage of the third study trial and a lower percentage of the second study trial.

While prior REVEAL study analyses showed that &#x003b5;4-positive participants were more likely than &#x003b5;4-negative participants to report changes to health behaviors and LTC insurance coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], these follow-up analyses show that such responses often depended upon whether or not an individual had proactively sought testing. &#x003b5;4-positive participants were more likely to report changes to mental activities, short-term changes to diet, and plans to change LTC insurance coverage than &#x003b5;4-negative participants, but only if individuals had self-referred into the study.</p><p>Our data do not fully explain why this difference is present. Self-referred participants in the REVEAL study may be more prepared to act on indications of increased risk for AD. While few differences were observed at baseline on beliefs about AD and attitudes about testing, such factors represent only a fraction of the psychosocial determinants that facilitate or inhibit behavior change. Many have argued that risk assessment interventions fall short by ignoring more critical determinants of behavior change, especially motivation, behavioral capacity and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Supporting this notion was the finding that self-referred individuals were less likely to discuss prevention strategies during genetic risk disclosure, yet more likely to respond to indications of increased genetic risk. Interventions that hope to use genetic risk information to motivate changes to lifestyles and other behaviors may benefit from more careful consideration of the readiness of individuals to enact such changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Practitioners and researchers must also be sensitive to the potential for studies of genetic risk information to inflate its ability to motivate health behavior changes by enrolling self-referred populations. Conclusions from such studies may not apply to populations that are less prone to proactively seek out genetic susceptibility testing.</p><p>The implications of these findings are timely, given advancements in technology to analyze genomes and provide genetic susceptibility information. In particular, great attention has been given to whether and how findings from genomic sequencing and genetic research should be disclosed, including calls to improve understanding of the impact of disclosing unsolicited genomic risk information derived as incidental or secondary findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In addition, questions persist about the utility of direct-to-consumer genetic testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which has overwhelmingly relied on passive marketing strategies that favor self-referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] (and companies have increasingly incorporated <italic>APOE</italic> into their testing panels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The results from our analyses underscore how the impact of genomic information disclosure on lifestyles and advance planning decisions may be very different under one model of service provision than another.</p><p>Although the focus of these analyses has been on changes to health behaviors and advance planning, a number of additional findings are of interest. As seen in the first REVEAL study trial, SRPs tended to be younger and had higher household incomes than ARPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. They were also more likely to be employed, more interested in testing, and had greater attentiveness about AD than ARPs. Of particular note - and contrary to findings from the first REVEAL study trial, which enrolled ARPs exclusively through research registries - was how SRPs had less than half the percentage of African Americans at intake. Prior research has found African Americans to have less interest in hypothetical genetic testing for AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and actual genetic testing for susceptibility to other diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This finding underscores the need for aggressive outreach if researchers hope to diversify the samples enrolling in genetic susceptibility testing research, while also suggesting caution when interpreting racial differences in behavioral outcomes when traditionally underrepresented groups are actively recruited. SRPs were also more likely to progress from enrollment to testing without dropping out, as found in analyses from the first REVEAL study trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Studies favoring active recruitment strategies should plan accordingly for greater participant attrition.</p><p>A number of limitations should be mentioned. Differences in recruitment strategies also introduced differences in sampling frames, complicating cohort comparisons. Study measures had several limitations, including that behavioral outcomes were single-item self-reports of behavior change and participant to social desirability biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Study participants, whether self-referred or actively recruited, were highly educated volunteers with high socioeconomic status, and were positively inclined toward genetic testing by virtue of their participation. As research subjects, test results were omitted from medical records, providing protections from discrimination that clinical testing may not offer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 despite multiple comparisons, and findings about changes to health behaviors would not have been statistically significant at a more conservative value of <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01. Analyzed data were collected over a 6-year period that overlapped with advances in AD prevention research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], the emergence of direct-to-consumer genetic testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and the enactment of legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] which could have changed attitudes towards genetic susceptibility testing for AD. Finally, the REVEAL study focused on single gene testing for AD risk, and findings may not generalize well to contexts where multiple genes and multiple diseases are addressed.</p><p>Nevertheless, these analyses demonstrate how different models of recruitment for providing genetic risk information affect who pursues testing and how they respond to the information they receive. Policymakers and clinicians will need to be sensitive to the ways genetic risk information can be obtained as they weigh its ability to improve preventive behaviors and public health.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13073_2014_124_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
