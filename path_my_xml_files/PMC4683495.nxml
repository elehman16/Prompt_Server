They were also explained about visual analog scale (VAS) scale, which they would be shown in the postoperative period. Using computer generated table, patients were randomly divided into three groups. Group B received intrathecally 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine + 0.7 ml of 0.9% saline. Group BF received intrathecally 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine + 25 mcg of fentanyl in 0.5 ml along with 0.2 ml 0.9% saline. Group BFM received intrathecally 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine + 25 mcg of fentanyl in 0.5 ml along with 1 mg of midazolam in 0.2 ml.</p><p>The test drug was prepared by a person not involved in the study making sure that the total volume of the drug remains 3.7 ml. In the operation theatre, baseline parameters in terms of pulse rate, respiratory rate (RR) and blood pressure were recorded. All patients were preloaded with 15 ml/kg of Ringer's Lactate. After taking adequate aseptic precautions, SAB was administered with the patient in left lateral or sitting position at L<sub>3-4</sub> or L<sub>4-5</sub> interspace with 23-gauge Quincke spinal needle. The time to attain sensory level up to T10 and time to attain motor block up to modified Bromage grade-3 were recorded. Vital parameters in terms of pulse rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), RR and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded before administration of SAB, immediately after block (0 min), at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min after the procedure and then at 15 min interval thereafter till completion of surgery. Fall in SBP or DBP &#x0003e;20% of the basal value was considered as hypotension. Change in pulse rate 20% of the basal value was considered as bradycardia or tachycardia. Any intraoperative complications such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, and pruritus were recorded. The total duration of surgery was also noted.</p><p>Postoperative analgesia was assessed with VAS. Injection diclofenac sodium 75 mg intramuscularly was administered as rescue analgesia if VAS &#x0003e;3. The total duration of analgesia was also noted. In the postoperative room, vital parameters were recorded every half hourly for 4 hours and then every hourly till the supplementation of rescue analgesia.</p><p>Time of recovery from the sensory block, as defined by regression of block up to T12 level, was recorded. Furthermore, time of recovery from motor block to modified Bromage scale-2 was also recorded.</p><p>Any postoperative complications such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, pruritus, and urinary retention were recorded and treatment of complications planned accordingly. The observer involved in the assessment of the parameters was blinded to the test drug used.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 9 (Chicago, SPSS Inc.). Data were presented as mean and standard deviation. Continuous variables were analyzed using ANOVA test, while categorical data were analyzed using Chi-square test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.

Also, there was statistically significant difference in duration of analgesia between Groups B and BF and Groups B and BFM. The administration of a combination of drugs intrathecally targets different spinal receptors resulting in prolonged and superior quality of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Various studies have observed the prolongation of analgesia with the addition of midazolam or fentanyl. Tucker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] observed prolongation of the duration of analgesia in labor when a combination of intrathecal midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 10 mcg was used for labor analgesia. Shah <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] also observed prolongation of the duration of analgesia with the addition of 2 mg intrathecal midazolam to 15 mg bupivacaine and 0.15 mg buprenorphine. Most of the studies done so far have used intrathecal bupivacaine combined with either fentanyl[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or midazolam.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] All have shown a significant increase in duration of analgesia.</p><p>There was statistically significant difference in time of onset of both sensory and motor block between Groups B and BF (<italic>P</italic> - 0.000) as well as between Groups B and BFM (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000). There was no clinically or statistically significant difference in the time for onset of sensory and the motor block between Groups BF and BFM (<italic>P</italic> = 0.054). The variation in the onset may be because of the fact that though there is fast onset on sensory and motor blockade due to addition of opioid-like fentanyl due to the action on opioid receptors, but there is no potentiation of the effect with the addition of midazolam. Usmani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] observed a significant difference in time of onset of both sensory and motor block when fentanyl was combined with bupivacaine intrathecally. When intrathecal midazolam was added to the bupivacaine, Agrawal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] observed no significant difference in onset of sensory and motor blockade time.</p><p>There was statistically significant difference in duration of sensory and motor block between Groups B and BF, Groups B and BFM as well as Groups BF and BFM. Bharti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] observed that the duration of motor and sensory blockade was prolonged when intrathecal midazolam is added to bupivacaine. Grewal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] also observed significant prolongation of motor block by adding fentanyl to bupivacaine in SAB. Khanna and Singh[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] observed a significant increase in duration of the sensory block with fentanyl when added to bupivacaine intrathecally. Tucker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] observed prolongation of the duration of the sensory block with intrathecal midazolam 2 mg added to Fentanyl 10 mcg in labor analgesia. Roussel and Heindel[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] did not observe significant prolongation of sensory and motor block when intrathecal fentanyl was added to bupivacaine. Bhattacharya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] observed no significant prolongation of the sensory block with intrathecal midazolam 2 mg added to bupivacaine 15 mg.</p><p>There was no significant variation in pulse rate, SBP, and DBP both within the group and between the groups. In none of the studies,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] there was significant decrease in pulse rate with addition of fentanyl to bupivacaine, however most of the studies were carried out by adding fentanyl in a dose of 25 mcg or less. In this study also there was no significant decrease in pulse rate in Group BFM.</p><p>Martyr and Clark[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found incidences of hypotension as a common complication when intrathecal fentanyl 20 mcg was added to bupivacaine 7.5 mg in elderly patients, but the incidence and severity of hypotension were not significant.
