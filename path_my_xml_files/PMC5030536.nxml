The Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS) outlines the requirements for research involving human participants in Canada. The need for an exception to consent (deferred consent) is recognised and endorsed in the TCPS for research in individual medical emergencies; however, little is known about substitute decision-maker (SDM) experiences. A paediatric resuscitation trial (SQUEEZE) (NCT01973907) using an exception to consent process began enrolling at McMaster Children's Hospital in January 2014. This qualitative research study aims to generate new knowledge on SDM experiences with the exception to consent process as implemented in a randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The SDMs of children enrolled into the SQUEEZE pilot trial will be the sampling frame from which ethics study participants will be derived. <italic>Design:</italic> Qualitative research study involving individual interviews and grounded theory methodology. <italic>Participants:</italic> SDMs for children enrolled into the SQUEEZE pilot trial. <italic>Sample size:</italic> Up to 25 SDMs. <italic>Qualitative methodology:</italic> SDMs will be invited to participate in the qualitative ethics study.

Supporting valid informed consent involves providing potential participants information about the purpose of the research, explaining the relative risks and benefits, describing the nature and duration of participation required and explaining the voluntariness of participation, all within a context free from coercion. Where an individual is incapable of providing informed consent, it has become an accepted practice for a substitute decision-maker (SDM) to act on their behalf for decision-making related to research participation, though SDM decisions do not necessarily accurately represent participant wishes.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref></p><p>Other principles underpinning the ethical conduct of research in human participants include Concern for Welfare and Justice.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Researchers must protect and promote the welfare of participants and minimise the risks of research participation, while SDMs must act according to the patient's expressed wishes, or if these are not known they should act to promote an incapable person's best interests. Justice in the research context is often characterised as fairness such as fair practices of recruitment, design, etc, and fair distributions of benefits and burdens of research. Individuals must have the opportunity to participate.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This is challenging when research participation may be effectively denied where a rigid requirement for prospective informed consent is imposed. Such requirements effectively halt research for individual medical emergencies, where prospective informed consent is impracticable.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Even for research occurring outside of the acute care context, it has been argued that fully informed consent is an ideal that is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>More is being learnt about how valid informed consent can be evaluated and ensured by a researcher.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> In the clinical and research context, individuals often rely on the advice of family and others when making decisions. Many individuals in fact do not want to weigh different choices or carry the burden of making such a judgement themselves.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Recent research involving parents of children with cancer has explored parental decision-making<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> as well as comprehension and satisfaction with informed consent,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> revealing that trust and confidence in the medical team rather than comprehension of study details inspires participation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

This provides a mechanism to support research in areas that would otherwise not benefit from the rigorous evaluation required to advance medical science. The Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS) outlines two circumstances under which departures from the general principles of consent can be ethically supported.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These include (1) altered consent in minimal risk research (Article 3.7) and (2) exception to consent for research in individual medical emergencies (Article 3.8).</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Exception to (prospective informed) consent</title><p>Exception to consent for research in individual medical emergencies can be considered as the enrolment of a participant into a study without their prospective informed consent or that of their SDM where the individual is incapable and where no prior directive is known to exist. Implementing an exception to consent process (sometimes referred to as deferred consent) involves several key elements that must be meticulously addressed during study planning: (1) procedures for participant enrolment, (2) subsequent notification of the participant or SDM of their enrolment in a research study, (3) approach by a member of the research team for full discussion about the study and request for consideration for consent (and assent as applicable) for continued participation&#x000a0;and (4) management of circumstances where consent for ongoing participation is declined. Depending on the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted, regulations vary and community consultation and/or notification may be a requirement.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> While resuscitation research following community consultation is possible,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> this does increase costs and raises further questions regarding what is meant by community, who should be consulted, how and to what degree. It has been argued that such requirements effectively serve as a barrier to conducting resuscitation research.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Community consultations also do not ensure that enrolment is acceptable at the individual level.</p><p>Importantly, little research has been conducted on the direct experience of SDMs with the exception to consent process. Interviews with capable adult survivors of critical illness reveal that only a minority finds enrolment followed by deferred consent unacceptable for research in medical emergencies.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> From a paediatric perspective, a recent systematic review evaluating the use of alternative consent models in research for life-threating paediatric emergencies found just 11 articles, with none specifically evaluating the experience of SDMs with deferred consent.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Work to date has focused on community consultation in light of US regulations,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;30</xref> feasibility evaluation for hypothetical studies<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and interviews with parents of critically ill children.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> A survey study of UK parents whose children had suffered from bacterial meningitis or meningococcemia within the past 5&#x02005;years found that deferred consent was acceptable to the majority of respondents, though the views of bereaved versus non-bereaved parents differed to some extent.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In contrast, parents who had received tertiary obstetric or neonatal care expressed low support for neonatal resuscitation research involving the use of a waiver, deferred or opt out consent model, though these authors noted the limitations of their work and expressed a need for more rigorous research involving parental interviews.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Context for the proposed research: an opportunity to evaluate SDM experiences</title><p>MJP is the principal investigator for the SQUEEZE pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) (NCT01973907).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This pragmatic, two-arm, parallel group, open-label pilot RCT opened recruitment at McMaster Children's Hospital (MCH) in January 2014. The overall objective of SQUEEZE is to determine in children with septic shock whether resuscitation involving less intravenous fluid and more medications (fluid sparing) compared to aggressive intravenous fluid (usual care) results in improved clinical outcomes without an increased risk of adverse events.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Management in the fluid-sparing (intervention) and usual care (control) arms fall within the broad scope of current treatment guidelines.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> SQUEEZE was inspired by recent evidence suggesting that too much intravenous fluid may lead to worse outcomes for patients with septic shock, including serious complications or even death.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref> However, a strategy that uses less intravenous fluid and more medications may also have important adverse effects. Current septic shock resuscitation guidelines<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> do not specify how much intravenous fluid is optimal, generating significant debate on this issue.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41&#x02013;45</xref> A high-quality RCT is therefore required to define optimal resuscitation care.</p><p>The primary objective of the SQUEEZE pilot trial is to determine the feasibility of a definitive multicentre RCT.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Approval to conduct this pilot RCT was granted by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (HIREB), including approval for the use of an exception to consent process, without which the RCT would not be feasible. SQUEEZE provides an opportunity to generate new knowledge on parental experiences with an exception to consent.</p><sec id="s1d1"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary objective is to conduct a study exploring the experiences of SDMs with the &#x02018;exception to consent&#x02019; process in the context of a pilot RCT comparing two resuscitation strategies for paediatric septic shock.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Research questions</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What is the experience for parents and guardians asked for consent for their child to remain in a study/RCT after the main intervention has taken place?

Qualitative research is particularly appropriate where relevant variables have not been identified<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02014;a criterion especially salient to this topic area, where so little research has been performed. As well, experiences identified as ethically difficult will likely rely upon social norms about, for instance, the value of patient autonomy and other ethical constructs. Qualitative research is well suited for unpacking tacit assumptions.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Methods include focus groups and individual interviews. Because of the sensitive nature of the participant, we have chosen individual interviews for this study. <italic>Study design:</italic> Qualitative research study involving individual interviews and grounded theory methodology. <italic>Study setting:</italic> MCH.</p><p>The sampling frame will include parents/guardians approached for consent for their child to remain in the SQUEEZE pilot trial. All parents/guardians of children enrolled into this RCT will be invited to take part in the ethics study, including parents who refuse continued involvement in order to capture reasons for consent and refusal. Even parents/guardians of SQUEEZE participants who do not survive their illness will be invited to participate as it is important to understand their experiences, which may differ from parents/guardians of septic shock survivors.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>The optimal timing for individual interviews for qualitative research in relation to a specific event has not been described in the literature. For this study, we seek to balance a desire for proximity with the need to be family centred in arranging a suitable interview time, recognising and respecting that the most appropriate time will differ among the participants&#x02014;who may include grieving parents. We anticipate that most parents/guardians will be interviewed by the Qualitative Research Assistant (QRA) within 1&#x02005;month of their consent encounter. Two parents/guardians for a given SQUEEZE participant may be interviewed for the ethics study as individual participants.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Parents/guardians approached for consent for their child to remain in the SQUEEZE pilot trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Where two parents/guardians are involved in decision-making related to the consent process, both parents/guardians are eligible for inclusion in the qualitative ethics study.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Parents/guardians who have indicated on the SQUEEZE pilot trial consent form that they do not wish to be approached for this qualitative study.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Screening, recruitment and accrual of participants</title><p>Screening for eligible participants for the qualitative ethics study will be performed by the SQUEEZE pilot trial Clinical Research Assistant (CRA).

Parents/guardians will be approached at least one calendar day after they have provided or declined consent for continued participation in SQUEEZE, and at a time when their child is either medically stable or no longer in the intervention phase of the SQUEEZE trial.

Interested participants will be sent a formal information and consent sheet mailed with a postage-paid return envelope, and they will be asked to sign and return it once they are satisfied that any questions have been answered. An interview will then be scheduled.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Semi-structured interviews will be conducted on the basis of open-ended questions that define the domain of inquiry, from which the interviewer or interviewee may diverge in order to pursue an idea or respond in more detail.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Part of the aim of qualitative interviews is to discern the interviewee's own framework of meanings.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Interviewers will be trained to avoid imposing their own understandings of, for instance, what constitutes an ethical issue. Participants will be encouraged to elaborate, in depth and detail, on their experience of being asked to consent after the fact. In particular, participants will be encouraged to describe what went on in the consent process and how they responded.</p><p>We expect that many of the qualitative interviews will be able to be conducted face-to-face, although some will need to take place by telephone. Decisions regarding on-site versus telephone interviews will be guided by our discussions with the study participants, based on their availability and preference. Several suitable interview rooms are available at MCH. Interviews may also be conducted at the Communications Resource Laboratory, which is located on the McMaster University campus immediately adjacent to MCH. Interviews will be taped and professionally transcribed by a transcriptionist who has signed a confidentiality agreement.</p><p>Anticipating that necessary comfort and rapport will not always be achieved in a single interview, and in order to allow an opportunity to explore emerging analyses with study participants (see data analysis), we plan second interviews for approximately one-third of the sample. We expect that a higher proportion of second interviews will occur by telephone; however, where possible, these will also occur face-to-face. In such cases, we will attempt to time interview appointments with any planned hospital follow-up clinic visits or otherwise defray the costs of travel to the hospital for the participant.</p><p>Some research participants will have had very difficult experiences related to their child's illness.

Where families are located or reside within the greater Hamilton area (no more than 50&#x02005;km from McMaster University), and if it is the preference of the family, interviews can be conducted at a location of the participants' choice. When an interview is to be conducted off site, the QRA will notify one of the study investigators of the interview time and location, and confirm her safe departure once the interview has been completed. If at any time during the interview process the QRA is concerned for her safety, the interview will be discontinued and she will exit the premises. The QRA will carry on her person a cellular telephone at all times to facilitate urgent communication if required. The interviews will follow the attached interview guide (see online supplementary file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>).

RCTs involving use of an exception to consent process are uncommon and even more so when the population under study is children. As principal investigator for the SQUEEZE pilot trial, MJP identified a responsibility to use this opportunity to advance our understanding of SDM experiences with research of this nature and contacted LS to seek out the possibility of a collaboration.</p><p>This resulting study supports creation of a &#x02018;virtuous learning loop&#x02019;,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> whereby the qualitative findings will inform not only study procedures in the planned multicentre RCT but also contribute to development of evidence-based guidelines that may be used by other investigators who wish to conduct research that requires use of an exception to consent process. It is exciting to see new evidence emerging in this area from other groups as well.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Evidence-based ethics guidelines will assist investigators in developing study operating procedures for approaching SDMs to ensure that this occurs in a manner consistent with SDM preferences. The medical community has embraced the concept of &#x02018;patient-centred care&#x02019;, and perhaps it is time for the research community to consider embracing what could be referred to as &#x02018;SDM-centred ethics&#x02019;. The concept of SDM-centred ethics would require an acknowledgement that what SDMs want (when acting in the best interests of an incapable individual) may not be the same as what REBs require (based on current research ethics policies), or what ethicist may consider most virtuous. Moving towards an evidence-based approach to research participation may result in an improved research experience for SDMs and promote retention of participants in such studies. This is a much needed area of study highlighted by a call for public input on the TCPS section on use of an exception to consent.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></p><p>From a methodological perspective, we acknowledge that our qualitative data will be based on parent/guardian recall and accept this as an inherent limitation of our study design. While other investigators have successfully audio recorded informed consent discussions in real time,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> we believe that it would be impracticable to attempt similar methods in our study where the RCT consent process is typically occurring in the intensive care unit (ICU) environment and may involve multiple interactions between the CRA and SDM(s). Moreover, we do not wish to burden parents/guardians with concurrent requests for consent, which may risk not only coercion but also participant retention in the parent trial. To assess the reliability of our qualitative data, study participants will be offered the opportunity to participate in a second interview during which the data from the first interview will be reviewed, discussed and revised as needed. Strengths of our protocol include an intentional structuring of study procedures to mitigate real or perceived competing interests of the PI of the parent trial and incorporation of a novel safety plan for research staff to follow should they witness emotional distress in a research participant. The latter is particularly relevant given recent findings of high levels of depression among caregivers of ICU survivors.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> Our protocol has also been designed to meet recommended reporting requirements for qualitative research.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></p><p>In summary, this qualitative study is the product of an innovative collaboration between the principal investigator of an RCT employing an exception to consent process and a Bioethicist. Collaborations of this nature require mutual trust, a commitment to sharing perspectives and a willingness of the clinical researcher to expose themselves and the parent trial in which they are invested to scrutiny. We look forward to the findings our study will generate being used to support development of evidence-based ethics guidelines and to optimise the experiences of SDMs in future research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Emilio Aguirre is the CRA for the SQUEEZE pilot trial, and assisted with development of procedures for communication between the CRA and QRA.
