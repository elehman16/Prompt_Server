The high prevalence of FD, as a functional disorder of the digestive system, has turned it into a major health issue in different societies (Jones, 2002<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Hoky et al., 1998<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Almost 25% of people experience dyspepsia symptoms at least six times a year. In addition, FD is the cause of 60% of all dyspepsia cases. According to the ROME III diagnostic criteria, FD is diagnosed when two or more of following symptoms are present: early satiation, postprandial fullness, and epigastric pain or epigastric burning in the absence of organic or metabolic diseases with symptom starting at least six months before diagnosis (Khademolhosseini et al., 2010<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Longo et al., 2013<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). However, there are some other dyspepsia symptom, such as over-belching, bloating, vomiting, and nausea. FD is divided into two often-overlapping syndromes, namely, postprandial syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome (Masoumi et al, 2015<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Lack of a standard treatment for FD, along with periodical and chronic signs in these patients has resulted in increased number of studies that have focused on discovering the pathophysiology and finding new treatments for this disease (Amini and Keshteli, 2012<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Tack, 2005<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Tack and Talley, 2006<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Madish and Labenz, 2005<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>).</p><p>Relative limitations of typical medications in controlling FD symptoms and the uncertainty about their mechanisms have increased patients&#x02019; tendency to use complementary and alternative medicine, specifically acupuncture, as well as medicinal herbs and natural products to relieve the symptoms (Talley, 1995<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Therefore, according to specific complementary and traditional medicine of each region, different studies, mainly on native plants, have been conducted in different countries. Moreover, the effectiveness of many simple and compound preparation of medicinal herbs produced in Iran, China, India, Australia, etc., has been proved (Ottillinger, 2013<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Zheng et al., 2009<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Remedies made from <italic>Apium graveolens</italic> and <italic>Trachyspermum copticom</italic> (AT) are among medications that have been widely mentioned in traditional medicine references of Iran as a treatment for dyspepsia. This preparation is comprised of an equal combination of AT, and is among the simplest medicinal compounds used for the treatment of dyspepsia (UNESCO, 2009<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Aliasl, 2015<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Melzer et al., 2004<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). According to different studies, medicinal herbs act concertedly in combination with each other and are able to relieve several clinical symptoms. This property is very important in the treatment of multifactorial diseases, such as functional gastrointestinal disease (Wegner and Wagner, 2006<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Although, several studies have been done on the therapeutic effects of AT, no clinical trial on the effectiveness of AT Iranian traditional remedies for the treatment of FD has been performed. </p><p>
<italic>Trachyspermum copticom</italic> belong to the family Umbelliferrae, and gamma-terpinen, thymol and p-cymene are the most abundant substances found in its essence (Malekinejad et al., 2012<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Furthermore, therapeutic effects of <italic>Trachyspermum copticum</italic> on digestive system include antifungal (Khosravi et al., 2015<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Sharifzadeh and Shokri, 2016<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>); antibacterial and antiparasitic (Zomorodian et al., 2015<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Zomorodian and Ghdiri, 2015<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>); anti-diarrhea (Balaji et al., 2012<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>); anti-spasmodic, anti-inflammatory, strong antioxidant (Kazemi, 2014<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Alavinezhad and Boskabadi, 2014<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>); analgesic (Dashti-Rahmatabadi et al, 2007<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>); anti-<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (Nariman et al,2016<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>); gastric-ulcer healing (Tajic et al, 2016<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>), and Ileum relaxant (Hejazian et al, 2007<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>) activities.</p><p>
<italic>Apium graveolence</italic> is a member of the family Umbelliferrae, and d-Limonene and selinene are the most important compounds found in its essence (Sowbhagya, 2014<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). <italic>A. graveolence</italic> effects on digestive system include significant inhibitory effects on gastric ulcers and inflammation (Powanda et al., 2015<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>) and analgesic, anti-oxidant and anti-bacterial properties (Kooti et al., 2014<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Nguyen et al.,2014<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>) as well as <italic>H. pylori</italic> and inhibitory effects on gastric cancer cells (Kooti et al, 2014<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>A. graveolens</italic> and <italic>T. copticom</italic> are among Iran's native plants with several therapeutic applications in Iranian traditional medicine.

<bold>Setting and participants</bold>
</p><p>This randomized double-blind trial was conducted in Kerman University of Medical Sciences. In total, 180 FD patients visiting Afzalipour Hospital between August 2015 and April 2016, were first gastroenterologist, first examined in the study by a gastroenterologist, and selected based on the ROME III diagnostic criteria. Among them, 150 subjects who satisfied inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study after signing the informed consent forms. The inclusion criteria were FD patients, aged 18-60 years old, who based on the ROME III diagnostic criteria, did not meet exclusion criteria. </p><p>The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, breastfeeding, having active urinary tract infection, history of seizure, concurrent use of other FD-related chemicals and herbal drugs, occurrence of severe side effects associated with the drugs, history of peptic ulcer and reflux disease, consumption of anticoagulants, having irritable bowel syndrome, history of esophageal, stomach, and intestinal surgeries, serious organic diseases (e.g. diabetes and cardiovascular diseases), consumption of narcotic substances, severe mental retardation, unwillingness of subject for participation, not completing the informed consent form, and emergence of warning symptoms (e.g. weight loss, anemia, blood in the stool, and dysphagia)</p><p>
<bold>Intervention</bold>
</p><p>In this study<italic> T. copticum </italic>(L.) with a herbarium number of KF1447, and <italic>A. graveolence </italic>(L.) with a herbarium number of KF1138 were kept in School of Pharmacy, Kerman University of Medical Sciences. After two-weeks screening period, patients were divided into three groups through randomization by minimization. The investigated traditional remedy comprised of an equal mixture of <italic>A. graveolens</italic> and <italic>T. copticom</italic>, prepared as 500 mg capsules by Pharmacognosy Department of Kerman University of Medical Sciences. Standardization and quality control procedures for this preparation were carried out by Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company. Two capsules of AT (500mg) were administered per day, one after breakfast and one after dinner for four weeks. In the placebo group, two 500 mg capsules of cornstarch were administered per day, one after breakfast and one after dinner. The omeprazole group took one 20 mg omeprazole capsule per day (Ivanova NG, 2002) on an empty stomach. All three groups took the medications for four weeks and were assessed during a 4-week follow-up period.</p><p>
<bold>Outcome and measurement</bold>
</p><p>In this trial, the severity and frequency of symptoms during the treatment period, after the completion of treatment period, and after the 4-week follow-up, were evaluated. The Stangellini&#x02019;s symptom severity questionnaire and ROME III symptom frequency questionnaire, were used to assess the outcomes. These questionnaires were completed on enrollment, and after two, four and eight weeks (Baohai et al., 2013<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). The symptom severity questionnaire includes eight items with the final score ranging between 8 and 32. The symptom frequency questionnaire is comprised of eight items with the final score ranging between 8 and 48.</p><p>
<bold>Sample size</bold>
</p><p>According to parameters obtained from the pilot study, the sample size was 42. However, the final sample size was calculated to be 50 in each group. </p><p>
<bold>Randomization and blinding</bold>
</p><p>Randomization was done by minimization. Then, patients were purposively assigned to these groups based on possible confounding factors, namely, age and gender, to match these three groups with respect to these factors. The initial symptoms of the patients were well matched as possible.</p><p>This trial was a double-blind study. Drugs were identically packaged and coded in the Pharmacognosy Department of Kerman University of Medical Sciences. The person who did the coding was not involved in the study. The examinations and follow-up assessments were done by someone who was unaware of the coding procedure. A third person, who was unaware of research objectives, divided the patients in one of these three groups and gave them the medications based on their initial descriptions. The statistical analysis was done by a fourth person, who was unaware of the grouping.</p><p>
<bold>Statistical methods</bold>
</p><p>Demographic information including age, sex, marital status, and educational level of patients in three groups was compared using Chi-square test. To compare the severity and frequency of changes in these three groups at four different time points (on enrollment, and after two, four, and eight weeks), the repeated-measures test was used. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS 23 and a p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. </p><p>

In the AT group, one subject was excluded after two weeks due to irregular consumption of the medication, and finally the treatment and follow-up periods were completed with 49 subjects. In the placebo group, two subjects were excluded due to irregular consumption of the medication, two due to drug intolerance (sensitivity to gelatin capsule shells and diarrhea after taking the placebo), two due to consumption of self-prescribed dyspepsia drugs, and one due to pregnancy. In total, 43 subjects in the placebo group completed the treatment and follow-up periods. In the omeprazole group, two subjects were excluded due to irregular consumption of medication, two due to consumption of dyspepsia drugs, and one due to drug intolerance (severe headache following consumption of omeprazole).

In a study conducted in 2005 by Rafieian-kopaei and Hosseini, the overall decrease of functional dyspepsia symptoms was significantly greater in the <italic>Ocimum bacillicum-</italic>treated group than in the placebo group (Rafieian-Kopaei and Hosseini, 2005<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Another study showed that the overall decrease of functional dyspepsia symptoms was significantly greater in the <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>-administered group than in the placebo group (Raveendra et al., 2012<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Moreover Mohtashami et al.demonstrated that the overall decrease of functional dyspepsia symptoms was significantly greater in the group received honey-based preparation of <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> as compared to the placebo group (Mohtashami et al., 2015<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Pasalar et al. (2015)<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref> performed a study on the effect of Jollab, an Iranian traditional remedy on FD patients and observed that the decrease in overall severity and frequency scores were higher in Jollab-treated group than in the placebo group (Pasalar et al, 2015<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>).</p><p>Considering each individual symptom the improvement in symptoms, such as epigastric pain, bloating, early satiation, postprandial fullness, burning, nausea and belching was significantly greater in the AT group than in the two others groups throughout the trial. It is worth noting that symptom severity improvement initiated from two weeks after the intervention and continued until the end of the follow-up period. Regarding the symptoms frequency, the improvement initiated with a short delay from the fourth week and continued until the end of the follow-up period. In a study conducted by Ghoshegir et al. (2015), it was found that the improvement of FD was greater in the Pimpinella anisum-treated group than in the placebo group. Considering each individual symptom P. anisum was more effective than placebo in the improvement of symptoms such as postprandial fullness, early satiation, belching, burning, and loss appetite (Ghoshegir et al. 2015).</p><p>AT, as an Iranian traditional remedy was significantly more effective than omeprazole in the improvement of symptoms such as belching, bloating, postprandial fullness, early satiation, and epigastric burning. Considering epigastric pain improvement, both medications were effective and there was no significant difference between them. Regarding the improvement of nausea and vomiting, there was no significant difference between AT and omeprazole in addition, the difference between omeprazole and placebo groups was not significant. Zohaninezhad et al. (2015)<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref> evaluated the clinical symptoms of children with gastroesophageal reflux, and did not observe any significant difference between the effects of Quin syrup and omeprazole (Zohalinezad et al., 2015<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Zohalinezhad et al. in a study (2016) found no significant difference between the therapeutic effect of <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> and omeprazole on clinical symptoms of patients with gastroesophageal reflux (Zohalinezad et al, 2016<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>).</p><p>In comparison between omeprazole and placebo, although the former was more effective in reducing the total score of symptoms, the difference was not significant, except for pain and epigastric burning. In a study conducted by Talley et al. (1998)<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref> on the effect of omeprazole on FD, no significant difference was observed between omeprazole and placebo in reducing dysmotility syndrome-related symptoms. However, omeprazole was more significantly effective than the placebo against ulcer-like symptoms (Talley et al., 1998<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr"> &#x025b6;</xref>).</p><p>According to the present study, AT, Iranian traditional remedy was more effective than omeprazole and placebo in improving FD symptoms (postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome). This study was associated with some limitations, such as being a single-center study, limited sample size, and short follow-up period. Therefore, results of this study are not generalizable to all FD patients. However, AT can be prescribed as an adjuvant medication, with few side effects, for FD patients after theconduction of further studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This
