It is a modified technique in which the local anesthetic is injected in the neurovascular plane between the transversus abdominis muscle and internal oblique muscle of the anterior of the abdominal wall via the lumbar triangle of Petit.

Only the patients with indirect hernias, fully reducible according to the Nyhus classification,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-lra-6-001">10</xref> were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were scrotal hernias, recurrent hernias, contraindication to spinal anesthesia, failure in spinal anesthesia, body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;35 kg/m<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-lra-6-001">2</xref>, known allergy or contraindication to study drugs, chronic hepatic or renal failure, and preoperative opioid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment for chronic pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-lra-6-001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Patients were allocated randomly by sealed, opaque envelopes &#x02013; which were not opened until patient consent had been obtained &#x02013; into groups according to a computergenerated sequence of random numbers. The patients, their anesthesiologists, investigators providing postoperative care, and the surgeon were blinded to group assignment. All patients were premedicated with midazolam at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg intravenous (IV) before surgery. Heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure, and peripheric O<sub>2</sub> saturation were monitored during surgery in 15-minute intervals. Supplemental oxygen was administered to all patients via a nasal cannula. Patients were placed in the lateral decubitus position. Spinal anesthesia was applied to all patients with 3.5 mL of heavy bupivacaine in the L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> subarachnoid space. The surgery was begun after checking the level of block with the pin-prick test every 2 minutes, until the block remained at the same level three consecutive times. The patients were randomly assigned to group I (the patients who did not receive TAP block) or group II (the patients who did receive TAP block). All the patients were operated on by the same surgeon. Lichtenstein technique was used for inguinal hernia repair in both groups. A propylene mesh was placed to fit the foor of the inguinal canal and its apex was sutured to the pubic tubercle using a 3-0 prolene suture. The lower border of the mesh was attached to the free edge of the inguinal ligament after making an opening to accommodate the spermatic cord. The mesh was anchored to the conjoint tendon by interrupted sutures. At the end of the operation, after the mesh was placed, the iliac crest was palpated in order to check the insertion point of the needle; then the skin, which was marked before surgery by the anesthesiologist, was pierced with a blunt regional anesthesia needle (Plexufix; B Braun, Melsungen, Germany) at the level of the Petit triangle near the midaxillary line. The needle was advanced at right angles to the skin in a coronal plane, until resistance was encountered. This showed that the needle tip was at an external oblique muscle. The needle was gently advanced and the tip of the needle was gently controlled in the open surgical plane by the surgeon until it entered the plane between the internal and external oblique muscles. After passing through the internal oblique muscle and further advancement into the transversus abdominis fascial plane, the needle was carefully aspirated to exclude vascular puncture. 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine or the same volume of saline was injected in incremental doses through needle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-lra-6-001">Figure 2</xref>). All the blocks were performed by the same surgeon at the end of the surgery before fascial closure. Study solutions were prepared by an anesthesiologist who was not involved in performing the block or data collection.</p><p>Operation time, systolic arterial pressure, and diastolic and mean arterial pressures were recorded in 15 minutes intervals during operation. At the end of the operation, 50 mg of IV dexketoprofen was injected into all patients. Pain assessments were scored for all patients at rest with coughing at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery by an anesthesiologist (independent observer) who did not know the group assignment. VAS (0: no pain to 10: worst imaginable pain) was used for pain assessment, for which all patients received instructions prior to surgery. Patients were given IV paracetamol if VAS &#x0003e; 3, maximally 4 times a day at 6-hour intervals. As a rescue analgesic, morphine IV 0.05 mg/kg was applied to patients if their VA S score was &#x0003e;3, if paracetamol had been administered less than 6 hours before. Morphine injection was repeated up to 15 mg in 4 hours. At any time, if pain relief was inadequate, an alternative opioid (tramadol) IV at a dose of 1 mg/kg was used. Total analgesic consumption and morphine requirement in the 24-hour postoperative period were also recorded. Any complications related to interventions were also noted.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).

On the other hand, an abdominal field block (eg, TAP block) can only provide analgesia for the parietal component of postoperative pain of major gynecologic surgery which consists of procedures ranging from relatively minor procedures to formal staging laparotomy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-lra-6-001">17</xref> In our study, none of our patients was morbidly obese and surgical insult was consistent and produced small to moderate surgical trauma. This may be one of the reasons why we observed such a big difference between groups in postoperative VAS scores and total analgesic consumption and morphine requirement in the 24-hour postoperative period.</p><p>Several approaches have been described for performing TAP block &#x02013; the classic posterior blind approach and ultrasound-guided approaches. The blind technique was initially described by Raf.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-lra-6-001">18</xref> It involves injection of local anesthetic solution into the TAP using the double pop of piercing the fascial planes via the iliolumbar triangle of Petit.</p><p>In a recent approach, often called the subcostal approach, local anesthetic is injected into the same anatomic plane using an insertion point near the xiphoid process. This approach may offer superior analgesia for abdominal operations above the umbilicus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-lra-6-001">17</xref> On the other hand, Jankovic et al showed in their cadaveric study that the position of the lumbar triangle of Petit varies largely and its size is small, and that the nerves to be blocked had not entered TAP in the specimens at the point of the lumbar triangle of Petit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-lra-6-001">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-lra-6-001">20</xref> This makes the performance of TAP block less convenient and more difficult in supine patients. It was also demonstrated that, at the midaxillary line, all the nerves were within the transversus abdominis plane. We performed TAP block in this study at the level of the Petit triangle near the midaxillary line, marking the insertion point of the needle before the surgery and controlling the position of the needle and spread of the local anesthetic in the open surgical plane in our semi-blind approach of TAP block.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First of all, we did not assess pain scores and analgesic consumption after 24 hours because of our ward conditions. However, TAP block has been shown to produce effective analgesia for 48 hours postoperatively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-lra-6-001">6</xref> We did not assess pain on movement but only assessed the pain at rest with coughing. TAP block reduced postoperative opioid use, although we have no data on postoperative nausea and other opioid dependent side effects. Our findings may not be generalized to obese patients with different surgical subtypes, since our study was conducted on patients undergoing a specific type of surgery with moderate surgical trauma. Measurement of sensory blockade was not performed in the postoperative period so that investigators could be adequately blinded.</p><p>Some complications like puncture of intraperitoneal viscera and liver have been documented after a blind TAP block.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-lra-6-001">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-lra-6-001">23</xref> McDermott et al demonstrated in their study that that the needle tip and local anesthetic spread were in the correct plane only in 17 (23%) of 72 injections in 36 patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-lra-6-001">23</xref> In the remaining 55 patients the needle tip was in the subcutaneous tissue in one patient, the external oblique muscle in one patient, between the external and internal oblique muscles in five patients, the internal oblique muscle in 26 patients, the transversus abdominis muscle in nine patients, and the peritoneum in 13 patients. TAP block was performed bilaterally using the standard landmark based blind technique and ultrasonography was used to detect the needle position and local anesthetic spread in that study. The use of ultrasound may reduce such complications; we did not observe any complications in our patients, since we used the semi-blind technique. This might be caused by the fact that TAP block was performed by advancing the needle carefully, with the tip of the advancing needle controlled by the fnger of the surgeon in the open surgical plane. Hence, the analgesic effect of TAP block may partly depend on the increase in the serum concentration of the local anesthetic. TAP block may cause systemic toxicity of local anesthetic,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-lra-6-001">24</xref> therefore, we used a relatively diluted amount of bupivacaine in the present study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, it was shown that semi-blind TAP block may be an effective way of providing analgesia in patients undergoing elective open inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-lra-6-001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Siddiqui</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Sajid</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Uncles</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheek</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Baig</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A meta-analysis on the clinical effectiveness of transversus abdominis plane block</article-title><source>J Clin Anesth</source><year>2011</year><volume>23</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>7</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21296242</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-lra-6-001"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>PL</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathiesen</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Torup</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Dahl</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The transversus abdominis plane block: a valuable option for postoperative analgesia?
