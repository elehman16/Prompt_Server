Its popularity stems from its simplicity, safety and efficacy in all age groups and is widely used for post-operative pain relief. It may be used as the sole anesthetic in high risk patient and most commonly used in conjunction with general anesthesia. A previous study proved that complications related to SCD including acute chest syndrome, painful crisis and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) were common with the regional anesthesia compared with general anesthesia,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] while another study suggested that there were no significant differences.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>SCD is caused by mutations in the &#x000df;-hemoglobin gene and the affected persons have extremely variable phenotypes. Individuals homozygous for the S gene have sickle cell (SC) anemia while SCD refers to all individuals with either homozygous sickle cell anemia or who are heterozygous for the S and another abnormal beta globin gene.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The pathophysiology of this disease is complex and has components of sickle vaso-occlusion and hemolysis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The bone in SCD is affected by microinfarction, osteopenia, osteoporosis, osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Both low 25-hydroxyl vitamin D [25(OH)D] and low bone mineral density (BMD) have been described in children with SCD.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Vitamin D and calcium are required for optimal bone health. 90% of required vitamin D synthesis come from exposure to sunlight. Persons with SCD are at particular risk for vitamin D deficiency (VDD) due to melanin skin hyper-pigmentation, which blocks cutaneous vitamin D production and high rates of lactose intolerance that leads to a reduced intake of vitamin D fortified dairy products. This also might explain, in part, the high incidence of VDD among individuals with SCD who are primarily of African descent.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Studies in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, India, Turkey and Australia, revealed that 30-50% of children and adults were deficient in 25(OH)D with levels below 20 ng/ml.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of prophylactic vitamin D on post-operative analgesia and post-operative complications among patients with SCD undergoing circumcision.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After approval from hospital ethics committee and written informed consent from the parents, 58 male children (aged 2-6 years) belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade II and scheduled to undergo elective circumcision were enrolled for the study, which was carried out between January and August 2012. A total of 58 patients were included in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups (29 each): Group that was administered 400 IU vitamin D for 6 months (Group 1) and those without vitamin D (Group 2). Blinding was achieved as double-blind (i.e. patients and clinician were unaware with the selection process). Random allocation of the patients belonging to each group was performed by computer-generated random table. Exclusion criteria included severe systemic disease, pre-existing neurological or obvious spinal disease, bleeding diathesis and a history of seizure disorder or a known hypersensitivity to amide-type local anesthetics.</p><p>The pre-anesthetic examination comprised of detailed history and systemic examination for end organ damage and acute chest syndrome (ACS). A full neurological examination was performed to elicit any neurological deficit from a previous CVA. Any complications associated with previous blood transfusion, surgery and anesthesia was also assessed. A through airway examination was performed for possible difficult intubation. Pre-operative investigations included complete blood count, coagulation profile, liver functions, renal functions, chest X-ray and echocardiogram in all patients. All patients followed the standard fasting guidelines prior to surgery.</p><p>A 22-gauge intravenous cannula was inserted into the dorsum of the hand in the premedication room. The fluid requirement was calculated depending on the age, weight of the patient and the fasting hours and transfused accordingly. In the operating room, standard monitoring included: pulse oximetry, end tidal carbon dioxide, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiography and temperature. Dehydration, over hydration, hypoxia, cold exposure and acidosis were avoided.</p><p>General anesthesia was induced using sevoflurane with 100% oxygen through Jackson Rees modification of Ayres T piece. Once adequate depth of anesthesia was achieved, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane caudal block was performed in the lateral decubitus position with both knees drawn up. Injecting 0.75 ml/kg bupivacaine (0.25%) subsequently, the surgical procedure was conducted. At the end of circumcision, LMA was removed and the patient was shifted later on to post-anesthesia care unit once they regained protective airway reflexes and regained consciousness. The duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia and first time to rescue analgesia were recorded.</p><p>Post-operative analgesia was recorded for the first post-operative day using face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) pain evaluation scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. A total score per patient is between 0 and 10. Scores can be grouped as: 0 = relaxed and comfortable; 1-3 = mild discomfort; 4-6 = moderate pain; 7-10 = severe pain. If the FLACC pain[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] score was &#x02265;5, paracetamol (Perfalgan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was given in a dose of 15 mg/kg, every 4-6 h as slow IV infusion over 15 min for pain relief. Adequate analgesia is necessary for effective physiotherapy, rapid ambulation and rapid discharge from the hospital.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>FLACC pain evaluation scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-30-20-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Ramsey Sedation Scale was used for post-operative sedation follow-up:[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>

Painful crisis was the most commonly observed SCD-related post-operative complication wherein, the risk among the non-vitamin D group was 4 folds more than the vitamin D group (3.4% in vitamin D group vs. 13.7% in the other group).

Adhesion, hemolysis and deformation are interlinked, together leading to profound disruption of the vascular function.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Deficiencies of calcium and vitamin D <italic>in utero</italic> and in childhood may prevent the maximum deposition of calcium in the skeleton.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] While treatment with vitamin D and calcium improved both 25(OH)D levels and BMD, long-term vitamin D and calcium therapy is likely to be required given the chronicity of SCD and its relentless vaso-occlusive hemolytic and inflammatory complications. Because low BMD was observed in young adults, screening for VDD should be considered at an earlier age, preferably in childhood.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It was reported that VDD has been linked to chronic pain including pain with SCD, arthralgia, leg pain in older adults, headache, postherpetic neuralgia, diffuse bone and muscle pain and chronic back pain.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Furthermore, Colleen suggested that not only an association of low vitamin D levels with various pain syndromes, but also an improvement in symptoms with vitamin D repletion.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, supplementation of vitamin D may serve a dual role in SCD patients by helping to improve both bone health and the chronic pain experience. The treatment of VDD led to improvement in pain symptoms and decreased the use of pain medications in non-SC subjects with the chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Osunkwo <italic>et al</italic>. reported that with advance of age, individuals with SCD experience daily chronic pain. He gave a 6-week course of oral high-dose vitamin D (4000-100 000 IU/week) for children and adolescents SCD subjects with vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency and monitored prospectively for a period of 6 months. Subjects who received this high-dose of vitamin D achieved higher serum 25(OH)D, experienced fewer pain days per week and had higher physical activity quality-of-life scores. These findings suggest a potential benefit of vitamin D in reducing pain in SCD.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Vieth reported that excessive amounts of Vitamin D can be harmful to infants and may be characterized by nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation, abdominal pain, muscle weakness, muscle and joint aches, confusion, fatigue and may be kidney damage. Vitamin D intoxication is extremely rare, but can be caused by inadvertent or intentional ingestion of excessively high doses. Doses of 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day for up to 5 months, however, do not cause toxicity.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In our work, we started prophylactic vitamin D before surgery for the same period of time and it was associated with a significant decrease analgesic requirements and at the same time the post-operative complications were noticeably less among these patients (both related and non-related to SCD). Vitamin D group was associated with significant intraoperative slow heart rate and also highly significant higher sedation scores, which may be contributed to the effect of vitamin D in SCD patients.</p><p>The most important limitations of this study were that the post-operative follow-up was only for 24 h, the number of patients in each group was small and the short course of prophylactic vitamin D used. Furthermore, we suggest a study to evaluate gender difference.</p><p>The results of the present study reveal that the use of prophylactic vitamin D in SCD resulted in delayed post-operative analgesic request and less total analgesic consumption. Administration of vitamin D was also associated with noticeable less post-operative SCD complications. This work focused on the significance of vitamin D in management of SCD patients. Prophylactic vitamin D has proved a modifiable effect on the anesthetic outcome in male SC children subjected to circumcision.</p><p>Further studies are indicated which involve both genders; different nations and use of vitamin D for long duration in patients with SCD need to determine the overall efficacy of this therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Platt</surname><given-names>OS</given-names></name><name><surname>Brambilla</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosse</surname><given-names>WF</given-names></name><name><surname>Milner</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name><name><surname>Castro</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Steinberg</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Mortality in sickle cell disease.
