However, many patients still experience nausea and vomiting on days 3&#x02013;5. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an increase in duration of aprepitant consumption from 3 to 6 days on the prevention of nausea and vomiting in women receiving AC chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>It was a randomized, crossover, controlled clinical trial. Women with breast cancer and scheduled to receive AC regimens were enrolled in this study. Enrolled patients were randomized into two groups. Group I received 3 days regimen of aprepitant in the first course of AC regimen chemotherapy and 6 days regimen of aprepitant in the second course; Group II received 6 days regimen followed by 3 days regimen. For nausea and vomiting assessment, we used Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Forty-nine patients were enrolled in this study. Sixty-three percent achieved a complete response with 6 days aprepitant regimen compared with 39% with 3 days regimen (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Ten percent had at least one vomiting episode during the 6 days regimen versus 15% with 3 days regimen (<italic>P</italic> = 0.034).

This side effect impairs patients&#x02019;quality of life, decline cognitive functions, and physical ability and may eventually affect the patient's desire to continue further chemotherapy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The mechanisms of CINV seems to be depend on the cellular injury induced by chemotherapy, which may release neurotransmitters.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Dopamine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) are the major excitatory neurotransmitters that are involved in emesis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Several patient-related risk factors for CINV are generally assumed, including gender, age, alcohol use, and history of motion sickness.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Patients &#x0003c;50 years old and women are more likely to suffer from CINV.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Although, chemotherapy agents are vary in degrees of emetogenic potential and combinations of emetogenic agents may have additive effects on the overall CINV.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The combination of anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy is a particularly high risk for inducing nausea and vomiting and considered as being highly emetogenic.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Strategies for antiemetic prophylaxis have developed in recent years.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Some antiemetic guidelines for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) recommend the use of the oral neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists as part of a routine regimen that also includes a corticosteroid and a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The incidence of CINV in patients receiving HEC, including breast cancer patients treated with 5-HT3&#x02013;receptor antagonists is approximately 50%.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Aprepitant is the first commercially available drug of a new class of NK1 receptor antagonists with little or no affinity for other NK receptors.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Approved by Food and Drug Administration in 2003 for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis and usually administered for a period of 3 days.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Recent studies reveal the efficacy of aprepitant in preventing CINV in patients who received AC and nonAC-based HEC regimen.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>However, despite these results, many cancer patients still experience CINV;[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] also the trend has now been reversed with increasing nausea and vomiting on days 3&#x02013;5. Hence, there is clearly a need for more effective prevention of CINV in patients receiving HEC on delay phase, especially in a patient, who is particularly susceptible to these symptoms such as women.</p><p>Here, we present the study of aprepitant duration for the management of nausea and vomiting associated with AC-containing chemotherapy in women with breast cancer. We hypothesized that addition of aprepitant duration from 3 to 6 days would improve emetic symptoms in women receiving AC &#x02013; based chemotherapy for breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomized, crossover, controlled clinical trial (IRCT2015040121574N1), and designed to evaluate the effect of increase in duration of aprepitant usage from 3 days to 6 days on the prevention of nausea and vomiting in women receiving combination of AC chemotherapy. This trial was conducted in referral university hospital in Isfahan (Iran's third largest city, located in the center of Iran), Iran. The Medical Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences has approved the study design, protocols, and informed consent procedure (the ethical code was 393449).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty patients with breast cancer were enrolled in this study through convenience sampling method. We included patients who were under 50 years of age, diagnosed with breast cancer and scheduled to receive four courses AC regimens. The following general exclusion criteria were considered: Previous history of gastritis, diabetes, and a brain tumor. In order to detect two-fifth standard deviation difference in the main outcome (nausea severity score), with &#x003b1; =0.05 and power = 80%. We considered 10% attrition rate and the final sample size was estimated 50 patients (25/group). Patients served as their own controls for study cycles.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>Enrolled patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. According to the crossover design of the study, Group I received Treatment A (3 days regimen) in the first course of 1-day AC regimen chemotherapy and Treatment B (6 days regimen) in the second course of 1-day AC regimen chemotherapy; Group II received Treatment B followed by Treatment A. Treatment A (3 days regimen) consisted of aprepitant (ABITANT, Abidi, Iran) 125 mg orally plus dexamethasone 8 mg injected intravenous (IV) on day 1 followed by 80 mg dexamethasone once per day on days 2 and 3 administered orally (p.o.). Treatment B (6 days regimen) consisted of aprepitant 125 mg orally plus dexamethasone 8 mg injected IV on day 1 followed by 80 mg dexamethasone once per day on days 2 through 6 administered orally (p.o.). There was a 30-day washout between the first and second courses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Measurement</title><p>Patients were followed from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of chemotherapy for a total of 7 days.</p><p>For nausea and vomiting assessment, we used Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group common toxicity criteria questionnaire, asking patients to answer two specific questions about any nausea and vomiting symptoms. First question was about nausea severity on a 0&#x02013;3 scale (0 = being no nausea, 1 = able to eat reasonable intake, 2 = intake significantly decreased but can eat, 3 = no significant intake) and second question was about vomiting (0 = none, 1 = 1 episode in 24 h, 2 = 2&#x02013;5 episodes in 24 h, 3 = 6&#x02013;10 episodes in 24 h, and 4 = &#x0003e;10 episodes in 24 h, or requiring parenteral support). Complete response (CR) was defined as no nausea and no episodes of vomiting during the study period.</p><p>All patients were given this questionnaire on cycle 1 and cycle 2, at baseline (prior to each chemotherapy treatment course), and after 7 days. Only patients with no symptom of nausea and vomiting (score of zero) at baseline (before chemotherapy) were eligible for entering to each cycle of this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS version 20 (Release 2011, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for windows.

Substantial development has been made in improving the control of CINV, largely because of the introduction of antiemetic agents. However, this trend has now been reversed with increasing nausea and vomiting on days 3&#x02013;5.</p><p>This crossover clinical trial in women with breast cancer addressed the potential efficacy of increase in duration of aprepitant consumption from 3 to 6 days for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by the combination of AC chemotherapy. The advantage of this crossover clinical trial design is less need for samples, the similarity of a participant in two intervention groups and the least Bayes.</p><p>In the current setting, we found that consumption of aprepitant for 6 days was superior to 3 days consumption in the proportion of patients achieving a CR overall after 1-day AC regimen chemotherapy (63% vs. 39%). As seen in previous trials CINV is well controlled on days 1 and 2 with aprepitant regimen. However, loss of control on days 6 through 8 in the delayed phase remains a challenge, therefore adding aprepitant to the standard antiemetic prophylaxis for 6 days provides a significant improvement in complete control for CINV from 43% to 63%.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Madsen <italic>et al</italic>. report that a 5-day dosing regimen of aprepitant is highly effective for preventing CINV, although, single doses of oral aprepitant 40 mg or oral aprepitant 125 mg alone were effective for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, other studies demonstrate 60&#x02013;80% CR to 3 days administration of aprepitant-containing regimen.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Badar <italic>et al</italic>. represent that more than75% of patients were free from nausea on day 1 and day 2 after use of aprepitant, but This fraction decreased from day 3 to day 7.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This discrepancy may be due to differences in the underlying disease, the patient characteristics, and the chemotherapy regimens the patients received; thus judgments should be made with caution.</p><p>We have shown in this study that the number of vomiting episodes is significantly lower during the 6 days aprepitant regimen than during the 3 days regimen. In agreement with our finding, other studies show a significant effect of aprepitant in the episodes of vomiting reduction, in patients treated with HEC regimens.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The main limitation of our study is a lack of placebo group to identify the placebo effect. We cannot allocate placebo group because not to treat nausea and vomiting in a patient who received chemotherapy is unethical.</p><p>The present study provides an experimental evidence of increase duration of aprepitant consumption can decline nausea severity. A patient who cannot significant intake due to severe nausea is 12% with 3 days regimen, versus 2% with 6 days regimen. A similar trend was seen in the previous studies where a patient who received 5 days of aprepitant had less nausea on day 6 and day 7.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29"
