Importantly, allergen avoidance should be indicated when possible and should be an integral part of the management strategy, according to the clinical and practical recommendations of ARIA guidelines for the management of allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>With regard to allergen avoidance or modification of allergen exposure, barrier protection measures for avoiding contact with allergens, such as nose filters or nasally applied cellulose powders, are being increasingly developed and evaluated in patients with allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In this context, a topical microemulsion made of glycerol esters for topical application in the nose has been developed, with the aim of conferring a protective effect in patients with allergic rhinitis. Its mechanism of action consists of creating a lipid coating that spreads over the surface of the nasal mucosa. Acting this way, the protective effect is achieved by creating a lipid barrier that prevents allergens being deposited onto the nasal mucosa and reaching the specific IgE of the mucosal immune system cells and engulfing allergens already present in the nasal mucosa. As such, the allergic reaction will be blocked by the application of the microemulsion at the very beginning of the allergic cascade, in contrast to commonly used symptomatic medications such as antihistamines or corticosteroids, which act at the end of this cascade.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the application of the topical microemulsion caused a reduction of nasal symptoms scores during one week of treatment in symptomatic patients with perennial allergic rhinitis due to house dust mites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, a reduction in nasal symptoms scores and a drop in a2-macroglobulin levels in nasal lavage fluid, indicative of attenuation of inflammation, were also observed after challenge with pollen allergen in patients with allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In this study, which included patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, the effect of a topical microemulsion was examined in a natural allergen exposure setting (during birch, grass, and olive tree pollen seasons). The intervention was given according to a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel group design in nine study centres in Spain and Sweden. Rhinitis-specific quality of life and symptoms characteristic of seasonal allergic rhinitis were monitored throughout the pollen season. We report on the symptom-reducing effects of the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Human Experimentation in Spain and Sweden and procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in the year 2000. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Patients were recruited in one Swedish centre (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22) and in 8 Spanish centres (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;88), with a varied geographical distribution in order to cover the different pollination patterns.</p><p>This randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre, multinational clinical trial (8 centres in Spain and 1 in Sweden) was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the topical microemulsion (ME group) compared to a normal saline solution (SS group) in adult patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis due to sensitization to grass, birch, or olive tree pollens. The diagnosis was made according to the investigators&#x02019; judgment based on the clinical picture correlated with positive skin prick tests (wheal diameter&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;mm) and/or specific IgE (titer&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.35 kU/L) for the allergenic extracts under consideration and routinely used by the investigators in their clinical practice. Potential participants were excluded if they had asthma of any origin, seasonal rhinitis with negative allergy testing, had received allergen-specific immunotherapy within the previous 36&#x000a0;months, or were on systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory drugs.</p><p>The patients were randomly assigned to receive the microemulsion (ME group) or the saline solution (SS group). The demographic characteristics are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The composition of the topical microemulsion was glycerol monooleate, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 400, sesame oil, polysorbate 80, sodium chloride 0.9%, menthol, eucalyptus oil and water, whereas the placebo was composed of sodium chloride 0.9%, menthol, eucalyptus oil and water at a neutral pH. Both products were manufactured by Reig Jofr&#x000e9; (Reig Jofr&#x000e9; Group S.A., Barcelona, Spain), according to international Good Manufacturing Practices. Treatment (one puff of either product b.i.d. per nostril, in the early morning and at midday) was administered throughout the expected dates of the pollen seasons for the pollens considered in this study. The pollen periods were defined according to the pollen counts provided by local agencies or networks, from the start of significant pollen counts until the end of significant pollen counts. Three visits were performed: just before the beginning (visit 1), in the middle (visit 2) and at the end of the pollen season (visit 3).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline demographic characteristics of the study subjects</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><td>&#x000a0;</td><th align="center"><bold>Statistic variable</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>ME group</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>SS group</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gender (M / F)<hr/></td><td>&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">n (%)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">28 (58.8) / 25 (47.1)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">25 (48.0) / 27 (51.9)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Age (years)<hr/></td><td>&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Mean (SD)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">32.6 (9.9)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34.9 (11.5)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td>&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Range<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">18.0 - 57.0<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">18.0 &#x02013; 69.0<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Duration of rhinitis (years)<hr/></td><td>&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Median (IQR)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">11.0 (9.0)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">10.0 (13.0)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td>&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Range<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.0 - 33.0<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.0 - 47.0<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sensitization profile<hr/></td><td>&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">% of subjects testing positive at SPT<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Grass pollen<hr/></td><td>&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">84.6<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">92.4<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Olive tree pollen<hr/></td><td>&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">46.1<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">52.8<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Birch tree pollen</td><td>&#x000a0;</td><td align="center">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center">25.0</td><td align="center">22.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><bold><italic>SPT</italic></bold> Skin Prick Test, <bold><italic>SD</italic></bold> Standard Deviation, <bold><italic>IQR</italic></bold> Interquartile range.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>At each visit, the investigators performed a physical examination on each subject indicating the presence or absence of the following symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal edema, nasal mucosa pallor, nasal crusts, eye redness, epiphora, conjunctival secretion, prolonged expiration, rhonchi or wheezing, and tachypnea. The participants completed a mini-RQLQ questionnaire (7, 8). At visit 1, the patients were provided with a daily symptoms and rescue medication consumption diary to be completed every day, at the end of the day, from visit 1 to visit 3. The severity of nasal symptoms (itching, runny nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion) and ocular symptoms (itching, redness, and tearing) was scored according to the following scale: 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no symptoms; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;mild symptoms; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate symptoms; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe symptoms, based on the patient&#x02019;s opinion. The patients were allowed to take topical antihistamines or corticosteroids, as well as commercially available oral antihistamines on an on-demand basis and according to the prescriptions made by the investigators. The brands as well as the number of times used per day were recorded on the dairy. Adverse events were recorded at visits 2 and 3, and a questionnaire on the patient&#x02019;s satisfaction with the treatment was completed at visit 3 (very satisfied; neither satisfied nor dissatisfied; dissatisfied; very dissatisfied).</p><p>The primary efficacy variable was the overall allergic rhinitis-related quality of life calculated by the least-squares mean of global scores in the self-administered mini-RQLQ questionnaire at visit 2 in the FAS population (randomized patients meeting all selection criteria and having a mini-RQLQ value at baseline). Secondary efficacy variables included: mini-RQLQ scores at visits 2 and 3 in the FAS (full analysis set) and PPS populations (FAS patients who completed the study treatment, did not take prohibited medications and had a value for the primary variable); number of nasal, ocular and lung signs (from the physical examination); severity of nasal and ocular symptoms, measured as the mean of nasal symptoms and of ocular symptoms (the sum of nasal symptoms divided by 4; the sum of ocular symptoms divided by 3; range: 0&#x02013;3); need for symptomatic medications; adherence (based on the medication returned by subjects); and the patient&#x02019;s satisfaction with treatment.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used for each outcome and intra and inter-group comparisons were made.

Only one event in the active group resulted in temporary discontinuation of the study treatment and two events in the control group resulted in definitive withdrawal.

This observation is of relevance in terms of how allergen avoidance can be achieved and how microemulsions may be used as a treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis.</p><p>This randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel study was performed according to the international recommendations for the evaluation of products for allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and with a similar design to other studies evaluating allergen avoidance strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Quality of life is an important treatment efficacy marker in patients with allergic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and in our study, the effect of the microemulsion was assessed using the validated and reliable mini-RQLQ questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], commonly used in patients with rhinitis and/or rhinoconjunctivitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Symptoms of allergic rhinitis recorded throughout the pollen season in the placebo group indicated that intensity was mild, reaching a score of 0.90 on a scale from 0 to 3 for total nasal symptoms. In patients who received the microemulsion intervention, least squares means of all variables derived from symptoms were nevertheless always lower compared with placebo, and this pattern reached statistical significance for total nasal symptoms. Accordingly, we suggest that topical/intranasal administration of small volumes of a microemulsion may be viewed as a preventive measure or treatment option in seasonal allergic rhinitis. This conclusion may be strengthened by the fact that the present comparator, i.e. isotonic saline, may not be a true placebo since isotonic (and hypertonic) saline may be effective in allergic rhinitis. For example, Garavello et al. showed that nasal administration of isotonic saline reduced nasal symptoms in children with seasonal allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The possibility that saline may exert such an effect, in combination with the significant difference between the microemulsion and isotonic saline in this study, underscores that the microemulsion is effective in seasonal allergic rhinitis.</p><p>In contrast to our previous study in seasonal allergic rhinitis in which a pool-device was used for experimental administration of a large volume of microemulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], this study involved repeated administration of a small volume (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) using a spray-like device. Symptoms were recorded in the evening, i.e. at time points up to 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;hours after dosing. The results therefore suggest that the microemulsion, given in small doses, was effective for many hours. Similarly, an extended effect was also suggested in our previous study of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis who received low-dose microemulsion intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Microemulsions containing glycerol monooleate are known to be bioadhesive and are probably not cleared by mucociliary activity as rapidly as, for example, suspensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This may explain why a small volume of microemulsion is sufficient for reducing symptoms in seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, further studies involving somewhat larger volumes and more frequent dosing may be considered to see if greater symptom-reducing effects can be achieved. Also, such studies should include comparisons with established treatments for allergic rhinitis including antihistamines and topical corticosteroids.</p><p>The findings in this study are in agreement with our previous observations on symptom-relieving effects in allergic rhinitis and support the hypothesis that the microemulsion reduces the interaction between the allergen and the mucosa in a non-specific fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Accordingly, we suggest that microemulsions may be efficacious for allergic rhinitis regardless of the type of allergen producing the nasal symptoms. Indeed, interventions aiming at avoiding allergen exposure or decreasing allergen exposure in general have recently received attention. A gel-forming cellulose powder was shown to reduce rescue medication use in a seasonal allergen exposure setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, symptoms were reduced by cellulose powder in an experimental challenge model involving dust mite allergens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Taken together, the above concepts highlight the possibility that devices aiming at physically protecting the nasal mucosa against allergens may be valid treatment options in allergic rhinitis. This may be viewed as being in line with current recommendations of allergen avoidance in allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that the topical application of the microemulsion reduces symptoms of seasonal rhinitis in a natural allergen exposure setting. Our finding suggests that topical microemulsions may be a useful option for avoiding mucosal exposure to allergens in this pathological condition. We suggest that microemulsions may be viewed as a means of reducing mucosal exposure to harmful inhaled factors in general.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANCOVA: Analysis of covariance; ARIA: Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma; b.i.d: Twice a day; FAS: Full analysis set; IgE: Immunoglobulin E; ME: Microemulsion; PPS: Per protocol set; RQLQ: Rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire; RR: Relative risk; SS: Saline solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Pedro Ojeda received honoraria from Reig Jofr&#x000e9; for the design and study direction.
