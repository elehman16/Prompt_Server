</p><p>All these approach options present, in turn, the most varied success and complication rates, such as: non reduction, iatrogenic fracture, neurovascular injury, soft tissue injury, medical team distress, pain and patient discomfort.</p><p>Despite the high incidence of shoulder dislocation and its importance in the orthopedic field, there are not, however, studies in the literature that compare the most diverse techniques regarding those mentioned aspects. Its indication is usually associated with experience and personal choice, unfounded on scientific evidence (most of the recommendations levels 4 and 5).</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate a traditional technique known by most orthopedists - Kocher's technique - to a most recent one, the Spaso maneuver, which does not has yet many references in the literature; however, it has shown excellent results in a few isolated published studies. We also seek to compare both techniques regarding efficacy, reduction time, applicability, patient comfort and complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a prospective, randomized clinical trial, approved by our institutional Ethics Research Committee (ERC), and it meets the standards of the National Research Ethics Commission (<italic>Comiss&#x000e3;o Nacional de &#x000c9;tica em Pesquisa</italic>, CONEP), being duly registered by the number 05998412.0.0000.5553. All patients included in the study signed the Free and Informed Consent form, having been previously informed on the nature of the study and their participation in it.</p><p>Between February 2011 and September 2012, 105 patients with traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation were seen in the Traumatology and Orthopedics Emergency Service in our hospital. After performing the appropriate propaedeutic - complete physical examination (including neurovascular evaluation) and shoulder radiographs on trauma series - all patients with confirmed diagnosis of dislocation were included in the study, since they did not present any exclusion criteria: use of analgesics after dislocation or fracture of the proximal humerus, unconsciousness, refusal to sign the consent form, failure to fill the evaluation form.</p><p>Patients were therefore randomized into two groups arbitrarily by means of previously numbered charts, being pair chart number corresponding to group A and even chart number to group B (zero was considered as even). The first group was submitted to reduction by the Spaso maneuver and the second using Kocher technique. Reductions were performed by a single Orthopedics and Traumatology resident physician, (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> year), and the time required for reduction was timed with a standard clock by an assistant who did not participate in the maneuver. The resident had three minutes to perform the reduction through the chosen maneuver, which occurred without previous administration of analgesics, anesthetics or muscle relaxants; after this period, in case of failure, he was free to try other methods. An evaluation form was filled, which contained the name, registration, age, gender, affected side, dislocation time, number of previous events, fracture or any neurovascular alteration detected before the procedure, no reduction of the dislocation, and the time of reduction, resident year, comments, complications, and subjective evaluation of pain reported by the patients using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). All residents had previous training - theoretical and practical - regarding the two maneuvers used.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Determining the sample size required to reject the null hypothesis with &#x003b1; value set at 0.05 was obtained from the literature review, drawing upon the effectiveness of the two reduction methods reported in several published and evaluated studies. Obtaining the significant difference in efficiency ratios described for the two maneuvers of approximately 11%, with the power of the test for the proposed hypothesis set at 80%, and the bicaudal test significance level at 5%, the Lehr<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> simplified formula was used to estimate the number of patients in each group, which was 43 patients. </p><p>The descriptive analysis was performed using standard methods, Student t-test for demographic variables with significance level &#x003b1; of 0.05 (all bicaudal tests), the Chi-square test was used to compare the effectiveness between the two methods and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to compare pain and time needed for reduction the between groups A and B.<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>The Spaso technique,<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> according to Miljesic and Kelly,<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> must be performed with the patient in supine position, with his shoulder flexed to 90&#x000b0;, elbow extended and the doctor keeping longitudinal traction in the affected limb to promote the elevation of the ipsilateral scapula from the exam table. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) Traction is maintained until the patient can relax enough to allow his scapula to touch the stretcher. The shoulder, right now, should be externally gently rotated to promote the reduction. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>) Finally, the internal rotation and extension of the already reduced limb is performed. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>)</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Glenohumeral dislocation is a very common diagnosis in orthopedic emergencies and brings to the patient high morbidity and disability. Thus, it is of importance its knowledge and proper management by the orthopedic physician. The classic mechanism of injury is described as indirect trauma on the limb which, in general, is presented in typical attitude, facilitating clinical diagnosis. Confirmation should be obtained by radiographic evaluation with the trauma series - true AP, scapular and axillary profile, as well as the neurovascular status and the presence of previously evaluated concomitant fracture.<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>Once the preliminary propaedeutic is performed, there should be emergency orthopedic intervention, aiming to relieve pain, bring comfort to the patient and, especially, minimizing damage to the noble and periarticular soft tissue structures. This is where the knowledge of various reduction techniques becomes important in order to obtain better results.</p><p>As mentioned, there is a wide range of maneuvers described, since from the most ancient techniques as Hippocrates, Kocher,<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Milch, Stimson,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> traction against traction, up to the Spaso technique, published in 1998.<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><p>The decision on the maneuver to be carried out depends on the experience of the orthopedist and personal choice, with weak grounding in scientific evidence (evidence level 4 or 5),<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in view of the lack of comparative studies among the methods. In our work, we opted for the evaluation of a classical method, described by Kocher in 1870,<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> known by most orthopedists, cited in most published studies, with efficacy ranging from 71% to 90% .<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Our result, however, showed 69.77% reduction through this technique, with an average time of 213.837 sec and pain level reported by the patients of 3,302 on the visual analogue scale. We compared the Kocher technique to a recent technique, described in 1998 by Miljesic and Kelly, <sup>4.14</sup> less known by most orthopedic surgeons, but that has shown very good outcomes in the few published works on thetopic.<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> According to the average described in the literature, we obtained reduction in 88.9% of cases by Spaso maneuver, taking an average time of 46.75 seconds with pain level of 3.13 on the VAS scale, on average.</p><p>The comparative analysis was in favor of Spaso maneuver, with a p value of 0.0035 obtained by chi-square test for effectiveness of the reduction between the techniques. The same outcome was obtained regarding the time required to reduce, by the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon method, with a p value less than 0.005. The only evaluated parameter that did not show significant difference between the groups was VAS.</p><p>We can infer from the data analysis, corroborated by hypothesis testing, that the Spaso maneuver was more efficient, fast and reproducible compared to Kocher's, showing also minimal complications and being feasible by a single performer, without previous analgesia.</p><p>It is known that the reduction maneuvers vary in nature: traction, lever, scapular manipulation and combined methods.<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The Spaso technique fits in traction group; however, it has important biomechanical basis, particularly anatomical.</p><p>Adapting what was described by Milch,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> we can consider that the shoulder has three major vector groups acting on each other, that reflect the local muscle action and act synergistically with a resultant oriented in the medial direction: horizontal (rotator cuff) oblique (teres major, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi) and vertical (deltoid, biceps and triceps), when in the anatomical position these groups are competing with each other. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Figure 8</xref>) The act of bending or elevating the limb promotes an alignment of these vector groups that begin to act in the same direction, minimizing muscular opposition known to play a key role in the failure of any reduction maneuver. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f09">Figure 9</xref>)</p><p>

</p><p>Another relevant aspect is the absence of analgesia, anesthesia or sedation in our protocol. According to some authors, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> analgesic medication may be omitted for the treatment of acute glenohumeral dislocations, especially when employing effective reduction technique, which is fast and presents low morbidity, especially when relying on the patient's cooperation.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p><p>It is worth noticing that our sample, although calculated by Lehr formula,<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> was based on data previously published. Thus, it is not possible to rule out any bias in the number of participants. And we also cannot state that it is a completely safe and effective method, being necessary, therefore, a larger sample group. Furthermore, patients were not previously assessed for ligamentous shoulder instability<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> - a fact that could interfere with the result of the reduction maneuver, although the groups are demographically comparable, also regarding the number of previous dislocations. Moreover, due to the nature and design of this study, it was not possible masking their participants - doctors and patients. We also believe that the results obtained from each group would tend to look alike if anesthesia or sedation would be administered prior to reduction.</p><p>Finally, more research is needed on a topic of such importance, especially works that compare the techniques described, since there could be other maneuvers with are equally satisfactory results.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that the Spaso maneuver is efficient, fast and easily reproducible, promoting the reduction of glenohumeral dislocations in a secure manner. It can also be carried out by one single person after relatively little training or experience and without analgesic drugs, muscle relaxants, anesthetics or sedatives. It also presents better results when compared to Kocher's maneuver regarding effectiveness and speed in reducing glenohumeral dislocations. There were no differences in pain levels during reduction for both techniques.</p><p>More comparative studies are needed to compare the various existing techniques in order to develop protocols aimed
