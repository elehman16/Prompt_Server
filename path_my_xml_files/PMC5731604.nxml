Instead, often, multiple factors are involved in manifestation of disease symptoms. Furthermore, as genes can take on more than one function and different pathways and processes are intertwined and can crosstalk to one another, it is therefore also quite common that one gene may be implicated in two or more diseases. As a result, it is sensible and informative to examine not only the associated genes of one disease to understand its pathology but also the overlap between the sets of associated genes of two diseases of high comorbidity risk in order to shed lights on the interplay of the two diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Yet, the knowledge that can be gained from a list of genes, or their product proteins, would be quite limited if not putting them in the biological context, such as the signaling transduction pathways, regulatory and metabolic pathways in which they are involved.</p><p id="Par5">Numerous efforts are being taken to identify relationship between two diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Comorbidity refers to the phenomenon that two (or more) diseases co-occur. Bar the pure coincidence, comorbidity would indicate that the two diseases are somehow pathologically similar. The similarity may reveal at various levels: from more phenotyptic ones, such as disease symptoms or coexpression of associated genes, to more genotypic ones, such as sharing common genes between the respective gene sets associated with the diseases. Indeed, there are reports on disease relationship which incorporates the fact of common genetic origin of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently emerged disease network theory has shifted focus to disease module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Disease module contains those set of genes whose mutations have effect on phenotype, these set of genes are not scattered by chance in the interactome but they reside close to each other due to their interactions. These interactions form one or several connected subgraphs called as &#x0201c;disease module&#x0201d;. Specifically, network based separation of a disease pair A and B (SAB) is introduced to compare shortest distances between proteins within each disease to the shortest distances between disease pair A and B. Relationships between a pair of diseases that have been revealed via other means, such as gene ontology (GO) term similarity and relative risk (RR) for comorbidity, are to correlate with the overlapping of two disease modules, supporting the hypothesis: cause of disruption leading to one disease may cause another disease sharing common characteristics. For example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] used the disease history of 30 million individuals aged 65 and older (U.S. Medicare) to determine for each disease pair the relative risk RR of disease comorbidity, finding that the relative risk drops from RR &#x02265;10 for S<sub>AB</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0 to the random expectation of RR&#x000a0;&#x02248;&#x000a0;1 for S<sub>AB</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0. While the esults show great promise, however, a significant challenge presents due to the limitation of having very few data. For example, there are only 7% of the disease pairs which overlap with each other and have negative S<sub>AB</sub> value. At the system level, only 20% of the disease interaction network has been captured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we attempt to address the issue by a novel method to predict the missing genes in the disease module using available information such as genes association to diseases, relative risk of cooccurrence of two diseases and human interactome. Our work starts out with the findings about disease module separation S<sub>AB</sub> from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and explores its utility as a powerful indicator to determine comorbid diseases: smaller SAB indicates that two selected diseases are more closely located in the interactome, and hence may show comorbid behavior. To complete the set of gene associated with disease and contribute towards completing the interactome, it is critical to identify missing common genes. The method formulates the task of searching for missing common genes as an optimization problem to minimize a network based module separation between two subgraphs formed by mapping the disease associated genes onto the interactome. Tested on a dataset of more than 600 disease pairs using cross-validation, it is shown that the method achieves an average ROC score of 0.95.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par7">In this section, we first briefly introduce the various concepts related to disease module on incomplete interactome, especially a quantity S<sub>AB</sub>, called module separation, as given in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], to measure relationship between two disease modules A and B. Then we explain in detail our method of finding missing common genes for a given pair of diseases formulated as an optimization problem to minimize S<sub>AB</sub>.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Disease module on Interactome and module separation</title><p id="Par8">Interactome contains all protein-protein interactions in the cell, and can be conveniently represented as a graph (or network), in which proteins are represented as nodes and interaction between two proteins is represented as an edge connecting the two corresponding nodes. Reconstructing the interactome is a central task in systems biology, which studies the cell as a system in a holistic way instead of simple ensemble of isolated items. Due to the limitation of the current technology, interactome for most organisms, even model organisms, is incomplete, with missing nodes and edges. Nonetheless, the incomplete interactome can already provide valuable insights into many biological processes which cannot be obtained otherwise. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], it is shown how to uncover disease-disease relationships through the incomplete interactome. Diseases with genetic causes have been studied widely, often with a focus to identify the culprit gene only, to find that in many cases the cause cannot be attributed to a single gene; instead it is very common that multiple genes involving in multiple cellular processes may be at play. Without putting these pieces in a bigger context, it is difficult to fully understand the pathological mechanisms. Work in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] presents a systematic study to uncover disease-disease relationships by mapping the associated genes onto the interactome.</p><p id="Par9">As mentioned by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], given a pair of diseases A and B, the genes known to be associated with them are put into two separate sets G<sub>A</sub> and G<sub>B</sub> respectively. Let graph G be the interactome, with node set V, and edge set E. Let map the genes in G<sub>A</sub> and G<sub>B</sub> onto G with two different colors, say, nodes in G corresponding to genes in G<sub>A</sub> are colored red and nodes in G corresponding to genes in G<sub>B</sub> are colored blue. For any shared gene, i.e., a gene is known to be associated to both disease A and disease B, then the corresponding node will be colored half red and half blue. Although all the red nodes are genes associated with disease A, indicating relatedness among them, they may not form a single connected component (or subgraph) of graph G of the interactome; often they form several connected components. This may be due to either incompleteness of the interactome (i.e., missing edges) or unknown associated genes, or a combination of both. However, if the connected components are too fragmented, say not significantly different from what can be formed by randomly mapped genes, then it is difficult to reliably infer useful relationships. So, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the size of the largest connected component, as a percentage of the total number of genes associated to a disease, must be maintained beyond a threshold, which is set based on percolation theory and the data used in the study. And the largest connected component, meeting the size requirement, is then called module as representative for the disease. For example, multiple sclerosis (MS) has 69 known associated genes and the largest connected component, which is qualified as a module with a size of 11, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has 51 associated gene and the largest connected component, which is qualified as module with a size of 9.</p><p id="Par10">To uncover disease-disease relationships, a quantity called module separate S<sub>AB</sub> is introduced as follows.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

</p><p id="Par21">Note that in the experiments reported below, 10 common genes, if available, were selected from G <sub>A</sub> &#x02229; G<sub>B</sub> and 10 uncommon genes were selected from (G<sub>A</sub> &#x022c3; G<sub>B</sub>) &#x02013; (G<sub>A</sub> &#x02229; G<sub>B</sub>) for cross validation.</p><p id="Par22">The performance is evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) score. From the list of the test examples ranked by their prediction score s(x), ROC curve plots the true positive rate as the function of false positive rate when a threshold moves from the top to the bottom of the ranked list &#x02013; test examples with prediction score larger than or equal to the threshold are predicted as positive and otherwise as negative. ROC score is the area under the curve of ROC curve and thus has a range of [0, 1], with 0.5 corresponding to a random classifier and higher score corresponding to better predictive power. The average ROC score for the whole dataset is 0.947, as reported in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. When Eq. (<xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="">4</xref>) is used in place of Eq. (<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>), the average ROC score is 0.976 and 0.979 for k&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2 and 3 respectively. This confirms that considering candidate missing common genes as a subset can indeed achieve better prediction as compared to considering candidate missing common genes individually, though the gain in performance seems to be tapering as the value of k increases. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> also lists the average ROC score for several cases: a) disease pairs with comorbidity in [0,1], b) disease pairs with comorbidity in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], c) disease pairs with comorbidity in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and d) disease pairs with comorbidity &#x0003e;3.0, with case e) being all pairs included. It can be seen clearly that high average ROC scores are achieved for all cases, with case a) achieving marginally the highest. This finding is noteworthy as it suggests that S<sub>AB</sub> is a useful indicator across all range of relative risk (RR) value whereas in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] strong correlation was observed between RR drops and S<sub>AB</sub> switching from negative to positive. Precision and recall reported in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> are computed using a threshold on prediction score s(x) which is set as suggested in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Essentially, the threshold is set by using ROC curve on the test data to determine the highest peak point of ROC curve from the diagonal line, i.e., the prediction score of the test example that corresponds the peak point is used as the threshold. Average precision and recall are reported as 0.88 and 0.91 respectively for comorbid disease pairs using shortest distance as method to measure module separation.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">It should be noted that the missing common gene problem, despite of its apparent importance, has not yet been addressed elsewhere in the literature to our best knowledge. Still, in order to get a sense how well the proposed method does in comparison to a baseline, we randomize the common genes for each disease pair. Specifically, for each disease pair, the set of common gene is replaced with the same number of genes randomly selected from the whole set of genes in the interactome. The rationale for doing so is to keep the count of common genes for each disease pair unchanged and also maintain the topology of interactome and the overall relative locations of the two diseases in the pair. When everything else was kept the same, it was found that the average ROC score dropped to 0.601 for the 605 disease pairs with their common genes randomized. The detailed results for different comorbidity ranges 250 with respect to the randomized baseline are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, and the histogram of ROC scores for the baseline is shown as plot F in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p><p id="Par27">For comparison, we also modify how the module separation is calculated. Specifically, instead of the shortest distances used in Eq. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>), we replaced &#x0003c;d<sub>AB</sub>&#x0003e; with the average distance for all distinct A -B gene pairs, &#x0003c;d<sub>AA</sub>&#x0003e; is the average distance for all gene pairs within disease module A, and &#x0003c;d<sub>BB</sub>&#x0003e; the average distance for all gene pairs within disease module B. Use this modified module separation, let&#x02019;s call it all-pair-average based module separation S <sub>&#x0003c;AB&#x0003e;</sub>, we get an average ROC score 0.49 for all 605 disease pairs. The histogram of the ROC scores is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> as plot G. One plausible explanation of why the all-pair-average based module separation performs poorly is that the module separation has become much less sensitive to swapping a single gene x&#x02019;s classification in Eq. (<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>) &#x02013; from common gene to non-common gene and vice versa.</p><p id="Par28">From comparison to the baseline of randomized data and an alternative definition of module separation, the results show that our proposed method performs very well, suggesting the optimization formulated in Eq. (<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>) as a viable solution to finding missing common genes for a given pair of diseases. Note that the predictive power is measured by ROC score, which does not require a pre-set threshold on the score s(x) when it is used for making prediction. Not requiring a pre-set threshold on the prediction score contributes to the popularity of ROC as a metric for assessing predictive power of a binary classifier: the ability to differentiating positive examples from negative examples when ranking on these examples by the prediction score. This is because in reality it is often difficult to set a priori threshold on the prediction score, although it can be set in certain ad hoc ways. In our situation, the score s(x), computed for each module separation sAB, depends on the interactome topology, the unknown number of missing genes and other factors, which makes it difficult to have a preset threshold for any give disease pair, least to say a common threshold for all disease pairs. Even if we normalize the score s(x) as s(x)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;(S<sub>AB</sub> &#x02013; S<sub>AB</sub>[+x]) / S<sub>AB</sub> it is unlikely that a threshold set for one disease pair (e.g., by using the method cited in Ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]) would be the same for another disease pair, because different disease pairs can have their genes residing on different locations of the network (and hence having different network topologies) and can have different number of missing common genes. So, for practical use of our method, we envision that, for any pair of diseases with high comorbidity yet a large module separation, biologists would suspect some common genes are missing and then use our method to suggest a short list of candidates (i.e., these with top ranking score s(x)) for further investigation.</p><p id="Par29">In this work, we used brute force to search all genes associated to the disease pair, as our focus is on the viability of using module separation to detect missing common genes not on the speed. In the dataset, we used for this study, the average number of genes in a disease pair is 168 and it takes 2&#x000a0;min 43&#x000a0;s to search all genes in the disease pair for putative common genes on a desktop computer: 2.90Ghz intel core i7, 8.00Gb memory. While it is desirable as a future work to find a faster heuristic algorithm for search as the number of genes increase, the brute force approach seems to be acceptable for typical cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">In this work, we developed a novel method to predict missing common genes for a given disease pairs. The method formulates the task as an optimization problem of minimizing network based module separation for subgraphs formed by associated genes on the interactome, with the hypothesis that correctly identified missing common genes would bring the two-module closer. The results of cross-validation from a benchmark dataset of more than 600 disease pairs show high prediction accuracy on average, measured as ROC score. The method provides a useful tool to infer better understanding of disease- disease interaction in terms of related genes. While the method is tested in cross-validation mode in this study, it can be easily deployed to predict de novo <italic>m</italic>issing genes, i.e., those genes that are not associated with any disease but have an impact on the phenotype of both diseases. It is worthwhile to note that the results reported in this study are based on incomplete Human interactome &#x02013; protein interactions that exist but have not be detected by experiments and reported in literature, and thus are referred to as missing edges in the protein-protein interaction network. Therefore, the accuracy for missing gene prediction may change, likely for higher, as the interactome becomes more complete. In fact, as an effort to address the challenge presented by missing data, in future work this method could be extended for predicting missing edges in an incomplete interactome as well.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Joerg Menche for making the comorbidity data available.
