A role for chronic use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in the increased incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Western countries has been previously suggested. The aim of this work was to study the effect of chronic administration of omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) <italic>per os</italic> in a model of reflux induced esophageal carcinogenesis. One week after esophago-gastro-jejunostomy, 115 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive 10 mg/Kg per day of omeprazole or placebo, 5 days per week. The esophago-gastric specimens were collected 28&#x000b1;2 weeks after randomization and analyzed in a blinded fashion. Mortality and esophageal metaplasia rates did not differ between the two groups (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.99 for mortality, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.36 for intestinal metaplasia and p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.66 for <italic>multi-layered epithelium</italic>). Gastric pancreatic acinar cell metaplasia (PACM) was more frequently observed in PPI-treated rats (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003). Severe ulcer lesions significantly prevailed in the placebo group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03). Locally invasive esophageal epithelial neoplasia were observed in 23/39 PPI-treated versus 14/42 placebo-animals (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03). In conclusion, chronic omeprazole treatment improved the healing of esophageal ulcerative lesions. Locally invasive neoplastic lesions and PACM prevailed among PPI-treated animals. However, neither an effect on the overall mortality nor on the incidence of pre-neoplastic lesions was observed in this work.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was funded by the grant &#x0201c;Ricerca corrente 2011&#x0201d; of the Istituto Oncologico Veneto (IOV-IRCCS) Padua, Italy, and supported by the School of General Surgery &#x02013; Padua University, Italy.

A rapid increase of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and gradual decrease of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been extensively reported in this geographic area, particularly among white, male adults <xref rid="pone.0112862-Hur1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0112862-Rugge2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>GERD is generally accepted as a major risk factor for EAC and since acid suppressors can modify the composition of the refluxate, mainly its pH, it has been proposed that the use of those drugs could be responsible for the dramatic increase in the incidence of EAC <xref rid="pone.0112862-PT1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are a class of very efficient acid suppressors. They are usually able to control GERD symptoms and prevent its complications, mainly esophageal inflammation and strictures. However, concerns that PPI-induced hypergastrinaemia may increase the risk of adenocarcinoma development have also been expressed <xref rid="pone.0112862-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that gastrin has proliferative effects on Barrett&#x02019;s epithelium <xref rid="pone.0112862-Haigh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A potential causal effect of gastrin on neoplastic progression in human Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus (BE) has been supported by a study showing that serum gastrin levels were significantly correlated with cellular proliferation in nondysplastic BE patients on PPI therapy <xref rid="pone.0112862-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>On the contrary, a preventive role of PPI in Barrett&#x02019;s adenocarcinogenesis has also been proposed, based on laboratory data of both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments.

This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Padua University (Comitato Etico di Ateneo sulla Sperimentazione Animale-CEASA). In this study, 115 male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River, Lecco, Italy) were consecutively submitted to a surgical procedure to induce gastro-esophageal reflux (GER). The animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions (room temperature 22&#x000b1;2&#x000b0;C, 55&#x000b1;5% humidity, 12 h light-dark cycle) and acclimatized for at least a week before the procedure.</p><p>Water and standard chow were given <italic>ad libitum</italic> before surgery. Water was permitted 2 hours after surgery and rat chow was provided on the following day.</p><p>Postoperatively, the animals were housed one to a conventional cage. After the operation, they were randomly divided into two study groups PPI (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;57) and Placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;58) using a computer-generated sequence. PPI group received chow containing 10 mg/Kg per day of omeprazole (Antra, ASTRAZENECA SpA) 5 days per week. The dose of 10 mg/kg per day of omeprazole was based on previous experimental literature data <xref rid="pone.0112862-Erickson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112862-Yeniehirli1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> on the same species. Moreover, in a previous pilot study by our group (unpublished data), omeprazole dose of 10 mg/Kg daily was effective in increasing intra-gastric pH from 2&#x02013;3 to 4&#x02013;5 in non-operated rats, which is comparable to the therapeutic effect in humans. In fact, we found that rats are extraordinarily resistant to proton pump inhibitors with respect to the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, as already described for mice <xref rid="pone.0112862-Waldum1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Postoperative animal care</title><p>In the first month after surgery, the animals were monitored daily, then at least weekly, to follow up their clinical conditions and ascertain their therapeutic needs.</p><p>In the first week after surgery, we adopted a drug administration protocol consisting of an infusion of analgesic (Contramal&#x000ae; 5 mg/kg t.i.d.), antibiotic (Depotyl-LA&#x000ae; 20 mg/kg every 3 days) and fluids (saline solution 5 ml t.i.d. and Stimovit&#x000ae; 1,5 ml b.i.d., subcutaneously).

The animals were given 5 mg/kg of Tramadol (Contramal&#x000ae;, Formenti, Verona, Italy) intraperitoneally immediately after the peritoneal incision. At the end of the surgical procedure, the animal was roused, maintaining 1 l/min oxygen. The animals received 5 ml saline solution subcutaneously and intramuscular injections of tylosin 20 mg/kg (Depotyl-LA&#x000ae;) to prevent dehydration and surgical infections.

During the experiment, 27 animals were humanely euthanized for welfare reasons (14 in the PPI and 13 in the placebo group) with a median endpoint of 2 weeks. These cases were excluded from the study. Seven cases were found dead in the cage (4 in the PPI group and 3 in the placebo group). By applying the humane endpoints described above (see M&#x00026;M), we achieved a low mortality rate in both groups. Thirty-nine and 42 rats reached the end of the experiments in PPI and placebo groups, respectively. The survival rates did not differ significantly between the two groups (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.99).</p><p>The incidence of pathological findings is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112862-t001">Table 1</xref>. All animals of both groups showed ulcerative and regenerative lesions of different degrees. Among rats treated with omeprazole, the incidence of severe ulcerative lesions was statistically inferior than in the placebo groups (18% vs 40%, respectively; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03), while the significance for the severity of regenerative lesions was not reached, even if the trend was toward a beneficial effect for the omeprazole treated group in preventing regenerative lesions.</p><p>As previously described with use of omeprazole <xref rid="pone.0112862-Hagiwara1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, cystic degeneration and acinar-like cells with red granules were detected at the base of the gastric mucosa. These cells were immunohistochemically positive for &#x003b1;-amylase, and the pattern of staining was similar to that of pancreas acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112862-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>No differences were obtained when pre-cancerous lesions (i.e. BE and MLE) were considered.</p><p>On the contrary, pancreatic acinar cell metaplasia and neoplastic lesions were more frequently found in the PPI group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003 and 0.03, respectively).</p><p>The neoplastic lesions mainly consisted of well differentiated mucinous tumours (18 in the PPI group and 9 in the placebo group); in one case in the PPI-group, the neoplasia only consisted of misplaced (well differentiated) glandular structures. The other neoplastic lesions featured squamous differentiation, sometime coexisting with glandular foci (Adeno-squamous differentiation). Regional nodal metastases were never detected.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study considered the effects of long-term PPI treatment in a rat model of gastro-esophageal reflux. When mortality or esophageal metaplasia rates were considered, no significant differences resulted when comparing PPI- group <italic>versus</italic> placebo-group.</p><p>On the contrary, we found a difference between the two study groups in terms of prevalence of ulcerative esophagitis, rates of pancreatic acinar cell metaplasia (PACM) and neoplasia. As expected, ulcers significantly prevailed in the placebo group, since PPI are recognised as very effective in ulcer healing. PACM is a metaplastic change of oxyntic mucosa that has been described to be associated with both reflux <xref rid="pone.0112862-PT1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and PPI treatment <xref rid="pone.0112862-Hagiwara1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, consistently with the present results.</p><p>In the present study, esophageal neoplasia prevailed among the PPI-treated animals (the prevalent histotype was mucinous adenocarcinoma). In a similar reflux rat model published by Ten Kate and collaborators in 2006, the neoplastic nature of similar histology has been questioned and the Authors described it as &#x0201c;<italic>mucinous tumors with cytologic characteristics of well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinomas&#x02026; without infiltrative growth</italic>&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0112862-Buskens1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the present study, because of the concurrence of both cytology atypia and architectural disarrangement, these lesions have been considered as locally invasive neoplastic lesions (even in absence of regional metastasis).</p><p>Surgical anti-reflux treatments and acid-suppressors in humans aim primarily to relieve symptoms of GERD. Anti-reflux surgery, typically a Nissen fundoplication, may be offered to selected patients with proven reflux disease who are refractory to medical treatment or to those reluctant to take life-long medication. Surgery provides both effective symptom relief and healing of esophagitis and offers the advantage of reducing both acid and bile reflux, which may act synergistically in the pathogenesis of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus <xref rid="pone.0112862-Jolly1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, the main available drugs (H2 antagonists and PPI) reduce acid secretion, with a consequent strong stimulus for gastrin production by G cells. Gastrin acts via its receptor (CCK2R) primarily present on enterochromaffin-like cells and parietal cells, stimulating proton pump production in parietal cells. This justifies the recurrence of acid-related symptoms after the interruption of a chronic treatment with acid suppressors and leads the patients with GERD to be maintained on treatments for long periods or life-long. Additionally, patients on NSAIDs treatment for chronic pain are usually on prophylaxis with PPI or H2 antagonist, to prevent peptic ulcer complications.</p><p>Acid suppressors have been the most prescribed drugs worldwide since the introduction of cimetidine in the 1975 by Sir James W. Black, the Nobel laureate who invented H2 antagonists, working on affinity of substances for a key receptor in acid-peptic disease (H2 receptors on parietal cells in the stomach). This fact changed the <italic>scenario</italic> of peptic disease from a surgical to a pharmacological treatment perspective.</p><p>On the other hand, PPIs act on the final common pathway of gastric acid secretion, permanently inactivating the H+/K+ ATPase (proton pump) in the parietal cell.</p><p>Since their introduction in the late 1980s, PPIs have assumed the major role for the treatment of GERD and other peptic disorders.

We observed an increase in pancreatic acinar cell metaplasia of the oxyntic mucosa in the animals treated with PPI, as already described in humans. To date, a link between this metaplasia and gastric neoplasia development has never been demonstrated. This work does not suggest an effect of the drug on overall mortality and on the incidence of esophageal metaplasia development. Moreover, this study documenting an increased prevalence of esophageal carcinomas was obtained in animals receiving long-term PPIs. This result should be viewed cautiously due to both model and study limitations. Thus, further studies are needed to clarify the effect of acid suppression on esophageal carcinogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We have no conflict of interest to declare.
