Subjects were randomized to the single VTP treatment group or an untreated control. The controls received a crossover VTP treatment at 3 months (crossover treatment group). Primary effectiveness measures were meibomian gland secretion (MGS) score and Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) that were evaluated at baseline, at 1 and 3 months post-VTP treatment, and at 1 month post-VTP treatment in the crossover treatment group. Exploratory variables included fluorescein tear break-up time (TBUT), lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE), lid parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF), ocular surface staining, frequency of over-the-counter (OTC) drop use, and hours of comfortable contact lens wear.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At 3 months, the treatment group showed significantly greater mean change from baseline in MGS (12.4&#x000b1;9.1 vs 1.4&#x000b1;6.4, p&#x0003c;0.0001), SPEED (&#x02212;8.4&#x000b1;4.7 vs &#x02212;0.7&#x000b1;4.4, p&#x0003c;0.0001) and significantly greater improvement in exploratory variables (TBUT, LWE, and frequency of OTC drop use) relative to the controls. Mean comfortable contact lens wearing time increased by 4.0&#x000b1;3.9 hours at 1 month. This was sustained for 3 months with no change in the control group. The crossover treatment group demonstrated similar results to the treatment group at 1 month post-VTP.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In SCL wearers with MGD, a single VTP treatment significantly improved mean meibomian gland function and significantly reduced dry eye signs and symptoms compared to an untreated control. The treatment increased mean comfortable lens wearing time by 4 hours (approximately doubling the pretreatment findings). This was sustained for up to 3 months post-treatment on average.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>meibomian gland dysfunction</kwd><kwd>vectored thermal pulsation</kwd><kwd>Dynamic Meibomian Imaging</kwd><kwd>evaporative dry eye</kwd><kwd>soft contact lens wear</kwd><kwd>comfortable contact lens wearing time</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Symptoms of dryness and discomfort are highly prevalent (up to 50%) among contact lens wearers and are the most commonly cited reason for the discontinuation of contact lens wear.<xref rid="b1-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Despite decades of advances in contact lens design and materials used to manufacture the lenses, the contact lens dropout rate remains consistently high at 16%&#x02013;34% per year.<xref rid="b4-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The improvements in contact lens design serve, in part, to minimize the discomfort caused by the physical changes, which occur to a contact lens within minutes and hours of placement on the eye (eg, lens dehydration, pre-lens tear film stagnation, and post-lens debris).<xref rid="b6-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, regardless of lens design optimization, there are ocular tissue changes that occur due to the disruptive presence of any contact lens on the eye.<xref rid="b3-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b6-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Examples of ocular tissue changes that have been reported as strongly correlated with contact lens wear are lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE), lid parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF), and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD).<xref rid="b9-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The mechanisms responsible for these tissue changes can be largely categorized as the result of increased evaporative stress on the tear film, friction between the lid wiper and the ocular surface, and the resulting inflammatory cascades that predictably ensue.<xref rid="b12-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Generally speaking, even with optimized contact lens design and materials, the importance of a stable and robust tear film and homeostatic ocular surface environment cannot be overstated, if successful contact lens wear is to be achieved.<xref rid="b6-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b13-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>While the volume of literature regarding the need for tear film stability in order to achieve comfortable contact lens wear is significant, the full extent of the impact of a contact lens on the ocular surface is not fully understood or characterized.

The most significant new finding in this study is that mean comfortable contact lens wear time increased, on average, by 4 hours per day at 1 month after VTP treatment, and the findings persisted over the entire study, approximately doubling the mean comfortable contact lens wearing time measured at baseline.

However, the safety and efficacy of the treatment have been well documented in both randomized controlled multicenter trials and retrospective studies and case series analyses over several years.<xref rid="b27-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b49-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="b50-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the benefit of treating MGD in a contact lens wearing population with a single VTP treatment. The results clearly indicate that identifying and treating MGD in contact lens wearers have the potential to significantly improve meibomian gland function, reduce dry eye signs and symptoms, and dramatically increase comfortable contact lens wearing time. The data strongly support a prior conclusion that contact lens wearers should be routinely evaluated and treated for MGD.<xref rid="b18-opth-12-169" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study results establish that there are multiple benefits of VTP treatment for MGD in contact lens wearers with discomfort and that these benefits far outweigh the risks of the VTP device. Of particular interest is that a single VTP treatment increased mean comfortable wearing time by 4 hours, on average, approximately doubling the number of comfortable contact lens wearing hours. This result was sustained out to 3 months post-treatment on average.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-opth-12-169"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Blinking exercises.</p><p><bold>Note:</bold> Perform 10 repetitions every hour for a minimum of 10 times per day every day.</p></caption><media mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tif" xlink:href="opth-12-169s1.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e830" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by TearScience Inc., Morrisville, NC, USA.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>CAB and CAC are employees of TearScience, Inc.
