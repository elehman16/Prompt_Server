All participants were implanted and randomized to a paired VNS (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) or control (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) group. After 6 weeks of home therapy, all participants received paired VNS. The device was used on 96% of days with good compliance. After 6 weeks, the paired VNS group improved on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0012) compared to controls (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1561). The between-group difference was 10.3% (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3393). Fifty percent of the participants in the paired VNS group showed clinically meaningful improvements compared to 28% in controls. At one year, 50% of participants had a clinically meaningful response. The therapy had greater benefits for participants with tonal and non-blast induced tinnitus at the end of 6 (24.3% vs. 2%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) and 12 weeks (34% vs. 2%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004) compared to controls with 80% and 70% responding at 6 months and 1 year, respectively. Adverse effects were mild and well-tolerated and the therapy had a similar safety profile to VNS for epilepsy. VNS paired with tones may be effective for a subgroup of tinnitus patients and provides impetus for a larger pivotal study.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Tinnitus is the perception of a chronic ringing or buzzing sound in the absence of external stimulation. The reactions to tinnitus have been categorized into four primary functions of daily living activities: emotions, hearing, sleep and concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Several counseling and sound-based therapies have been developed to help some patients manage these reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Those that incorporate cognitive behavior therapy principles have received particular attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, many patients with chronic tinnitus continue to remain refractory to treatments.</p><p id="Par3">The psychological model of tinnitus proposed by Dauman and Tyler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> distinguishes the physiologic mechanisms of tinnitus from the reactions to tinnitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Preece <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> categorized mechanisms into three broad categories: (1) deafferentation and central- induced changes, (2) increases in spontaneous activity, and (3) increases in cross-fiber correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. One of the proposed mechanisms of tinnitus is generally thought to arise from hyperactive neurons in the central auditory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Neurons deprived of auditory input respond to the same frequencies as neighboring neurons that receive input from undamaged parts of the cochlea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This results in an increase in the number of neurons in the primary auditory cortex that respond to a narrow range of frequencies. Subsequently, spontaneous activity and synchrony set in, which can create the perception of tinnitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Pairing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with tones can reverse this maladaptive neuroplasticity in an animal model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. VNS promotes neuroplasticity that is specific to the paired experience by triggering a timed burst of neurotransmitters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The tones paired with VNS were specifically chosen to asynchronously activate auditory neurons surrounding the tinnitus frequency (excluding the tinnitus frequency), thereby reducing the synchronous activity of neurons in the hyperactive tinnitus region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The first feasibility study using this conceptual framework was an open-label, 10-patient study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Stimulation settings were identical to those used in the animal experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. After 4 weeks of daily VNS-tone pairing, tinnitus symptoms improved in 40% of the participants and this improvement lasted for at least 2 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The aim of the pilot trial was to further explore the safety and efficacy of paired VNS therapy in a double-blind, randomized, controlled study in a larger sample of participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30), for a longer period of time, and at four independent sites. This pilot study was not powered a priori to detect efficacy. The main intent was to provide both safety and efficacy information to support the design and implementation of a pivotal study for US market approval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">Sixty-two individuals were screened and thirty were implanted (see Methods).

Moderate adverse events involved two participants who experienced iatrogenic vocal-cord paralyses (hoarseness or voice weakness) after implant that lasted longer than 12 weeks. In one of those participants, the affected side returned back to normal while in the other participant, hoarseness and vocal cord movement improved but the vocal cord paralyses did not recover completely. This participant was offered the possibility of gel injections and speech therapy but declined both. One of these events occurred with a surgeon new to VNS surgery. One lead fracture occurred which required replacement surgery after re-engineering of the lead.

For the first 6 weeks, the device was used on 96% of total possible days. Participants received an average of 273 (&#x000b1;38&#x02009;SD) stimulations per day (approximately 2.5 (&#x000b1;0.1&#x02009;SD) hrs/day) during the first 6 weeks.</p><p id="Par10">The highest number of missed days for a single participant was 31% (13 of 42). The protocol required the device to be used for at least four (4) out of every seven (7) days (57%; or 18 or fewer missed days) with no more than three (3) unused days in a row; all participants met the compliance criteria. There were no compliance issues with the system, even though use required that the participant actively start treatment (by starting their computer and hitting the start button) and be near their laptop for 2.5&#x02009;hours. The stimulation parameters were confirmed upon return clinic visits by establishing communication with the IPG.</p><p id="Par11">Twenty-seven (27) of thirty (30) participants (90%) kept their device and equipment through at least 6-months.

The participant that returned the device prior to 24 weeks had only a 2.7% decrease on the THI after 12 weeks. An additional participant had their device removed after 10 months. Twenty of 30 (67%) participants routinely used the device through 12 months. An additional 5 participants still had the device implanted for sporadic use (83.3% used the device at least some during the long-term study).

First, this was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Second, participants <italic>in both groups</italic> were implanted and controls crossed over (after 6 weeks) to receive the paired VNS therapy. Third, participants continued to use the device over one year and were followed up with quarterly assessments. Finally, the earlier open label feasibility study used an implanted lead with an <italic>external</italic> stimulator. Participants had to be in the clinic each day to receive stimulation for 4 weeks (20 weekdays). The current study had the stimulator and lead both implanted such that therapy could be delivered at home.</p><p id="Par22">There was a wide variability in the responses across participants. For example, two participants showed large decreases in the THI during the control portion of the study. It is possible that the improvement may have resulted from a placebo effect or that VNS may be modulating the emotional component of the tinnitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. When considering the latter, it should be noted that the use of VNS in this study is distinctly different from the use of VNS for epilepsy and patients with major depression, where VNS is given 24&#x02009;hours per day, seven days a week, and the stimulation is not paired with any specific sensory input. In contrast, in this study, substantially less VNS was administered compared to epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> studies (2.5&#x02009;minutes of stimulation/day for tinnitus vs. 144&#x02009;minutes of stimulation/day for epilepsy/depression). Therefore, it is unclear whether the unpaired VNS in the control group may have contributed to the therapeutic benefits in some participants and/or was a placebo effect. Our preclinical studies had previously demonstrated that unpaired VNS did not reverse the tinnitus percept or plasticity in a rat animal model of tinnitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, no differences in depression scores (BDI) were obtained between the groups and no overall decrease in BDI was observed in the long term. Subsequent studies will explore the timing of paired VNS to have a better understanding of the mechanism of action.</p><p id="Par23">Our results show that VNS was associated with reductions in tinnitus severity in a subgroup of tinnitus patients (tonal and non-blast induced tinnitus). In animal studies, tinnitus was evaluated in a gap-detection behavior model whereby rats underwent noise exposure and were subsequently tested for tonal tinnitus percept<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, the study model was a noise exposure model (non-blast induced) with tonal tinnitus. It is possible that the pathophysiology of blast-induced tinnitus is different from tinnitus due to prolonged noise exposure. It is also possible that a different pairing paradigm may be needed for hissing quality of tinnitus. Given the wide heterogeneity of tinnitus pathophysiology and symptoms, paired VNS therapy may be effective within certain subgroups.</p><p id="Par24">We did not observe large consistent decreases for the MML or loudness match measures. Use of psychoacoustic measures such as the MML have been problematic in earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and loudness matching is known to be subject to learning effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In this study, there was high variability in MML measurements across baselines with an average difference of 7.4&#x02009;dB (range 6.2 to 29&#x02009;dB), making interpretation of the results difficult.</p><p id="Par25">VNS is known to be a safe and well-tolerated procedure that has been performed in approximately 100,000 patients worldwide for the treatment of severe depression and epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Two participants reported hoarseness or vocal weakness lasting more than 12-weeks. As in our case, this has previously been associated with VNS surgery and is comparable to the rates seen in other early VNS studies for the treatment of epilepsy. Nevertheless, the events did not interfere with compliance. Future studies will assess vocal cord function prior to surgery and use experienced VNS surgeons with enhanced surgical training.</p><p id="Par26">All participants completed the randomized phase of the study and side effects due to stimulation were minimal (i.e. hoarseness). The pairing of VNS with tones revealed no new types of adverse effects, suggesting that the safety profile is similar to VNS for epilepsy and depression.</p><p id="Par27">Although the therapy was time consuming (2.5&#x02009;hours a day, 7 days a week), compliance during the first 6 weeks of the study was very good. After the first 12 weeks, participants could use the device for differing amounts, although typically for 1.5 to 2.5&#x02009;hours a day, for 3&#x02013;7 days a week. Only 2 out of 30 participants were explanted after 6 months. Both participants had a decrease on their THI between 30&#x02013;60% at 6 months suggesting that both participants believed the benefit had plateaued. One participant returned the computer after 6 months, due to a weak improvement on the THI. Most other participants elected to remain implanted and try new or different settings. It is possible that periodic use of the device may have accounted for minimal or late onset of improvement in some participants.</p><p id="Par28">In this study, the stimulation settings were identical to those used in the animal and the feasibility studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, it is not known whether the stimulation parameters used to activate the human vagus nerve are optimal. Recent animal research demonstrated that moderate intensity of VNS (0.4 and 0.8&#x02009;mA) drive greater plasticity compared to VNS at higher intensities (1.2 and 1.6&#x02009;mA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, it is possible that different frequencies, different pulse widths or amplitudes might reveal better results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">Individuals with tinnitus may certainly benefit from counseling and sound therapy. However, it should be noted that the individuals enrolled in this study had tinnitus for 18 years on average and had tried several other therapies, making them a refractory population. The data here showed an improvement on all three questionnaires as well as loudness severity rating after one year of treatment. For responders, the average decrease in THI was 47% (in terms of absolute decrease, these responders had an average THI decrease of 20 points from baseline) at one year. Although not all individuals participated in the long-term follow-up, these results are encouraging and suggest a long-lasting therapeutic benefit.</p><p id="Par30">A limitation of the study was the small number of participants and sites due to the pilot nature of the study. Potential clinical effects of promising new tinnitus interventions should be first tested in smaller trials, which can give important information on the effect size of the intervention and may help to identify subgroups of patients being more likely to respond to the tested intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. This information is necessary to design large prospective placebo-controlled clinical trials, which are costly and time consuming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Based on the results from this study, a 11% difference between paired VNS and control group with a common standard deviation of 20 would indicate 53 participants per group (106 total participants) and would have 80% power. This pilot study serves as primary support for the design and implementation of a larger pivotal study (120 participants) for US market approval.</p><p id="Par31">Given the heterogeneity of chronic tinnitus, it is unlikely that any single treatment will be effective for all patients with tinnitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The observation of a robust response in a subgroup of patients that corresponded most closely to our preclinical data suggests that paired VNS is associated with reductions in tinnitus severity for certain types of tinnitus. The results of this study demonstrate that VNS may be promising for a subgroup of patients with chronic tinnitus.

The participant initiated each therapy session but was unaware of the group allocation (there was a &#x0201c;start&#x0201d; button, but no information on the specific settings was shown to the participant). This allowed the blinded condition to be maintained, since participants were often unable to perceive VNS or only sporadically perceive VNS either via neck tingling or voice hoarseness.

Participants were randomized using SAS (PROC PLAN) and stratified by site. Each site had its own randomization sequence, with an initial block of two followed by blocks of four. For each participant, the site called the CRO to receive the treatment assignment, taken sequentially from the randomization list for that site.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>VNS Implantation and Stimulation Parameters</title><p id="Par38">Device implantation was typically performed under general anesthesia by an otolaryngologist. One participant, however, was implanted using local anesthesia, at their request. Details of the device implantation have been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. After surgical implantation and approximately one week of recovery, participants were randomized to either the paired VNS group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) or to the active control therapy group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14).</p><p id="Par39">Participants were admitted to the surgical center/hospital on the morning of the device implantation and were discharged within 24&#x02009;hours. The implantation involved placement of the lead&#x02019;s stimulation electrodes on the left vagus nerve in the carotid sheath. The lead connector was then tunneled subcutaneously to a pocket created in the left ancillary or pectoral region where it was attached to the implantable pulse generator.</p><p id="Par40">The device consisted of an implantable pulse generator (Model 1000 Serenity&#x000ae;), an implantable lead and electrode (Model 3000), and an external controller system (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The external controller system included a laptop computer (Dell Inspiron) with high quality circumaural headphones (Sennheiser, HD280-PRO), running the Tinnitus Application Programming Software (TAPS Model 4000) and an external controller. The external controller (Model 2000, connected to the laptop via USB) communicated wirelessly with the IPG stimulator. The software enabled the audiologist to program the stimulation parameters (amplitude (mA), frequency (Hz), pulse width (&#x000b5;s), duration (ms)), review captured participants&#x02019; programming history, and check lead impedance and battery status. The software also captured participants&#x02019; programming history.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Setup using the Serenity&#x000ae; System that pairs Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) with tones.

</p><p id="Par41">Participants started the therapy after approximately one week of recovery from surgery. Stimulation was delivered to the left vagus nerve since this is the most common practice in VNS for epilepsy and depression. However, since the upstream targets are bilateral, stimulation likely affects both sides of the cerebral hemispheres. Each VNS stimulation consisted of fifteen 0.8&#x02009;mA, constant current, charge balanced pulses (100 &#x000b5;s pulse width, at 30&#x02009;Hz). The duration of the VNS pulse train was 0.5&#x02009;seconds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Each pulse train was delivered approximately every 30&#x02009;seconds for 2.5&#x02009;hours. In no instance were settings outside those used for VNS in epilepsy or depression (output currents were &#x02264;3.5&#x02009;mA, frequencies were &#x02264;30&#x02009;Hz, pulse widths were &#x02264;1000 &#x000b5;s and duty cycles (ON time / OFF times) &#x02264;50%.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Stimulation settings for paired VNS therapy.

</p><p id="Par42">In the paired VNS group, each 0.5&#x02009;s VNS pulse was presented simultaneously with a 0.5&#x02009;s tone every 30&#x02009;s for 2.5 hrs. Therapy tones excluded one or more of the participant&#x02019;s tinnitus frequencies. The tones paired with VNS were at least &#x000bd; octave away from the most prominent tinnitus frequency for each individual participant. The frequencies ranged from 170 to 16000&#x02009;Hz. The sounds were played at an intensity based on the participant&#x02019;s comfort level and adjusted for any hearing loss at different frequencies and intensities were limited to 80&#x02009;dB SPL. Each of the tone frequencies was made to appear to arise from various 3D locations (programmed using a KEMAR head model) in order to avoid a bias of presenting a tone (paired with VNS) from a single spatial location. The frequency and intensity (dB SPL) of each tone were randomly selected each time a VNS pulse was delivered.</p><p id="Par43">In the control (unpaired) group, VNS was not paired with tones (10&#x02009;minutes of tones only, 5&#x02009;minutes of silence and no VNS; 2&#x02009;hours of VNS only; 5&#x02009;minutes of silence and no VNS, and 10&#x02009;minutes of tones only) during the 2.5-hour period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Delivery of Home-based Therapy</title><p id="Par44">Both groups received therapy for 6 weeks (randomized portion of the study). The control group then crossed over to the paired VNS group settings after 6 weeks while the VNS group continued the original paired VNS therapy.</p><p id="Par45">After the audiologist programmed the system settings, participants trained in proper use of the device to initiate daily stimulation at home. Although the stimulation was self-delivered by the participant at their home, a test therapy session was administered at the site under supervision of the investigator. VNS was administered to determine whether the participant could tolerate the standard settings and initiate therapy appropriately. If the participant was unable to tolerate the standard settings, output current was reduced from 0.8&#x02009;mA in 0.1&#x02009;mA steps until a tolerable level was reached. After a tolerable level of output current was obtained, the site operator verified that the participant could hear the tones and that the tones were coming from various locations as perceived through the headphones (site personnel would listen to the tones through the headphones and then have the participant listen and verify the tones could be heard).</p><p id="Par46">Participants were contacted at least once during the first seven days of therapy so that the site could check that the participant was delivering therapy appropriately for the full 2.5-hour session. Participant compliance with performing at-home therapy was verified at sites by reviewing the data log files (log files had date/time/stimulation information), such that each participants daily use could be verified.</p><p id="Par47">Participants were instructed to do therapy in a quiet room and to either read a magazine or book while sitting in a comfortable chair. They were also instructed not to sleep, watch TV (with audio), or have extended conversations during therapy. However, they were allowed to work on a muted computer. The intent was to allow the participant to hear the tones while still being able to perform some other tasks. Although participants were instructed to deliver therapy in their home at approximately the same time every day, they were allowed to deliver therapy at different times due to scheduling conflicts. If participants needed a bathroom break or if other social interruptions (i.e., telephone call) occurred, they were given a 15-minute break. Furthermore, if a participant missed more than an average of three therapy sessions a week, or more than 3 sessions in a row, that participant was eliminated from the primary analysis, but was included in any intent-to-treat analysis. Delivery of therapy was verified through review of the records on the participant&#x02019;s computer at each study visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Baseline Screening and Outcome Measures</title><p id="Par48">Baseline screening included audiometry (through 12&#x02009;kHz with pure tones for both air and bone conduction stimuli including monosyllabic word recognition testing) and tinnitus pitch matching. Hearing thresholds were measured at 0.5&#x02009;kHz, 1&#x02009;kHz, 2&#x02009;kHz, 3&#x02009;kHz, 4&#x02009;kHz, 6&#x02009;kHz, 8&#x02009;kHz and 12.5&#x02009;kHz (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Assessments included Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ), Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), loudness severity (participants were asked to rate the loudness of their tinnitus on a scale from 0&#x02013;100; 0 meaning no tinnitus and 100 indicating loudest tinnitus that they can imagine), as well as psychoacoustic outcome measures including Minimum Masking Level (MML) and loudness matching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

Since this was a pilot study, no primary outcome measure was designated. Participants had three baseline visits prior to starting therapy. The first visit was performed soon after consent was obtained to confirm eligibility. A second was performed at least two weeks later. Device implantation was then scheduled and participants were randomized to the paired VNS group or the control group (described below). A third baseline assessment was performed after surgery but prior to therapy initiation in order to determine whether surgery or anesthesia had any significant impact on assessments. All participants had their outcome measures administered in the clinic.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Pure Tone Audiometry for both the paired VNS and control group.

Baseline characteristics were compared between groups using a t-test or a chi-squared test. Change from baseline was calculated for each group as percent or absolute change from baseline to 6 weeks. The within-group change in outcome (THI) from baseline to week 6 was analyzed with a one-sample t-test (H<sub>0</sub>: change&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) and presented as a mean difference (with 95% confidence interval) for each group. Between group comparisons were made with two-sample t-test. For all comparisons, alpha was set at 0.05.
