Root mean square electrocardiography (RMS ECG) provides a novel alternative measure of ventricular repolarization.

Prolonged ventricular repolarization is a known risk factor for <italic>torsades de pointes</italic> arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Precise measurement of QT interval is of paramount importance for the correct diagnosis of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and for the proper safety assessment of drugs in development. However, the QT is a low signal-to-noise measurement and the end of T wave can be difficult to determine in the presence of noise or encroaching P or U waves. Measurement of QT intervals are technically difficult in many patients with chronic heart disease whose T-waves often have low amplitude. In particular, P waves frequently encroach on the T wave downslope in newborns whose cycle lengths (CL) are much shorter than those in older children or adults. Thus, there are practical and clinically relevant reasons to consider alternative measures of ventricular repolarization.</p><p>One such alternative measure of repolarization makes use of the RMS ECG signal, a magnitude function of the ECG from which robust beat-to-beat measures of repolarization can be assessed <xref rid="pone.0085689-Lux1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The RMS ECG was classically used to define the <italic>spatial magnitude</italic> of the vectorcardiogram and to delineate the peak, onset and offset of the P, QRS and T wave signals. Likewise, the spatial magnitude of the standard 12-lead ECG can be calculated as follows: <disp-formula id="pone.0085689.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0085689.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(Eq. 1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>e<sub>i</sub>(t)</italic> is the ECG signal at time <italic>t</italic> from lead <italic>i</italic>. Note that there are only eight independent signals of the twelve lead ECG. RMS ECG derived measurements have been experimentally validated using floating micro electrodes and refractory periods as estimates of mean times of ventricular depolarization and repolarization, mean ventricular action potential duration (APD), and dispersion of repolarization times <xref rid="pone.0085689-Fuller1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085689-Lux2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Specifically, the R peak to T peak (RT<sub>PK</sub>) interval of the RMS ECG provides a robust estimate of the mean ventricular APD <xref rid="pone.0085689-Fuller1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085689-Lux2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. While substantial experimental data are available from animal studies, validation of RMS electrocardiography in humans is lacking. Thus, the objective of this study was to validate the application of RMS electrocardiography to detect abnormal ventricular repolarization in human subjects with drug-induced repolarization changes or congenital LQTS and compare the precision to that of current standard-of-care Lead II QT measurements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Human Subjects and ECG Recordings</title><p>All experimental procedures performed in this study were approved by the University of Utah and Primary Children's Medical Center Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).

Briefly, 68 subjects (40 men, 28 women: 20&#x02013;59 years) underwent two 24-hour continuous 12-lead digital ECG monitoring sessions (1000 Hz sampling rate using H12+ Holter monitors, Mortara Instruments, Milwaukee, WI) during randomized and blinded administration of placebo and a single 400 mg moxifloxacin dose. Raw 10 second, 12-lead ECGs from LQTS patients and healthy controls ascertained in the University of Utah Pediatric Cardiology clinic and Primary Children's Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah were identified and extracted from a GE Muse system. Healthy controls consisted of patients who were evaluated by a pediatric cardiologist and diagnosed with an innocent murmur and a normal 12-lead ECG. Ninety-seven LQTS patients (mean age 9.5&#x000b1;6.7 years) and 97 sex-matched controls (mean age 9.4&#x000b1;6.5 years) were identified. In 62 LQTS patients a mutation was identified in one of the major LQTS genes (LQT-1: 37 subjects, LQT-2: 18 subjects, LQT-3: 7 subjects).

The QT measurement itself has a low signal-to-noise ratio, thereby complicating the precise determination of end of the T wave, especially in presence of encroaching P or U waves. The encroachment of the P wave onto the T wave downslope poses a particular problem for the measurement of the QT interval in newborn children with rapid heart rates. In this context, we tested the validity of RMS electrocardiography to detect changes in ventricular repolarization in the setting of drug-induced and congenital LQTS.</p><p>Initial animal studies detailed the cellular and organ level basis and rationale for the RMS ECG measurements, specifically the RT<sub>PK</sub> and TW intervals <xref rid="pone.0085689-Lux1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085689-Lux2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The RT<sub>PK</sub> is highly and linearly correlated with mean ventricular activation-recovery intervals as measured from unipolar epicardial electrograms <xref rid="pone.0085689-Fuller2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085689-Haws1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The activation-recovery interval correlates with transmembrane ventricular action potential duration, as measured with floating electrodes in control conditions and during local alterations in repolarization <xref rid="pone.0085689-Fuller2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085689-Haws1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, the RT<sub>PK</sub> interval provides an estimate of mean ventricular action potential duration. By contrast, the QT interval does not provide a similar correlate of action potential duration. Rather, the QT is an estimate of the interval between the earliest depolarization and the latest repolarization in the measured lead. The width of the RMS T wave corresponds to the range of ventricular repolarization times and thus is a measure of the dispersion of repolarization <xref rid="pone.0085689-Fuller1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085689-Lux2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, which is an established factor contributing to arrhythmia vulnerability.</p><p>While the animal data verifying the relationship between RMS ECG intervals and cellular electrophysiology is compelling, the application of RMS electrocardiography to human subjects is limited <xref rid="pone.0085689-Akoum1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085689-Segerson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to validate the use and test the precision of RMS electrocardiography to detect prolongation of ventricular repolarization in the setting of drug-induced and congenital LQTS in human subjects. We used data from a TQT study that provided a highly controlled and regulated environment to determine changes in RMS ECG repolarization features in response to randomized and blinded administration of placebo and moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin is the industry &#x0201c;gold-standard&#x0201d; control in that multiple studies have shown a &#x0223c;10 ms prolongation in QTc interval in healthy control subjects. Likewise, we found that both RT<sub>PK</sub> and QT<sub>RMS</sub> lengthened in response to moxifloxacin administration, based on raw and CL-corrected values. Similar to other published TQT studies <xref rid="pone.0085689-Couderc2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085689-Holzgrefe1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, the peak placebo-corrected RT<sub>PK</sub> and QT<sub>RMS</sub> intervals correlated with the peak moxifloxacin plasma levels. The Bland-Altman analysis confirmed that the standard-of-care lead II QT tangent method and the QT<sub>RMS</sub> are equivalent measures of repolarization duration. Importantly, the variance of the QT<sub>II</sub> was substantially <italic>larger</italic> than that of the QT<sub>RMS</sub> and RT<sub>PK</sub>, underscoring the better precision of the RMS based measures. A comparison of the STD of the RMS measures to those of other published QT studies (range 6&#x02013;18 ms, Table 3 in <xref rid="pone.0085689-Darpo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>) also confirms the better precision of RMS electrocardiography to detect significant changes in repolarization. Accuracy and precision are critical in determining the number of subjects necessary to detect a significant difference in repolarization in a TQT study and thus the cost of adhering to FDA requirements. Interestingly, the width of the RMS T wave increased following moxifloxacin administration and the peak, placebo-corrected changes in T width correlated with the peak moxifloxacin plasma levels. Taken together, these data suggest that moxifloxacin prolonged ventricular repolarization and increased the dispersion of repolarization in healthy subjects.</p><p>At a fundamental level, action potential duration and all ECG estimates of ventricular repolarization vary with heart rate in a complex and patient-specific manner <xref rid="pone.0085689-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, ECG estimates of repolarization adapt differently to increasing or decreasing heart rates, a process termed RR/QT hysteresis <xref rid="pone.0085689-Malik2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We were surprised to find that 10 min averages of QT<sub>RMS</sub> and RT<sub>PK</sub> intervals correlated with CL in a linear fashion. Such a linear relationship is not true for QT intervals measured from consecutive ten-second, 12-lead ECGs <xref rid="pone.0085689-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The goal of our study was not to investigate the fundamental nature of repolarization hysteresis. However, we speculate that by averaging the QT<sub>RMS</sub> and RT<sub>PK</sub> intervals over a 10-minute period, the short-term dynamics of repolarization hysteresis were smoothed out, such that the relationship between these intervals and CL was mostly linear.</p><p>In addition to detecting drug-induced changes in ventricular repolarization, RMS electrocardiography was also successful in tracking prolonged ventricular repolarization in the setting of congenital LQTS. Both the QT<sub>RMS</sub> and RT<sub>PK</sub> intervals were prolonged in LQTS children compared to controls. This study corroborates earlier animal studies regarding the ability and precision of RMS electrocardiography to detect changes in ventricular repolarization and supports the utility of RMS electrocardiography as a novel measure of repolarization in humans.</p><p>The RMS TW measurements for children with LQT-2 were significantly longer than other LQTS subtypes or healthy controls. This finding is consistent with the RMS TW lengthening observed during moxifloxacin administration. Mechanistically, moxifloxacin treatment and LQT-2 patients share a common pathophysiology in that moxifloxacin blocks the hERG potassium channel <xref rid="pone.0085689-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and LQT2 patients have mutations in the gene encoding the hERG channel <xref rid="pone.0085689-Sanguinetti1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085689-Trudeau1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The implication is that hERG channel dysfunction prolongs the dispersion of repolarization. It is not clear why dysfunction of the other primary delayed rectifier potassium current, <italic>I</italic>
<sub>Ks</sub> (LQT-1) did not also increase the dispersion of repolarization as measured by TW.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Study limitations</title><p>TQT studies are performed in highly controlled research environments in order to minimize day-day differences and facilitate direct comparisons between placebo, moxifloxacin or study drug treatments. While RMS ECG-derived measurements nicely track drug-induced changes in ventricular repolarization in the TQT environment, the applicability of RMS ECG measurements to the &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; environment was not fully addressed in the current study. However, in our limited Holter analysis of pediatric patients with LQTS, we were able to calculate patient-specific heart rate corrected values even while the children went about their normal active behaviors.</p><p>Another limitation of the study is that we did not have access to the QT measurements reported to the FDA and thus were unable to compare our QT<sub>RMS</sub> and RT<sub>PK</sub> measurements with annotated QT measurements reported in the TQT study. Finally, the data derived from the standard 12-lead ECG must be interpreted cautiously in light of the very short nature of data acquisition (10 seconds). While we were able to detect significant differences in RMS ECG parameters between LQTS and healthy control children, heart rate correction based on the subject group as a whole was inadequate due to the highly variable inter-subject relationships. In particular, we must be cautious when interpreting the results of differences in RMS TW between control subjects and the subtypes of LQTS, especially in light of the relatively small numbers within each subtype.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Summary</title><p>In summary, this study builds upon earlier animal studies establishing the cellular basis for RMS ECG intervals <xref rid="pone.0085689-Lux1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085689-Lux2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and establishes the validity of RMS electrocardiography to detect drug-induced and congenital abnormalities in ventricular repolarization in human subjects. An advantage of the RT<sub>PK</sub> interval is that measurement of the peak of the RMS T wave signal is more precise and easier to measure than a low amplitude signal, such as the end of the T wave. Moreover, the RT<sub>PK</sub> measurement has a specific cellular correlate in that it corresponds to the mean ventricular APD. RMS electrocardiography may be ideally suited to measure repolarization in newborn patients where the P wave typically encroaches on the end of the T wave. The inability to precisely detect the end of the T wave in newborn children is one of the major obstacles to universal screening of newborns for LQTS. By focusing on the peak of the T wave, RT<sub>PK</sub> intervals may provide a reliable, robust measure of ventricular repolarization and facilitate development of ECG screening tools for early detection of LQTS.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0085689-Lux1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
