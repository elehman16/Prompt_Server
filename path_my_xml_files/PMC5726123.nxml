Only very limited drug-based treatments are available for PDD, and no medications have been licensed for MCI-PD and DLB. Without adequate management of the non-motor aspects of these conditions, the risk of being admitted to care is very high. Increasing the availability and the evidence&#x000a0;base for non-drug-based therapies for dementia and mild cognitive impairment, such as psychosocial interventions, is a key objective of England's National Dementia Strategy<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and other national dementia policy drivers. Unfortunately, there is almost no evidence to support their use in people with more complex forms of dementia, such as dementias associated with Parkinson's-related disorders.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Thus, there is a need to extend psychosocial therapies to this population. Unpublished data provided by public and patient&#x000a0;involvement (PPI) representatives and Parkinson's expert consultees involved in this project support&#x000a0;this view.</p><p>For people with dementia unrelated to Parkinson's-related disorders, psychosocial therapies, such as reality orientation or reminiscence therapy, have been in use for some time.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Recently, in the UK, several large-scale multicentred trials of psychosocial interventions for dementia have been conducted, for example,&#x000a0;goal-oriented cognitive&#x000a0;rehabilitation<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; however, these have either specifically excluded people with PD/DLB or not been tailored to meet their needs. One of the most widely accepted psychosocial therapies for dementia, which has been accepted for use in the National Health Service (NHS) and is part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> guidelines for dementia care is structured group cognitive stimulation therapy (CST).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Based on these recommendations, as well as its relatively widespread use and availability, CST was chosen by the research team as a candidate therapy to adapt for individuals with Parkinson's-related dementias.</p><p>CST was originally developed from a Cochrane systematic review of psychological interventions for people with dementia<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and has been shown to be cost-effective,&#x000a0;to improve quality of life and to enhance cognition to an extent comparable with trials of cholinesterase inhibitors.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> CST is based on the principle that stimulating engagement in cognitive and social activity enhances cognitive function and quality of life. However, in spite of the success of the therapy in a group setting, it was recognised that not all people with dementia may have access to, or wish to participate in, group activities. CST was therefore adapted for home-based individualised administration (via a study companion) in the form of &#x02018;individual CST&#x02019;&#x000a0;(iCST).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p>The efficacy of iCST was recently investigated in a 26-week multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial&#x000a0;(RCT).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The&#x000a0;findings revealed a significant improvement in the quality of the relationship of the person with dementia and their study&#x000a0;companion, as well as an improvement in health-related quality of life for companions (designated &#x02018;caregivers&#x02019;). Furthermore, iCST was found to be feasible for people who found travel a barrier to participation. Outcomes related to those who support or care are particularly important, since the perceived burden of care has been shown to be significantly related to the extent of associated cognitive impairment in the person living with Parkinson's-related dementia.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This may be in part due to the added responsibility of managing the impact of concurrent cognitive, psychiatric and physical impairments in the cognitively impaired person. Nonetheless, in spite of the positive findings mentioned above, iCST did not appear to improve cognition or quality of life of the cognitively impaired participants themselves.</p><p>While CST as a psychosocial intervention for people with Parkinson's-related dementia has potential, early consultation with PPI and Parkinson's expert groups suggested the need for adaptation. Thus, the first step was to undertake a &#x02018;therapy adaptation&#x02019; process in order to meet the specific needs of people with PDD, MCI-PD or DLB. This will be&#x000a0;described in detail in a subsequent paper. The adaptation was deemed necessary due to the added complexity of the symptoms related to PD which may include frequent episodes of confusion, marked hallucinations and delusions, high rates of apathy, a myriad of motor symptoms and dependency on companions due to physical disability. It was hypothesised that cognitive stimulation therapy specifically adapted for Parkinson's-related dementias&#x000a0;(CST-PD) may improve cognitive function and quality of life in this population&#x000a0;and could potentially have a positive effect on companions and other outcomes.</p><p>The protocol outlined here describes a feasibility and exploratory study embedded within a pilot trial of CST-PD, which will be delivered by companions. This study will address some of the iterative steps in the process involved in developing a complex intervention for people with dementia, as outlined by the UK's Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on the topic.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> First, it is a test to explore whether it is possible to implement and evaluate this particular complex intervention, including aspects of treatment implementation and dosing, and second, it will be a small-scale trial of the intervention to estimate the treatment effect and its variance on a single main outcome as well as exploratory subsidiary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Overall aim</title><p>The purpose of this work is to gather the information needed to design a subsequent full-scale, definitive RCT&#x000a0;powered to evaluate the efficacy of CST-PD in improving a range of outcomes relevant to people with PDD, MCI-PD or DLB and their companions.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Objectives</title><p>To fulfil our aim, we will achieve the following objectives:</p><p>Primary objectives<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>An evaluation of the operational aspects of the study including recruitment, acceptance of the intervention and assessments, and loss to follow-up;</p></list-item><list-item><p>A process evaluation of the intervention including whether&#x000a0;the intervention can be delivered, received and enacted as intended,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> as well as acceptability and tolerability of the intervention by the dyads (people with MCI-PD, PDD or DLB, referred to as participants,&#x000a0;and their study partners, referred to as companions).</p></list-item></list>

The trial is registered with the ISRCNT (ISRCTN11455062); all study-related items from the WHO Trial Registration Data Set are available at the registry. The protocol lies within a research programme comprising a series of sequential steps in the development, feasibility testing, piloting&#x000a0;and eventual full-scale trialling of a complex psychosocial intervention for people with PDD, MCI-PD or DLB. The programme has followed the UK's MRC's updated Guidance on &#x02018;Developing and Evaluating Complex Interventions<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and is now at the feasibility, exploratory and pilot trial stage, which we describe here. Specifically, this part of the programme is a fully controlled randomised single-blind exploratory pilot trial with an embedded feasibility process evaluation and evaluation of new outcomes. The protocol for the process evaluation is not reported here but will form the basis of other papers. The pilot trial is designed and powered to test the hypothesis that CST-PD is superior to TAU for people with PDD, MCI-PD or DLB in improving cognitive function when assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-randomisation. The therapy will be delivered in participants&#x02019; homes with recruiting sites in locations in Greater Manchester&#x000a0;and other regions in the UK.

It is vital to address these issues, since in the case of an intervention such as CST-PD, there are multiple components working in synergy to produce change, and it is not clear at the outset which components may result in change and at which level this may occur (eg, individual, companion, relationship and so on).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Thus, the &#x02018;dimensions of complexity&#x02019; highlighted in the MRC's new guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> that need to be considered and accounted for in the trial design are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>.

Participants choose the activities they are most interested in from a library of over 60 cognitively stimulating topics.

User-friendly information brochures (available as on online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file</xref>) will be available at memory and movement disorder clinics and support groups, and information talks will be given at Parkinson's UK community groups. In a recent trial of iCST involving people with non-PD dementias and their companions, the recruitment target (356 dyads over 15 months) was achieved<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; however, the level of companion burden experienced in the non-PD dementia population may be less compared with that experienced by companions of people with PDD, MCI-PD and DLB, and this may influence recruitment.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, Parkinson's-related dementia is much less common compared with dementia of the Alzheimer type.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Therefore, one of the goals of this study is to obtain an accurate estimate of the recruitment rate for participants and their companions.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sample size</title><p>A predetermined sample size for the feasibility aspects of this study is not required, since inferential statistics will only be exploratory. The sample size is determined by that required to detect a clinical meaningful difference in our primary outcome measure, cognitive function. To determine sample size, we referred to the previous literature<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8 16</xref> and, taking a conservative approach, have estimated the standardised effect size on cognition of the parent form of the intervention to be 0.4. Thus, assuming 80% power and a correlation coefficient&#x000a0;of 0.5 between baseline and endpoint on cognitive outcomes, the required sample size is 27 completers per group. By enrolling 32 dyads per group, it will allow for a 15% attrition rate (consistent with pilot sample guidance<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). For the secondary, exploratory outcomes, the proposed sample size of 27 per group is within the recommended guidelines (24&#x02013;50 participants<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref>) required to estimate the standard deviation (SD) for a sample size calculation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Eligible dyads will be identified at recruiting&#x000a0;centres by trial collaborators (principal&#x000a0;investigators) and research nurses and therapists.

Informed consent from the participant and companion, based on the Good Clinical Practices guidelines published by International Council for Harmonisation,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> will be gained during the home screening visit (participant and companion information sheets and informed consent forms are available as on online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file</xref>). In line with the aforementioned iCST/CST trials, guidance from the British Psychological Society on evaluation of capacity will be followed. In the event of a participant with PDD/DLB not having capacity at study entry&#x000a0;or losing capacity after study entry, the ethics committee has approved the&#x000a0;INVEST trial implementer to gain consent from an acceptable, nominated representative. During the home screening, the unblinded trial implementer will administer the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> to confirm eligibility and collect demographic data.

A tamper proof process of single-strata, blocked randomisation will be applied and communicated via telephone and confirmatory email by an independent arbiter, the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre Clinical Trials Unit. Due to the nature of the intervention, dyads will not be blind to treatment allocation.</p><p>Immediately following the intervention period (see below for details), the blinded assessors will visit dyads in their home to conduct post-test assessments. The unblind trial implementer will remind all dyads to maintain the blind during the assessment.

This adaptation process is described in detail elsewhere and has resulted in a condition-specific cognitive stimulation therapy manual with training guidance. The manual comprises over 60 topics categorised into nine different themes&#x000a0;(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">table 3</xref>). Each topic contains several cognitively stimulating activities, for example, discussion suggestions, word association and creative tasks. Activities vary in complexity and can be matched and adapted to suit the needs of the participant.

Furthermore, since previous evidence enabled us to power the primary outcome measure, cognitive function, for an evaluation of efficacy, a pilot trial was considered possible and this required inclusion of a control group to account for the natural progression of symptoms during the trial. Specifically, in the TAU comparator arm, dyads will not receive any additional intervention to their standard NHS treatment for PD and cognitive impairment or DLB. Typically, this involves dopamine replacement therapy for the symptomatic relief of Parkinsonism, cognitive enhancing medication (eg, cholinesterase inhibitors) and support from a Parkinson's disease nurse specialist. Since people with Parkinson's-related dementia tend to have significant symptoms in multiple domains, the support of occupational therapist, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists is often required. These interventions will be available to both the TAU as well as those dyads randomised to the active treatment arm. Treatment fidelity will be actively monitored in the control group, as it is in the experimental group, to ensure that the control group do not receive an active intervention component which could reduce the effect size between the experimental and control groups or, similarly, to ensure that an iatrogenic component is not added to the control group which could artificially inflate the difference in outcomes between the two groups.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
