success and complication rates of ureteroscopy. We performed a retrospective analysis
of 736 patients (455 males and 281 females), with a mean age of 45.5&#x000b1;15.2 years
(range, 1-88 years), who underwent rigid ureteroscopic procedures for removal of
ureteral stones. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the type of imaging
modality used: group I, intravenous urography (n=116); group II, computed tomography
(n=381); group III, computed tomography and intravenous urography (n=91), and group
IV, ultrasonography and abdominal plain film (n=148). Patients&#x02019; demographics, stone
size and location, prior shock wave lithotripsy, lithotripsy technique, operation
time, success rate, and rate of intraoperative complications were compared among the
groups. There were no significant differences in success and complication rates among
the groups. The stone-free rate after primary ureteroscopy was 87.1% in group I,
88.2% in group II, 96.7% in group III, and 89.9% in group IV (P=0.093). The overall
incidence of intraoperative complications was 11.8%. According to the modified Satava
classification system, 6.1% of patients had grade 1, 5.1% had grade 2, and 0.54% had
grade 3 complications. Intraoperative complications developed in 12.1% of patients in
group I, 12.6% of patients in group II, 7.7% of patients in group III, and 12.2% of
patients in group IV (P=0.625). Our findings clearly demonstrate that ureteroscopic
treatment of ureteral stones can be safely and effectively performed with no use of
contrast study imaging, except in doubtful cases of anatomical abnormalities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Computed tomography</kwd><kwd>Imaging</kwd><kwd>Intravenous urography</kwd><kwd>Stone</kwd><kwd>Ureteroscopy</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="17"/><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) is considered the gold standard imaging
technique in the diagnosis of urolithiasis because of its high sensitivity and
specificity. Currently, patients who are admitted to hospital with acute flank pain are
evaluated with NCCT (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Patients with urinary stones are offered treatment options such
as shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), ureteroscopy (URS), or percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or
follow-up. Before interventions, contrast-enhanced re-imaging, such as intravenous
urography (IVU) or computed tomography (CT), is recommended for evaluating anatomy of
the renal collecting system (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Despite this
recommendation, most urologists do not perform any contrast-enhanced re-imaging before
intervention after diagnosis of urinary stones. The most important reason for this lack
of imaging is concern for future malignancies due to radiation exposure, and the risk
for development of allergic reactions and contrast nephropathy due to use of contrast
agents (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Although low-dose CT has been recommended for decreasing radiation
exposure, it is not used routinely in practice (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Because of all of these above-mentioned concerns, in this study, we aimed to investigate
whether a contrast-enhanced study was necessary before an URS procedure in patients
diagnosed with urinary tract calculi. We examined different imaging techniques to
determine any differences for success and results of URS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>We performed retrospective analysis of 736 patients (455 males and 281 females), with
a mean age of 45.5&#x000b1;15.2 years (range, 1-88 years), who underwent rigid URS procedures
for removal of ureteral stones. Cases requiring flexible URS were excluded from this
study. Assessment of patients included the medical history, a physical examination,
urinalysis, urine culture, complete blood count, bleeding and coagulation profile,
serum biochemistry, and imaging modalities. The patients were divided into 4 groups
according to the preoperative imaging modality used: patients who only had IVU (group
I, n=116), those who only had NCCT (group II, n=381), those who had both NCCT and IVU
(group III, n=91), and those who had ultrasonography and abdominal plain X-ray (group
IV, n=148). Selection of the imaging modality was based on the surgeon's
decision.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; demographics, size and location of stones, prior SWL, ureteral orifice
dilation, preoperative stenting, lithotripsy technique, operation time, success rate,
and intraoperative complications were documented and compared among the groups. The
success of treatment was defined as the absence of residual stones after a single
intervention. Stone-free status was assessed intraoperatively by direct URS, and
postoperatively by imaging. Intraoperative complications were recorded according to
the modified Satava classification system. Grade 1 complications included incidents
without consequences for the patient, grade 2 complications were those that were
treated intraoperatively with endoscopic surgery (grade 2a) or required endoscopic
re-treatment (grade 2b), and grade 3 complications included incidents requiring open
or laparoscopic surgery (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical technique</title><p>All URS procedures were performed under general or spinal anesthesia, in the
lithotomy position. A semi-rigid ureteroscope was used in all patients, and a
flexible-tipped guide wire was inserted through direct URS. Ureteral orifice dilation
was performed in selected patients when the ureteroscope could not be easily
advanced. The stones were fragmented with a pneumatic or holmium:YAG laser
lithotripter until they were deemed small enough to pass spontaneously. Some small
stones or residual fragments were removed with a basket catheter. Decision for
placement of a double-J stent at the end of the procedure was based on the surgeon&#x02019;s
decision, and it was removed under local or brief anesthesia approximately 2 weeks
later.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis of data was performed with SPSS for Windows, Version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., USA).
Data are reported as means&#x000b1;SD. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was used for
intergroup comparisons of continuous variables (<italic>post hoc</italic>:
Bonferroni), and the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical
variables. Statistical significance was set at P&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The study group consisted of 455 males and 281 females, with a mean age of 45.5&#x000b1;15.2
years (range, 1-88 years). The mean age was 45.4 years (18-81 years) in group I, 46.6
years (1-79 years) in group II, 45.9 years (8-77 years) in group III, and 42.8 years
(4-76 years) in group IV, with a significant difference among the groups (P=0.009). The
stones were located in the distal ureter in 67.6% of patients, the mid-ureter in 23.1%
of patients, and the proximal ureter in 9.2% of patients. There was no difference in
localization of stones among the groups (P=0.067). The mean stone size was 11.6&#x000b1;3.9 mm
when all of the patients who were included in the study were considered. The mean stone
size was 12.3 mm (5-30 mm), 11.3 mm (4-25 mm), 11.5 mm (3-23 mm), and 11.3 mm (4-30 mm)
in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively (P=0.122). SWL was performed in 24.9% of the
patients before surgery, and this rate was 22.4% in group I, 25.7% in group II, 23.1% in
group III, and 25.7% in group IV (P=0.866). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table

</p><p>Ureteral orifice dilation was performed in 19.8% of the patients. The rate of ureteral
orifice dilation was significantly different among the groups (P&#x0003c;0.001). The mean
duration of surgery was 35.8&#x000b1;13.1 min and was also significantly different among the
groups (P=0.026). There were no differences among the groups for the rate of success or
complications. After one URS session, 658 (89.4%) patients were stone-free (among
groups, P=0.093). The intraoperative rate of complications was 11.8% for all of the
patients included in the study. According to Satava classification, 6.1% of the
complications were grade 1, 5.1% were grade 2, and 0.54% were grade 3. The
intraoperative rate of complications was not significantly different among groups
(P=0.630). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref> shows procedural

treatment planning of urinary stone disease. Currently, the preference and timing of
imaging techniques are controversial in the diagnosis and follow-up of this disease.
Current European Association of Urology guidelines recommend NCCT as the gold standard
imaging technique in patients who are admitted with acute flank pain (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The advantages of NCCT over other imaging
techniques include its high sensitivity and specificity, and its ability to determine
stones, other pathologies, the distance between the stone and skin, urinary system
anatomy, and density of mass, as well as absence of any need for any preparation or
contrast agent (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>High radiation exposure is the most important disadvantage of NCCT. Furthermore, many
patients with flank pain may be admitted to the emergency department with similar
complaints repeatedly, and may need recurrent CT imaging (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This is why European Association of Urology guidelines
recommend low-dose CT in the diagnosis of urinary stones, but this is not followed
routinely in practice (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Miglioretti et al.
(<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) investigated radiation exposure due to
abdominal/pelvis CT in children. They reported that the mean radiation dose exposed per
CT was 10.6 mSv in children younger than 5 years of age, and 14.8 mSv in children aged
between 10-15 years. The authors reported that those doses were much greater than the
doses recommended for low-dose CT (radiation exposure: 0.97-1.9 mSv). They estimated
that one per 300-390 girls and one per 670-760 boys would develop solid cancers in the
future because of this exposure (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).
Epidemiological studies have reported that radiation exposure during one CT is similar
to the amount of radiation exposure in Nagasaki and Hiroshima after atomic bombs (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>An additional radiological imaging before URS increases radiation exposure, and may
increase the risk for severe allergic reactions and contrast nephropathy because of use
of contrast agents. Mechanisms, such as direct toxicity, hemodynamic changes, and
tubular obstruction, are thought to play role in the pathophysiology of acute renal
failure due to radiocontrast agents (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).
Radiocontrast agents are responsible for 5-10% of patients hospitalized for acute renal
failure, and they are the most frequent agents that cause acute renal failure following
aminoglycosides (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Currently, there is no
curative treatment for contrast nephropathy.</p><p>The prevalence of allergic reactions due to contrast agents has been reported as 2-8%,
and they cause severe, life-threatening reactions in 0.1% of cases (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The
rate of mortality due to contrast agent use during IVU procedures is 0.01-0.001% (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
Although allergic reactions and nephrotoxicity related to contrast agents are rare,
routine use of contrast-enhanced radiological imaging modalities in every patient would
increase the number of patients affected. In addition, bowel preparation before IVU and
a long duration of procedure are quite disturbing for patients.</p><p>In our study, contrast-enhanced radiological imaging was performed in 207 (28.1%)
patients, but we do not know the prevalence of nephrotoxicity or allergic reactions.
This is the most important limitation of our study. The reason for this lack of
knowledge is the retrospective and multicenter design of our study. We did not find any
differences in the rate of success or complications after surgery between patients who
had direct X-rays and contrast-enhanced imaging modalities preoperatively. Therefore,
this raises the question whether contrast-enhanced imaging modalities, which have many
potential risks, are really necessary for those patients.</p><p>Currently, there is no consensus on the preference and timing of the imaging techniques
used in the diagnosis and follow-up of urinary stone disease (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, prospective, randomized studies are needed to
measure the amount of radiation exposure, evaluate the adverse effects due to contrast
agents, and patients&#x02019; satisfaction. Experimental studies are required to analyze injury
related to these imaging modalities. However, our study is important because it is the
first clinical study to draw attention to this topic, despite all of its
limitations.</p><p>Low-dose NCCT is a reliable and safe imaging modality for diagnosis of urinary stones
and evaluation of patients before URS. In addition to radiation exposure, use of extra
imaging modalities in the preoperative period carries the risk for nephrotoxicity and
allergic reactions. Therefore, we believe that contrast-enhanced imaging modalities
should not be used routinely in the preoperative period, except for patients with
suspicion of urinary tract abnormalities (e.g., horseshoe kidney and pelvic ectopic
kidney) or obstruction (e.g., ureteropelvic or ureterovesical obstruction and ureteral
stricture) in ultrasonography or NCCT. Retrograde pyelography can be performed during
URS as an alternative to prior contrast-enhanced radiological exams that could avoid
high radiation exposure and allergic reactions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>First published online.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>T&#x000fc;rk</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Knoll</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Sarica</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Skolarikos</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Straub</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><source>Guidelines on urolithiasis</source><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uroweb.org/gls/pdf/2220Urolithiasis_LR.pdf">http://www.uroweb.org/gls/pdf/22%20Urolithiasis_LR.pdf</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="B02"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hale</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanna</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Miyake</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosser</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Imaging the urologic patient: the utility of intravenous
