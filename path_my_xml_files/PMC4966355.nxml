After ethical clearance and obtaining written and informed consent, 66 male patients, aged 18&#x02013;65 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status Grade I or II, posted for unilateral inguinal hernia-fully reducible direct or indirect hernia (Nyhus classification[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) were randomly allocated into two groups using computer-generated randomisation sequence [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-60-499-g001"/></fig><p>Group P patients received PVB from T<sub>10</sub> to L<sub>2</sub> with 5 ml of bupivacaine (0.5%) with 1:400,000 epinephrine injected at each segment, and Group S patients received SAB with 12.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine.</p><p>The same anaesthesiologist performed the procedure of giving either block. Residents not participating in the study recorded intra- and post-operative data. Exclusion criteria included patients with untreated and uncontrolled systemic illness, infections at block site, morbid obesity, history of substance abuse, chronic analgesic use, history of allergy to local anaesthetics, mental dysfunction, metabolic disease and active gastrointestinal reflux.</p><p>Eight hours fasting was ensured and patients were premedicated with oral ranitidine 150 mg on the night prior to surgery. Patients were preloaded with 10 ml/kg lactated Ringer's solution and given supplemental oxygen (4 L/min) with Venturi mask in the operation room (OR). Standard monitoring included heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>). All the patients were pre-medicated with intravenous (IV) midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 50 &#x003bc;g in the OR before block placement. In case of any discomfort during the surgery, intermittent boluses of fentanyl 25&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;g IV were administered.</p><p>In Group P, PVB was performed using the technique described by Moore and Katz.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In the sitting position, at five levels from T<sub>10</sub> to L<sub>2</sub>, 5 ml of bupivacaine (0.5%) with 1:400,000 epinephrine was injected at each segment (total 62.5 &#x003bc;g adrenaline). Then, the patient was turned supine, and the onset of unilateral pinprick discrimination assessed every 5 min and up to 30 min. The block was considered as &#x02018;successful&#x02019; if the onset of pinprick discrimination started within 15 min (endpoint) or if the sensory block (T<sub>10</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>2</sub>) was achieved within maximum period of 30 min. Otherwise, it was considered &#x02018;block failure&#x02019; and the patient was given GA and excluded from the study. Motor block was evaluated at the end of surgery using a modified Bromage scale[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] of 0&#x02013;3 (0 = full flexion of knees and feet; 1 = just able to flex knees, full flexion of feet; 2 = unable to flex knees, but some flexion of feet possible; 3 = unable to move legs or feet).</p><p>Group S patients were administered SAB in the sitting position using midline approach with a 25 gauge needle at L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> or L<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>3</sub> intervertebral space with 12.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine. Sensory block was assessed by pinprick from T4 downwards and surgery allowed to commence when the sensory block was higher than T<sub>10</sub>. Patients with inadequate block were converted to GA and excluded from the study.</p><p>Continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram, HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and SpO<sub>2</sub> was done at baseline (before premedication), immediately before the block, after the block (positioned supine) and then every 3 min for 1<sup>st</sup> 15 min and thereafter, at 10 min till the end of surgery and post-operatively at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h. Any episode of hypotension (MAP lower than 20% of baseline value) was treated with IV fluids and if needed, 6 mg bolus of IV mephentermine. Bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;60 beats/min) was closely observed and managed with IV atropine (0.6 mg) if HR was &#x0003c;50 beats/min. Various parameters noted included time required for performing the block (TRPB) (from premedication to the end of block procedure), time to surgical anaesthesia (TSA) (from end of block to readiness of surgery), duration of surgery (DS) (from the skin incision to the closure of the skin), post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) transfer time [PTT] (from the end of surgery to transfer to ward).</p><p>Recovery room residents were blinded to the type of anaesthetic technique used. In PACU, the patient was evaluated using Modified Aldrete Scoring system[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] wherein if score was &#x02265;9, patient bypassed the PACU directly to ward. In the ward, the patient was assessed by modified post-anaesthetic discharge scoring (PADS) system[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] for home readiness and discharge. Time from the end of surgery to home readiness was noted and was taken as time to reach the discharge criteria. Patients who achieved a modified PADS score &#x02265;9 were considered fit for discharge (or home readiness).</p><p>Post-operatively, all the data were collected at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery. Time to first post-operative analgesic requirement (duration of post-operative analgesia), total analgesic consumption in the first 24-h period, visual analogue score (VAS), and incidence of side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus, headache, urinary retention, etc.) were noted. VAS score &#x0003e;4 was treated with tramadol in bolus of 50 mg IV and post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was treated with 4 mg of ondansetron IV.</p><p>Considering 30% increase in duration of post-operative analgesia in <italic>P</italic> group to be clinically relevant and taking confidence interval (&#x003b1; =0.05) and the power of test (1-&#x003b2;) as 80%, we required a sample size of 50 (25 in each group).

The choice of anaesthetic technique for inguinal hernia repair depends on skill of the anaesthesiologist, the feasibility of the technique, the complexity and expected duration of the procedure, intra- and post-operative pain control, recovery time, post-operative morbidity and cost-effectiveness. According to the epidemiological data, GA is used in 60&#x02013;70%, central neuraxial blocks in 10&#x02013;20% and local infiltration anaesthesia in 5&#x02013;10% of cases.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] PVB have been used with success, both as an anaesthetic and analgesic technique, for inguinal herniorrhaphy.</p><p>In our hospital, SAB is a preferred technique of anaesthesia for IH that however is not an ideal anaesthetic technique for a fast track ambulatory surgery. SAB has some adverse effects such as prolonged motor blockade, intra-operative hypotension, post-dural puncture headaches, urinary retention, delayed mobility and discharge from the hospital. Hence, quest for an ideal technique for anaesthetising IH patients is still on. Unlike SAB, PVB preserves lower extremity motor function and provides unilateral, segmental anaesthesia of the operative site, prolonged post-operative analgesia and lowers incidence of PONV.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] For this reason, we decided to compare the effectiveness of PVB and SAB in terms of post-operative pain relief and early ambulation.</p><p>The population sample studied was homogenous with regards to the preanaesthetic characteristics such as age, weight, ASA grade, DS and baseline haemodynamic parameters. We used 1 in 4 lakh adrenaline to limit the absorption of bupivacaine that had reached its highest safe limit of local anaesthetic.</p><p>The mean HR and SpO<sub>2</sub> was statistically comparable in both groups throughout surgery [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] which is similar to the study results found by Bhattacharya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In Group P, there were no significant changes in the MAP compared to the baseline [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] due to less significant sympathetic blockade and unilateral nature of the block. The results of our study were consistent with those of other studies.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, in group S, there was a significant decrease in MAP compared to the baseline that remained throughout the surgery attributable to the sympathetic blockade. This resulted in higher fluid requirement and mephentermine boluses in Group S compared to Group <italic>P</italic> (1666.67 &#x000b1; 232.42 ml vs. 1186.67 &#x000b1; 121.01 ml and 10% vs. 0%) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. On intergroup comparison, MAP was statistically significantly decreased in Group S compared to Group <italic>P</italic> after the block and throughout the surgery. In Group P, the time to perform the block was 18.83 &#x000b1; 1.98 min that was significantly higher than Group S of 6.07 &#x000b1; 1.17 min because in PVB multiple injections were required and anatomical landmarks were difficult to identify as compared to SAB. This time was longer in studies when a single level (L1) PVB was used.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The time to onset of surgical anaesthesia was significantly higher in Group <italic>P</italic> as compared to Group S which was similar to study results of Bhattacharya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Akcaboy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in view of injections given at multiple levels.</p><p>Since post-operative pain is one of the common reasons that can delay early ambulation and discharge, addition of local anaesthetics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) can improve post-operative analgesia, thus facilitating an earlier discharge.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In our study, very few patients had significant pain in either P or S group, as shown by the low VAS scores at 2 h in the post-operative period. However, duration of analgesia was much more prolonged in Group <italic>P</italic> compared to Group S (300&#x02013;438 min vs. 138&#x02013;228 min) allowing earlier ambulation. This finding of post-operative analgesia (median, 6 h 24 min) in our study corroborate with the some studies (median, 5 h 45 min)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but are in contrast with others.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Prolonged sensory block enabling prolonged analgesia is the most significant characteristics of the PVB technique. This results from relative avascularity of the paravertebral space and hence, slow uptake of local anaesthetics.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Mean total post-operative analgesic requirement of tramadol was significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in Group <italic>P</italic> as compared to Group S (121.67 &#x000b1; 25.20 mg vs. 206.67 &#x000b1; 25.37 mg), the longer duration of analgesia lessening analgesic requirement.</p><p>In our study, all the 30 (100%) patients in Group <italic>P</italic> and nine (30%) patients in S group were able to bypass the recovery room. The time to reach the discharge criteria was significantly earlier in the Group <italic>P</italic> (166.50 &#x000b1; 27.38 min) as compared to Group S (360.20 &#x000b1; 18.77 min), so early home readiness could be caused by a reduced amount of pain experienced by this group. Bilateral SAB with high dose of bupivacaine may explain the delayed ambulation, increased need for recovery room and increased time required to reach the discharge criteria attributable to the residual motor and sympathetic blockade. In contrast ambulation is much earlier after PVB for inguinal hernia repair, probably due to minimum motor blockade of lower extremities, as shown by lower Bromage scores in Group P.</p><p>Comparing the side effects in both groups, Group S was associated with higher incidence of nausea, urinary catheterisation, headache and backache (33%, 3%, 10% and 13%) while none in group <italic>P</italic> had such complications. SAB is associated with higher PONV because of the associated sympathetic blockade causing postural hypotension. This fact further precludes early ambulation and early transfer to the ward from the recovery room in patients receiving SAB. PVB provides better peri-operative haemodynamic control resulting in lesser incidence of PONV.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Headache and backache occurred in three (10%) and four (13.3%) patients of Group S, respectively and in none of the patients of Group P. Both these symptoms were of a minor degree and manageable with rest or NSAIDS.</p><p>Some perceived disadvantages of PVB include the need for adequate training, the longer time required to perform the block, the possibility of block failure and the risk of pneumothorax.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Although the block performance time was longer than SAB is consistent with some studies,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but this did not affect the home readiness time. In our study, one patient (3%) had to be given GA due to block failure which is consistent with failure rates in any teaching institute, as shown by L&#x000f6;nnqvist <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Multiple segments PVB were not comfortable for the patient and increased the risk of pneumothorax. Deep needle penetration during PVB above T12 level can result in pneumothorax[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] because the lung pleura extends up to T12 level. Although the blocks were performed at the T10&#x02013;L2 levels, no pneumothorax was observed in our study. Bilateral anaesthetic spread reflects unintentional injection into the epidural space.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Two patients in the Group <italic>P</italic> had epidural spread and was excluded from the study that is comparable to the incidence reported in other studies. In two patients, femoral nerve block was a finding as the block was given at L5, but that did not cause the overall prolonging of the discharge.</p><p>One of the limitations of our study was small sample size but it had significantly important results, and we suggest future studies to be undertaken with a larger population size. Another limitation of our study was that it was a single-blind study but double-blinding was not possible because of the varied difference between the two techniques so used.</p><p>Another limitation of the study was that we used landmark technique and not ultrasound-guided block. With the advent of ultrasonography into clinical practice, assessment of the distance to the thoracic paravertebral space and pleura or real-time monitoring of the position of the needle and the injection during the block is gaining popularity.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] There are at least nine different ultrasound-guided approaches to PVB described in literature and it must be realised that though it has increased safety of block performance, it has longer learning curve.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Unilateral PVB is more efficacious than conventional SAB for inguinal hernia repair in terms of prolonged post-operative analgesia, better haemodynamic control, shorter time required for reaching the discharge criteria and lesser incidence of side effects. Hence, PVB could be a better and safe alternative to SAB for early home readiness.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
