Although the causal relationship between type 2 diabetes and NAFLD is not clear, fatty liver and type 2 diabetes likely share pathophysiological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Therefore, nonpharmacological interventions&#x02014;diet and physical activity&#x02014;that improve blood glucose control and other metabolic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) also might be effective in reducing liver fat.</p><p>Low-calorie weight-loss diets reduce liver fat content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In the absence of weight loss, the only published study exploring the effects on fatty liver of macronutrient composition demonstrated that a high-fat diet promoted liver fat deposition in obese individuals compared with a high-carbohydrate diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Concerning the role of different types of fat, observational data indicate that people with NAFLD have a higher intake of saturated fatty acids and a lower consumption of n-3 fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Although high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diets are a current option for diabetic patients because of their positive effects on glycemic control and LDL cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), no studies have evaluated their effects on hepatic fat content.</p><p>A cross-sectional analysis in a population of healthy people from northern Italy evaluated the impact of carbohydrate quality on liver fat content, showing a direct relationship between glycemic index of foods and degree of hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Since carbohydrates with low glycemic index ameliorate plasma lipid profile, blood glucose control, and insulin sensitivity, it might be hypothesized that, beyond the quantity, the quality of carbohydrates may play a role in liver fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Physical activity alone or in association with caloric restriction in the presence of weight loss is effective in reducing hepatic lipid content in diabetic subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Beneficial effects of physical activity on fat liver content have also been shown independently of changes in body weight by two recent interventional studies evaluating the effects of aerobic training in obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and resistance training in a heterogeneous group of people with clinical evidence of NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). No data are available in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, no study has investigated the effects of the interaction of physical activity with qualitative dietary changes independent of weight loss.</p><p>Therefore, the aims of this controlled randomized trial were to compare in patients with type 2 diabetes the effects on liver fat content of two dietary approaches generally recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes; these were 8-week isoenergetic diets relatively rich in carbohydrates and fiber and with a low glycemic index versus rich in monounsaturated fat. This study also evaluated the effects on liver fat content of the addition to these diets of a structured supervised light program of aerobic physical exercise.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 45 participants (37 men and 8 postmenopausal women) with type 2 diabetes were recruited at the diabetes outpatient clinic at the Department of Internal Medicine of the University Medical School Hospital and were enrolled in the study after giving their written informed consent. Patients were overweight or obese, without body weight changes over the previous 6 months, and in satisfactory blood glucose control with diet or metformin plus diet treatment, had normal fasting plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and were not taking any lipid-lowering drugs. Subjects had no evidence of A, B, or C virus or autoimmune hepatitis; clinical signs or symptoms of inborn errors of metabolism; history of toxins or drugs known to induce hepatitis; or history or symptoms of any known disease, apart from diabetes. Their alcohol consumption was &#x0003c;20 g/day. They were not vegetarians or engaged in intensive physical activity. Of the 45 participants enrolled, 4 (1 in each group) dropped out before the final examination as they moved to other cities or could no longer accomplish their working routine. Moreover, in spite of their initial consent, five subjects refused proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) spectroscopy examination because of claustrophobia. Data in this article are from the 36 participants who underwent hepatic fat measurement. The study protocol was approved by the Federico II University Ethics Committee.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Sample size</title><p>In order to detect a 30% difference in liver fat content between treatments with a 80% power at 5% significance level, 40 patients had to be studied. The expected changes in liver fat content after treatment correspond to the differences observed between obese patients with or without type 2 diabetes in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study design</title><p>The intervention was preceded by a run-in period of 3 weeks during which participants were stabilized on a diet with a composition similar to the one usually followed, only providing that saturated fatty acids were at least 13% (carbohydrate 48%, total fat 33%, saturated fat 13%, and protein 18% of total energy intake). With use of a factorial 2 &#x000d7; 2 randomized parallel-group design, the participants were randomly assigned to one of the following intervention groups for an 8-week period: <italic>1</italic>) high-carbohydrate/high-fiber/low&#x02013;glycemic index diet (CHO/fiber group), <italic>2</italic>) high-MUFA diet (MUFA group), <italic>3</italic>) high-carbohydrate/high-fiber/low&#x02013;glycemic index diet plus physical activity program (CHO/fiber+Ex group), and <italic>4</italic>) high-MUFA diet plus physical activity program (MUFA+Ex group). The allocation to the intervention, stratified for BMI, age, sex, and diabetes therapy (only diet or metformin), was randomly performed by a minimization method using MINIM software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.users.york.ac.uk">www.users.york.ac.uk</ext-link>). The experimental diets were isoenergetic in order to keep body weight constant and differed in macronutrient composition: carbohydrate 52 vs. 40%, fiber 28 vs. 10 g/1,000 kcal, glycemic index (bread reference) 60 vs. 95%, fat 30 vs. 42%, and MUFA 16 vs. 28% for CHO/fiber diet and MUFA diet, respectively. The other components including the saturated fat (7%), protein (18%) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (4%) were similar in the two diets. The dietary macronutrient composition was drawn by the tables of food composition from the Italian National Research Institute for Food and Nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). For improvement of dietary compliance, patients were seen weekly by an experienced dietitian, who made telephone calls every 2&#x02013;3 days to ensure that they followed the assigned diet. Moreover, some foods&#x02014;olive oil for MUFA diet and stick bran for CHO/fiber diet&#x02014;were provided to the participants. Adherence to the dietary treatments was evaluated by a 4-day food record (two weekend and two working days) completed by the participants every second week.</p><p>The structured supervised exercise program was performed at the Cardiac Rehabilitation Centre of the Department of Clinical Medicine, Cardiovascular and Immunological Sciences. Participants exercised on treadmill or cycle ergometer two times per week for 45 min at an intensity corresponding to 70% of their baseline peak <italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>; the session also included warm-up and cool-down periods. Only the participants assigned to the exercise program received information about the benefits of physical activity and a motivational counseling. At baseline and at the end of the study, all patients underwent a cardiopulmonary stress test. Every second week, a validated questionnaire (7-Day Physical Activity Recall) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) was administered to all participants to quantify their weekly moderate/vigorous physical activity apart from the structured training program.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Experimental procedures and anthropometrics</title><p>All evaluations were performed before and after the 8-week intervention periods by personnel blinded to the assignment.

Sagittal, coronal, and axial slices covering the whole liver were preliminarily taken to position the spectroscopy acquisition voxel. A single voxel of 8 cc (2 &#x000d7; 2 &#x000d7; 2 cm) was placed within the right lobe avoiding major blood vessels, intrahepatic bile ducts, and subcutaneous fat tissue. The proton spectrum was acquired using an eight-channel phased array body coil after shimming over the volume of interest using an unsuppressed water PRESS sequence with the following parameters: repetition time 1,200 ms; echo time, 40 ms; 512 data points over 2,500 KHz spectral width, 12 acquisitions. Total spectra acquisition time was 16 s and thus acquired in breath hold to avoid movement artifacts and spectra broadening. Spectra were analyzed using LCModel software (version 6.2-1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://s-provench-er.com">http://s-provench-er.com</ext-link>) that fits in vivo metabolite spectra using model resonances acquired under comparable scanning conditions from multiple compounds in standard phantom solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Concentration values in arbitrary units of water peak (signal of water) and the sum of lipid peak at 1.3, 0.9, and 1.6 ppm (signal of fat) were considered for fat liver quantification, including both methyl and methylene groups of triglyceride molecule. Signal decay was corrected for the different T2 decay of water and fat using mean T2 relaxation times of 50 and 60 ms for water and fat, respectively. Hepatic fat percentage was calculated using the following formula: 100 &#x000b7; Sf &#x02044; (Sf + Sw) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), where Sf is signal of fat and Sw is signal of water. These values represent a relative quantity of water and fat in the volume of interest. To convert these values into absolute concentrations (weight per volume) expressed as percent fat, equations validated by Longo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) were applied.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Cardiopulmonary exercise test</title><p>All patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing on a bicycle ergometer by a ramp protocol of 20 W/min in the afternoon 8 h after a light morning breakfast.

We evaluated the effects on liver fat of the two most recommended dietary approaches to diabetes, i.e., a relatively high-CHO/high-fiber/low&#x02013;glycemic index diet and a high-MUFA diet with and without the association of a structured physical activity program. Hepatic fat content significantly decreased after the 8-week intervention with MUFA diet independently of exercise. This decrease was clinically relevant (&#x02212;29%), indicating that qualitative isocaloric dietary modifications may positively influence fatty liver.</p><p>In the current study, the MUFA diet differed from the CHO/fiber diet for the high-fat content (40% of total energy) because of the high contribution of MUFA (28 vs. 16%). In the only published isocaloric dietary intervention on fatty liver in overweight nondiabetic women, a high-fat diet (56%) significantly increased the hepatic fat content compared with a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The extreme increase in fat in that study was mainly due to saturated fatty acids. Taken together, the data suggest that both the quantity and the quality of dietary fat have a role in the treatment and possibly in the pathogenesis of fatty liver. Differential effects of the type of fatty acids on direct measures of liver fat content have been reported only in animal studies. In mice without fatty liver, an olive oil&#x02013;rich diet increased hepatic triacylglycerol content compared with corn oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), while in a rat model of NAFLD, olive oil decreased the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver significantly more than fish oil and butter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>MUFAs may exert their beneficial effects on hepatic fat content through their influence on lipid metabolism in the liver or the abdominal adipose tissue. Since in the postprandial phase MUFAs are more rapidly oxidized than saturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), a high-MUFA diet may avoid fat deposition in liver by the activation of catabolic pathways. In addition, MUFAs could favor fatty acid deposition in adipose tissue rather than in liver, enhancing the clearance of circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase. We demonstrated in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) that a MUFA-rich diet stimulated the activity of lipoprotein lipase more than a saturated fat&#x02013;rich diet. There is also evidence that MUFAs are preferentially taken up by adipose tissue and muscles because of their greater affinity for the fatty acid transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). MUFAs may also improve hepatic steatosis by positively influencing adipose tissue cross-talk with liver metabolism through regulation of adipokines and inflammatory markers synthesis. In fact, in obese women hepatic fat content is associated with increased concentrations of ceramide and inflammatory mediators in subcutaneous adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Moreover, in cultured cells, saturated fatty acids are preferentially stored as diacyglycerol and ceramides in contrast with MUFAs, which are, instead, preferentially incorporated into triacylglycerols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The effects of the MUFA diet did not seem to be mediated and/or lead to changes in insulin resistance, since no significant changes in homeostasis model assessment index were observed in our patients. However, this index is not a good marker of overall insulin resistance in patients with diabetes, and in addition, we had no measures of hepatic insulin sensitivity.</p><p>In this study, the MUFA diet had a higher content of vitamin E, which has been shown to induce a reduction in hepatic steatosis in obese nondiabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), although it did not significantly modify histological features of NAFLD in obese children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). However, it is unlikely that in our study the antioxidant effects of vitamin E were responsible for the effects of the MUFA diet because of the much higher antioxidant capacity in the CHO/fiber diet that included higher ORAC levels and higher concentrations of polyphenols and vitamin C.</p><p>In our study, the high-fiber low&#x02013;glycemic index diet did not increase liver fat content, while an increase in liver fat has been repeatedly associated with high-carbohydrate diets in previous studies using carbohydrates mainly consisting of fructose, simple sugars, or high&#x02013;glycemic index foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). To date, only one study in mice has compared the effects of high&#x02013; and low&#x02013;glycemic index diets, showing that hepatic steatosis increased more with rapidly than slowly absorbed carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). This is in line with the fact that, although dietary carbohydrates may stimulate hepatic de novo lipogenesis leading to fasting hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), the eucaloric substitution of dietary starch for sugar reduces hepatic lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Therefore, carbohydrates with high and low glycemic index may differently influence hepatic fat deposition through a dissimilar influence on fatty acid synthetic pathways in the liver. The relationship between quality of ingested carbohydrates and fatty liver may also be mediated by changes in gut microbiota because of different modalities of intestinal absorption. Intestinal flora is related to obesity and metabolic diseases, and the microbial species hosted in our intestine may influence metabolite absorption and liver fat metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>The effects on fatty liver observed in the current study were independent of the exercise training program. In fact, neither physical activity alone nor its interaction with diet influenced hepatic fat content. In the only intervention trial that explored the effects of aerobic physical activity, independent of weight loss, a 20% reduction in liver fat content was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Differing from our study, that trial was conducted in nondiabetic patients with a higher baseline exercise capacity (<italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> peak &#x02248;25 vs. 15 mL/kg/min in our study). A recent study evaluating the effects of exercise training on fructose-induced liver fat accumulation in rats showed that physical activity did not reduce hepatic fat content, although it beneficially modified the partitioning of lipids, providing more unsaturated fatty acids in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Because of these inconsistencies, more data are needed to elucidate the role of physical activity on liver fat content in type 2 diabetes. It should also be considered that, because of the cultural resistance and structural barriers to physical exercise common in this middle-age population of persons with type 2 diabetes as well as the need for supervised sessions that could be practically inserted in a clinical setting (work schedule, etc.), the physical exercise implemented in this study was of light/moderate intensity with a relatively low volume of exercise. Therefore, we cannot exclude that a more prolonged/vigorous exercise would have induced beneficial effects, also in light of the resistance to the beneficial effects of physical activity reported in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), which could mainly concern the obese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>This study has some strengths and limitations. This was a randomized controlled trial with a rigorous follow-up of dietary adherence and direct supervision of physical exercise. Hepatic fat content was measured by the gold standard NMR spectroscopy. A limitation is that only patients in good metabolic control were studied, and therefore our results may not be extended to type 2 diabetic patients of other ethnic groups or with poorer control. Nevertheless, there are no indications that worse metabolic control could negatively influence the effects of MUFAs on hepatic fat content. In spite of randomization, one group (CHO/fiber) had a higher fat liver content at baseline, which was not associated with differences in any other variable known to influence liver fat content. Anyhow, this did not influence the results because analyses were corrected for baseline levels, and the significant decrease in liver fat was not observed in the group with higher baseline values.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that qualitative dietary changes without weight loss can beneficially influence hepatic fat content in type 2 diabetic patients. These results are clinically relevant and have implications for the nutritional management of fatty liver in type 2 diabetes, suggesting that a MUFA-rich diet also enriched in fiber and with low&#x02013;glycemic index should be preferred. Further studies are needed to elucidate the possible mechanisms of these dietary effects and to evaluate the effects of more intense and prolonged physical exercise on liver fat in type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
