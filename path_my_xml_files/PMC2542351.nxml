The evidence supporting the dependency of FMD on the endothelium is based on the observation that, after removal of the endothelial lining, arteries lose their ability to dilate in response to an increase in flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, FMD is partially to totally abolished after intra-arterial administration of a NO synthase blocker (i.e. L-NMMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Nitric oxide is an anti-atherosclerotic molecule, and decreased NO bioavailability is a hallmark of pro-atherogenic states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The biological significance of FMD, the relative simplicity and the non-invasive nature of the technique has motivated the dramatic growth in FMD research over the past 15 years. The widespread adoption of this ultrasound technique has been supported in part by published data suggesting that FMD correlates with invasive measurements of endothelial function in the coronary arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and may predict future cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, data are also available indicating that reduced FMD has weak or no association with other cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], is a questionable marker of the presence and severity of coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], fails to show a prognostic value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and has poor diagnostic accuracy for identifying older adults with subclinical cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These contradictory results may be due to substantial discrepancies in FMD protocols across labs, but also due to the inter-subject variability in hyperemic shear stress (the stimulus for FMD). Large variability in reactive hyperemia has been documented among individuals and populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The unadjusted FMD outcome may reflect conduit artery endothelial function as well as the magnitude of the hyperemic stimulus. Current work is moving to adjust the measured vasodilation response for the applied stimulus; in other words, dividing the peak FMD by the magnitude of stimulus achieved with reactive hyperemia. In 2005, Pyke and Tschakovsky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the initiators of this approach, suggested the utilization of shear rate (or shear stress (SS)) area under the curve (SS<sub>AUC</sub>) (individual area until peak FMD) as a method to quantify the entire and "relevant" hyperemic stimulus; and thus to be used for FMD normalization purposes. Two years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the same authors provided experimental evidence of the physiological appropriateness of using this method. They concluded that the SS<sub>AUC</sub>, but not the peak shear, was the critical determinant of the peak FMD response. Following publication of this paper, a radical change in clinical practice within the FMD community was expected; however, to our surprise, since the time of Pyke and Tschakovsky's publication (April 2007), only two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] out of 92 FMD studies (PubMed search) have incorporated normalization of FMD to SS<sub>AUC</sub>. Reasons for this slow adoption of the recently proposed method to express FMD data may include 1) insufficient lead time after publication of the article for dissemination and implementation; 2) inability to simultaneously capture arterial diameter and velocity; 3) lack of clinical evidence supporting the utility of this approach; and 4) complicated comparison with the large body of evidence collected using the traditional FMD approach.</p><p>A "proof of concept" study was conducted herein to further evaluate the efficacy of FMD normalization. In a group of healthy individuals, we elicited five different magnitudes of reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress to <italic>mimic </italic>real-life inter-population differences. Considering this analogy, we created the following experimental scenario: comparison of five hypothetical "populations" with different magnitudes of reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress stimuli. Because the five "populations" do in fact have identical endothelial function, the correct outcome should be no detectable differences. We hypothesized that peak FMD:SS<sub>AUC </sub>ratio (normalization approach), but not peak FMD (traditional approach), would be the same among the five "populations" with identical endothelial function. This observation would corroborate that normalization of FMD to SS<sub>AUC </sub>eliminates the influences of variable shear stress found among populations, and solidify the utility of FMD:SS<sub>AUC </sub>ratio as an index of endothelial function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty healthy, physically active young adults (10 men, 10 women) volunteered for this study. All subjects were free of recognized cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic diseases, non-hypertensive (resting blood pressure &#x0003c; 140/80 mm Hg), non-obese (body mass index &#x0003c; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), non-smokers, and had no family history of heart diseases. No subjects were taking medications with vaso-active effects, including contraceptives. All procedures were approved by Indiana University Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to participation in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study procedures</title><p>Procedures of the study consisted of a screening session and a vascular testing session. The screening session included completion of a medical history/health habits questionnaire, measurements of height, weight, resting blood pressure, and a fasting venous blood draw to obtain total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood glucose, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein. In addition, all subjects were familiarized with the equipment/testing room to be used during the vascular session.</p><p>On the vascular session day, subjects were instructed to report to the laboratory between 6:00 and 10:00 am having 1) fasted for 12 h, 2) abstained from caffeine, tobacco products, and vitamin supplements for 12 h, and 3) abstained from exercise for 12 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Women were studied during days 1&#x02013;7 of their menstrual cycle to minimize the influence of cyclical changes in female hormones. Subjects were instructed to lie supine in a dark, climate-controlled quiet room (22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C), with their right arm extended out laterally. A venous blood draw was performed from the antecubital vein. Samples were collected into 6-mL heparin vacutainer tubes for determination of whole blood viscosity and hematocrit. Each subject underwent an acclimation phase (20 min) to obtain a hemodynamic steady state. Heart rate was continuously monitored using a three-lead ECG. Blood pressures were taken in the left arm with a mercury sphygmomanometer to confirm a steady state. A 5 &#x000d7; 84 cm automatic cuff (E-20 rapid cuff inflator, D.E. Hokanson, Bellevue, WA) was placed around the forearm immediately distal to the olecranon process following established guidelines for assessing FMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. To quantify the magnitude of occlusion-induced ischemia (volume and peak), a dual-wavelength near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) (ISS, Champaign, IL) probe was positioned over the right extensor digitorum muscle (medial aspect, distally from the cuff). The probe was held in place with an elastic bandage. The forearm oxygen tissue saturation (%StO<sub>2</sub>) was recorded throughout the study. The ultrasound image of the brachial artery was obtained longitudinally 2&#x02013;10 cm above the antecubital fossa by 2D high resolution (Terason T3000, Teratech Corporation, Burlington, MA) ultrasound system, using a 5 to 12-MHz multifrequency linear-array transducer. Once a satisfactory image was obtained, the right arm was secured using a custom-designed arm immobilizer and the transducer was stabilized using a clamp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Minor corrections of transducer placement were made to maintain optimal imaging. Doppler velocity was also measured via ultrasound. Doppler flow signals were corrected at an insonation angle of 60&#x000b0; and measurements were performed with the sample volume placed in mid-artery. Ultrasound parameters were not changed during the study. Simultaneous Doppler measurements for blood velocity and 2D ultrasound imaging for diameter were continuously recorded for 30 sec at baseline. The automatic forearm cuff was then inflated to 250 mm Hg and maintained for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 min; in a randomized order. Diameter and velocity recordings resumed before cuff deflation and continued for 2 min thereafter. Ultrasound images were recorded at 5 frames/second using Camtasia (TechSmith, Okemos, MI) and converted into an AVI file. R-wave gated frames were not captured exclusively because internal data in our laboratory shows that continuous assessment of diameter at 5 frames/second yields the same FMD results (n = 10; FMD = 7.58 &#x000b1; 0.9 vs. 7.62 &#x000b1; 0.9%, p = 0.655; Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.998, p &#x0003c; 0.0001). The occlusion conditions were applied 10 min apart from each other and baseline measurements were re-established prior to each condition.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Experimental set-up.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-7120-6-44-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><sec><title>Brachial Artery Diameter and Blood Velocity</title><p>Off-line analyses of diameters and velocities were performed using an automated edge-detection Brachial Analyzer software (Medical Imaging Applications, LLC, Coralville, IA); briefly, the software allows the user to identify a region of interest (ROI) on the portion of the image where the vessel walls are most clear. The arterial wall borders were detected by an optimal graph search-based segmentation that uses a combination of pixel density and image gradient as an objective function. Each sequence of images was reviewed by the technician and interactively edited when needed to ensure that diameter measurements were always calculated from the intima-lumen interface at the distal and proximal vessel wall. Similarly, for determination of blood velocity, the ROI was selected around the Doppler waveform and the trace of the velocity-time integral was used to calculate mean velocity for each cardiac cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). All measurements were performed by a single technician who was blinded to the trial condition for each image sequence. Reproducibility of our measurements has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The time course of diameters and velocities were determined using a 3-sec moving average. The peak dilation postocclusion was determined as the highest 3-sec average and was presented as a percent change from baseline diameter (peak FMD; %). Brachial artery blood flow was calculated using the following formula: Vm &#x02022; <italic>&#x003c0; </italic>&#x02022; (D<sup>2</sup>/4) 60, where Vm is mean blood velocity (cm &#x02022; s<sup>-1</sup>), <italic>&#x003c0; </italic>is 3.14, and D is mean arterial diameter (cm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Analysis of brachial diameter and velocity (using the edge-detection Brachial Analyzer software) of a representative subject immediately following cuff deflation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-7120-6-44-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Whole blood viscosity</title><p>With the use of a pipette, 1 mL of blood sample was removed from the vacutainer tube, the mass of the sample was determined, and the density calculated.

The viscosity of the sample was determined by measuring the time required for the sample to pass between two fixed points on the viscometer. Kinematic viscosity (mm<sup>2 </sup>&#x02022; s<sup>-1</sup>) was obtained by multiplying a viscometer constant (0.007927 mm<sup>2 </sup>&#x02022; s<sup>-2</sup>) by the efflux time in seconds. To obtain viscosity in mPa &#x02022; s, kinematic viscosity was multiplied by the density in grams per milliliter.

To describe the magnitude of reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress elicited with increased duration of occlusion, shear stress AUC was calculated for each occlusion condition. Briefly, the AUC was calculated by summing the areas of successive postocclusion trapezoids (each with a base of 3-sec) for 60 sec (SS60sec<sub>AUC</sub>; a.u.). To quantify the "relevant" hyperemic stimulus responsible for the peak FMD response, the shear stress AUC above baseline was individually calculated for the duration of time-to-peak dilation (SS<sub>AUC</sub>; a.u.).

Tukey's HSD procedure was used when a significant F-ratio was found. All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM).

No effect of sex was found in any of the main outcome variables (SS60sec<sub>AUC</sub>, peak FMD response, FMD:SS<sub>AUC </sub>ratio), thus data were pooled across sex. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> displays mean baseline values for brachial artery diameter, blood velocity, shear stress, heart rate and forearm oxygen tissue saturation. No differences in baseline values were found (p &#x0003e; 0.05) for any of the variables. NIRS data on one subject was lost, thus sample size was 19 for all NIRS-related analysis. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> illustrates the time course of forearm oxygen tissue saturation in conjunction with brachial artery blood flow across the different forearm occlusion conditions. As indicated, the volume of ischemia and peak ischemia increased incrementally with duration of forearm occlusion (F<sub>(4,72) </sub>= 102.6; p &#x0003c; 0.0001 and F<sub>(4,72) </sub>= 69.85; p &#x0003c; 0.0001, respectively). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> illustrates the effects of forearm occlusion duration on the magnitude of reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress (panel A), peak FMD response (panel B), and FMD normalized to shear stress (panel C). As shown, varying forearm occlusion duration effectively elicited five different magnitudes of reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress (F<sub>(4,76) </sub>= 97.6; p &#x0003c; 0.0001). As a result, differences in peak FMD response were detected among conditions (F<sub>(4,76) </sub>= 40.5; p &#x0003c; 0.0001); however, these discrepancies were abolished when normalizing FMD to the shear stress (peak FMD:SS<sub>AUC </sub>ratio) (F<sub>(4,76) </sub>= 0.43; p = 0.785).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics of the subjects.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Variable</td><td align="center">Value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">N</td><td align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sex, M/W</td><td align="center">10/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Age, years</td><td align="center">25.3 &#x000b1; 0. 6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Height, cm</td><td align="center">175.0 &#x000b1; 2.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Weight, kg</td><td align="center">68.6 &#x000b1; 2.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Body mass index, Kg/m<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center">22.3 &#x000b1; 0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Resting systolic blood pressure, mmHg</td><td align="center">112.0 &#x000b1; 2.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Resting diastolic blood pressure, mmHg</td><td align="center">71.4 &#x000b1; 2.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total cholesterol, mg/dL</td><td align="center">159.3 &#x000b1; 7.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">High density lipoprotein cholesterol, mg/dL</td><td align="center">57.2 &#x000b1; 2.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Low density lipoprotein cholesterol, mg/dL</td><td align="center">89.1 &#x000b1; 6.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Triglycerides, mg/dL</td><td align="center">64.9 &#x000b1; 5.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fasting glucose, mg/dL</td><td align="center">90.3 &#x000b1; 1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">High sensitivity C-reactive protein, mg/L</td><td align="center">0.50 &#x000b1; 0.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Whole blood viscosity, mPa&#x000b7;s</td><td align="center">3.74 &#x000b1; 0.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hematocrit, %</td><td align="center">42.9 &#x000b1; 0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Reported physical activity<sup>1</sup>, days/week</td><td align="center">4.3 &#x000b1; 0.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are mean &#x000b1; SEM.</p><p><sup>1 </sup>Aerobic physical activity of moderate intensity for 30 min or more.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Baseline hemodynamic information among forearm occlusion durations.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Variable</td><td align="center">1-min</td><td align="center">2-min</td><td align="center">3-min</td><td align="center">4-min</td><td align="center">5-min</td><td align="center"><italic>p </italic>value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Arterial diameter, cm</td><td align="center">0.352 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td align="center">0.349 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td align="center">0.349 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td align="center">0.350 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td align="center">0.350 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td align="center">0.308</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Blood velocity, cm &#x02022; s<sup>-1</sup></td><td align="center">8.48 &#x000b1; 1.9</td><td align="center">8.99 &#x000b1; 2.0</td><td align="center">8.18 &#x000b1; 1.8</td><td align="center">8.81 &#x000b1; 2.0</td><td align="center">9.00 &#x000b1; 2.0</td><td align="center">0.67</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Shear stress, dynes &#x02022; cm<sup>-2</sup></td><td align="center">367.0 &#x000b1; 32</td><td align="center">392.4 &#x000b1; 42</td><td align="center">359.9 &#x000b1; 32</td><td align="center">385.1 &#x000b1; 42</td><td align="center">393.7 &#x000b1; 40</td><td align="center">0.648</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Heart rate, bpm</td><td align="center">51.5 &#x000b1; 2</td><td align="center">51.1 &#x000b1; 2</td><td align="center">52.5 &#x000b1; 2</td><td align="center">52.6 &#x000b1; 2</td><td align="center">52.4 &#x000b1; 2</td><td align="center">0.412</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Forearm oxygen tissue saturation, %</td><td align="center">56.87 &#x000b1; 2.4</td><td align="center">58.16 &#x000b1; 2.3</td><td align="center">58.46 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="center">57.98 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="center">58.41 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="center">0.974</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means &#x000b1; SEM.

Normalization of FMD to SS<sub>AUC </sub>has recently been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] to control for the presence of the large inter-subject variability in reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress and solely reflect conduit artery endothelial function. The present study was designed to further examine the efficacy of FMD normalization. In a group of healthy individuals, via manipulation of duration of cuff occlusion, we evoked five different magnitudes of reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) to create an idealized experimental scenario: comparison of five hypothetical "populations" with known identical endothelial function but different magnitude of reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress stimuli. Our findings demonstrate that, when presenting the data using the traditional approach (peak FMD), differences in FMD are detected across the varying shear stimuli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), which would suggest the erroneous conclusion that discrepancies in endothelial function exist among these populations. However, when presenting the data using the normalization approach (FMD:SS<sub>AUC </sub>ratio), these differences are abolished (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>); thus confirming that normalization of FMD to SS<sub>AUC </sub>eliminates the influences of variable shear stress on measured conduit artery endothelial function.</p><p>Pyke and Tshakovsky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] were the first to examine the effect of normalizing FMD to SS<sub>AUC</sub>. The purpose of their study was to investigate the independent contributions of the peak and continued reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress on FMD. This was elegantly conducted by maintaining the peak shear stimulus constant while manipulating the shear stimulus duration (re-inflation of the cuff) or by maintaining the shear stimulus constant while manipulating the magnitude of the peak shear stimulus (application of arterial pressure). From these experiments, the authors concluded that the SS<sub>AUC</sub>, but not the peak shear, was the critical determinant of the peak FMD response; and thus to be used for normalization purposes. Because their findings were convincing and physiologically sound, we did not consider further exploration of the relative contribution of peak vs continued shear. Instead, we opted to manipulate the duration of cuff occlusion because this is an effective method to globally modify the hyperemic stimulus (both peak and duration); thus closely mimicking real-life between-subject differences in shear.</p><p>The only two ultrasound studies manipulating the duration of cuff occlusion as strategy to create a range in hyperemic stimuli and assess the subsequent vasodilation response at the conduit artery (radial and brachial) were published in 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Both groups concluded that the duration of hyperemic stimulus played an important role on the vasodilatory response, observations that prompted Pyke and Tshakovsky's study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] 10 years later. Our data are in agreement with Leeson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Joannides et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] in that longer duration of cuff occlusion was associated with greater hyperemic and vasodilation responses; however, these groups did not test whether normalization of FMD to SS<sub>AUC </sub>removed differences among trials; this is not surprising as the concept of FMD normalization was not introduced at that time. A limitation to the studies of Leeson et al. and Joannides et al. is the utilization of blood flow, instead of shear stress, as representation of the vasodilatory stimulus. Unfortunately, blood flow (velocity &#x02022; <italic>&#x003c0; </italic>&#x02022; (diameter<sup>2</sup>/4) &#x02022; 60) and shear stress (viscosity &#x02022; 4 &#x02022; velocity/diameter) are parallel only in conditions where arterial diameters are constant, a situation that does not occur during the hyperemic phase where arterial diameters are significantly and dynamically altered. Furthermore, in contrast to Leeson et al. and Joannides et al., our study incorporated the NIRS technology to quantify the magnitude (volume and peak) of forearm occlusion-induced ischemia. Given that the forearm ischemia is the driving force for reactive hyperemia, characterization of the principal stimulus for FMD should not be neglected.</p><p>There are a few limitations to this study. First, because all trials were performed on the same day, it is possible that repeated episodes of ischemia-induced hyperemia influenced subsequent measures; however evidence suggests that serial FMD measurements do not affect subsequent FMD outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We chose to include all trials on one day in order to avoid day-to-day endothelial function variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and to allow for consistent placement of the ultrasound and NIRS probes across trials, which minimizes these recognized sources of variability in these measurements. Sufficient time was allowed between trials for diameters, velocities, and tissue oxygen saturation to reach baseline values. Most importantly, the order of trials was randomized to minimize any confounding influence from this potential carry-over effect. Second, although the dilation following the conventional 5-min forearm occlusion is largely attributed to NO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], it remains unknown if dilation following shorter periods of occlusion (1, 2, 3, and 4 min) is NO dependent as well. In addition, the effects of reduced shear and/or metabolites released during the ischemic period on the FMD response are not well understood, thus manipulation of occlusion duration may be considered a limitation to the study. Third, our measurements of whole blood viscosity were performed using a glass capillary viscometer, thus we were unable to assess viscosity at varying shear rates. Although we believed that measurements of viscosity using this method would provide more accurate shear stress information than using a constant (assumed) viscosity of 4 mPa &#x02022; s for all subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], there were no differences between both approaches (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). This observation suggests that the addition of viscosity measurements does not have a significant impact on shear stress calculations and it does not alter the interpretation of the FMD results. The validity of our viscosity measures may be demonstrated by the small coefficient of variation (4.47 &#x000b1; 0.65%) and high correlation between hematocrit and viscosity (r = 0.878, p &#x0003c; 0.001). Fourth, because our sample was composed of 20 healthy asymptomatic men and women, extrapolation of these findings across clinical populations should be made with caution.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Shear stress area under the curve calculated using measured viscosity vs. assumed viscosity.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="2">Shear stress area under the curve (a.u.)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">Measured viscosity used</td><td align="center">Assumed viscosity (4 mPa&#x000b7;s) used</td><td align="center">t-test p value</td><td align="center">ICC coefficient (p value)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1-min</td><td align="center">11.7 &#x000b1; 1.3</td><td align="center">12.7 &#x000b1; 1.5</td><td align="center">0.610</td><td align="center">0.985 (&#x0003c; 0.0001)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2-min</td><td align="center">20.0 &#x000b1; 1.4</td><td align="center">21.7 &#x000b1; 1.7</td><td align="center">0.457</td><td align="center">0.950 (&#x0003c; 0.0001)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3-min</td><td align="center">26.3 &#x000b1; 1.6</td><td align="center">28.7 &#x000b1; 2.2</td><td align="center">0.386</td><td align="center">0.941 (&#x0003c; 0.0001)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4-min</td><td align="center">35.4 &#x000b1; 2.1</td><td align="center">38.3 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="center">0.377</td><td align="center">0.930 (&#x0003c; 0.0001)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5-min</td><td align="center">41.5 &#x000b1; 2.2</td><td align="center">45.0 &#x000b1; 2.8</td><td align="center">0.340</td><td align="center">0.919 (&#x0003c; 0.0001)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means &#x000b1; SEM.</p><p>ICC = Intraclass correlation</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The significance of the present findings is notable. Our results support the view of Pyke and Tschakovsky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the original advocates of FMD normalization to SS<sub>AUC </sub>approach. The obvious lack of compliance to the recent guidelines in the clinical literature is intriguing and perhaps problematic. From a theoretical and physiological standpoint, there is robust evidence that FMD should be corrected by its dilator stimulus; however, the following question remains to be resolved: Does FMD:SS<sub>AUC </sub>ratio predict cardiovascular risk and events more accurately than peak FMD (the traditional FMD approach)? Further research is warranted to confirm that the apparent physiological appropriateness of normalization is in fact clinically pertinent. Given that arterial diameter and velocity measurements are typically performed continuously and simultaneously during the hyperemic phase, we encourage investigators to, at the minimum, report FMD data using both the traditional (peak FMD response) and normalization (peak FMD:SS<sub>AUC </sub>ratio) approaches. In supporting this new approach, while we do not intend to invalidate the large body of evidence collected using the traditional FMD approach, we advise the reader to interpret the existing literature with caution. Special attention should be devoted to studies that did not report any form of hyperemic stimulus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JP designed the study, recruited the subjects, collected the data, analyzed the data, and wrote the original manuscript draft.
