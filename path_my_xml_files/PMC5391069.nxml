Healthy adult participants (n = 29) were randomly allocated to one of three experimental groups: (1) exercise before task practice, (2) exercise after task practice, and (3) task practice only. After familiarization with the learning task, participants undertook a baseline practice set. Then, four 60&#x000b0; clockwise rotational sets were performed, comprising an adaptation set and three retention sets at 1 h, 24 h, and 7 days after the adaptation set. Depending on the experimental group, exercise was presented before or after the adaptation sets. We found that error reduction during adaptation was similar regardless of when exercise was presented. During retention, significant error reduction was found in the retention set at 1 h for both exercise groups, but this enhancement was not present during subsequent retention sets, with no differences present between exercise groups. We conclude that an acute bout of intense exercise could positively affect retention, although the order in which exercise is presented does not appear to influence its benefits during the early stages of consolidation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>INEFC-AGAUR</institution></funding-source><award-id>PRE/2623/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1562-0272</contrib-id><name><surname>Ferrer-Uris</surname><given-names>Blai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Institut Nacional d&#x02019;Educaci&#x000f3; F&#x000ed;sica de Catalunya (INEFC), Ag&#x000e8;ncia de Gesti&#x000f3; d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR) (PRE/2623/2013), both from Generalitat de Catalunya, and Grup de Recerca en Activitat F&#x000ed;sica i Salut (GRAFiS, 2014SGR/1629).

Learning, along with brain function, is known to be influenced by many factors, including engagement in physical activity and a healthy lifestyle [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Physical activity, in particular, has been shown to have a positive impact on brain function and cognition [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with supportive evidence coming from both animal and human studies [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a recent review, aerobic exercise training programs were shown to improve attention and processing speed, executive function, and memory [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, these benefits seem to depend on characteristics of the exercise, including its mode, intensity, and duration [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. More specifically, the benefits of exercise are aroused not only by training programs but also by acute bouts of exercise [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The evidence suggests that an acute bout of exercise can selectively improve various cognitive processes and enhance memory [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Despite the growing knowledge base concerning how exercise influences cognitive function, research is scarce regarding how exercise affects specific types of memory. Long-term memory formation requires a two-step process: first, the acquisition (adaptation) of sensory information that will be stored as short-term (working) memory (lasting from seconds to 1&#x02013;2 minutes) [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; and second, the consolidation of such memory so it becomes more stable and resistant to perturbation [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Long-term memory can be split into declarative and non-declarative memory, with the latter being more relevant to learning motor skills [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To our knowledge, the following articles have explored the effects of an acute exercise intervention on adaptation and retention of this concrete type of memory. Typically, motor memory consolidation is assessed via retention tests and therefore both terms are used interchangeably in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Statton et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed how a moderate-intensity running bout enhanced motor adaptation on the sequential visual isometric pinch task. However, adaptation enhancement did not lead to better retention of the motor skill. Roig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] studied how an intense acute bout of exercise (cycling) could improve motor adaptation and consolidation of a manual tracking task. Although it did not improve adaptation, exercise had a positive effect on mid-term (24 h) and long-term (7 days) skill retention. Moreover, they found that the presentation order of the exercise in relation to the learning task affected the outcome, with participants who exercised immediately after a learning task showing superior long-term skill retention compared with participants who exercised immediately before. Preceded by Roig&#x02019;s study, Mang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] observed that a single bout of intense cycling presented before a sequence-specific motor learning task (continuous tracking) enhanced adaptation and mid-term retention (24 h). Additionally, in a posterior study, the same authors observed that an equal exercise bout improved relearning of a discrete motor sequence task 24 h after adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Overall, Mang&#x02019;s results suggest that intense exercise could strengthen the adaptation and retention of the motor skill.</p><p>The previously cited studies utilized tasks that required some form of motor adaptation while also including [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or not [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] learning of an implicit sequence. Unfortunately, Roig&#x02019;s and Mang&#x02019;s studies used similar learning paradigms which limits their generalizability to other procedural learning situations. Moreover, when including the research of Statton et al. (2015), the motor tasks in these studies only required pinch, wrist, or thumb movements in a single direction (e.g. left&#x02013;right). More complex motor learning paradigms, involving multi-joint and multi-plane movements, are needed to expand our understanding of how exercise can affect the learning process of other gross motor skills. Also, it is unclear how exercise characteristics moderate the exercise effects on adaptation and retention of motor skills. Consequently, a different exercise protocol and learning task is necessary to clarify the extent of exercise-induced benefits on cognitive processes and memory. Lastly, because of the limited evidence regarding the effect of the exercise presentation order in relation to the learning task [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], further research is needed to clarify what presentation order is best to enhance motor learning.</p><p>Here, we investigated the effect of running as an acute intense exercise (iE) on the adaptation and retention of a rotational visuomotor adaptation task (rVMA). In addition, we examined the effect of the presentation order of the iE in relation to the rVMA task on retention. We hypothesized that (1) iE would improve the learning rate when presented immediately before the adaptation process of the rVMA task; and (2) iE would improve the rVMA retention process in the short- (1 h), mid- (24 h) or long- (7 days) term. Additionally, we also aimed to explore the effect of the presentation order of the iE and the rVMA task to observe if presentation order may lead to differences on long-term retention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>In total, 29 adults participated in this study, of whom 21 were males and 8 were females (7 male participants in each group); their mean age, height, and body mass was 21.2 &#x000b1; 1.9 years, 169 &#x000b1; 10 cm, and 64.0 &#x000b1; 80.8 kg, respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0175296.t001">Table 1</xref> for participants&#x02019; background characteristics).

Participants were asked to answer a self-report questionnaire related to the exclusion criteria, which included the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) to assess health status, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short version (IPAQ) to assess engagement in physical activity. Basic anthropometry measures (height and body mass) were taken. To assess fitness level (estimated VO<sub>2</sub>max), participants did a 20-m shuttle run test (20mSRT) [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. During the 20mSRT, beat-by-beat RR values were recorded using a Polar RS800CX (Polar Electro) at a 1 KHz frequency. At the end of the first session, participants undertook the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence version 2 (TONI-2) to assess their intelligence level (TONI-2 Intelligence quotient, TONI-2-IQ). Between the first and the second session, participants were allowed to rest for at least 48 h.</p><p>In the second session, all participants performed the rVMA task, but only the experimental groups performed the exercise protocol. The session started with a familiarization set (20 trials) of non-registered practice in the rVMA task without rotation (0&#x000b0;). When the familiarization set ended, the baseline set was done without rotation (0&#x000b0;; 104 trials). Next, participants did an adaptation set (312 trials) in the rVMA task, with a clockwise rotation of 60&#x000b0; applied to the cardinal coordinates of the cursor movement. Because of this rotation, movements of the hand and joystick appeared on the screen with a clockwise deviation of 60&#x000b0;. An example of the early and late trajectories of the cursor movement during the adaptation set is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175296.g003">Fig 3</xref>.

Mirroring the rVMA-EX group, the CON group did the adaptation set immediately after the baseline set, but without doing any exercise after completing the adaptation; only reading or holding a conversation was allowed.

Cartesian positions were low-pass filtered using an eighth-order dual-pass Butterworth filter (cut-off frequency: 12 Hz). Only trials where the start was initially found within 20% of the center-to-target distance were accepted. Movement onset was defined as the nearest point to an outward movement equal to 10% of the center-to-target distance. The movement offset was defined as the point where the speed decreased to 10% of the maximum speed. In addition, we rejected trials in which the traveled distance did not reach 90% of the center-to-target distance. Overall, a total of 110 trials were rejected, which represents a 0.52% of the total executed trials. There were no group differences in the number of trials used for further analyses (Kruskal-Wallis One-Way ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> = 0.478).

IDE was calculated as the difference between the ideal trajectory, defined by the vector between the center point to the target, and the real trajectory, defined by the vector between the center point to the trajectory point at 80 ms after the movement onset. The 80 ms time point was selected to avoid possible corrections guided by visual feedback. RMSE, as straightness measure of the entire movement was calculated, considering the real joystick trajectory and the ideal trajectory (characterized by a straight line), as follows:

We also investigated whether the order of task and exercise presentation produced different retention results. Regarding the adaptation set, there were no differences in the rVMA between those who did and did not exercise before the task, as evaluated by output movement error variables (RL-IDE and RL-RMSE), indicating that exercise did not contribute to improving the RL. Likewise, the overall movement error performance (IDE and RMSE) and descriptive (MT, TD and RT) parameters were not enhanced by the exercise bout. Thus, these results did not support our hypothesis that exercise would have a positive effect on motor adaptation when presented before motor tasks[<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Timing between exercise and task presentation, the task characteristics (type of task and complexity), and the exercise characteristics (type of exercise, duration, and intensity) are some of the factors that have been seen to modulate this exercise-brain function relation [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].It is possible that the exercise intensity used in the present study may havehindered the possible beneficial effects of exercise for adaptation to the motor task after exercise. Similar results have been obtained by Roig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], who showed that a bout of high-intensity exercise before practicing a manual tracking task had no impact on adaptation. They proposed that exercise could induce fatigue, thereby hampering the possible benefits of exercise during adaptation by decreasing the accuracy. Considering the similarities between the exercise used in this and in Roig&#x02019;s study [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we speculate that fatigue, in addition to excessive arousal, may have caused the observed results in the adaptation set of the rVMA task. However, Mang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found that, despite using a similar high-intensity exercise program to the one used by Roig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], participants who exercised before the motor task adaptation had enhanced performance. Despite this enhanced adaptation, exercise-induced benefits were only observed in the temporal components of the motor task. In the present study, exercise did not boost motor adaptation on any of the spatial or temporal task parameters, possibly because of the moderating effects of task characteristics over exercise-induced benefits [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, further research is necessary on the effects of high-intensity exercise on complex motor learning paradigms in task adaptation.</p><p>Regarding retention, IDE values were improved during short-term retention (RT1h) in both exercise groups. IDE is thought to reflect the planning of the movement direction, and thus the state of the internal model of the skill [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Consequently, we suggest that the performed bout of iE positively affected short-term consolidation and retrieval of the newly formed internal model of the motor skill. Rotational visuomotor adaptation tasks, are known to be dependent on cerebellar function [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is known that acute intense exercise can impact the excitability of cerebellar circuits and that these cerebellar circuits may contribute to the exercise-induced increase in LTP-like plasticity in brain regions like premotor cortex [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, more research is needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the observed exercise-related boost on memory.</p><p>Although group differences were not confirmed, movement error expressed as the RMSE produced similar results to the IDE. It must be noted that RMSE includes initial movement planning and feedback-guided corrections during the path to the target. The fact that no differences were found among groups for the MT and TD at RT1h may indicate that quick and efficient correction of the trajectory occurred through the use of feedback in the control group. Despite participants in the exercise groups performing better at initial movement planning, feedback-guided corrections in the control group allowed them to correct the initial trajectory deviations to achieve comparable RMSE values to those of the exercise groups.</p><p>In contrast to the strengthening of the short-term retention (RT1h), exercise failed to maintain the observed benefits in the retention sets at 24 h (RT24h) and 7 days (RT7d) after adaptation. The IDE and RMSE values were similar for the three groups, indicating that exercise did not affect motor planning or feedback utilization at 24 h or 7 days after adaptation to the skill. Based on previous research [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we hypothesized that exercise would positively impact the RT24h and RT7d results. Roig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that a single bout of high-intensity exercise enhanced motor memory retention at 24 h and 7 days after adaptation. In a study by Mang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a similar exercise intervention enhanced mid-term retention of motor memory (24 h). It seems that, compared to previous research, we demonstrated the more acute and transient effect of exercise. Three factors could explain why exercise may not induce persistent effects on memory formation: differences in the exercise bout characteristics (i.e., intensity and/or exercise mode), the fitness level of the participants, and the characteristics of the learning task [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We will now examine each of these factors separately.</p><p>High-intensity exercise may have the potential to facilitate memory consolidation [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, as seen in previous research, exercise bouts of insufficient intensity (low to moderate intensity) may not be sufficient to improve motor consolidation [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. When compared with studies that succeeded in finding 24 h and 7 day improvements in long-term memory, the exercise intensity in the present study (estimated 85% VO<sub>2</sub>max) may have been too low; for example, Mang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] used 90% of power output, which was similar to that utilized by Roig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition to intensity, there is evidence that the mode of exercise may influence its benefits. Recent reviews propose that cycling produces a greater effect on cognitive performance [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and long-term memory [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] than running. Accordingly, the running intervention used in the present study could have produced inferior results when compared to those from similar studies that used cycling [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This hypothesis is somewhat supported by the results of Statton et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], who successfully enhanced motor adaptation through moderate-intensity aerobic running, but failed to induce more long-term benefits in motor retention. Hence the exercise bout used in this study may have been too intense to improve adaptation, but insufficiently intense to enhance the retention at 24 h and 7 days, with retention benefits limited to 1 h after adaptation.</p><p>The fitness level of the participants could also have affected the extent of the exercise-induced improvements. Exercise has been reported to exert greater effects on long-term memory when participants have only average fitness levels [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our sample seemed to have higher fitness levels which could explain differences between our results and those from previous studies. When comparing the fitness level of our exercise group (mean estimated VO<sub>2</sub>max: 56.06, range: 43.3&#x02013;63.6 ml/kg/min) to that of Mang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (mean VO<sub>2</sub>peak: 45.36, range: 30.4&#x02013;63.4 ml/kg/min), it is plausible to consider that fitness level promoted mid-term retention in the study by Mang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but promoted short-term retention in our study. However, when compared with the results presented by Roig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (mean VO<sub>2</sub>peak: 53.35, range: 44.1&#x02013;64.1 ml/kg/min), who achieved enhanced mid- and long-term retention, the fitness level was similar to that in the present study. Therefore, it remains unclear how fitness level could moderate the exercise-induced improvements on motor learning. The fitness level homogeneity of our sample limited the possibility to further explore the potential modulating effect of fitness level on the exercise-learning relationship. More research is necessary to increase our knowledge in terms of the effects of exercise on the mechanisms associated with learning improvement and the role of moderators (e.g., fitness level) in this relationship.</p><p>In addition to exercise characteristics and fitness level, task characteristics could also have affected the study results. It is known that the effect of exercise on cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and long-term memory formation [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] can be modulated by the paradigm of the cognitive or learning task used. In the present study, improvements in short term retention, 1 h from motor adaptation, were specifically observed for a rVMA task utilizing a 60&#x000b0; clockwise rotation. Previous research using motor procedural tasks have been successful in finding exercise-induced benefits on mid- and long-term memory at 24 h and 7 days after exposure [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study describing the effect of an exercise intervention on the learning of a complex procedural motor skill that involved a multi-joint and multi-plane movement paradigm. The complexity of the rVMA task could have decreased the effect of exercise, limiting the anticipated mid- and long-term benefits. Moreover, the previous studies by Mang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Roig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] relied on tasks mainly focused on accuracy. By contrast, participants in our rVMA task were instructed to &#x0201c;move the cursor over the target as fast and as straight as possible&#x0201d;, which required not only accuracy but also speed of processing and execution. Research has differentiated the effects of exercise in speed and accuracy components of cognitive and simple motor tasks, with speed benefiting most from exercise [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Depending on the weight of the speed and accuracy components, and based on the results of previous research [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we propose that the speed&#x02013;accuracy relationship could alter the effect of exercise on memory consolidation. Therefore, the speed requirements in the execution of the rVMA task may have affected participant&#x02019;s long-term memory formation. In addition, despite involving some form of motor adaptation, the use of alternative learning paradigms (e.g. implicit sequence learning) in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] could explain different results compared to the present research possibly because of the implication of different neural pathways [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], among other factors.</p><p>Finally, contrary to what previous research has defined [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we observed no differences in memory consolidation based on whether exercise was presented before or after the adaptation set. We presume that the initial consolidation stages may equally benefit from exercise regardless of whether it is presented before or after adaptation. However, the null effect of exercise on mid- and long-term retention hinders further speculation on how the order in which exercise is presented may modulate longer delayed effects. More research is needed to confirm whether the presentation order of the exercise relative to practice can trigger different mechanisms, as proposed by Roig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Despite finding an enhanced rVMA retention at 1 h as a consequence of the exercise intervention, our results may be affected by some limitations. It could be though that exercise effects on motor consolidation could be influenced by relearning because of the high amount of trials performed during the retention sets. However, IDE presented a similar trend of findings during the first trials of the RT1h set, compared to the overall set performance (see graph B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175296.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Furthermore it seems that in comparison to other studies [<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the reduced exercise intensity and the mode of exercise (i.e., running) might have compromised the exercise-induced benefits on mid- and long-term retentions. Likewise, it is possible that the high fitness level of participants in the present study could have altered the mid- and long-term effects. Therefore, to confirm the mid- and long-term benefits seen in previous studies, there would be a need to use a higher exercise intensity (90% of VO<sub>2</sub>max) and to include a population with regular fitness levels. Furthermore, the lack of neurochemical assessments limits our ability to comment on the mechanisms that may trigger the consolidation enhancement induced by exercise. In future research, the collection of blood samples to examine changes in neurotransmitters and trophic factors concentrations may help clarify the mechanisms underlying the exercise-induced enhancement of memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, a single bout of iE enhanced consolidation of an rVMA task, as expressed by improved retention at 1 h after task adaptation. Moreover, the order in which the exercise and the learned task were presented yielded similar benefits in retention at 1 h. However, we cannot reject the possibility of a long-term effect of exercise and task presentation order, because the exercise characteristics and fitness levels of the participants may have limited the benefits on mid and long-term retentions. Contrary to our expectation, exercising before a task practice did not improve the learning rate of the motor skill, probably because the exercise intensity was too high and there was a possibility of fatigue. Our results add evidence to the practical uses of exercise in learning and memory, but indicate that further research is needed to improve our understanding of how different exercise protocols affect procedural learning tasks. Moreover, to explore the effect of acute exercise on learning in different populations, future studies should aim to include participants with different fitness levels and ages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175296.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Exercise effects on motor adaptation and motor retention 1h.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> IDE Performance is presented at the start and at the end of the adaptation (average of first and last 32 trials, respectively).
