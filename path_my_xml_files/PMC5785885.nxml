Health information technologies have the potential to actualize advances in perioperative patient care, but failure to evaluate the usability of these technologies may hinder their implementation and acceptance. This protocol describes the usability testing of an innovative telemedicine-based intra-operative clinical support system, the Anesthesiology Control Tower, in which a team led by an attending anesthesiologist will use a combination of established and novel information technologies to provide evidence-based support to their colleagues in the operating room.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Two phases of mixed-methods usability testing will be conducted in an iterative manner and will evaluate both the individual components of the Anesthesiology Control Tower and their integration as a whole.

Some of this risk is unavoidable and either is inherent to the nature of the surgical procedure itself or is attributable to a characteristic of the patient that is not in an immediate way modifiable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There are, however, factors that do fall under the control of the anesthetic team that have been shown to affect the patient&#x02019;s immediate and long-term health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Information technology-driven decision support has been shown to optimize management of these factors, leading to improvement in physiological measures, such as blood pressure stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and glucose control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This decision support can aid members of the anesthesia care team, who often experience information overload in the operating room that can limit their implementation of evidence-based practice. Health IT tools that work to advance and implement decision support systems are being championed in the demand for enhanced quality in health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A critical component of the implementation process is the inclusion of usability analysis of the health IT throughout its lifecycle, beginning in the development phase and continuing into the post-implementation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Usability is an essential feature of the successful implementation of novel information technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and has significant impact on productivity and performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in addition to the acceptance and safety of health IT systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">At our institution, we are developing a novel telemedicine-based intervention for the operating room, the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), which is similar in concept to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The clinicians in the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACTors) will monitor active operating rooms (ORs) in real time by using several electronic health records at our institution. Just as an air traffic control tower monitors each aircraft and delivers additional information and alerts to the pilot and co-pilot, the ACT will engage with teams of anesthesia clinicians in a similar fashion to assist them in providing safe, effective, and efficient care for their patients. The ACT intervention will be evaluated in the form of a pragmatic, comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial (NCT02830126). However, prior to the implementation of the ACT, it will be crucial to ensure that it is a useful and usable resource for the clinicians for whom it is developed, as usability is a critical feature of the successful implementation of novel information technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], with a significant impact on productivity and performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in addition to the acceptance and safety of health IT systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The primary objective of the protocol described in this paper is to evaluate the usability of the ACT by gathering perceptions of key stakeholders and end users of the ACT and secondarily to assess the feasibility of its implementation in routine care, prior to conducting a pragmatic trial evaluating the ACT. Usability testing will be performed in an iterative manner throughout the design and implementation stages and will focus on outcomes related to effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptability. This protocol describes two phases of mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) usability and feasibility testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] of the ACT structure, including the software platforms that it employs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par17">The full description of ACT is available in <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>. This includes a description of one of the software programs used in the ACT, called AlertWatch&#x000ae; (Ann Arbor, MI), which is a clinical monitoring and alerting system (<xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>, Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The specific and unique platform described in this protocol, AlertWatch (AW) Tower Mode, will be customized and refined through this research. While the developers of AlertWatch will be involved in refinements of the ACT based on the findings of our study, they will have no input on the design of the study nor how it is carried out and no involvement in the data collection and analysis process. The initial design of the AW Tower Mode is based on input from experts in clinical anesthesiology and medical informatics. We anticipate that prototype revision and improvement will occur throughout the usability testing and analysis process.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>AlertWatch Tower Mode census view. From this view, clinicians in the ACT can obtain a brief overview of all the patients in the ORs.

A combination of methods is often more powerful than single methods in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, &#x0201c;near-live&#x0201d; testing often discover concerns that would have otherwise been missed and is important in the evaluation of the feasibility of implementing a new technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, in this protocol, we employ a combination of formal and real-world mixed-methods usability testing.</p><p id="Par35">The formal think-aloud usability sessions with two groups of end users in phase I will provide rich information on surface-level usability problems actually encountered by these users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This data will inform the development and refinement of the ACT intervention, particularly in the early phases of design and implementation. &#x0201c;Think-aloud&#x0201d; testing is well suited to identify barriers to adoption for new technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], although limitations of this method include the potential for hindering cognitive processes, particularly for tasks that involve a high cognitive load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We anticipate that the phase II in situ qualitative and quantitative usability testing, with its heightened fidelity, will provide additional and complementary insight into usability and workflow concerns in a more realistic setting. Real-world testing such as this often discovers concerns that would have otherwise been missed in exploratory or formal usability testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. By analyzing a combination of data logs and user questionnaires, we will obtain results pertaining to major usability elements, namely, efficacy, efficiency, learnability, and satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], that will allow us to ensure a useful and usable resource for our clinicians.</p><p id="Par36">Usability testing throughout the lifecycle of a given technology is a crucial component of the successful implementation of such technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and the results of our iterative analyses will inform and refine the development of our intervention, particularly the AW Tower Mode platform. This Tower Mode platform is a customized product being specifically created and designed for the purpose of instituting the ACT and for our future randomized controlled trial. Although we are testing with a limited sample size, we anticipate that the results of the usability analysis described in this paper will provide a sufficient breadth and depth of information to allow us to ensure that the platform, which plays an integral role in the ACT, incorporates the actual needs of our users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">The planned pragmatic RCT will continue to evaluate user experience in real-world implementation settings to capture additional information about usability. For example, the current study is designed to evaluate the usability of the ACT and its software programs, prior to the initiation of the randomized controlled trial in which ACTors will be providing support to anesthesia clinicians in the OR. The usability of the modes of interaction between ACTors and CORs will not assessed with the present methods, and we do expect this to have an impact on the fully functional ACT. Therefore, in our future randomized controlled trial involving the ACT intervention, we plan to implement post-implementation analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] that evaluate and refine the ACT to ensure that it is a useful and usable resource for our clinicians in an actual real-world setting. We anticipate that some of these analyses will be in the form of surveys with both closed and open-ended responses that are administered to the members of the anesthesia department.</p><p id="Par38">The ACTors in our study will be monitoring up to 50 patients at a time, a novel model for anesthesia care that deviates significantly from the traditional model in which one anesthesiologist is responsible for no more than four rooms. The ACT will demand a high level of cognitive functioning. This level of cognitive functioning necessitates resources that have been thoroughly examined for design and usability flaws. Thus, this series of iterative usability testing and improvement is vital to the development and implementation of our innovative intervention.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Appendix 1</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>ACT description</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>ACTFAST context</title><p id="Par45">The current study describes one part of our larger effort to implement the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), a novel, telemedicine-based intervention for the operating suite. The purpose of the research described in the current protocol is to use iterative usability testing over the course of approximately 6&#x000a0;months, in order to create a maximally useful and usable resource for our clinicians. A second, concurrent study by our group (Anesthesiology Control Tower: Forecasting Algorithms to Support Treatments, or ACTFAST2) is working to develop, refine, and validate forecasting algorithms to predict negative patient trajectories; such algorithms will serve to help inform ACT interventions. Our final phase of investigation will be a yearlong comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial (Anesthesiology Control Tower: Feedback Alerts to Supplement Treatments, or ACTFAST3; NCT02830126) to demonstrate the utility of the ACT in improving adherence to clinically relevant practice guidelines and to evaluate the effect of the ACT on surrogate measures of patient outcome. In this trial, each of our institution&#x02019;s adult ORs will be randomized on a daily basis either to a control group or to an experimental group in which anesthesia providers in those ORs will receive the support of the ACT. This support will be communicated in the form of additional alerts sent by the physicians in the ACT, whose responsibility is to filter and prioritize information, thus maximizing alert quality and minimizing false alarms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>ACT technology</title><p id="Par46">One of the key components of the ACT technological infrastructure is an advanced clinical monitoring and display system called AlertWatch &#x000ae; (Ann Arbor, MI). AlertWatch (AW) uses a multi-threaded Java-based server to collect and integrate clinical information from multiple distinct data sources for presentation in a simplified and intuitive manner (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). AW provides alerts based on its continual analysis of the current patient state; when patient parameters fall outside of predetermined set points, AW triggers written and auditory alarms within the patient display and on the census view. The AW Tower Mode platform used in this study is distinct from the commercially available product in many ways and will be refined based on the results of the present study.</p><p id="Par47">AlertWatch and all additional electronic records used by our hospital are available via secure Internet connection to clinicians at any physical location in the world, allowing for the creation of our remote ACT. This includes our anesthesia information management system, MetaVision (iMDsoft&#x000ae;, Needham, MA; Centricity, General Electric Healthcare), which contains both manually entered data and automatically recorded physiologic data for the perioperative period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>ACT structure</title><p id="Par48">The ACT is physically housed within the hospital complex and is remoted from the physical operating rooms. This room includes three computers: two with two monitors and one with three monitors (one being a flat panel TV screen). An additional flat panel TV screen is powered by the third computer. The presence of additional monitors allows multiple AW windows to be visible, in addition to providing space for the separate, necessary software programs that will be needed. All software (i.e., our electronic medical record, our anesthesia information management system, and AW) either is accessible on these computers through desktop icons or links through our department&#x02019;s webpage. A guide to the ACT and an AW help guide are provided in a physical format in addition to electronic copies. Two landline telephones and one iPhone will be available in the randomized control trial.</p><p id="Par49">The ACT will be staffed by attending anesthesiologists and anesthesiology residents who are in their final year of training. The main role of these trained clinicians (referred to as &#x0201c;ACTors&#x0201d;) is to monitor all active ORs by making use of AlertWatch, the hospital&#x02019;s EMR, and the anesthesiology information management system. ACTors will assess and address alerts within the AW Tower Mode platform (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and will use their clinical judgment to determine whether a particular alert warrants contact with the clinicians in the OR (CORs) to provide additional support.</p></sec></sec></sec></app><app id="App2"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Appendix 2</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Debriefing scripts</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Debriefing script for phase Ia (ACTor sessions)</title><p id="Par50">
