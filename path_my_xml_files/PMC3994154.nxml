Other factors affecting aerobic performance include body mass (BM) and body composition <xref rid="pone.0095797-Ramana1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Obese and overweight persons, whose high BM is caused by high body adiposity, display a considerably lower VO<sub>2</sub>max relative to their body mass <xref rid="pone.0095797-Goran1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Hulens1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, a high body mass, as well as a high body mass index (BMI), can also be caused by a high amount of lean body mass (LBM) in persons with normal (or even low) body fat (BF). Publications to date have presented results of research on the influence of obesity and overweight on physical fitness and have established correlations between body composition and performance on fitness tests for athletes engaged in different disciplines <xref rid="pone.0095797-Salvadori1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Sterkowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, no attempts have thus far been made to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the influence of body composition on aerobic performance. The influence of body composition may be particularly important for sports disciplines in which athletes are required to have an appropriately high aerobic performance together with high muscle mass (e.g., boxing, basketball, or handball).</p><p>Traditionally, VO<sub>2</sub>max is given in absolute values and relative to BM. However, such method of data normalization does not account for body size and body composition. Darveau et al. <xref rid="pone.0095797-Darveau1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and West et al. <xref rid="pone.0095797-West1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> indicated a need to use parameters that allow for a comparison of physiological variables, such as VO<sub>2</sub>max, between persons with different BM. An example of such a parameter is the allometric scale <xref rid="pone.0095797-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Loftin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In relation to the practice of sports, studies have reported the need to use different values, such as allometric coefficients, to determine the percentage of total BM to be considered <xref rid="pone.0095797-Tartaruga1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These values would be specific for each sport <xref rid="pone.0095797-Loftin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0095797-Nevill1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Svedenhag1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Most commonly, the two exponents of BM used as possible scaling factors are 0.67 and 0.75 <xref rid="pone.0095797-Nevill2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Our hypothesis states that one&#x02019;s endurance is affected by absolute BM regardless of body adiposity or LBM. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to determine aerobic performance in men with lower body mass and normal body composition and in men with an increased body mass due to (a) high body fat (but with a normal lean body mass) and (b) high lean body mass (but with normal body fat). The aims of the study also include determining the optimal method of expressing VO<sub>2</sub>max that would allow for a comparison of endurance between persons with different body mass and body composition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study project was approved by the Commission for Bioethics at the Regional Medical Chamber in Krakow (opinion No. 88/KBL/OIL/2010) and procedures were carried out in accordance with Helsinki Declaration. Each study participant, having been informed of the aim and method of the study, signed an informed consent form to take part in the studies.</p><p>Before the incremental fitness test, each participant underwent a medical examination to ensure there were no contraindications to perform maximal physical effort. Anthropometric measurements and the incremental test were conducted before noon in similar external conditions (humidity and ambient temperature). Prior to the somatic measurements and the incremental test, participants were familiarized with the laboratory, measurement equipment, and testing procedures, and were instructed on how to prepare for the somatic measurements and the incremental test. Twenty four hours prior to testing participants were asked to refrain from physical activity, maintain hydration levels, and get at least 6 to 8 hours of sleep.

For each body composition parameter, a measurement result between the 40th and 60th percentile within a given group was considered average; a result above the 80th percentile was considered high. Participants were divided into three groups of different body composition. Group 1, which was the control group, included men with mean %BF (14.0&#x02013;18.5%) and mean LBM (59.0&#x02013;64.3 kg). Group 2 included men with high %BF (&#x0003e;21.5%) and mean LBM (the High Body Fat [HBF] group). Group 3 included men with mean %BF and high (&#x0003e;66.3 kg) LBM (the High Lean Body Mass [HLBM] group). In addition, the men in the HBF and HLBM had BM values that were not significantly different (about 80&#x02013;83 kg).

High body mass can be caused by an increased amount of BF or increased muscle mass (i.e., LBM), or both. The study sought to isolate the influence of both factors. The study also sought to assess, on the one hand, the influence of high body adiposity and, on the other hand, the influence of high LBM in men with similar body mass and normal values of other parameters for body composition (with the exception of body height). Results show that most of the analyzed physiological and biochemical parameters were similar between the HBF and HLBM groups.</p><p>A statistically significant positive correlation was found between LBM and absolute values of VO<sub>2</sub>max.

McInnis and Balady <xref rid="pone.0095797-McInnis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, when comparing VO<sub>2</sub> during submaximal effort between body builders (%BF&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8%) and men with normal body fat percentage (%BF&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24%) but having similar BM, found that body builders had a significantly higher VO<sub>2</sub> during motor tasks. Therefore, high body mass does not limit the VO<sub>2</sub>max: no significantly lower absolute values of VO<sub>2</sub>max were found in the analyzed groups with high body mass in comparison to the controls. This study found similar absolute values of VO<sub>2</sub>max between the studied groups. This result is most likely due to the type and intensity of physical activity the study participants engaged in. Apart from body size and body composition, VO<sub>2</sub>max is determined by genetic factors as well as the type and duration of physical activity. The HBF group was the least physically active, while the HLBM group declared the greatest engagement in very hard&#x02013;intensity exercises, including strength exercises. Conversely, the control group declared the greatest engagement in moderate-intensity exercises. Different intensity of exercises and the amount of time spent on physical activity between the groups may have affected the absolute values of VO<sub>2</sub>max. Low (although significant) correlation between absolute VO<sub>2</sub>max and LBM indicates the importance of the training state.</p><p>A problem that usually hampers interpretation of the data in a study of people with increased body mass and different body composition is the way of expressing the VO<sub>2</sub>max values. Depending on the chosen method of data normalization, results may be presented differently. People with similar absolute VO<sub>2</sub>max may have significantly different VO<sub>2</sub>max, which is relative to BM, yet at the same time, may have similar VO<sub>2</sub>max, which is relative to LBM. This study shows that the method of normalization of VO<sub>2</sub>max values is the determining factor in the interpretation of results of studies analyzing aerobic performance in persons with different body composition <xref rid="pone.0095797-Eisenmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

In studies where VO<sub>2</sub>max values are expressed in this way, the results unambiguously show that high BM, regardless of body composition, has a negative effect on aerobic performance (the results of correlation in this study support this statement). A negative correlation between BM and VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> suggests that persons with high BM have lower aerobic performance <xref rid="pone.0095797-Nevill3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Welsman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Vanderburgh1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

However, Heil <xref rid="pone.0095797-Heil1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> showed that persons with low body mass were more likely to be categorized as having a low VO<sub>2</sub>max.

This is to make the result of VO<sub>2</sub>max measurement independent of total body mass. The results of this study confirmed the validity of this approach: no correlation was found between BM and VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;0.75</sup> and VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;0.67</sup>. However, there is a statistically significant negative correlation between VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;0.75</sup> and BMI and between VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;0.75</sup> and %BF (similar negative correlation was also noted between VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;0.67</sup> and %BF or BMI). When VO<sub>2</sub>max was expressed relative to BM<sup>&#x02212;0.75</sup> or BM<sup>&#x02212;0.67</sup>, the HBF group displayed the lowest (p&#x0003c;0.05) values of this parameter.</p><p>Another suggested method of normalization is expressing VO<sub>2</sub>max relative to LBM <xref rid="pone.0095797-Toth1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Vanderburgh1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Janz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In this study, when VO<sub>2</sub>max was expressed relative to LBM the all groups displayed similar results. At the same time, this method of normalization shows no significant correlation of VO<sub>2</sub>max with BM, body composition, and BMI. Therefore, this method seems to be optimal for comparing VO<sub>2</sub>max values in persons with different body composition.</p><p>The results of this study, which are similar to those found in studies of physical fitness in overweight or obese persons, demonstrated that obese persons displayed similar absolute VO<sub>2</sub>max values and VO<sub>2</sub>max values relative to LBM compared to persons with normal body composition <xref rid="pone.0095797-Goran1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Ekelund1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. On the other hand, persons with high BF displayed significantly lower values of VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0095797-Goran1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095797-Hulens1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Goran et al. <xref rid="pone.0095797-Hulens1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> found that VO<sub>2</sub>max relative to LBM is an indicator of the physiological status of the cardio-respiratory system in terms of the oxidative demands of the body and does not seem to be influenced by excess FM. For this reason, it is recommended to provide VO<sub>2</sub>max relative to LBM, not relative to total BM <xref rid="pone.0095797-Goran1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The results of this study substantiate this recommendation: correlation coefficients indicate that body composition does not affect VO<sub>2</sub>max relative to LBM. However, there is a significant negative correlation between VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and %BF, BMI, and BM.</p><p>The limitation of the study was the significant difference in body height noted in HLBM compared to the control group and HBF groups. This is why the increased level of LBM may have been the result of the greater BH of persons in the HLBM group and not the result of, for example, the applied training. Nevertheless, tall persons were included in the study because adding another inclusion criterion would have considerably reduced the HLBM group. It should be noted that BH does not affect one&#x02019;s endurance capabilities. VO<sub>2</sub>max is determined not only by somatic build, but also by many other factors, such as the cardiopulmonary functions, the number of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration in the blood, mass of the mitochondria, or the training state.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Body mass shows a negative correlation with values of VO<sub>2</sub>max relative to body mass. This means that low values of this parameter are noted both in persons whose high body mass is the result of high body fat and in persons whose high body mass is the result of high lean body mass. Regardless of the method of normalization, aerobic performance of persons with similar body mass and different body composition is similar. High body mass, regardless of the cause (i.e., high BF or high LBM), decreases VO<sub>2</sub>max relative to body mass. Results of this study may prove useful for trainers, instructors, and persons engaged in anaerobic-aerobic sports disciplines that require good aerobic performance as well as strength and power determined primarily by muscle mass. The study found relatively low yet statistically significant correlation and determination coefficients that indicate a relationship between body mass and body composition and VO<sub>2</sub>max values expressed in the following ways: as absolute values relative to absolute body mass and as VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;0.75</sup> and VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup>.</sup>BM<sup>&#x02212;0.67</sup>. VO<sub>2</sub>max expressed relative to LBM shows no relationship with absolute BM and body composition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the subjects who volunteered for the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0095797-Bassett1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
