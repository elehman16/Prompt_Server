The common pattern of play in &#x0201c;team sports&#x0201d; is &#x0201c;stop and go,&#x0201d; i.e., where players perform repeated bouts of brief high-intensity exercise punctuated by lower-intensity activity; carbohydrate serves as a major energy source for the athletic performance of team-sports players<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In addition, the importance of carbohydrates increases with increasing exercise intensity, but because of the limited carbohydrate reserves in the body, the depletion of liver and intramuscular glycogen by high-intensity exercise for a long time is a determining factor in the athletic performance of team-sports players<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Carbohydrate depletion in the body by high-intensity team-sports performed over a long period of time impairs athletic performance due to inhibition of fat metabolism and accumulation of metabolites such as ammonia (NH3), lactate, hydrogen ion (H+), and inorganic phosphates (Pi)<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>Carbohydrate loading by high-carbohydrate diet or additional carbohydrate supplements after depletion of carbohydrate through prolonged high-intensity exercise increases the level of glycogen synthesis by increasing glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 and glycogen synthases concentrations<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In addition, carbohydrate loading improves the secretion of anabolic hormones (e.g., growth hormone [GH] and testosterone) and the efficiency of glucose by increased insulin secretion with increasing blood glucose concentration<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. It also reduces free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol levels in the blood5. Besides, additional carbohydrate supplements before exercise lead to an increase in carbohydrate metabolic efficiency by the activation of intramuscular pyruvatehydrogenase complex (PDC)<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, thereby increasing intramuscular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate (PCr), and glycogen content via increased excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC)<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.

Sullo et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> found that male professional long-distance athletes with carbohydrate loading had better 25 km time trial performance and higher glucose and lactate concentrations in the last 5 km. Tarnopolsky et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> reported enhanced carbohydrate utilization capacity and exercise performance in seven endurance-trained male athletes after 4 days on a high-carbohydrate diet (55&#x02013;60 to 75% of energy intake). Foskett et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> reported 6.4% CHO-E solution intake immediately before each trial (8 mL&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup> BM) and at 15-min intervals (3mL&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup> BM) during intermittent high-intensity running to fatigue performed after carbohydrate loading for 2 days improves endurance capacity in six recreationally active male games players with high pre-exercise muscle glycogen concentrations. Vandenbogaerde et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, based on the meta-analysis of 73 studies, verified that an adequate carbohydrate supplement intake of about 0.7 g&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x02219;hr<sup>-1</sup> before and during exercise enhances the endurance performance by 2 to 6%. However, most previous studies have examined the effects of carbohydrate loading with diet or supplements in endurance athletes such as middle- and long-distance runners or cyclists, while studies of team-sports players who performed various types of prolonged high-intensity exercise are relatively inadequate and the results are also unclear<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of additional carbohydrate supplements for 7 days after prolonged interval exercise on exercise performance and energy metabolism during submaximal exercise in team-sports athletes. We hypothesized that 7 days of additional carbohydrate supplements after prolonged interval exercise may enhance exercise performance with increased carbohydrate utilization capacity and carbohydrate-sparing effect with improved fat oxidation during submaximal exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_sec2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty team-sports athletes (14 soccer and 6 rugby players) who belong to the Korean Football Association and Korean Rugby Union volunteered to participate in the study.

In this study, there was no significant interaction in all parameters related to exercise performance (VO<sub>2max</sub>) and energy metabolism (VE, VO<sub>2</sub>, VCO<sub>2</sub>, RER, blood glucose level, and blood lactate level) during submaximal exercise in team-sports athletes. These results show that additional carbohydrate supplements for 7 days after prolonged interval exercise are not effective for improving exercise performance in team-sports athletes such as soccer and rugby players. However, more improvement in the EXP was observed in the VO2max, blood glucose level, and blood lactate level compared to those in the CON. These results presented the possibility that additional carbohydrate supplements for 7 days after prolonged interval exercise performed in this study may be effective.</p><p>The main finding of this study was that there was no significant difference in VO2max among the two intervention groups. Although the EXP showed a larger increase rate (CON vs EXP = 5.3% vs 6.3%) than the CON, this difference did not result in a significant interaction. A few previous studies have reported that carbohydrate loading by a high-carbohydrate diet or additional carbohydrate supplements after depletion of carbohydrate does not affect exercise performance<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Andrews et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> reported that despite the increase in carbohydrate oxidation, the 24.2-km time trial was not improved in 8 female aerobic-trained athletes after 4 days on a high carbohydrate diet (75% of energy intake).Tarnopolsky et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> reported that muscle glycogen concentration did not increase by 0% in response to dietary carbohydrate from 55&#x02013;60 to 75% of energy intake for a period of 4 days (carbohydrate loading) and there was no corresponding increase in performance time during an 85% VO2peak trial (5%) in 8 endurance-trained female athletes. However, many previous studies revealed that carbohydrate loading is effective in the enhancement of exercise performance. Walker et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> reported that aerobic-trained women increased muscle glycogen content in response to a high-carbohydrate diet (75% of energy intake) for a period of 4 days. Moreover, the increase in muscle glycogen, and possibly liver glycogen, after a high-carbohydrate diet was associated with increased cycling performance to volitional exhaustion at approximately 80% VO<sub>2max</sub>. Foskett et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> proved that after consumption of a carbohydrate-rich diet, carbohydrate supplementation (90 g&#x02219;h<sup>-1</sup>) in the form of a 6.4% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution during exercise led to an improvement in high intermittent running capacity, but it did not affect muscle glycogen use. In our study, we presumed that the positive results of exercise performance via carbohydrate loading by a high-carbohydrate diet or additional carbohydrate supplements after depletion of carbohydrate through prolonged high-intensity exercise were not observed for the following reasons: First, we did not use the method of high-carbohydrate diet intake which corresponds to 75&#x02013;80% based on the analysis of the dietary intake which is obtained through accurate dietary investigation. After meals, to emphasize practical aspects, 50 g (2nd to 4th days) and 100 g (4th to 7th days) of additional carbohydrate supplements without an accurate dietary investigation were provided in team-sports athletes 3 times daily. Second, unlike previous studies, we selected team-sports athletes rather than endurance athletes as subjects; therefore, athletic performance was evaluated by using VO<sub>2max</sub> instead of exercise duration until exhaustion using a treadmill.</p><p>In addition, we measured energy metabolism through VE, VO<sub>2</sub>, VCO<sub>2</sub>, RER, blood glucose level, and blood lactate level over 30 min of submaximal exercise. As a result, all energy metabolic parameters showed no significant interaction. Thus, additional carbohydrate supplements performed in our study were not effective in energy metabolism during submaximal exercise. However, in the other variables except for RER, the change rate in the EXP showed a more positive tendency than that in the CON. In the case of previous studies related to energy metabolism, Tarnopolsky et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> reported a 41% increase in muscle glycogen as a result of carbohydrate loading by high-carbohydrate diets equivalent to 75% of energy intake for 4 days in 7 male endurance athletes. Andrew et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> reported that carbohydrate loading for 4 days in 8 aerobic-trained women showed a significantly higher RER and blood lactate level and lower blood glycerol concentration. Foskett et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> announced that after 2 days of carbohydrate loading, carbohydrate-electrolyte solution intake at rest (8 mL&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup>) and during interval exercise (3 mL&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup>)resulted in higher blood insulin, glucose, and lactate levels and lower blood glycerol and free fatty acid concentration during exercise and recovery compared to those in the placebo group. In our study, the EXP showed an increased VE, VO<sub>2</sub>, and VCO<sub>2</sub> during submaximal exercise compared to the CON. Based on the RER result, considering the same rate of change in carbohydrate and lipid oxidation between both groups during submaximal exercise, the increased relative exercise intensity (e.g., VO<sub>2max</sub>) in the EXP is considered to be caused by these results. Unlike Andrews et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and Foskett et al.<sup><xref rid="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, our study failed to identify higher RER, blood glucose level, and blood lactate level in the EXP compared to those in the CON; these results mean that our carbohydrate loading method does not lead to efficient carbohydrate loading effect. In other words, for team-sports athletes to have an efficient carbohydrate loading effect, we consider that it is desirable to take quantified carbohydrates from 75 to 80% of the daily energy intake for 4 to 7 days after the carbohydrate depletion by prolonged high-intensity interval exercise, and this carbohydrate loading method may increase the amount of intramuscular glycogen storage and improve energy metabolism and performance during exercise in team-sports athletes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="JENB_2018_v22n1_29_sec5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our results suggested that carbohydrate loading performed in this study had no effect on energy metabolism during submaximal exercise and exercise performance in team-sports athletes.
