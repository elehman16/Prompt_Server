In recent years, the use of intrathecal adjuvants has gained popularity with the aim of prolonging the duration of block, better success rate, and patient satisfaction. Adequate pain management is essential to facilitate rehabilitation, accelerate functional recovery, and enabling patients to return to their normal activity more quickly. The quality of the spinal anesthesia has been reported to be improved by the addition of opioids (such as morphine, fentanyl, and sufentanil) and other drugs (such as dexmedetomidine, clonidine, neostigmine, ketamine, and midazolam), but no drug to inhibit nociception is without associated adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine has become one of the frequently used drugs in anesthetic armamentarium, along with routine anesthetic drugs due to its hemodynamic, sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, neuroprotective, and anesthetic-sparing effects.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> ratio of 1:1600 makes it a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist compared to clonidine, thus reducing the unwanted side effects involving &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> receptors. High selectivity of dexmedetomidine to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors (which mediate analgesia and sedation) has been exploited by various authors in regional anesthesia practice.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>By virtue of its effect on spinal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors, dexmedetomidine mediates its analgesic effects. Dexmedetomidine has been found to prolong analgesia when used as an adjuvant to local anesthetics for subarachnoid, epidural, and caudal blocks.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl is a centrally acting synthetic opioid that has been widely used. Intrathecal fentanyl is usually combined with local anesthetic agents for perioperative anesthesia and analgesia. Intraoperative supplementation of bupivacaine spinal anesthesia with intrathecal fentanyl resulted in better quality of spinal anesthesia. Fentanyl is a lipophilic drug potentiates spinal anesthesia, and it is associated with a decreased incidence of side effects such as pruritus, nausea, and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>P<sc>ATIENTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After obtaining Institutional Ethical Committee approval of Zagazig Faculty of Medicine and written informed consent, seventy ASA physical status I and II male patients aged 18&#x02013;50 years, height 160&#x02013;190 cm, and weight 50&#x02013;90 kg scheduled for inguinal hernioplasty under spinal anesthesia were included in this prospective randomized, double-blinded study in the period from October 2014 to May 2015 in Zagazig University Hospitals.

Following infusion of 500 ml lactated Ringer's solution and with the patient in the sitting position, lumber puncture was performed at the L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> level through a midline approach using a 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned into three groups:</p><p>

</p><p>After intrathecal injection, patients were positioned in the supine position and oxygen 2 L/min was given through a face mask. The anesthesiologist performing the block recorded the intraoperative data and a nurse followed the patients postoperatively until discharged from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Both were blind to the group to which the patient was allocated. Sensory block was assessed bilaterally using analgesia to pinprick with a short hypodermic needle in the midclavicular line. Motor block was assessed using the modified Bromage scale (Bromage 0: The patient is able to move the hip, knee, and ankle; Bromage1: The patient is unable to move the hip but is able to move the knee and ankle; Bromage 2: The patient is unable to move the hip and knee but able to move the ankle; and Bromage 3: The patient is unable to move the hip, knee, and ankle). The time to reach T<sub>10</sub> dermatome sensory block and Bromage 3 motor block was recorded before the surgery. The regression time for sensory and motor block was recorded in a PACU. All durations were calculated considering the time of spinal injection as time zero. Patients were discharged from the PACU after sensory regression to S<sub>1</sub> dermatome and Bromage 0.</p><p>The three groups were monitored perioperatively for heart rate NIBP and SpO<sub>2</sub>. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg or &#x0003e;30% decrease in baseline values. Tachycardia was defined as heart rate &#x0003e;100/min and bradycardia was defined as heart rate &#x0003c;60/min. Intraoperative nausea, vomiting, pruritus, additive analgesia, sedation using Ramsay Sedation Scale, or any other side effects were recorded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were checked, entered, and analyzed using SPSS version 11 (SPSS Inc., IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).
