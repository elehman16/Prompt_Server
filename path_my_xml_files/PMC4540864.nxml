bilateral upper-extremity training on brain activity in patients with stroke. [Subjects
and Methods] Eighteen chronic stroke patients were divided into two groups: the virtual
reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training group (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and the
bilateral upper-limb training group (<italic>n</italic> = 8). The virtual reality-based
bilateral upper-extremity training group performed bilateral upper-extremity exercises in
a virtual reality environment, while the bilateral upper-limb training group performed
only bilateral upper-extremity exercise. All training was conducted 30 minutes per day,
three times per week for six weeks, followed by brain activity evaluation. [Results]
Electroencephalography showed significant increases in concentration in the frontopolar 2
and frontal 4 areas, and significant increases in brain activity in the frontopolar 1 and
frontal 3 areas in the virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training group.
[Conclusion] Virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training can improve the
brain activity of stroke patients. Thus, virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity
training is feasible and beneficial for improving brain activation in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Bilateral arm training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Virtual reality (VR) therapy has recently been demonstrated to improve upper-extremity
motor function in stroke patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. VR
therapy has been used as an interactive intervention for motor retraining in children<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> as well as adults<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> because of the
intensity of practice and sensory feedback.</p><p>Electroencephalography was the first brain imaging assessment tool used to demonstrate
alterations of brain functions in patients with traumatic brain injury<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The electrodes are used only to measure the brain&#x02019;s
electrical activity. Brain wave activity is relayed from the scalp to a computer, where it
is recorded and stored. All of this is performed while the patient is resting quietly with
his or her eyes closed or sometimes while performing a cognitive task such as reading.
Disturbed cortical functions, as evidenced by the abnormal wave size, are indicative of
brain activity malfunction. These issues usually manifest as abnormal behaviors such as
difficulty paying attention, distractibility, learning disabilities, and loss of memory,
while many others cause attention deficit disorders. The frontal lobes in particular are
involved in motor function, problem solving, spontaneity, memory, language, initiation,
judgment, impulse control, and social and sexual behaviors. Because of their location at the
front of the cranium, proximity to the sphenoid wing, and large size, the frontal lobes are
extremely vulnerable to injury. MRI studies show the frontal area is the most commonly
damaged region following mild to moderate traumatic brain injury<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are important differences in the symmetry of the frontal lobes: the left frontal lobe
is involved in controlling language-related movement, whereas the right frontal lobe plays a
role in nonverbal abilities. Some researchers emphasize that this rule is not absolute and
that both lobes are involved in nearly all behaviors in many people. Motor function
disturbances are typically characterized by a loss of fine movements and strength of the
arms, hands, and fingers. Complex chains of motor movement also appear to be controlled by
the frontal lobes<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study investigated virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training
(VRBT) for the rehabilitation of chronic stroke patients. We hypothesized that the training
provides more appropriate sensory feedback than bilateral upper-limb training, which
subsequently leads to improved brain activity and upper-extremity function in stroke
patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 20 stroke patients were recruited from a general hospital. Stroke survivors were
included if they met the following criteria: (1) hemi-paralytic, (2) able to follow verbal
instructions, (3) at least 6 months post-stroke diagnosed by a physician, (4) able to
communicate (i.e., Mini Mental State Examination language section score from 24&#x02013;30), and (5)
a Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score less than 2 for the upper extremities. Patients were
excluded if they had diplegia or a visual field defect. This study was approved by the
Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board. The purpose and requirements of the study
were explained to all patients before the experiment began, and all patients signed a
written informed consent form prior to participation.</p><p>Upper-extremity function, muscle strength, and brain waves were evaluated before the
intervention. Twenty patients were randomly divided into the virtual reality-based bilateral
upper-extremity training (VRBT, <italic>n</italic> = 10) group or the bilateral upper-limb
training (BT, <italic>n</italic> = 10) group as controls; the latter performed the BT while
watching an irrelevant video. The patients in both groups trained 30 minutes per session,
three times per week for six weeks. In addition, the patients were offered conventional
physical therapy for 30 minutes per session, five times per week for six weeks. Two physical
therapists were randomly allocated to each group for training. The VRBT group had no
dropouts, but two patients were excluded from the BT group because of poor participation
(&#x0003c;80%)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The VRBT group contained 5
men and women each; their mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight were 69.2 &#x000b1; 5.5&#x02005;years, 163.5 &#x000b1;
8.6&#x02005;cm, and 59.4 &#x000b1; 8.3&#x02005;kg, respectively. Seven and three had right and left hemiplegia,
respectively. The mean duration after stroke onset was 16.2 &#x000b1; 6.5 months, and their mean
MMSE score was 24.5 &#x000b1; 0.7. Meanwhile, the BT group consisted of 3 men and 5 women, with a
mean age, height, and weight of 73.1 &#x000b1; 8.9&#x02005;years, 160.9 &#x000b1; 9.5&#x02005;cm, and 54.9 &#x000b1; 10.7&#x02005;kg,
respectively; 3 and 5 had right and left hemiplegia, respectively. The mean duration after
stroke was 17.0 &#x000b1; 6.5, and their mean MMSE score was 24.1 &#x000b1; 0.4. There were no significant
differences between the groups.</p><p>A physical therapist who also was an expert in electroencephalography was recruited to
measure brain wave activity at baseline and after the intervention. The electroencephalogram
(EEG) is produced by synchronous postsynaptic potentials from cortical neurons recorded at
the scalp. The raw EEG signal is amplified, digitized, plotted, and filtered to isolate
narrow frequency bands (in&#x02005;Hz) that reflect specific brain sources and functions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. EEG neuro-feedback refers to the conversion
of information regarding brain wave activity (i.e., the quantitative measurement of brain
wave frequencies) into graph- or game-like displays as the patient learns to control and
improve brain wave patterns.</p><p>The VRBT involved a visual expression technique using animations and provided cognitive
information for feedback<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The animation
consisted of symmetric and asymmetric upper-extremity training as well as symmetric and
asymmetric upper-extremity training at 45&#x000b0; in a virtual reality environment. The patients
performed each movement for 4 minutes and then rested for 1 minute to minimize fatigue.
Depending on the severity of the deficits, the patient either grasped the handles or the
affected hand was strapped to the handle<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
An upper-extremity instrument (50&#x02005;cm wide and 60&#x02005;cm long) was used to control the
inclination and width. A laptop (SVS13116FKP, Sony Vaio, Korea), webcam (QuickCam Orbit,
QVR-1, Logitech, Korea), and monitor (M2352D-PN, LG, Korea) were used to create the virtual
reality environment. The webcam had a resolution of 1,600 &#x000d7; 1,200 at a medium frame rate (30
frames/s) and recorded a patient&#x02019;s upper-extremity movement. One webcam was placed in front
of the patient, and another was placed on the ceiling above. A monitor displayed the virtual
reality program and simultaneously recorded the patient&#x02019;s bilateral upper-extremity
movements. The monitor had a resolution of 1,920 &#x000d7; 1,080 and a diagonal measurement of 23
inches. Patients received real-time feedback through the monitor while training. The monitor
simultaneously displayed an animation with the virtual reality training, and the patient&#x02019;s
upper-extremity movement. The patients in the VRBT and BT groups were offered the same four
upper-extremity training programs as well.</p><p>A QEEG-8 (Laxtha Inc., Daejeon, Korea) was used to measure brain wave activity<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. An expert on brain wave measurement
instructed an evaluator how to apply the analysis program and use the equipment, who was
then trained to repeat the measurement process. Brain waves were measured in a separate
space where patients were undisturbed. Measurements were performed after the baseline and
post-intervention examinations. The patients&#x02019; eyes were closed in order to block noise due
to eye movement. The patients kept their eyes closed and remained in a comfortable position
for brain wave measurement for 80 seconds. In order to decrease the incidence of artifacts,
the patients were instructed not to speak or move during the process. Four electrodes were
attached to the surface of the skull, and brain waves were measured using a monopolar
derivation method. The EEGs were based on the International 10&#x02013;20 electrode system, and
measurement positions were on FP1, FP2, F3, and F4. In general, plate electrodes (7&#x02013;10&#x02005;mm)
that consist of a silver electrode whose surface is covered with a thin film of argentic
chloride are used for EEG measurement<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
A Telescan 2.98 (Laxtha Inc., Daejeon, Korea) was used to analyze brain wave data. The
measured brain wave patterns were evaluated to determine whether they were artifacts, and
all raw data except for the first and last 10 seconds were analyzed. Sampling rates from
4&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz were used. The relative power of each band (i.e., the percentage of the total power
in each channel) is a measure of the percentage of the total power in a specific frequency
band. Whereas the absolute power can sum to essentially any magnitude across the frequency
spectrum, the relative power must add up to 100%, with the relative power in any given band
representing some fraction of the total power. Evaluation of the relative power may improve
the detection of subtle shifts in brain function over time according to the normalization of
fluctuations in the total power observed among individuals or within one individual across
several recordings.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0. The Shapiro-Wilk test
showed the data had a normal distribution. A paired t-test was performed to compare changes
before and after the intervention. An independent sample t-test was used to compare
differences in the means between the two study groups. The level of significance was set at
p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>On the EEG in the VRBT group, the concentration of Fp2 increased significantly from 20.2 at
baseline to 30.0 post-intervention (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In addition, in the VRBT group, the F4
concentration significantly increased from 13.5 at baseline to 19.5 post-intervention (p

training to hemiplegic stroke patients and investigated the active regions of the brain by
using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). They found patients exhibited
significantly more activity in the exercise neural networks near the damaged cortex area,
complemented exercise area, and sensorimotor cortex than normal controls. In addition, they
report reorganization and activation of the ipsilateral motor pathway and complemented
movement area around the patients&#x02019; damaged region.</p><p>Toyokura et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> applied both simple
and complex tasks to stroke patients and measured their sensorimotor cortex activation by
using fMRI. Accordingly, the sensorimotor cortex area exhibited significantly greater
activation during the complex task than the simple task. The simple task consisted of
grasping and making a fist with one or both hands, while the complex task involved
alternately opening and closing both hands simultaneously.</p><p>A beta wave from 12&#x02013;35&#x02005;Hz is a brain wave that affects concentration; it is increased by
executing cognitive information processes or physical activities that require concentration.
During such tasks, alpha waves decrease while beta waves increase<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strong beta waves (e.g., 20&#x02013;35&#x02005;Hz) indicate
concentration, while lower-frequency theta waves indicate decreased concentration. In the
present study, EEGs were based on the International 10&#x02013;20 electrode system, but the
measurement positions were only FP1, FP2, F3, and F4. Even though concentration (i.e., Fp2
and F4) and brain activity (i.e., Fp1 and F3) improved significantly after treatment in the
VRBT group, the frontal lobes showed asymmetric activity. However, as only four electrodes
were used, further studies should examine brain activity by EEG using more electrodes.
Despite this limitation, the present results indicate virtual reality training with
bilateral motor learning is promising for the neuro-rehabilitation of post-stroke motor
deficits.</p><p>The virtual reality environment with repeated bilateral movement learning increased the
efficiency of training by inciting the patient&#x02019;s interest, providing real-time feedback to
modify the patient&#x02019;s movement, and improving behavioral understanding. On the other hand,
the VRBT group exhibited improved concentration and brain activity compared with the BT
group. This difference might be due to an external stimulus such as virtual reality that
involves a direct multi-sensory system, thus inducing concentration and enhancing brain
activity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Merians</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Jack</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Boian</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Virtual reality-augmented rehabilitation for patients
