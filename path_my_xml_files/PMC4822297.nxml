Several monoclonal antibodies against amyloid &#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;) are in development as potential disease-modifying treatments. Antibodies are attractive drugs as they can be made highly specific for their target. Data from recent AD trials remain inconclusive, but provide some suggestion that a treatment effect of immunotherapy is possible. Bapineuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting non-selectively all forms of A&#x003b2;, generated side-effects leading to lowering of treatment doses and no treatment effect was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Solanezumab was developed to target soluble, monomeric A&#x003b2;. In two phase 3 studies, solanezumab did not meet primary endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, when data from the two studies were pooled, a pattern emerged with a slowing of cognitive decline in the subgroup of mild AD. The lack of robust clinical effect with antibodies binding A&#x003b2; fibrils or monomers has drawn attention to antibodies targeting soluble, aggregated forms of A&#x003b2;.</p><p>A&#x003b2; exists in various conformational states - monomers, oligomers, protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Protofibrils are soluble A&#x003b2; aggregates, larger than approximately 100&#x000a0;kDa, i. e., eluting in the void volume on a Size Exclusion Superdex 75 column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is increasing evidence suggesting that oligomers and protofibrils are more toxic than insoluble fibrils or monomers and that they mediate neurotoxicity and alter synaptic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The Arctic Alzheimer mutation (A&#x003b2;PP E693G) has been shown to specifically increase the formation of soluble A&#x003b2; protofibrils, an A&#x003b2; species toxic to neurons and likely to be present in all cases of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Indeed, Arctic mutation cases were negative for fibrillar amyloid, as measured by Pittsburg compound B (<sup>11</sup>C-PIB) with positron emission tomography (PET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This suggests that reducing A&#x003b2; protofibrils could provide an effective treatment approach for AD that might ameliorate neuronal toxicity and potentially improve other pathological processes, e.g., synaptic dysfunction, inflammatory changes, and, ultimately, neuronal loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>mAb158 is a murine monoclonal antibody that was raised to target protofibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and BAN2401 is the humanized IgG1 monoclonal version that selectively binds to A&#x003b2; protofibrils. In vitro studies demonstrated that the binding characteristics are essentially indistinguishable from mAb158. BAN2401 has at least a 1000-fold higher selectivity for protofibrils compared to monomers and 10-15 times better binding to protofibrils than to fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Treatment of transgenic mice carrying both the Swedish and the Arctic mutations with mAb158 demonstrated that plaque formation was prevented if the antibody was given before the appearance of plaque in young mice. If treatment started later in this mouse model, levels of insoluble A&#x003b2; in the brains of plaque-bearing old mice were not affected. However, in both cases, soluble A&#x003b2; protofibril levels were diminished, showing that mAb158 can selectively reduce protofibrils in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAN2401 in AD patients following single and multiple ascending doses and to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition, effects of BAN2401 on CSF and plasma biomarkers of AD were investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A multicenter double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study was performed in subjects with mild to moderate AD. No major issues in our animal studies, or in the formal toxicological studies were seen. The starting dose was set with an acceptable margin to NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level). Estimations of dose levels were made from treatment studies in our transgenic Alzheimer mice models. The top dose was chosen from our studies on transgenic Alzheimer mice and based on lowering of A&#x003b2; protofibrils.</p><p>The study was comprised of two parts. In the single ascending dose (SAD) study, doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 15&#x000a0;mg/kg were evaluated. A multiple ascending dose (MAD) part investigated doses of 0.3, 1, and 3&#x000a0;mg/kg administered every four weeks with a total of four doses over four months and a dose of 10&#x000a0;mg/kg biweekly, with a total of seven doses over four months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each cohort consisted of eight subjects, two randomized to placebo and six to BAN2401. BAN2401 was given as an i. v. infusion. Treatment periods of the SAD and MAD cohorts took place in a staggered parallel manner. Cohorts were initiated after review of the safety and PK data of the previous cohorts. Before determining to proceed to the next dose level, each SAD cohort was observed for four weeks post dose. This included assessment of a non-contrast brain MRI at three weeks after dosing to evaluate the presence of amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA-E for edema/H for hemorrhage). Treatment in each MAD cohort was initiated after review of all available safety data, including data from the equivalent and the next higher single dose levels. Data included MRI, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory data collected at least three weeks post dose in the SAD study. Subjects were followed for up to 180&#x000a0;days after final dosing.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design with overlapping SAD-MAD cohorts, where treatment periods took place in a staggered parallel manner.

Doses were not administered until evaluation of the most recent MRI. An additional safety MRI was conducted at 90 and 180&#x000a0;days after the final dose for MAD1 and MAD2 cohorts, and at 90&#x000a0;days for MAD3 and MAD4 cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>In the SAD cohorts, serum concentrations of BAN2401 were measured pre dose, at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24&#x000a0;h post dose, and at 10, 21, 28, 90 and 180&#x000a0;days post dose. Concentrations of BAN2401 in CSF were measured in SAD6 (15&#x000a0;mg/kg) on day 2 for the first four subjects and on day 10 for the next four subjects. In the MAD cohorts, serum BAN2401 concentrations were measured pre dose and immediately post dose for all four infusions. Additional samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24&#x000a0;h post dose after doses 1 and 4. In addition, single samples were collected three weeks and three months post dose. A validated method for measurement of BAN2401 based on liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LCMS) (Frontage Laboratories, Exon, PA, USA) was used. The LCMS method had a lower limit of quantification of 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL. Concentrations of BAN2401 in CSF were measured using a validated ELISA with electrochemiluminence detection with a lower limit of quantification of 3&#x000a0;ng/mL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Target engagement and pharmacodynamics</title><p>Plasma concentrations of A&#x003b2;<sub>(1-40)</sub> were measured at the same time points as for the PK assessments.

A beneficial safety profile allowing for efficacious dose levels without undesired side effects is pivotal for success. Safety and tolerability were the primary outcome measures in this first-in-human study with BAN2401 in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD. In this study, BAN2401 was safe and well-tolerated at all doses tested. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached with either single or multiple dosing.</p><p>Asymptomatic ARIA-H occurred in 3/60 (5&#x000a0;%) subjects treated with BAN2401, which is a lower incidence than that observed in subjects treated with placebo (2/20, 10&#x000a0;%). The incidence of ARIA in both placebo and BAN2401 treatment groups at base-line was within the expected levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For the ongoing phase 2b study there were no dosing limitations based on safety, as all doses were safe and tolerable.</p><p>Results of the non-compartmentalized PK analyses indicate that BAN2401 is characterized by linear PK, with dose-proportional exposure and first order elimination. The mean serum half-life of BAN2401 was approximately seven days, which was reliably determined when given at doses of 10&#x000a0;mg/kg or higher. This was shorter than predicted from animal PK studies. Consequently, a more frequent biweekly dosing interval was considered important, and an additional MAD cohort with 10&#x000a0;mg/kg biweekly dosing was added. The 10&#x000a0;mg/kg biweekly dose achieved minimum steady state levels of approximately 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL after three doses, with an accumulation factor of approximately 1.4. The PK profile has guided us for selecting dose and dose regimens in the ongoing phase 2b study.</p><p>BAN2401 penetrated the blood-brain barrier and could be measured in CSF as a surrogate for CNS exposure. Due to the limited numbers of CSF samples, a cautious interpretation of the data is necessary. CSF concentration 24&#x000a0;h after a single dose was 0.04&#x000a0;% of its serum concentration and after monthly multiple doses 0.04 - 0.08&#x000a0;%, but was somewhat higher, 0.13&#x000a0;% at 24&#x000a0;h post dose at steady state after biweekly dosing. Over a 14-day interval at steady state with multiple dosing at 10&#x000a0;mg/kg biweekly, the CSF: serum ratio increased to 0.29&#x000a0;%, which may suggest a longer half-life in CSF vs. plasma.</p><p>There were no apparent effects of BAN2401 on CSF t-tau, p-tau or A&#x003b2;<sub>(1-42)</sub>. At present there is no validated assay for measuring protofibrils in human CSF. Thus, it was not possible to assess target engagement of BAN2401 in CSF. However, ex vivo immunoprecipitation experiments with BAN2401 demonstrated that the antibody was able to pull-down virtually all A&#x003b2;<sub>(1-42)</sub> from AD brain tissue in the fraction containing mainly soluble A&#x003b2; aggregates. This indicates a high level of target engagement in affected brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There was no clear guidance for an effective dose based on biomarkers. For this reason, several doses and dose regimens are being tested in the ongoing phase 2b study. BAN2401 treatment led to only a slightly increased plasma A&#x003b2;<sub>(1-40)</sub> (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), which was most evident at 10&#x000a0;mg/kg biweekly, and this would be consistent with low affinity of BAN2401 for monomeric A&#x003b2; present in human plasma.</p><p>Traditionally, SAD and MAD studies involve the completion of each cohort before proceeding to a higher dose. In this study, we used a design allowing the SAD and MAD cohorts to be intercalated and conducted in staggered parallel fashion. Thus, the study duration was significantly shortened. An adequate duration of follow up for the assessment of ARIA and other potential adverse events could still be ensured prior to initiation of higher dose cohorts. In addition, PK results from completed earlier cohorts were used to amend the MAD dose frequency to reflect the shorter than expected half-life and to investigate if the PK profile in CSF might be comparable to that in serum. Use of this innovative study design enabled all cohorts to be completed within 12&#x000a0;months. It demonstrated that in this Phase 1 study BAN2401 was safe and well-tolerated at single doses up to 15&#x000a0;mg/kg and multiple doses up to 10&#x000a0;mg/kg biweekly. On the basis of this study, a Phase 2b efficacy study has been initiated in a combined population of prodromal AD and mild AD dementia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Several monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of AD have been in development over the last decade. BAN2401 is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds soluble A&#x003b2; protofibrils. The first clinical study described in this paper demonstrates that that BAN2401 was safe and well tolerated in mild to moderate AD. The presence of ARIA was assessed at multiple time points with MRI. The incidence of ARIA on MRI was comparable to that of placebo. BAN2401 exposure was approximately dose proportional, with a serum terminal elimination half-life of approximately seven days. Only a slight increase of plasma A&#x003b2;<sub>(1-40)</sub> was observed but there were no measurable effects of BAN2401 on CSF biomarkers. On the basis of these findings, a Phase 2b efficacy study has been initiated in early AD.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13195_2016_181_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Tables addendum.
