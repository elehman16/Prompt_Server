Fifty-eight patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease undergoing stenting in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital were selected and randomly divided into control group (n=29) and dexmedetomidine group (n=29). The dexmedetomidine group was treated with dexmedetomidine before induced anesthesia, while the control group was given the same dose of normal saline; and the normal volunteers of the same age were selected as the normal group (n=29). At 3 days after operation, the levels of serum S100B and nerve growth factor (NGF) in each group were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was detected via western blotting. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and attention network test (ANT) were performed. Moreover, the cognitive function and attention network function, and the effects of dexmedetomidine on cognitive function and attention network function were evaluated. The concentrations of serum S100B and NGF in dexmedetomidine group was lower than those in control group (P&#x0003c;0.01). The results of western blotting showed that the levels of serum BDNF in control group and dexmedetomidine group were significantly lower than that in normal group (P&#x0003c;0.01), and it was higher in dexmedetomidine group than that in control group (P&#x0003c;0.01). Besides, both MoCA and ANT results revealed that the visual space and executive function scores, attention scores, delayed memory scores, targeted network efficiency and executive control network efficiency in dexmedetomidine group were obviously higher than those in control group (P&#x0003c;0.01). The cognitive function and attention network function of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease have a certain degree of damage, and the preoperative administration of dexmedetomidine can effectively improve the patient's cognitive dysfunction and attention network function after operation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dexmedetomidine</kwd><kwd>ischemic cerebrovascular disease</kwd><kwd>cognitive dysfunction</kwd><kwd>attention network function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ischemic cerebrovascular disease can lead to hemiplegia or even death. According to epidemiological data, ischemic cerebrovascular disease ranks third in the diseases causing the death of the elderly, seriously affecting the life quality and life health of patients (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Clinically, the ischemic cerebrovascular disease is often treated with surgery supplemented with drug therapy, and a large number of studies have shown that patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease will suffer from vascular cognitive dysfunction; reducing the thrombosis via early diagnosis can effectively prevent the occurrence of vascular cognitive dysfunction (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Stenting can be effective in the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, which is widely used in clinic due to its definite efficacy and small trauma (<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Stenting for patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease may lower the risk of vascular cognitive dysfunction of patients. However, El Hammi <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) found that the cognitive function of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease treated with stenting still has a certain degree of cognitive dysfunction and damage to attention network function compared with normal people. Li and Liu (<xref rid="b8-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) found through detecting the levels of serum S100B, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neotrophic factor (BDNF) that dexmedetomidine provides significant improvement on the recovery of cognitive function of patients receiving epilepsy foci resection, and S100B, NGF and BDNF are highly sensitive and can accurately predict the patient's brain damage. The effects of dexmedetomidine on recovery of cognitive function and attention network function of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease have not been studied. Therefore, in this study, the cognitive function and attention network function of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease after operation were studied, expecting to clarify the effects of dexmedetomidine on the cognitive dysfunction and attention network function of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and to provide a theoretical basis and related guidance for the recovery of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Patients of the study</title><p>The samples in this study were from patients diagnosed as ischemic cerebrovascular disease by deputy director and above in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital from March 2015 to September 2016. Inclusion criteria: 1) patients diagnosed as ischemic cerebrovascular disease via head CT or MRI; 2) patients without obvious hemiplegia, with normal language skills; 3) patients who could complete the cognitive and attention network function tests; 4) patients who agreed to receive stenting, signed the informed consent and were willing to participate in this experimental study. Fifty-eight patients meeting inclusion criteria were selected, and they were aged 48&#x02013;73 years, including 31 males and 27 females. Other wasting diseases were excluded from patients enrolled, and the clinical and pathological data and complete treatment program of the above patients in the treatment process were retained. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental grouping</title><p>The above patients selected were randomly divided into control group (n=29) and dexmedetomidine group (n=29). The dexmedetomidine group was treated with intravenous administration of 1 &#x000b5;g/kg dexmedetomidine using a micro-injection pump before induced anesthesia, while the control group was given the same dose of normal saline. Other operative procedures and treatment regimens were the same, and the normal volunteers at the same age were selected in the same period as the normal group; the cognitive function and attention network function of patients were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of serum S100B and NGF levels via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title><p>The peripheral venous blood was drawn at 3, 7 and 30 days after operation, and 2 ml blood was collected after separation of serum to detect the levels of serum S100B and NGF strictly according to the S100B and NGF ELISA kit (Boster Biological Technology Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China). The remaining serum was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum BDNF level</title><p>Serum specimens stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C and collected from each group of patients were thawed and the total protein was extracted after addition of RIPA lysate (1:1; Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), the protein content of each group was detected using the BCA protein quantification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the same concentration of loading sample was prepared, followed by preparation of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide separation gel and spacer gel and electrophoresis separation. Then the protein was transferred onto the PVD membrane and sealed in 5% skimmed milk powder for 1 h. The target bands were cut and incubated with BDNF and GAPDH antibodies (diluted at 1:1,000; cat. nos. SAB1405514 and SAB1405848; Sigma) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. The bands were washed with Tris-buffered saline Tween (TBST) 3 times (10 min each time), and the rabbit anti-mouse secondary polyclonal antibody (diluted at 1:5,000; cat. no. SAB3701038; Sigma) were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After that, bands were washed with TBST again 3 times (10 min each time). The DAB coloring solution was added in the dark room for development and fixation, and the gray value of band was analyzed using the gel imaging system. The BDNF/GAPDH ratio indicated the expression level of BDNF protein in serum.</p></sec><sec><title>Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA)</title><p>The cognitive function was evaluated via MoCA in an independent and quiet environment, including visual space and executive function: 1 point, the patients can describe the profile of clock, record the number order and position, and identify the distinction between the hour hand and the minute hand; 0 point, the patients cannot identify as above. Attention score: 1 point, the patient can repeat a series of figures said by the experimental staff; 0 point, the patient cannot repeat; 1 point, the patients can quickly find the difference of figures between the first and second time; 0 point, the patients cannot recognize that. Continuous subtraction (100 minus 6) is performed for a total of 5 times; 3 points, one error or normal; 2 points, 2 or 3 errors; 1 point, 4 errors; 0 point, all errors.

Researchers proposed the attention network theory by analyzing a large number of research results of cognitive psychology and brain function imaging, and evaluated the network function with the targeted network efficiency and control network efficiency (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Cognitive function evaluation and attention network function evaluation are applied in the research on patients with stroke, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="b12-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The mechanism of cognitive dysfunction and attention network damage in patients with cerebrovascular disease is not clear, and some studies have reported that the possible mechanism may be the vascular inflammation, cerebrovascular injury, environmental factors and genetic factors (<xref rid="b15-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In recent years, clinicians and researchers have paid increased attention to the cognitive dysfunction and attention network deletion in patients with central nervous system diseases, which is helpful to recover the patients' cognitive function and attention network function.</p><p>In this study, the cognitive function and attention network function of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease after stenting were evaluated using the classical MoCA and ANT. The results showed that patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease will suffer from severe cognitive dysfunction and attention network damage after operation. Yang and Rosenberg (<xref rid="b17-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) found that the cognitive dysfunction and attention network function damage will be recovered in patients with carotid atherosclerosis after stenting, but it was found in this study that the cognitive function and attention network function of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease still have obvious abnormality compared with normal people even after stenting.</p><p>In this study, patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease received intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine before treatment, and the surgical process and treatment protocol were the same as those of the control group. After operation, the serum S100B, NGF and BDNF expression levels in patients were detected, and the cognitive function and attention network function were evaluated. The results showed that the levels of serum S100B, NGF and BDNF in dexmedetomidine group were significantly higher than those in control group, and the cognitive function and attention network function were also significantly superior to those in control group. The above results indicated that dexmedetomidine has a significant protective effect on patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and contributes to the recovery of cognitive function and attention network function of patients with of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, the cognitive function and attention network function are closely related to the brain tissue structure and brain blood flow distribution; if the brain tissues are in an ischemia and hypoxia state for a long time, there will be severe cognitive dysfunction and attention network function damage (<xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly-selective excitatory center and peripheral &#x003b1;2 receptor drug, which can make the blood pressure change stable under the stimulation and the blood flow more stable. Substantial research evidence reveals that dexmedetomidine has a significant protective effect on brain, which can significantly reduce the coma time and promote the postoperative cognitive function recovery of patients with brain injury (<xref rid="b20-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Dexmedetomidine can contract the vessels and produce sedative and analgesic effects. The latest research data show that dexmedetomidine can affect the expression levels of inflammatory factors and reduce the inflammatory response in blood vessels through activating the corresponding signal pathway (<xref rid="b21-etm-0-0-5806" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In this study, the protective effect of dexmedetomidine on cerebral blood vessels may be also manifested as reducing the level of inflammatory factors in cerebral blood vessels, reducing the level of inflammation in brain tissues of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and reducing the damage of inflammation to the brain tissues, thus improving the cognitive function and attention network function.</p><p>In conclusion, patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease will suffer from obvious cognitive dysfunction and attention network function damage after stenting, and the preoperative administration of dexmedetomidine can effectively protect the cerebral blood vessels, improve the cognitive dysfunction and attention network function damage, and increase the postoperative life quality of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>No funding was received.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the present study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JZ was mainly responsible for the study design and manuscript writing.
