Promoting optimal self-management, including the use of asthma action plans, along with regular health professional review has been shown to be an effective strategy and is recommended in asthma guidelines internationally. Despite evidence of benefit, guided self-management remains underused, however the potential for online resources to promote self-management behaviors is gaining increasing recognition. The aim of this paper is to describe the protocol for a pilot evaluation of a website &#x02018;Living well with asthma&#x02019; which has been developed with the aim of promoting self-management behaviors shown to improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a parallel randomized controlled trial, where adults with asthma are randomly assigned to either access to the website for 12&#x000a0;weeks, or usual asthma care for 12&#x000a0;weeks (followed by access to the website if desired). Individuals are included if they are over 16-years-old, have a diagnosis of asthma with an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score of greater than, or equal to 1, and have access to the internet. Primary outcomes for this evaluation include recruitment and retention rates, changes at 12&#x000a0;weeks from baseline for both ACQ and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores, and quantitative data describing website usage (number of times logged on, length of time logged on, number of times individual pages looked at, and for how long). Secondary outcomes include clinical outcomes (medication use, health services use, lung function) and patient reported outcomes (including adherence, patient activation measures, and health status).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Piloting of complex interventions is considered best practice and will maximise the potential of any future large-scale randomized controlled trial to successfully recruit and be able to report on necessary outcomes.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The financial costs associated with asthma care continue to increase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], while care remains suboptimal - patients continue to overestimate their asthma control, tolerating more symptoms and greater limitations than necessary
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Promoting self-management, including the use of asthma action plans, along with regular health professional review has been shown to be an effective strategy leading to improved outcomes including improved quality of life, lower rates of healthcare contacts, and fewer days off work and school, and is a recommendation in worldwide asthma guidelines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Self-management support aims to improve outcomes in a number of ways: better recognition of deterioration of symptoms, more appropriate responses to exacerbations, and optimizing adherence to medication
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Improving adherence to inhaled corticosteroids is crucial to avoid exacerbations, improve day to day control, and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Adherence to treatments in many chronic illnesses is low and asthma is no exception
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Research into non-adherence suggests several rationales, but in common with other chronic conditions recurring themes relate to doubts about the need for the medications in the first place, and concerns about potential side-effects of treatments
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Despite evidence of benefits, guided self-management remains underused
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Online interactive tools to support asthma self-management in general have been trialed out with the UK and there is increasing evidence that they may be safe and effective, enabling patients to take a more proactive role, improving asthma quality of life scores and symptoms (and in some cases forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second (FEV<sub>1</sub>))
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and potentially demonstrating cost-effectiveness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This suggests that making effective use of available technologies may have the potential to increase uptake of self-management behaviors in those with asthma, without additional cost. How best to achieve this is still not clear
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><sec><title>&#x02018;Living well with asthma&#x02019; resource development</title><p>We developed an online resource &#x02018;Living well with asthma&#x02019; which aims to promote optimal self-management behaviors known to lead to improved outcomes. Exploratory focus group discussions with adults with asthma and primary care nurses clarified the key features deemed most important in a website. These data, along with a preceding literature review
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], informed the initial development of a prototype of the website. The actual content of the pages within the website was developed and refined iteratively with input from adults with asthma, practice nurses, general practitioners, a sociologist, human computer interactions researchers, respiratory physicians, and a health psychologist. Further refinement of the content was undertaken using &#x02018;Think aloud&#x02019; studies with adults with asthma. These were undertaken by DM, and participants fed back in real time their views on the contents and usability. Initially this was on paper mock-ups of proposed web pages, and latterly on actual &#x02018;Living well with asthma&#x02019; webpages. &#x02018;Think aloud&#x02019; studies are a recognized method of gaining information about users&#x02019; views in real time as they navigate around a website, providing information about usability and feeding into further development and refinement of the website
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The &#x02018;Living well with asthma&#x02019; website was developed as a standalone resource which should complement face-to-face asthma reviews, but does not require health professional involvement.</p><p>A full description of the website development will be available in a forthcoming publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for the evaluation methods</title><p>Guidance for the development of complex interventions recommends pilot and feasibility studies prior to formal evaluations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A pilot study is a version of the main study that is run in miniature to test whether the components of the main study can all work together
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], whereas a feasibility study is used to estimate important parameters that are needed to design the main study, such as ease of recruitment, standard deviations of outcome measures, and follow-up rates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This study aims to address both issues. Feasibility and piloting are essential to ensure that planned progression to a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) is appropriate in the first place and if it can be undertaken with appropriate power to achieve definitive results. This early evaluation must be broad enough to provide information both about how a full-scale RCT may work in practice but should also have consideration for how the resource may be used beyond the evaluation. Feasibility is investigated through measuring recruitment and retention rates and collecting usability data about the website itself. Measuring clinical outcomes will allow for the collection of important data on the efficacy of the intervention and for the estimation of effect sizes in any future larger RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Study aims</title><p>This study aims firstly to assess the feasibility of conducting a RCT of the clinical effectiveness of an online asthma resource aimed at promoting adherence in adults with poorly controlled asthma, using the &#x02018;Living well with asthma&#x02019; resource. Secondly, as a pilot study the aim is to provide estimates of recruitment and retention rates, as well as estimates of the variability of clinical and behavioral outcome measures to inform power calculations for a definitive trial. The study will collect a range of information about the way the intervention was used, including but not limited to: the most and least visited pages, the length of time the intervention was accessed, and how often it was accessed. Finally, this pilot and feasibility study also aims to identify any potential problems to be addressed, and allow for further development of the resource, before a further evaluation.</p><p>We hypothesize that this intervention, which has been designed with end user involvement and aims to improve adherence to therapy using multiple strategies (educational information, attitudinal arguments, self-monitoring, and reminders), will result in improved symptom control and quality of life measures in adults with asthma.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Ethical approval and trial registration</title><p>Ethical approval for this study was granted by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (ref 13/WOS/004) in March 2013.

For example, if we invite 100 participants to recruit 50, the recruitment rate would be estimated with a confidence interval of&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10%. Patient characteristics and outcomes will be summarized at baseline, at follow-up, and as changes over baseline.
