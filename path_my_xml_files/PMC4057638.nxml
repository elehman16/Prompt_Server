Current estimates show that between 45 and 96&#x000a0;% of children with ASD demonstrate these sensory difficulties (Ben-Sasson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; Lane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>) and sensory features (i.e.: hyper- or hypo reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in the sensory aspects of the environment) are now included as one of four possible manifestations of &#x02018;Restricted, Repetitive Patterns of Behavior, Interests, or Activities&#x02019; (American Psychiatric Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). Families report that behaviors associated with difficulty processing and integrating sensory information create social isolation for them and their child, restrict participation in daily living activities (Schaaf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2011</xref>) and impact social engagement (Hilton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; Baker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>; Ashburner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Reynolds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2011</xref>; Watson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2011</xref>; Hochhauser and Engel-Yeger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>). Consequently, interventions to address problems associated with difficulty processing sensory information, such as occupational therapy using sensory integration (OT/SI), (Ayres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1989</xref>) are among the most often requested services by parents of children with ASD (Mandell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>; Green et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>; Goin-Kochel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>). There is emerging evidence regarding positive outcomes of OT/SI for children with ASD (Pfeiffer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2011</xref>; Fazlioglu and Baran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; and see Schaaf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref> for a review), however, methodological limitations preclude definitive conclusions. Hence, there is the need for a rigorous study of OT/SI that includes a manualized protocol and measurement of treatment adherence (Case-Smith and Arbesman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2008</xref>; Watling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2011</xref>). Fortunately, a validated measure of treatment fidelity that describes the key principles of the sensory integrative approach and provides guidelines for best practice is now available (Parham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>; May-Benson et al., in press). Importantly, this measure provides a means to evaluate the fidelity of OT/SI in a clinical trial while assuring internal and external validity; a standard that is followed in the current study.</p><p>A second advancement that enhances the testing of this intervention is data showing that Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a useful outcome measure for studies of interventions for ASD (Ruble et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). GAS is used to measure functional and meaningful aspects of an individual&#x02019;s progress (Mailloux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>; Kiresuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1994</xref>). In autism, inherent heterogeneity often confounds findings, and thus, it is important to utilize outcome measures that are sensitive to individual outcomes. GAS has been shown to be a substantive and sensitive approach to evaluate progress on individualized goals in randomized controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for children with autism provided that specific quality indicators are present. These include that goals are independently rated, evaluated for equivalence between groups (comparability), scaled with equidistance, have measurable criteria, and clear, identifiable benchmarks (Ruble et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>), recommendations that we followed in this study. A further strength of using GAS is that it provides a means to identify and measure outcomes that are parent-chosen and thus, meaningful to family. Given the increased emphasis on measurement of outcomes that are meaningful to the client or family (PCORI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pcori.org">http://www.pcori.org</ext-link>), the use of GAS provides a model for best practice.</p><p>Given the need for a rigorous randomized trial of OT/SI for individuals with ASD, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of OT/SI following a manualized protocol on individual goal attainment (primary outcome) in comparison to usual care (UC). The secondary purpose was to evaluate the impact of this approach on the child&#x02019;s sensory behaviors, adaptive behaviors and functional skills.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-two children participated in this study. A convenience sample of eligible families was recruited from the children&#x02019;s hospital where the study took place and the surrounding community. Families were eligible to participate if their child: (1) was between the ages of 4.0 and 7.11 at the time of enrollment, (2) had a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder from a licensed psychologist based on the results of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) (Lord et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1994</xref>) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) (Lord et al. 1999), (3) had a non-verbal cognitive level of &#x0003e;65 (this IQ cut score is based on findings from an earlier study where we assessed the feasibility of conducting this intervention with children with ASD&#x02014;Schaaf Benevides et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>); (4) demonstrated difficulty processing and integrating sensory information as measured by the Sensory Profile (SP&#x02014;Dunn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999</xref>; 3 or more subscales or total test score in the definite difference range) or the Sensory Integration and Praxis Test (SIPT- Ayres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1989</xref>; score of&#x0003c;&#x02212;1.0 on 3 or more subtests); and (5) parents were willing to attend 3&#x000a0;weekly sessions for the duration of the 10-week study period and to refrain from initiation of any new treatments including medications during the study period.</p><p>Child characteristics are also shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> below for the treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17) and UC control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15). In keeping with current gender prevalence estimates of ASD (CDC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>), the majority of the participants in both groups were boys (Treatment: 14 males, 3 females; UC: 12 males, 3 females) and Caucasian (treatment: 16 White, 1 not-reported; UC: 13 White, 2 Asian). Highest parent-reported level of education in both groups was similar, with 11 (65&#x000a0;%) parents in the treatment group reporting a 4-year college degree or higher, and nine (60&#x000a0;%) parents in the UC group reporting a 4-year degree or higher. Age, autism severity, cognitive level, and non-study related services were similar between the two groups. Non-project services, or &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; (UC) received during the study period was similar between the groups and documented by parents logging their child&#x02019;s weekly services in hours per week.

The study was approved by the first author&#x02019;s research ethics committee. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides an overview of the recruitment, enrollment, randomization and retention flow. Following phone screening for eligibility with interested parents, child participants were scheduled for confirmation of autism diagnosis using the ADOS and the ADI-R and, for children who did not have a current cognitive assessment (within the past 12&#x000a0;months) confirmation of cognitive level was also completed by the psychologist on the hospital&#x02019;s autism diagnostic team. If the child met inclusion criteria, parental consent, child assent, and permission to videotape treatment sessions was obtained following the approved procedures. Next, independent evaluators, trained in the administration of the assessments, conducted the pre-intervention assessments. These blinded evaluators (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2) were highly experienced therapists who had been licensed to practice occupational therapy for a mean of 28&#x000a0;years (range 26&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years), and who had experience with working with children with ASD (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;19&#x000a0;years, range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16&#x02013;22&#x000a0;years). These evaluators also were trained and certified in the use of the SIPT for an average of 12.5&#x000a0;years (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Participant recruitment, enrollment, randomization and retention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10803_2013_1983_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Following the completion of the initial assessments, the independent evaluators analyzed the assessment data (assessments are listed below) and met with the parents to identify five goals that would be addressed during the study period. These goals were scaled according to GAS Methodology (Kiresuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1994</xref>). To maintain a level of objectivity, parents did not view the goal attainment scales upon their completion or during the study period. Independent evaluators remained blind to child allocation during the study period and post-testing phases, and completed the post-intervention assessments using the same assessment battery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization, Allocation Concealment and Implementation</title><p>Once goals were identified and scaled, children were randomly assigned using random number generations provided by the study statistician to either the treatment or UC control group using random permuted blocks within four strata<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> based on cognitive level (hereafter referred to as IQ) and autism severity score (high IQ/high severity, low IQ/low severity, high IQ/low severity, low IQ/high severity). A high IQ was classified as a score of 85 or higher and low IQ was classified as below 84. Autism severity was determined with the ADOS using procedures to calculate severity scores described by Gotham et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>), in which a lower severity score indicates less severity of autism features. A severity score of 6&#x02013;10 was scored as &#x0201c;high severity;&#x0201d; a score of 4&#x02013;5 as &#x0201c;low severity.&#x0201d; In total, eight children were randomized in the low IQ/high severity strata, one child randomized in the low IQ/low severity strata, 22 randomized in the high IQ/high severity strata, and one randomized in the high IQ/low severity strata. The randomization sequence and opaque envelopes with randomization allocation group (treatment or UC) were generated by the Division of Biostatistics and remained concealed until the child&#x02019;s strata was determined using the criteria outlined above. Children were randomized by the second author or principal investigator in order of completion of pre-test assessment and goal scaling.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>); Mailloux and Smith Roley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>); Schaaf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">(2012)</xref>; and Schaaf and Nightlinger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2007</xref>). The reader is referred to these sources for an in-depth description. The manualization of the intervention and examination of the treatment manual&#x02019;s adherence to fidelity was conducted in a feasibility study prior to this trial, and results are described elsewhere (Schaaf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>). Importantly, following the Data Driven Decision Making Process (Schaaf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2011</xref>; Schaaf and Blanche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2012</xref>) outlined in the intervention manual, assessment data were used to develop hypotheses about the sensory motor factors affecting the child&#x02019;s functional behaviors and individually-tailored sensory motor activities were developed to address these factors. For example, if assessment data showed that the goal of &#x0201c;participate in a play activity with a peer for 10&#x000a0;min&#x0201d; may be related to poor tactile processing and praxis (hypothesis), individually- tailored sensory motor activities were designed to address tactile discrimination and improve praxis. Individually-tailored treatment activities might include activities such as using a carpeted scooter board while in the prone position to pull oneself up a ramp, then working to turn the scooter board around to ride down the ramp and land in a cushioned area of mats and pillows that are covered with various textures. In this activity, the child is experiencing total body tactile and proprioceptive sensations (from scooter board texture, actively moving muscles against resistance, and landing in textured mats and pillows) to increase body awareness and using this enhanced sensory input to plan body movements during the scooter board activity. Of note, the intervention is contextualized in play with active involvement of the child and conducted in a large gym equipped with mats, a variety of suspended swings, large balls, a climbing wall, carpeted barrels, large inner tubes and foam blocks with opportunities for active, guided, sensory motor play. The therapist facilitates the child&#x02019;s ability to participate in the sensory-motor experiences in adaptive ways (e.g.: use a trapeze swing to experience proprioceptive and vestibular sensations to increase body awareness and then organize the body to hold onto the swing and jump into a large ball pit). It should be noted that this treatment is not designed to be a comprehensive treatment for autism, but rather part of a comprehensive program that includes educational, behavioral and medical services.</p><p>The intervention was delivered by three registered, licensed occupational therapists with extensive experience working with children with ASD (mean years of experience&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15, range 12&#x02013;20&#x000a0;years), with certification in sensory integration,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> and who were trained on the manualized intervention. In addition, the interventionists received 3-day training by the third author and weekly consultations with the first author to discuss challenges and questions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Fidelity</title><p>Fidelity checks were utilized in this study to accomplish two purposes: (1) to monitor and improve provider use of the intervention manual procedures while minimizing drift in provision of services, and (2) ensure the external validity of the study procedures by documenting provider adherence to principles of intervention (Bellg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>). Treatment fidelity was confirmed using the Fidelity Measure discussed above (Parham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>). This measure has strong inter-rater reliability (0.99 for total score), with individual item inter-rater reliability ranging from 0.94 to 0.99. Validity for the measure is also strong as raters were accurately able to distinguish the manualized intervention sessions from other intervention approaches with 92&#x000a0;% accuracy. A score above 80/100 is considered acceptable fidelity and distinguishes this intervention from others (Parham, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>). In this study, all treatment sessions were videotaped and a random selection of 10&#x000a0;% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;51) were evaluated and rated. The mean fidelity score was 90.1 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9, Range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;53&#x02013;100). Regarding the few sessions that did not reach a score of 80, additional training and consultation was provided to the therapists to support their adherence to the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Phenotypic Measures</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Autism Diagnosis</title><p>Autism diagnosis was confirmed by non-study psychologists in the autism clinic at treatment site using the ADI-R (Lord et al. 1994) and the ADOS-G (Lord et al. 1999). The ADI-R is a semi-structured parent interview used to diagnose children with autism spectrum disorders and, in conjunction with the ADOS, is considered to be a gold-standard assessment for the diagnosis of ASD. The ADI-R has established validity and reliability with trained administrators (Lecavalier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>; Lord et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1994</xref>).

The SIPT is the gold standard for assessing sensory integration and praxis, and is standardized on nearly 2,000 children 4&#x02013;8&#x000a0;years 11&#x000a0;months. This assessment produces standard scores for normative age groups on each of the 17 tests, was administered to all participants and findings were used to generate hypotheses about the sensory motor factors affecting the identified goals.</p><p>The Sensory Profile is a 125-item parent report of a child&#x02019;s sensory behaviors using a Likert-scale format to quantify the frequency of occurrence of behaviors. The Sensory Profile is appropriate for children ages 3&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years, and was standardized on over 1,200 children with and without disabilities. Content and construct validity has been established. Responses are summarized in six sensory processing domains of Auditory Processing, Visual Processing, Vestibular Processing, Touch Processing, Multisensory Processing, Oral Sensory Processing, five modulation areas, and three domains describing a child&#x02019;s emotional and behavioral responses to sensation. The Sensory Profile was administered to all participants to characterize their sensory reactivity (i.e.: over/under responsiveness, seeking or avoidance) in the areas listed above and findings were used to generate hypotheses about sensory factors affecting identified goals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Primary Outcome Measure: Goal Attainment Scaling</title><p>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) provides a standardized means to capture the diversity of meaningful, functional outcomes (Kiresuk and Sherman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1968</xref>). It provides a systematic process for identification of goals that are specifically relevant to individuals and their families and has been shown to be a promising outcome measure in ASD (Ruble et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). GAS has been used extensively for outcome measurement (Ruble et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2010</xref>; Pfeiffer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2011</xref>; Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>; Mailloux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>) and is shown to be a valid and reliable method for measurement of progress on individualized goals for children with ASD (Ruble et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>; Palisano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1992</xref>). For example, Ruble et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>) report good reliability when objectives are clearly measurable finding average intra class correlation between 2 study samples of 0.98 (CI 0.74&#x02013;0.99) for measurability, 0.96 (CI 0.74&#x02013;0.99) for equi-distance, and 0.77 (CI 0.65&#x02013;0.99) for difficulty. In a study of 65 infants ages, 3&#x02013;30&#x000a0;months, Palisano et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1992</xref>) found that GAS is valid as a responsive measure of motor change for infants with motor delays as &#x0201c;neither type or category of goals influenced the therapists&#x02019; ability to select outcomes that the infants were capable of achieving&#x0201d; within the 6&#x000a0;month intervention period (p 335). Ruble et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>) concludes that GAS is a &#x0201c;promising ideographic approach for measuring intervention effectiveness&#x0201d; (p 1983). These authors recommend using a GAS template to assure goals are standardized and systematic to create reliable and valid goals, and to conduct technical checks that assess the qualities of the goal scaling to assure methodological soundness, strategies that we utilized in the current study. A technical check was completed by the second author on each GAS to assure that it met all quality markers using a technical checklist that included items based on GAS literature such as &#x0201c;The desired behavior/skills is observable and measurable with criteria of frequency and duration; the projected level of performance is based on the child&#x02019;s current level and scaled with intervals that represent equidistance.&#x0201d; A mathematical method is used to calculate a T-score that represents the extent to which the goals are met (Ottenbacher and Cusick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1990</xref>) and thus, although the goals are different for each participant, the score is standardized.</p><p>Goals for each child were identified by the independent evaluators using a standard series of questions with the parent and then scaled with equally spaced probability intervals according to the procedures recommended by Kiresuk et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1994</xref>); Ruble et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>); and Mailloux et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>). To scale each goal, the independent evaluator describes the child&#x02019;s current level of functioning for the specific goal and then scales it for expected level of attainment over the 10&#x000a0;week period (improvement) and down (regression). The probability distance between the levels of the scale is equal and equally distributed around the predicted level of performance. A score of &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; is used for expected level of attainment during the 10-week period, with scores of &#x02212;1 and &#x02212;2 denoting less and much less than expected level of attainment respectively; while +1 and +2 denote better and much better level of attainment than expected. Following the intervention period, the independent evaluators who were blind to group assignment conducted a standardized interview with the parents and asked parents to rate their child&#x02019;s goals.

The current study is one of the first randomized trials to meet this level of rigor (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Group differences on change scores of pervasive developmental disorders behavioral inventory</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" colspan="3">Control</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Experimental</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Significance</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Effect size<sup>a</sup>

<sup>a</sup>Mean and standard deviations are based on raw scores. Effect size is presented using the difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The primary outcome for this study was the score obtained on GAS and we found that the children receiving the treatment scored significantly higher (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003) than the controls on goal attainment with an effect size of 1.2. Our finding is consistent with Pfeiffer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2011</xref>) who found that children with ASD who participated in 6-week program of occupational therapy using sensory integration made significantly greater gains in their individualized goal attainment scale scores in comparison to those who received a fine motor intervention. Goal attainment scaling is a method to individualize and quantify goals for clinical populations. It has been used extensively in the clinical literature, and is recommended as an outcome measure in randomized control trials of psychosocial interventions in ASD (Ruble et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>) such as the current study. Of note, the procedures we utilized in constructing scaled goals were consistent with the recently published recommendations of for its use (Ruble et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>) including that: benchmarks were carefully constructed, goals were scaled at equal intervals, and rating of goals post intervention was based on parent interview by an independent evaluator blind to study condition. Although adherence to these conditions increases the reliability and validity of GAS (Ruble, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>) our findings must be interpreted with caution given that the parents were not blind to the intervention.</p><p>Two valuable aspects of GAS are that it provided a means to individualize goals based on each child&#x02019;s individual needs <italic>and</italic> to identify areas that are important to the parents. Individualization is an important aspect of treatment given the heterogeneity and developmental nature of ASD as it is likely that each child has a unique set of pre-treatment characteristics that impact the choice of goals and outcomes (Stahmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2011</xref>). Further, utilization of goals that are important and meaningful to the parents assures that the primary stakeholders (families of children with ASD) needs are being addressed. This is an important aspect of any intervention and is in keeping with contemporary trends in intervention research (PCORI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2013</xref>; Melnyk and Morrison-Beedy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>). For the current study, individual goals were based on parent-identified areas of need and assessment data that were established prior to treatment allocation. Many of the goals for the treatment and UC controls were similar in type as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The most frequent goals were related to self-care including goals such as greater independence in dressing, feeding, toileting or grooming activities (treatment&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;27, UC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;25). The second and third most frequent goals were about play (treatment&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16, UC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15); and sitting for participation in activities such as synagogue or dinner (OT/SI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12, UC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9). There were some minor differences in goal type between the groups; the treatment group had more goals related to fine motor skills (OT/SI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5, UC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) and participation in daily routines (treatment&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7, UC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1); whereas the usual care group had more goals related to emotional regulation (treatment&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3, UC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), sleep (treatment&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1, UC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) and inappropriate touching (treatment&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0, UC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4).</p><p>A second aspect of individualization that is important for ASD research and practice is that intervention strategies were tailored to each child&#x02019;s assessed areas of need. In this study, the Data Driven Decision Making Process (Schaaf, in press; Schaaf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2012</xref>; Schaaf and Benevides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2011</xref>; Schaaf and Blanche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2012</xref>) was used to individually tailor treatment activities to address the specific sensory-motor factors that were hypothesized to be affecting each participant&#x02019;s goal attainment and functional skills. The treatment utilizes individually tailored sensory motor activities at the just right challenge with a playful approach to facilitate the child&#x02019;s adaptation to promote function. Thus, the focus of treatment is on each individual&#x02019;s sensory motor factors hypothesized to be impacting function, but importantly, the expected outcomes are functional behaviors. It is likely that this individualization was an important aspect of the positive findings of this study, and should be modeled in future studies.</p><p>In terms of functional behaviors, the children in the treatment group significantly decreased their need for caregiver assistance on self-care and social activities in comparison to the UC controls on the PEDI. In addition, they also showed a trend toward improvement in self-care and social skills. Thus, not only did the caregivers rate the children in the treatment group as needing less assistance from them in these activities, they also rated their skill level higher. These secondary outcome data should be interpreted with caution given that we completed multiple comparisons, however, these findings are consistent with the philosophy of the treatment approach&#x02014;that adequate processing and integration of sensory information provides an important foundation for participation in functional, meaningful activities (Ayres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>). Of note, the PEDI has been shown to have good reliability and validity as an outcome measure of functional behaviors (Nichols and Case-Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1996</xref>).</p><p>In terms of the sensory-motor factors that may underlie these findings, in this cohort many participants in both groups showed deficits in sensory modulation and praxis (measured via the Sensory Profile and the SIPT), and thus, the intervention was tailored to address these areas. Improvements in sensory modulation and praxis skills therefore, may underlie the gains seen in self-care and social skills. In regard to sensory modulation (over or under-reactivity to typical levels of sensation), the individually-tailored treatment for these children included a focus on activities that facilitated sensory modulation and regulation of behavioral responses to these sensory experiences. As the child&#x02019;s ability to modulate sensation improved, it is likely that their behavioral regulation also improved and subsequently they were better able to participate in self-care and social activities. Interestingly, the subjects in the treatment group did show a decreasing trend of negative sensory behaviors on the Sensory Perceptual Behaviors Subscale of the PDDBI and this approached significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.064), supporting this interpretation.</p><p>Similarly, it is possible that the intervention also had an impact on praxis. Praxis involves the ability to conceive of, plan, and organize goal-directed motor actions (Ayres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1989</xref>; Dziuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>) and is related to adequate processing and integration of body sensory information (tactile, vestibular and proprioception). The intervention aimed to facilitate body awareness and praxis through individually-tailored, active, sensory-motor activities rich in tactile, proprioceptive and vestibular sensations. Many self-care activities such as dressing require adequate body awareness and thoughtful planning and execution of motor skills. Thus, it is possible that improved body awareness and praxis had a positive impact on ability to carry out these self-care tasks. Similarly, social interactions require constant processing of varied, often unpredictable sensations and the need for spontaneous responses (i.e.: praxis) and are likely affected by difficulty processing and integrating sensory information related to the body (Hilton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; Baker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>; Ashburner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Reynolds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2011</xref>; Watson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2011</xref>; Hochhauser and Engel-Yeger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>). Thus, as the children&#x02019;s praxis improved, it is plausible that their ability to adaptively plan and carry out social interaction activities also improved and they became more independent. Further testing of these potential relationship is needed and in order to validate the idea that improvements in sensory modulation and praxis were related to improvements in functional skills, it will be important in future studies to specifically measure any changes in in these factors and their relationship to changes in functional skills such as self-care and socialization. In this study we were limited by the lack of instruments validated to measure change in these factors for this population within our 10-week intervention period. The SIPT is not recommended as a pre-post-test measure for periods shorter than 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months (Ayres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1989</xref>) and its utility for shorter intervention periods has not been tested. Similarly, the Sensory Profile has not been validated for use as a pre-post assessment (Dunn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999</xref>) although there is emerging data that test&#x02013;retest reliability of certain sub-scores may be utilized in this way. Until these measures are validated for use as outcome measures in shorter intervention periods, or outcome measure to evaluate change in sensory functions are validated, future studies should consider a longer intervention period so that these assessments can be used to measure change in sensory-motor skills and determine their relationship to any changes in functional skills and adaptive behavior.</p><p>In terms of the proposed mechanism underlying the positive findings in this study, one explanation is that the intervention impacted neuroplasticity&#x02014;the ability of the nervous system to be shaped and influenced by experience. It is well regarded in the neuro-developmental literature that early sensory motor experiences promote neuroplasticity and enhance the capacity of the brain to adapt to environmental challenges (Shonkoff and Phillips <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2000</xref>; Ayres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1972</xref>; Dawson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>). Thus, it is possible that through the process of neuroplasticity that the children became more independent in their functional skills as their ability to process and integrate sensory information improved. Further testing of this assumption is needed using methods that evaluate nervous system activity pre and post intervention. There is some preliminary evidence that change in neural activities results from enriched environments. For example, Dawson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>) showed that more organized EEG activity occurred in children with ASD who also made gains in the Denver Early Start Program; and Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">(2007)</xref> showed that electrodermal activity, a measure of sympathetic nervous system activity, showed a trend to decrease (expected direction) following a sensory-enriched intervention in subjects who were previously sensory hyper-reactive. An important next step in this research will be to measure changes in brain activity that may be concurrent with improvements in adaptive behaviors and individual goals as suggested by Schaaf et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our data provide preliminary support for the efficacy of a manualized intervention designed to address difficulties processing and integrating sensory information for children with ASD. We show improvements in our primary outcome&#x02014;Goal Attainment as well as our secondary outcome measures showing improvements in self-care and social activities reflected by decreased caregiver assistance. These findings should be interpreted cautiously until they are replicated in a larger sample size. In addition, in future studies it would be useful to include additional outcome measures that rely on direct observation of goal attainment and sensory behaviors to provide further validation of GAS findings. It will be important to supplement parent reported data with direct observational measures. It will also be important to include a longer intervention period in future studies and follow-up testing to determine if the observed changes are maintained. Finally, although we randomized subjects based on autism severity and cognition, we were not able to include these strata in our analysis due to our sample size. Future studies would be strengthened by the inclusion of a larger sample so that impact of potentially confounding variables on treatment outcomes can be evaluated. Of note, almost all of our participants (30 of 32 children, or 94&#x000a0;%) demonstrated high severity of autism, and 22 or 68.75&#x000a0;% also had high IQ. It would be useful if future studies utilizing this intervention include children with low severity and/or low cognition to determine if the findings from this study are replicated with this sample. Similarly, our sample of convenience resulted in a sample with little ethnic diversity and future studies should make an effort to include participants from more diverse backgrounds. Despite these limitations, this study provides evidence that this intervention may be a useful adjunct to a comprehensive intervention program for individuals with ASD who have functional and behavioral challenges related to difficulty processing and integrating of sensory information.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>Although we randomized based on these strata, we did not complete subgroup analyses based on strata due to small sample size.</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p>Certification in sensory integration requires participation in 120&#x000a0;h of post-graduate course work offered and 40 hours of practice under the guidance of an experienced clinician trained in sensory integration (Parham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="Fn3"><label>3</label><p>One child was tested with the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This Grant was funded by an Autism Speaks Foundation Treatment Grant (#3797).
