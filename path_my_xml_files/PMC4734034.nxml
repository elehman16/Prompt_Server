According to the <italic>First National Health and Nutrition Survey</italic> (1999&#x02013;2000) in Palestine, the overall prevalence of overweight was 62.4%, and 24.4% of whom are obese (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Specifically in the Gaza Strip, 57.0, 66.8, and 67.5% indicated the prevalence of being overweight including obese in urban areas, refugee camps, and rural areas, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Obesity is a risk factor for developing different diseases including metabolic diseases (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and diabetes (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The hypothesized physiological mechanism is the state of chronic low-grade inflammation that is associated with excess adipose tissue (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The link between obesity and inflammation has been derived from the finding that proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are overexpressed in obesity (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The high levels of cytokines generally and IL-6 particularly are associated with decreased nitric oxide and increased reactive oxygen species, which lead to endothelial and microvascular dysfunction (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Accordingly, increased serum level of IL-6 stimulates the liver to synthesize and secrete the systemic inflammatory marker C reactive protein (CRP) (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the antioxidant defense factors become lower due to accumulation of fat in adipose tissues and the associated production of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Because of that, nutritional intervention has been recognized as a possible method to restore the antioxidant levels and to treat the inflammatory status and metabolic dysregulation in diabetic or cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Micronutrients such as vitamins and trace elements are required at appropriate intakes for the immune system to function optimally (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Marine foods consumption is associated with reduced CVD risk (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), cerebrovascular disease (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), cancer (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), depression (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and inflammation (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The effect of fish is believed to be mainly due to its component of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs) (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). They are represented in the most biologically important forms; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). EPA/DHA supplement has the potency to treat many diseases. LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs have several important biological effects on a range of cellular functions that may reduce the onset of heart diseases and reduce mortality among patients with coronary heart disease, possibly by stabilizing the heart's rhythm and by reducing blood clots (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). CVD, diabetes, and metabolic dysregulation have been linked strongly to inflammation (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the objective of the study reported here is to evaluate the effect of LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs on inflammatory markers (serum level of IL-6 and CRP) in hypertensive and/or diabetic obese adults. We also aimed to find out the change in metabolic markers; fasting blood glucose (FBG) and lipid profile factors, total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) after 8 weeks of LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs intervention.</p><sec id="S0002"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Study population</title><p>Eligible participants for this study were obese [body mass index, BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) &#x02265;30], hypertensive, and/or diabetic patients between 28 and 60 years of age who systemically visited the primary healthcare centers to follow up at three locations in Gaza City, Palestine. The diagnosis and selection of hypertensive and diabetic cases depended on patients&#x02019; self-reporting and proof of the patients&#x02019; medical history records obtained from the healthcare center. For instance, all of the diabetic patients were type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Participants were eligible if they had a high CRP level (high-sensitivity CRP [hs-CRP] &#x02265;6 mg/L; <italic>in titer test, CRP &#x0003c;6 mg/L appeared as negative</italic>). Patients were excluded if they had any acute illness within the past 2 weeks, regularly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors) and/or cholesterol-lowering agents (statins), suffered from systemic and inflammatory diseases that change physical or laboratory tests (arthritis, renal, thyroid, hepatic, respiratory, gout, active malignant disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding), and/or documented intolerability to LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs.</p><p>The recruitment of study participants began in November 2013 and was completed in May 2014. Of 484 screened patients, 108 were enrolled in the study and assigned randomly to one of the three groups: control or one of two experimental/intervention groups &#x02013; LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs treatment and vitamin C treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20002"><title>Study design and intervention</title><p>The clinical trial was randomized, open-labelled, controlled, and parallel, and performed in compliance with the World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Korea, October 2008 (number: PHRC/HC/11/13, March 4, 2013). The trial was registered and approved by Universiti Putra Malaysia [Ref. No.: FPSK_Mac (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)04 (21 June 2013)]. It was conducted at the Ministry of Health primary health care centers in Gaza City, Palestine, and followed the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Public Health, Al-Quds University.</p><p>Recruited patients were randomly assigned to LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs treatment (experimental) group or control group using manual blocks formation based on the rolling of a dice. The allocation and randomization of randomized controlled trial (RCT) patients depended on a blocking system; 108 patients diseased with hypertension (HT) and/or T2DM were selected and arranged in ascending order. Then, restricted randomization for three groups (named as A, referred to vitamin C group; B, referred to LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs group; and C, referred to control group); the created blocks of sequences ensured equal numbers of allocated participants. For three groups, six blocks created as the following: 1) ABC, 2) ACB, 3) BAC, 4) BCA, 5) CAB, and 6) CBA. After that, rolling of dice got number 1; means block number 1, which is ABC, so, the first participant was allocated in group A, the second in group B, and the third in group C, and finally repeated rolling of dice took place to allocate all of RCT patients in the groups.</p><p>Patients in the experimental group of current study were assigned to treatment with 1.0 g fish oil from sardine and anchovy per day, whereas the control group was kept free from supplements. The fish oil containing LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs were supplied in softgel capsules (commercial formula) including 300 mg EPA and 200 mg DHA. The daily dose of fish oil was higher than Samimi et al. (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) who examined the effect of 1.0 g fish oil involving 180 mg EPA and 120 mg DHA per day for 6 weeks on hs-CRP in gestational DM through placebo RCT. We used a higher dose of EPA/DHA to achieve higher variance and to keep pace with longer intervention period.</p><p>Participants in both groups were advised to maintain constant daily lifestyle habits unless they progressed to any of the excluding criteria. Based on an adapted form of Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (v 2) (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the majority of participants indicated that they undertook a low level of physical activity (PA), whereas the remaining participants indicated they undertook a moderate level of PA. None of the participants said they undertook a high level of PA before or during the trial. The participants were approximately equally distributed in terms of smoking habit, which was evaluated by an adapted and modified form of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In terms of smoking status, each patient was categorized either as a smoker, ex-smoker, passive smoker, or non-smoker.</p><p>The intervention continued for 8 weeks, and the participants returned for follow-up visits every 2 weeks. At study baseline (randomization time), we performed anthropometric measurements (BMI, waist circumference [WC], as well as blood pressure [systolic and diastolic]) and blood sampling. We measured systemic inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and IL-6) and metabolic markers (FBG, TC, and TG).</p><p>Sample size was estimated as 32 per a group to detect a reduction in inflammatory and metabolic markers at a <italic>p</italic>-value 0.05 with a power of 90%, and a dropout rate of 10% was expected.

IL-6 was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich) via one-run reading.</p><p>Blood was collected by a trained nurse or physician of the health center. A 7-mL blood sample was drawn into a polyethylene evacuated tube and then divided into two separate tubes.

(<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and Shaikh et al. (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The disparities in the discussed results supported our results to be consistent with a part of results of the previous studies and inconsistent with the other parts for both inflammatory and metabolic markers. LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs changed the level of hs-CRP, FBG, and TG significantly. However, these reductions are insufficient to consider the LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs as a treating factor of inflammation or metabolic dysregulation. The clinical significance of TC was achieved because the intervention factor stabilized the level of TC in the experimental group at the time the control group got an increase after 8 weeks. Our results evidenced by TC significance suggested the role of LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs as a protective and prophylaxis factor in hypertensive and diabetic obese patients. The concluded affectivity of LC &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs may be attributed to the short time of study or the dose used. Further studies are needed with variation on the duration and dosage to obtain more explanation on the role of EPA and DHA in inflammatory and metabolic markers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors extend sincere thanks to the patients for their willingness to participate in this study.</p></ack><sec id="S0006"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MSE performed assembly of data and shared in the design of the study, statistical analysis, writing, and interpretation.
