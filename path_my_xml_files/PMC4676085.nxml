Until the publication of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</italic><italic>of Mental Disorders</italic> III revised edition (DSM-III-R), ADHD was considered to be applicable only to children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Long-term follow-up studies have revealed that ADHD persists during adulthood. In spite of remission, approximately 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% of childhood-onset ADHD persists into adolescence and adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Methylphenidate remains one of the most commonly prescribed medications for the treatment of ADHD in adults because of availability of efficacy and safety data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Results from previous studies have indicated long-term efficacy and a good tolerability profile for osmotic-release methylphenidate hydrochloride long-acting (OROS-MPH) in flexible dose range in management of ADHD in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Methylphenidate modified-release long-acting formulation (MPH-LA; Ritalin-LA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Novartis Pharma AG) is currently approved for the treatment of ADHD in children aged 6&#x000a0;years and above in several European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A 40-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre core study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MPH-LA in adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The study reported that MPH-LA was safe and effective in the treatment of ADHD in adults, in a dose range of 40&#x02013;80&#x000a0;mg/day, and this effect was maintained for at least 6&#x000a0;months. Statistically significant improvement in both DSM-IV ADHD Rating Scale (DSM-IV ADHD RS) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) was observed with MPH-LA treatment, and the safety profile was comparable to that of treatment in children.</p><p>Long-term safety and efficacy of MPH-LA in adults with ADHD is not yet reported. In order to address this, a 6-month, open-label, flexible-dose, multicentre extension study to the above described 40-week core study was conducted. Here we report the long-term (1&#x000a0;year; last phase of core study&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;extension study) efficacy and safety of MPH-LA in adults with ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The current study concentrates on the last phase of the core study (<italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase) and the succeeding extension phase conducted at 48 centres in six countries. The core study was conducted between 24 November 2010 and 7 August 2012, and the extension study was conducted between 12 April 2011 and 5 February 2013. The study protocol of the core and extension trials was designed in accordance with the guidelines on studies in ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Written informed consents were provided by all the enrolled patients. The study protocol and all the amendments were approved by the Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee (core: NCT01259492; extension: NCT01338818).

Briefly, this was a 6-month, multicentre, open-label extension of a 40-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled core study (NCT01259492) that comprised three phases: 9-week <italic>dose confirmation</italic> phase, 5-week open-label <italic>dose optimisation</italic> phase and 6<italic>-</italic>month <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The 6-month <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, withdrawal period to evaluate the maintenance effect of MPH-LA in adults with ADHD.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study design of the core and extension study (<bold>a</bold>) adapted from core study manuscript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. <italic>MPH-LA</italic> methylphenidate modified-release long-acting formulation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40263_2014_180_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Eligible patients entering the extension study (NCT01338818) were initiated on treatment with MPH-LA 20&#x000a0;mg and up-titrated to their optimal doses (dose at which there was an optimal balance between control of symptoms and adverse effects) of 40, 60 or 80&#x000a0;mg/day in increments of 20&#x000a0;mg/week for the first 3&#x000a0;weeks of the extension study (i.e. week 41&#x02013;43). This re-titration was necessary to accommodate patients who entered the extension study from the placebo arm of the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase of the core study. The investigator had the flexibility to readjust the doses as necessary (between weeks 44 and 66) as long as the dose remained in the range of MPH-LA 40&#x02013;80&#x000a0;mg/day (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Participants</title><p>The study population consisted of ADHD patients (18&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years) with confirmed childhood onset according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Inclusion criteria for the core study have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Adult ADHD patients entering the extension study had either completed the 6-month <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase of the core study or discontinued from the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase due to lack of therapeutic effect (defined as &#x02265;30&#x000a0;% worsening from the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase baseline and &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;% remaining improvement from the beginning of the core study, using DSM-IV ADHD RS).</p><p>A total of 298 patients entered the extension study and received treatment with MPH-LA (Ritalin LA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Novartis Pharma AG: a racemic mixture of d- and l-threomethylphenidate modified-release hard capsules). Of these, 156 patients were treatment responders (MPH-LA, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;132; placebo, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24) and 91 patients were treatment non-responders (MPH-LA, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;46; placebo, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;45) in the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase. Treatment non-responders were defined as patients who fulfilled both the lack of therapeutic effect criteria in the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase of the core study. Of the enrolled patients, 51 patients (MPH-LA, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;38; placebo, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) had discontinued in the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase of the core study prior to the implementation of an amendment to the inclusion criteria for the extension study protocol (treatment non-responders were required to fulfil both the lack of therapeutic effect criteria). These 51 patients were classified as &#x02018;missing treatment non-responders&#x02019;.</p><p>Details of exclusion criteria for the core study are provided elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In summary, for the extension study, patients who had developed or showed evidence of psychiatric, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, respiratory, hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, haematology or neoplastic disorders during the course of the core study were excluded from the extension study. In addition, other exclusion criteria included pregnancy, seizures, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma and Tourette&#x02019;s syndrome or a family history of Tourette&#x02019;s syndrome. Patients with positive urine drug test or abnormal electrocardiogram at the end of the core study or premature discontinuation visit were also excluded from the study. Patients were not allowed to take rescue medication or psychotropic drugs. Patients undergoing psychological or behavioural therapies for treatment of ADHD should have discontinued them at least 1 month prior to the screening visit. Psychological or behavioural treatments for reasons other than ADHD had to be discontinued 3&#x000a0;months prior to entering the study or kept stable with the same therapist during the whole study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>The primary objective of the extension study was to assess the long-term safety of MPH-LA in adults with ADHD. Safety-related events were monitored in terms of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), and their severity and relation to the study drug were assessed. In addition, physical examination, changes in vital parameters such as blood pressure, pulse rate and haematological parameters, clinical chemistry and electrocardiogram were also monitored.</p><p>Cumulative safety data for 12&#x000a0;months were collected and analysed from the combined period of the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase of the core study and the extension study. Safety data for 6&#x000a0;months were collected from the extension study. Safety data have been presented from two different baselines: (1) baseline of the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase until the end of the extension study (12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; data); (2) baseline of the <italic>extension</italic> phase to end of the extension study (6&#x000a0;months&#x02019; data).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Efficacy Assessments</title><p>The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of MPH-LA in adults with ADHD (assessments from the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase baseline and the <italic>extension</italic> baseline were recorded). Efficacy was primarily assessed using the DSM-IV ADHD RS and the SDS. DSM-IV ADHD RS is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing the severity of ADHD symptoms; it consists of 18 items directly adapted from the ADHD symptom list according to the DSM-IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. SDS consists of a five-item, self-rated questionnaire that measures the extent to which a patient&#x02019;s disability due to an illness or health problem (e.g., anxiety disorder, painful conditions, ADHD, depression, etc.) interferes with work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Secondary efficacy assessments were performed using clinician-rated instruments, namely the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S). The CGI-I is designed to assess the overall change of illness compared with baseline whereas the CGI-S is designed to assess the patient&#x02019;s current illness state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The proportion of patients with improvement in the CGI-I and CGI-S scales are reported.</p><p>A summary of individual efficacy scales, their sub-scores, assessment time points, scoring criteria, assessment baselines and the improvement criteria are provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Details of efficacy scales</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Type of scale</th><th align="left">Sub-scores</th><th align="left">Assessment visit/visits (week#)</th><th align="left">Scoring criteria for the scale</th><th align="left">Change at end of study evaluated from:</th><th align="left">Improvement in ADHD indicated by:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">DSM-IV<break/>ADHD RS<sup>a</sup>

The overall incidences of AEs reported in the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase or the <italic>extension</italic> phase were comparable between patients receiving MPH-LA and placebo in the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase of the core study, and the safety profile of MPH-LA did not change with the longer duration of treatment. No consistent relationship was observed between the mean daily dose of MPH-LA and the incidence of AEs. The flexible dosing regimen applied in the extension study allowed titration of MPH-LA dose, such that every individual patient received the dose at which an optimal balance between control of symptoms and adverse effects was achieved. There were no unexpected AEs or SAEs reported in this study. The most common AEs were nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea, decreased appetite and dry mouth, which were similar to those reported in previous studies with other formulations of MPH both in children and adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These findings will help address the limited data availability on the long-term safety of MPH in the treatment of adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The proportion of patients receiving MPH-LA who discontinued the extension study due to AEs was 2.3&#x000a0;%, which is much lower than the 18.5&#x000a0;% as reported in a similar 1-year, open-label study on safety of OROS-MPH (36&#x02013;108&#x000a0;mg/day) in the treatment of adult ADHD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and the 14.7&#x000a0;% in another 6-month, open-label study on safety and efficacy of dexmethylphenidate extended release (d-MPH-ER) (20&#x02013;40&#x000a0;mg/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The reason for a higher proportion of patients discontinuing due to AEs in these two studies was reported to be dose related, thus necessitating dose reductions in these patients. We suggest that the lower incidence of discontinuation related to MPH-LA in this study can be attributed to the flexible, optimised titration of MPH-LA daily dose in the open-label extension study, thus ascertaining an optimal balance between control of symptoms and AEs.</p><p>Overall, only two (0.7&#x000a0;%) patients in the &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;mg dose group reported SAEs, neither of which were considered to be related to the study drug. The incidence of SAEs in this study was lower than that observed in a similar open-label, dose titration, 1-year flexible dose study (36&#x02013;108&#x000a0;mg/day OROS-MPH) that assessed the safety of OROS-MPH. In that study, 1.5&#x000a0;% of patients reported SAEs, none of which were considered to be related to the study drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. None of the patients reported QT, QTcB or QTcF &#x0003e;500&#x000a0;ms. Overall, the modest change in vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in patients treated with MPH is not considered to be clinically meaningful and is thought to be consistent with the known effects of stimulant medications in ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The results of this extension study suggest improvement in ADHD symptoms and reduction in functional impairment as measured by the DSM-IV ADHD RS, SDS and CGI scales. Mean improvement in total scores of DSM-IV ADHD RS and SDS from the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase baseline to the end of the extension study were 0.9 and 1.4 points, respectively, confirming that efficacy is maintained over a period of 1 year. Patients who received MPH-LA in the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase and who continued therapy in the extension study maintained the efficacy as seen in DSM-IV ADHD RS and SDS total scores at the end of the extension study. Patients who received placebo compared with those who received MPH-LA in the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase showed marked improvement in their DSM-IV ADHD RS and SDS total scores after receiving MPH-LA in the extension study. These results were comparable with another open-label, 6-month, extension study in which there was marked clinical improvement in DSM-IV ADHD RS scores in patients who were switched from placebo to d-MPH-ER (20&#x02013;40&#x000a0;mg/day), and the benefit was sustained in patients who were already receiving MPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Similarly, mean improvement in the SDS total score (4.8) in this study was comparable with a 7-week, open-label extension study in which the improvement in SDS total score was 2.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6.0 and 4.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5.8 for patients receiving OROS-MPH (18&#x02013;72&#x000a0;mg/day) and placebo, respectively, in the double-blind period of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>At the end of the extension study, clinical improvement in CGI-I rating was noted in 141 (65.3&#x000a0;%) and 65 (80.2&#x000a0;%) patients treated (in the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase) with MPH-LA and placebo, respectively. Although comparison with other studies is difficult due to patient variability influencing response, the response rates reported in this study are similar to those observed in the literature. In a 6-month extension study, 95.1&#x000a0;% of patients maintained on d-MPH-ER (20&#x02013;40&#x000a0;mg/day) and 95.0&#x000a0;% of patients who switched from placebo to d-MPH-ER showed improvement in CGI-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In another 1-year study, 81&#x000a0;% improvement was observed in CGI-I scores in patients with ADHD treated with MPH-ER (30&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Likewise, improvement in the CGI-S scale observed in 42.9&#x000a0;% and 76.9&#x000a0;% of patients who received MPH-LA and placebo treatment (in the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase<italic>)</italic>, respectively, was similar to that reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the results indicate that MPH-LA at a flexible dose of 40&#x02013;80&#x000a0;mg/day maintained long-term efficacy over a period of 1&#x000a0;year as observed in the improvement of both ADHD symptoms and functional impairment, as measured by the DSM-IV ADHD RS, SDS and CGI scales.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The key strength of this study was that dosing in the open-label extension study was flexible and obtained by titrating MPH-LA daily dose after ascertaining the optimal balance between control of symptoms and AEs, which closely reflects clinical practice. There is also a limitation in the study design, as it is not a true switch study of patients receiving MPH-LA or placebo switched to MPH-LA optimal dose in the extension study, as all the patients had received MPH-LA before entering the <italic>maintenance of effect</italic> phase and a sham response was seen in placebo patients. Another limitation could be that not all the patients who finished the study had received MPH-LA continuously for 1&#x000a0;year, and, in these patients, exposure to MPH-LA was interrupted. On the other hand, this interrupted exposure could also be considered a strength of the study and be relevant in terms of ecological validity, since it may reflect real-life exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study confirms the long-term safety and efficacy of MPH-LA for treatment of adults with ADHD, which is comparable to the safety events reported in the core study and other studies of MPH-LA in children with ADHD. No new safety event was reported upon long-term exposure to MPH-LA. The safety and efficacy profile of MPH-LA is also similar to that of other formulations of MPH used in the treatment of adults with ADHD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Funding and Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Novartis Pharma AG.
