NEPA is a fixed oral combination of a new NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist (RA), netupitant (NETU 300&#x000a0;mg), and palonosetron (PALO 0.50&#x000a0;mg), a pharmacologically distinct 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA. NEPA showed superior prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) compared with oral PALO in a single chemotherapy cycle; maintenance of efficacy/safety over continuing cycles is the objective of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a multinational, double-blind study comparing a single oral dose of NEPA vs oral PALO in chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve patients receiving anthracycline/cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy along with dexamethasone 12&#x000a0;mg (NEPA) or 20&#x000a0;mg (PALO) on day 1. The primary efficacy endpoint was delayed (25&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h) complete response (CR: no emesis, no rescue medication) in cycle 1. Sustained efficacy was evaluated during the multicycle extension by calculating the proportion of patients with overall (0&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h) CR in cycles 2&#x02013;4 and by assessing the probability of sustained CR over multiple cycles.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 1455 patients randomized, 1286 (88&#x000a0;%) participated in the multiple-cycle extension for a total of 5969&#x000a0;cycles; 76&#x000a0;% completed &#x02265;4&#x000a0;cycles.

Antiemetic guidelines currently recommend a prophylactic combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist (RA), a neurokinin-1 (NK<sub>1</sub>) RA, and dexamethasone when administering highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) or anthracycline-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, as studies have shown a clear benefit with the addition of an NK<sub>1</sub> RA to the standard 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA plus dexamethasone regimen in these settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, adherence to antiemetic guidelines is suboptimal, despite continued research suggesting that guideline conformity improves CINV control for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequently, even with effective agents available, many patients still suffer from CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The supportive care community, in particular, continues to evaluate opportunities to reinforce and encourage implementation of guidelines into clinical practice, as well as monitor adherence.</p><p>Netupitant (NETU) is a new highly selective NK<sub>1</sub> RA which has been developed as an oral fixed combination with palonosetron (referred to as NEPA; AKYNZEO&#x000ae;). Palonosetron was specifically chosen as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA for the NEPA combination because of its distinct pharmacological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] characteristics. Palonosetron is distinguished from the older 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RAs in the class with its unique receptor binding, its ability to inhibit the cross talk between the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and NK<sub>1</sub> receptors, its ability to induce NK<sub>1</sub> receptor internalization and to work synergistically with NETU to enhance the inhibition of the substance P response, in addition to its distinctly better efficacy during the delayed (25&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h) phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Consequently, it has the potential to enhance prevention of delayed CINV when used in combination with NETU. The NEPA combination also has the potential to improve guideline adherence by targeting two critical pathways involved in emesis with a convenient, single oral dose.</p><p>In a phase 2 single-cycle, dose-ranging study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] in patients receiving HEC, the NEPA oral combination of NETU 300&#x000a0;mg + PALO 0.50&#x000a0;mg was shown to be superior to oral palonosetron during the delayed and overall (0&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h) phases for all efficacy endpoints.</p><p>The current phase 3 study was designed to demonstrate superior prevention of CINV during cycle 1 with oral NEPA compared with oral palonosetron in patients receiving anthracycline-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (and to evaluate NEPA&#x02019;s safety). This study was also designed to evaluate whether the efficacy (and safety) seen in cycle 1 would be preserved over continuing treatment cycles. In a previously reported phase 3 study, NEPA was shown to be well tolerated over multiple cycles of HEC and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the limited number of trials evaluating the multicycle efficacy of antiemetics, interpretation of the results has been challenging due to high dropout rates and differing statistical methods utilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As preservation of benefit over repeated cycles of chemotherapy is essential for optimal supportive care during cancer treatment, antiemetics need to be able to demonstrate a sustained benefit.</p><p>The cycle 1 data has been previously reported by Aapro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; a single oral dose of NEPA plus dexamethasone prior to chemotherapy resulted in superior complete response (no emesis, no rescue medication) rates during the delayed phase (primary endpoint) compared with oral palonosetron plus dexamethasone. The efficacy of NEPA was supported by consistent superiority over oral palonosetron for all secondary efficacy endpoints (i.e., no emesis, no significant nausea, complete protection) during both the delayed and overall phases. This publication reports the results of the multiple-cycle extension of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was conducted between April 2011 and November 2012 in accordance with GCP, ICH, Declaration of Helsinki principles, and local laws and regulations. Protocol approval was obtained from ethical review committees for each site, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrollment. The study design has been described in detail in the cycle 1 publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. After completion of cycle 1, patients had the option to participate in a multiple-cycle extension, receiving the same treatment as assigned in cycle 1 for as long as they continued to fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria. There was no pre-specified limit of the number of repeat consecutive cycles. Patients received one of the following two treatments: oral NEPA (NETU 300&#x000a0;mg/PALO 0.50&#x000a0;mg) plus 12&#x000a0;mg dexamethasone or oral palonosetron 0.50&#x000a0;mg plus 20&#x000a0;mg dexamethasone, all given prior to chemotherapy each cycle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Eligible patients were &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years, na&#x000ef;ve to chemotherapy, and scheduled to receive their first course of an anthracycline/cyclophosphamide regimen for treatment of a solid malignant tumor. The chemotherapy consisted of either cyclophosphamide IV (500 to 1500&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and doxorubicin IV (&#x02265;40&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or cyclophosphamide IV (500 to 1500&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and epirubicin IV (&#x02265;60&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>). Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Patients were not eligible if they were scheduled to receive <bold>(</bold>1) HEC from days 1 to 5 or MEC from days 2 to 5 following chemotherapy, (2) radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis within 1&#x000a0;week prior to day 1 or between days 1 and 5, or (3) a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Patients were not allowed to receive any drug with known or potential antiemetic efficacy within 24&#x000a0;h prior to day 1 and were excluded if they experienced any vomiting, retching, or mild nausea within 24&#x000a0;h prior to day 1. Patients were not to have had any serious cardiovascular disease history or predisposition to cardiac conduction abnormalities, with the exception of incomplete right bundle branch block. Because netupitant is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, use of any CYP3A4 inducer within 4&#x000a0;weeks, use of a strong or moderate inhibitor within 1&#x000a0;week<bold>,</bold> or scheduled to receive CYP3A4 inhibitors, inducers, or certain substrates as concomitant medication were prohibited. For each cycle of the multiple-cycle extension, the investigator needed to consider it appropriate and not posing any unwarranted risk to the patient. There was to have been satisfactory study compliance in the preceding chemotherapy cycle, and patients were to be scheduled to receive the same chemotherapy regimen as cycle 1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessments and statistical methods</title><p>From the start of chemotherapy infusion on day 1 through the morning of day 6 (0&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h) of each cycle, patients completed a diary, capturing information pertaining to occurrence and timing of each emetic episode and rescue medication intake. Metoclopramide tablets were provided as rescue medication; however, the investigator was allowed to use an alternative rescue (excluding 5-HT<sub>3</sub> or NK<sub>1</sub> RAs, as well as palonosetron) at his/her discretion. The use of rescue medication for treatment of either nausea or vomiting was considered treatment failure. Severity of nausea was evaluated daily by patients in the diary by using a 100-mm horizontal visual analog scale (VAS). The left end of the scale (0&#x000a0;mm) was labeled as &#x0201c;no nausea,&#x0201d; and the right end of the scale (100&#x000a0;mm) was labeled as &#x0201c;nausea as bad as it could be.&#x0201d; No significant nausea was defined as a maximum score &#x0003c;25&#x000a0;mm.</p><p>The objective of the multiple-cycle extension was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral NEPA relative to oral palonosetron across multiple cycles of chemotherapy. The primary aim of the study was to demonstrate the superiority of NEPA over oral palonosetron based on the proportion of patients with a CR during the delayed (25&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h) phase of cycle 1. In the multiple-cycle extension, the proportion of patients with CR and no significant nausea were prospectively defined efficacy endpoints, but no formal comparisons between groups were pre-specified. Thus, <italic>p</italic> values for the multiple-cycle extension should only be descriptively interpreted. CR, no emesis, and no significant nausea rates were compared by using a two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test including treatment, age class, and region as strata. A separate analysis of sustained CR evaluated the probability that a patient would remain a complete responder over 4&#x000a0;cycles of chemotherapy. This analysis was performed by using Kaplan-Meier methods, and patients who did not sustain a CR were considered treatment failures. Treatment groups were compared via a log-rank test. As the majority of patients had completed their planned chemotherapy after 4&#x000a0;cycles of treatment (as expected in &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; AC protocols), only 36&#x000a0;% of patients received a fifth cycle and 27&#x000a0;% a sixth cycle; therefore, efficacy data is only presented through cycle 4.</p><p>Safety was assessed primarily by a clinical review of treatment-emergent adverse events. The multiple-cycle extension summarized incidence rates for cycles 2&#x02013;6, while cycle 1 was evaluated separately. Cardiac safety was evaluated by cardiac adverse events, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes (including QTc), cardiac troponin levels, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). During each cycle, ECGs were recorded pre-dose and 5, 24, and 120&#x000a0;h post-dose. Troponin levels (cTnI) were measured pre-dose and 24 and 120&#x000a0;h post-dose of each cycle by using a standardized troponin assay (Siemens&#x02019; ADVIA Centaur TnI-Ultra troponin assay). A threshold of 0.12&#x000a0;ng/mL was considered an &#x0201c;alert value&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. LVEF was assessed for all patients at visit 1 and at the end of the study. No formal comparisons were performed for the safety assessments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1455 patients were randomized into the study.

Therefore, the best available prophylactic antiemetics should be administered beginning at the first course of chemotherapy to maximize prevention of CINV from the start. All antiemetic guideline committees consistently suggest that combination regimens aimed at multiple molecular targets associated with emesis are now the standard of care for prevention of HEC and some types of MEC-induced CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Developed as the first antiemetic combination agent, NEPA presents a convenient approach to targeting what experts now believe are the two most important molecular targets (substance P/NK<sub>1</sub> and serotonin/5-HT<sub>3</sub>) associated with CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this study, NEPA was administered with a single dose of dexamethasone. This offers a simple single-day &#x0201c;triplet&#x0201d; regimen and could reduce side effects associated with multiple-day dosing of dexamethasone.</p><p>This study evaluated 1450 patients over a total of almost 6000 chemotherapy cycles. While historically, the high dropout rate in multicycle trials has created methodologic challenges, in this study, 76&#x000a0;% of all patients completed at least 4&#x000a0;cycles of chemotherapy. The population selected included patients with solid tumors receiving an anthracycline-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy regimen. This combination has historically been considered a moderately emetogenic regimen but because it is commonly administered to (young) females with breast cancer (as was the case in this study), the emetogenic risk is substantially increased due to the additional patient-related risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, the population evaluated in this study represents a group at significant risk for CINV. All antiemetic guidelines recommend NK<sub>1</sub> RA/5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA/dexamethasone prophylaxis in this setting with guideline committees now classifying anthracycline-cyclophosphamide regimens as HEC. However, if an NK<sub>1</sub> RA is not available, the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) recommends the use of palonosetron as the preferred 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>While this study was conducted in a relatively homogenous population of predominantly white females, other studies in the NEPA program have demonstrated efficacy and safety in a broader population of patients receiving various types of emetogenic chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The data supporting the sustained efficacy benefit of NEPA over multiple cycles in this study is compelling for clinical practice. The NEPA benefit over oral palonosetron was maintained over multiple cycles for overall complete response rates and also for no emesis and no significant nausea in each cycle. These findings were consistent for all endpoints across the entire period of risk (0&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h) for all four chemotherapy cycles.</p><p>Nausea remains a clinical challenge, and the nausea control rates were not as high as those for emesis. However, it is encouraging that treatment including NEPA resulted in a clinical benefit over oral palonosetron in preventing significant nausea over multiple cycles, as there have been no consistent findings to date supporting the role of other NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists in nausea control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These results are supported by a prior phase 2 trial where NEPA resulted in superior nausea control over oral palonosetron in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>A complementary analysis offers perhaps a more rigorous approach to assessing preservation of efficacy in that it evaluates continued CR success over multiple cycles by censoring those patients who had emesis or more than mild nausea (i.e., CR failures); this approach was utilized previously in analyzing the sustained benefit of aprepitant over multiple cycles in a similar population of patients receiving AC chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this study, the complementary analysis demonstrated significantly more NEPA-treated patients having continued CR success across cycles (log-rank test, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). It is notable that the incremental benefit of NEPA over oral palonosetron continued to increase across cycles with 13&#x000a0;% more NEPA-treated patients having continued CR by cycle 4. Similar results were seen for sustained nausea control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p>These findings are particularly impressive considering that NEPA (plus dexamethasone) was compared with and shown to be superior to oral palonosetron, the MASCC guideline-preferred 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA (plus dexamethasone) in the setting when an NK<sub>1</sub> RA is unavailable. This suggests that the incremental benefit of the NEPA combination over an older 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA might be greater. Future trials could be considered to explore this as well as evaluating how NEPA would perform against an aprepitant-containing regimen. According to the data generated thus far, NEPA showed slightly higher response rates than an exploratory aprepitant arm in both a single-cycle study in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and over multiple cycles in patients receiving either non-AC moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with the safety findings previously reported in cycle 1 of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and in the HEC/MEC multiple-cycle trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], NEPA was well tolerated over multiple cycles of chemotherapy without evidence for increasing adverse events over time/cycles or cardiac safety concerns for either agent. There continued to be a low incidence of treatment-related adverse events, none of which led to discontinuation, and there were no serious treatment-related adverse events or deaths for NEPA-treated patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study demonstrate superiority of NEPA over oral palonosetron (both given with dexamethasone) in preventing CINV and sustained efficacy over multiple cycles of chemotherapy.
