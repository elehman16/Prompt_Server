For Group II patients, at least eight teeth with 4-8 mm PPD received subgingival application of hyaluronan (HA) gel. Selected teeth were isolated and dried with cotton rolls. Prefilled hyaluronan gel bulb was loaded into applicator. End of the bulb was cut and placed into the selected periodontal pockets up to the gingival margin (till material flowed out of sulcus) and coe-pak was applied over the experimental sites. For Group III patients, at least eight teeth with 4-8 mm PPD received subgingival application of CHX gel. Selected teeth were isolated and dried with cotton rolls. Blunt needle of prefilled syringe was inserted into the pockets in those sites that had been randomly assigned to receive it and coe-pak was applied over test sites.

It cannot be ascertained that no interaction between LDD and systemic/hematological parameters occurs, and thus it may be hypothesized that there is possibility of drug absorption from the local sites into the periodontal connective tissues, and hence, into the systemic circulation. Primary outcome of this study revealed that LDD (HA gel and CHX gel) used as an adjunct to SRP can significantly improve the benefits of SRP. Systemic/hematological markers associated with chronic periodontitis significantly improve after SRP with or without LDD. Secondarily, increase in CRP levels associated with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis is less than 6 mg/L, as inferred by our rapid chair side diagnostic test kit.</p><p>To overcome validity issues such as carry-over issues and asymmetric disease distribution[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and to evaluate systemic/hematological inflammatory load due to periodontal disease and NSP treatment, whole mouth design was used for this study.</p><p>Both SRP alone (control group) and adjunctive use of HA and CHX gels (experimental groups) resulted in statistically significant reduction in the clinical periodontal parameters. Improved PI and GI were observed due to NSP treatment (SRP with or without LDD) modalities, along with improved oral hygiene practices commonly observed in the study subjects.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Similar to already published data,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] this study also revealed significant improvement in the PPD and CAL after subgingival application of CHX gel as an adjunct to SRP. In contrast to Xu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but similar to our study, Jentsch <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Johannsen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Pistorius <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] also reported significant improvement in gingival and periodontal health after subgingival application of HA as an adjunct. Improvement in clinical periodontal parameters in HA gel/SRP group may be attributed to its ability to promote regeneration and its anti-edema and anti-inflammatory properties that positively influence the local inflammation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, the difference between the two experimental materials was non-significant in our study.</p><p>Owing to its low-grade systemic inflammatory state, increased concentrations of hematological and systemic inflammatory markers is a well-established fact in the patients suffering from periodontitis, when compared with healthy subjects.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This study also demonstrated elevated systemic/hematological parameters within the limits of normalcy at baseline in all three groups. Also, local and systemic host responses have been proposed to be elicited after SRP that would have aided in eliminating local infection and promoting healing.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Results of this study revealed significant improvement in hematological parameters after the NSP therapy using both LDD as an adjunct to SRP and SRP alone. Comparisons of mean WBC count between experimental and control groups at different time intervals reveal no significant difference at baseline and at 24-h interval. However, the difference was significant statistically at 1-month and 3-month intervals. Comparison between different groups revealed more reduction in WBC counts in Group II (HA gel/SRP) followed by Group III (Xan-CHX gel/SRP), and least in Group I (SRP alone), both at 1 and 3 months. Although comparative difference between both experimental groups (Group II and III) was not significant, both experimental groups revealed significant difference from control group (SRP alone).</p><p>Similar to D&#x02019;Aiuto <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] transient alterations of DLC count (10<sup>3</sup> /&#x003bc;L) were also observed in this study at 24 h after the NSP therapy in all the groups. Comparison of mean neutrophil between various groups at different time intervals shows no significant difference at baseline and at 24-h interval. At 1 month and 3 months, more reduction in neutrophil count was more in Group II (HA gel/SRP), followed by Group III (Xan-CHX gel/SRP) and least in Group I (SRP alone). No significant difference was observed between Groups II and III at any time interval. Christan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also proposed that the significant reduction of leukocyte counts can be observed 3 months after the SRP.</p><p>No statistically significant difference was observed among experimental and control groups at any time interval for lymphocyte count; however, eosinophil count shows significant difference between experimental and control groups at 24 h only. For monocyte count, a statistically significant difference was observed between control and experimental groups at 24-h and 3-month intervals. None of the other differences were significant statistically. D&#x02019;Aiuto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] also reported statistically significant increase in the number of circulating monocyte at 24 h, and decrease in lymphocyte count after 24 h followed by significant increase in lymphocyte number 1 month after SRP. Loos <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Graziani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Sambashivaiah <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Rai and Anand,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported improvement in hematological and inflammatory markers after SRP. D&#x02019;Aiuto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported early increase in the hematological parameters in the first few days to a week after the periodontal therapy.</p><p>Significant difference in the systemic/hematological parameter between the control and experimental groups may be possibly due to the reduction in the systemic inflammatory load that occurs due to the cumulative effect of SRP and absorption of LDD from the local site. Furthermore, it might be noted that increase systemic inflammation after SRP, as reported by Graziani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] may have been ameliorated by the anti-inflammatory effects of LDD.</p><p>Jentsch <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that absorption of HA through gingival epithelium or skin could not be found. However, their study used supragingival application of HA in gingivitis patients. It is well established that diseased pocket wall revealed progressive degenerative and necrotic changes in the epithelium lead to ulceration of the lateral wall, and thus exposure of the underlying inflamed connective tissue.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Also, inadvertent or unintentional curettage that followed SRP, resulting in removal of inflamed and pocket epithelium.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] El-Sayed <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that removal of pocket lining facilitates placement of HA gel in direct contact with connective tissue to perform its alleged beneficial effect. Hence, subgingival application of LDD systems, immediately after thorough SRP, may lead to absorption of the drug from the local site, as reported in this study. Furthermore, coe-pak at the experimental sites may have reduced the chances of dilution and outflow of the drug by saliva and the gingival crevicular fluid.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Similar to our study, Nagaral <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also revealed that estimation of serum CRP using a rapid chair side diagnostic test kit with detection limit of 6 mg/L is not of any significance in subjects with chronic periodontitis which signifies that increase in CRP levels associated with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis is less than 6 mg/L.</p><p>Multifold beneficial role of hyaluronic acid have been proposed. In the initial stage of inflammation, it bonds with the fibrin clot; stimulates production of cytokines by fibroblasts, keratinocytes, ameloblasts, and osteoblasts, which promote inflammation; and activates inflammatory cells, stimulating migration toward the lesion, phagocytosis, and clearing of pathogens. Increased osteoblast activity by stimulating differentiation and migration of mesenchymal cells, and the physiochemical properties to keep the growth factors responsible for tissue repair <italic>in situ</italic> by hyaluronic acid have been reported. It is bacteriostatic toward <italic>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] These properties might reduce bacterial load in the initial stages of healing, and hence, may resulted in better improvement in HA gel/SRP group patients than SRP alone. Similarly, dual-staged released antimicrobial property and enhanced gel structure and substantivity due to cationic charges of the CHX that can interact with the anionic charges of the bioadhesive xanthan gum polymer in Xan-CHX gel[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] may be responsible for better results as compared to SRP alone.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>To evaluate systemic inflammation, readily available hematological markers, in lieu of sensitive systemic inflammatory markers such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, were used. For the estimation of serum CRP, cost-effective rapid chair side diagnostic test kit with detection limit of 6 mg/L was used, instead of laboratory-assisted CRP detection kit with detection limit of 0.1 mg/L. Also, our results are based on short term, small sample size, and hence, it is suggested that further long-term, large-sample size clinical trial using more sensitive inflammatory markers may be required to quantify the anti-inflammatory effect of LDD.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Future research directions</title><p>Beside improvement in clinical periodontal parameters by SRP, LDD may influence systemic/hematological component of the patients. To the best of our knowledge, no published data have reported influence of LDD as an adjunct to SRP on systemic/hematological components, although several reports have confirmed that moderate to severe forms of periodontitis are associated with a mild systemic inflammatory response, as defined by raised serum concentrations of inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6), and standard periodontal treatment has been shown to reduce the level of systemic inflammation, thus giving strength to the concept that periodontitis contributes to the systemic inflammatory burden of the individual.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This study signifies that SRP, with or without LDD, reduces the systemic inflammatory load associated with immuno-inflammatory response to bacterial plaque in chronic periodontitis patients. However, these results can be used as preliminary data to allow designing large-scale interventional study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
