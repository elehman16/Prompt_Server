Twenty-four naive patients with acute thromboembolic cerebrovascular events, with National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke scores between 12 and 16, were included. Any condition interfering with GLP-1 and immunity was regarded as exclusion criterion.

Calculated daily energy requirement was supplemented with parenteral nutrition, starting on the first study day for both groups.

Introduction of early enteral nutrition within the first 24 to 48 hours after admission has been demonstrated to decrease septic complications, ameliorate the course of primary disease and shorten the stay in the ICU when compared with parenteral nutritional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These positive findings were attributed to the prevention of worsening in intestinal permeability, interruption of the catabolic process and restoration of immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Incretin hormones originate from the gastrointestinal system in response to the presence of nutrition in the intestinal lumen and potentiate postprandial insulin secretion. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is the best known incretin hormone and is secreted principally from the L-cells of the distal ileum. The main stimulant of GLP-1 secretion is the presence of food awaiting absorption in the intestinal lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In a recent study, GLP-1 has been demonstrated to act as an immune-modulator and influence cell-mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Its receptors have been shown on T-receptors in animal models, and their stimulation with supraphysiological concentrations of GLP-1 has been demonstrated to regulate the proliferation of lymphocytes and peripheral T regulatory (TREG) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The TREG cells originate from the thymus and play a pivotal role in the prevention of autoimmune diseases by establishing immune tolerance. They control immunity-mediated injury of the host by limiting inflammation and tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. They have also been demonstrated to act as an immune-modulator following acute stroke, and to limit the extent of the damaged tissue area by controlling cellular inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, there has been no study inquiring about the relationship between early enteral nutrition and changes in plasma GLP-1 levels, and also the resulting clinical implications among ICU cases. In this clinical trial, our aim was to determine the impact of early enteral nutrition within the first 24 hours of admission, and late enteral nutrition; beginning 48 hours after admission, on plasma GLP-1 levels of acutely ill ICU patients with thromboembolic stroke. The possible relationship between the changes in GLP-1 and cell-mediated immunity was sought, as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>Patients between 40 and 70 years old admitted to our neurology ICU with the diagnosis of an acute thromboembolic cerebrovascular event were included in the study.

Accordingly, daily caloric requirement was determined as 25 kcal/kg/day for each participant.</p><p>Enteral nutrition was supplied via a nasogastric tube (NGT) which was inserted by an ICU physician.</p><p>The early enteral feeding group (Group 1) was given the commercially available enteral nutrition liquid (JEVITY<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Abbott) within the first 24 hours via nasogastric intubation. Every 100 ml of this liquid contained 105 kcal energy with a combination of 14.05 g carbohydrates, 3.07 g fat and 4 g protein. Keeping with the ICU algorithm, enteral nutrition was started slowly with divided doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; 10 ml/h (10.5 kcal/h) for the first six hours on the first day of enteral feeding, then 20 ml/h (21 kcal/h) for the following 12 hours and 30 ml/h (31.5 kcal/h) thereafter. The deficit in daily energy requirement was supported with supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN). The late enteral feeding group (Group 2) was given the daily recommended caloric requirement (25 kcal/kg/day) parenterally with the parenteral nutritional solution for the first 48 hours. Following this period, enteral nutrition was started using the same protocol mentioned for Group 1. In order to avoid caloric deprivation and complete the daily recommended caloric requirement, supplemental parenteral nutrition was given to both groups during enteral nutrition.

There had also been no difference between the pre-feeding GLP-1 levels and enteral feeding GLP-1 curves of cases within the groups. We additionally demonstrated that early enteral feeding significantly increased the number of T helper and TREG cells, and decreased the amount of T cytotoxic cells with any change in plasma GLP-1.</p><p>We decided to perform this investigation on patients with acute thromboembolic stroke because of their acute illness status. Thereby, we aimed to avoid the impact of any interfering situation. Recently demonstrated neuroprotective properties of GLP-1 via GLP-1 receptors on neurons was the other reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Current study did not exhibit the presumed postprandial increase at GLP-1 levels in both early and late enteral feeding groups. These findings may be interpreted in two ways. The first explanation is the impact of meal kinetic effect on GLP-1 secretion which is determined principally by meal size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Large amounts of nutrition have a greater impact on GLP-1 secretion than small amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In our study, keeping in accordance with the ESPEN guideline for enteral nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], for avoiding the risk of aspiration pneumonia and feeding diarrhea, our patients were fed with standard amounts of a liquid mixed meal. Small amounts of the liquid meal, 10 to 30 cc at introduction, may not be sufficient for the stimulation of GLP-1 secretion. The second explanation is the possible physiological transient hypercortisolism originating from the stress caused by acute stroke. Studies on critically ill patients have demonstrated that low GLP-1 levels accompanying stress hyperglycemia is negatively correlated with plasma cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In a recent study, exogenous GLP-1 infusion has been demonstrated to attenuate stress hyperglycemia in ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This study may underline the inadequacy of incretin response in ICU patients and support our findings.</p><p>Post-ischemic inflammation resulting from focal hypoperfusion-induced oxidative injury causes permanent neuronal damage in ischemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Cellular immunity by T-lymphocytes plays a pivotal role in post-ischemic inflammation. T-regulatory cells (TREG) characterized by the expression of CD4CD25 surface marker and foxP3 transcription marker at flow-cytometry, are immune tolerance elements that inhibit the magnitude of immunopathological damage via decreasing the severity of T-cell mediated immune response and avoiding its permanency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These cells have experimentally been shown to decrease infarct damage in acute stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In recent animal models, the presence of GLP-1 receptors on T lymphocytes has been demonstrated and experimentally their stimulation has been shown to increase peripheral TREG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Besides, factors other than GLP-1 that may act on TREG cells should not be ignored. The increasing number of TREG cells in our early enteral feeding group without accompanying GLP-1 elevation may be a good example of this proposal.</p><p>A limited number of studies investigating the influence of nutritional state and some micronutrients on cell-mediated immunity and early enteral nutrition have been shown to ameliorate cell-mediated immunity in ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, the impact of early enteral nutrition on TREG cells is obscure and there is no relevant study. In this trial, among ICU patients with acute stroke, we clearly demonstrated that early enteral nutrition resulted in augmentation of T helper and TREG cell amounts. T-helper cells are very well known to increase the TREG cell population via their secretory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], so together the increase of these cell groups is not a surprise.</p><p>The clinical outcomes of early enteral feeding had also been investigated in the present study. Even though statistically insignificant, probably due to the low number of patients, median ICU stay and risk of infection tended to be lower with early enteral nutrition. This finding has been supported by a retrospective study performed on 4,049 critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The decreasing number of cytotoxic T cells in our early enteral feeding group may be considered as a contradiction to the declining risk of infection in this group. Cytotoxic T cells are well-recognized members of cell-mediated immunity via their direct cytolytic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It has been recently demonstrated that the immune modulatory effects of TREG cells are partially mediated by lowering the cytotoxic T cell number and thereby slowing the response rate of cell-mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Depending on the data mentioned above, we may propose that the decreasing cytotoxic T cell amounts in our early enteral feeding group may be related to their increasing TREG cell counts. In the same group, a decrease in risk of infection, in spite of declining T cytotoxic cells, may be attributed to the increase in T-helper cells, modulating humoral immunity via cytokines, and their impact on natural killer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The link between early enteral nutrition and the increasing T-helper and TREG cell population was not via GLP-1 and blood glucose changes. The curves of blood glucose changes were similar between Group 1 and Group 2.</p><p>Early enteral nutrition has been shown to positively affect cellular immunity among surgical ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In a study performed on neurological and non-neurological ICUpatients, GLP-1 levels have been found to be indifferent, as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. According to these studies, we do not expect to see different results in various ICU patient groups except for cases with interfering factors.</p><p>There are a few pitfalls of the present study. The immune-modulating and neuroprotective properties of GLP-1 are reported primarily in animal models when pharmacological doses of GLP-1 (or an agonist) are administered. Hence, infusion of GLP-1 (or an agonist) would have been an alternative approach for our study. However, the decision of not infusing GLP-1 or a GLP-1 agonist into acutely-ill ICU patients was made, taking the ethical issues into consideration. As is known, GLP-1 infusion is not free of complications. For instance, it may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia via decreasing gastrointestinal system (GIS) motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Deane <italic>et al</italic>. has shown that in critically ill patients with normal gastric emptying during placebo infusion, GLP-1 slowed gastric emptying substantially but, if the gastric emptying was delayed during placebo infusion, GLP-1 had no detectable effect on gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, the gastrointestinal effects of GLP-1 appear to be diminished in the critically ill.</p><p>Performing GLP-1 measurements at different time points, even though equally matched with regard to enteral feeding times, may be considered as a second limitation. This situation may be regarded as an inhomogeneity with regard to timing. Nevertheless, the statistically insignificant difference between the GLP-1 levels of both groups before the first enteral feeding, makes this inhomogeneity clinically worthless.</p><p>Parenteral nutrition is a potential and substantial confounder. It can be argued that the extra parenteral nutrition is the cause of the observed changes in lymphocyte subgroups and clinical implications, rather than early enteral nutrition in our study. In Casaer's study, the negative outcomes observed by introduction of parenteral nutrition early within the first two days when compared to late (after eight days) are attributed to the changes in blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Accordingly, parenteral nutrition may be considered as an important factor when interpreting the results of such studies. In our study, taking the negative impact of malnutrition into account, the daily energy requirement was completed with enteral and parenteral nutrition where needed within each participant. The results might be confusing if there was a mismatch at the energy supply for both groups. In his study, Casaer defines late parenteral supply as "after 8 days". However, in our study, every participant received parenteral nutrition beginning on the first day. Mean glucose measurements of our groups were statistically indifferent both at inclusion and during the following seven days (<italic>P </italic>= 0.47). Finally, although the plasma samples were obtained at different time points of acute illness, mean GLP-1 levels of our groups before first enteral feeding were similar (<italic>P </italic>= 0.389). Lymphocyte counts and subgroups' amounts were also indifferent (shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Depending on the information mentioned above, it is reasonable to say that parenteral nutrition does not have a negative impact on our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In our study the number of T-helper lymphocytes and TREG cells were found to increase with early enteral feeding in neurology ICU patients.
