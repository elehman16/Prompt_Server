Indication for fURS also has been extended, even for stone larger than 2 cm (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Aboumarzouk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Breda et al., 2008</xref>). Preoperative stenting is frequently used to allow passive ureteral dilatation, which is supposed to facilitate the passage of a flexible ureteroscope or ureteral access sheath (UAS). In a study, double-J stent inserted 5&#x02013;10 days before fURS was recommended as a part of standardized technique to achieve superior results for treatment of renal stones (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Miernik et al., 2012</xref>). However, a preoperative stenting inevitably leads extra cost and time, as well as complications such as flank pain, sexual dysfunction, bothersome urinary symptoms and potential urinary tract infection (UTI) (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Shigemura et al., 2012</xref>). Then, patient compliance is an issue for urologists. In addition, urologists have better skill and more confidence to successfully perform fURS procedures for patients without preoperative stenting with increased experience. For the above reasons, more and more fURS procedures without preoperative stenting were carried out in our department.</p><p>However, the outcome of Flexible Ureteroscopic Treatment for renal stones without preoperative stenting is undefined. Hence, we reviewed a series of cases to seek the answer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the ethics committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. All unilateral fURS procedures from between June 2013 and May 2015 were reviewed. All patients included underwent fURS as initial attempt or substitute for previous failed Extracorporal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) or Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) procedures to treat solitary as well as multiple renal calculi. The patients with the presence of ipsilateral ureteral stones were excluded. All patients were classified into two groups depending on whether they received a preoperative stent. The patients in stenting group received preoperative stenting (5&#x0223c;8 F) for persistent renal colic, fever, insufficient renal function, or just to dilate the ureter to facilitate subsequent fURS. The patients in non-stenting group had not received stenting before fURS.</p><p>All procedures were performed by experienced urologists in our department according to standard operative protocols. UTI was controlled before all operations. For patients with preoperative stenting, firstly the stents was removed through ureteroscopy (URS) or cystoscopy. For patients without preoperative stenting, a rigid URS was performed to detect the whole ureter at first. Then a guidewire was inserted into ureter and UAS (12/14 F, Cook) was placed routinely. A 7.5 F flexible ureteroscope (Storz, Germany) with a 200 &#x003bc;m laser fibre was used for laser lithotripsy. Nitinol stone retrieval baskets were also used if necessary at surgeon discretion. All patients received ureteral stent at the end of operations. Then all patients underwent KUB or non-contrast CT about four weeks and three months after treatment, and absence of any stone or residual stone fragment &#x02264; 4 mm was considered as stone-free.</p><p>We retrospectively recorded data from patient documentation, radiologic images (including X-ray, IVU, and computed tomography), reports of anesthesia and operation. All radiologic images were checked collaboratively by an urologist and a radiologist. Number, location and linear diameter of stones visible in radiologic images were noted in detail. Fever was defined as postoperative body temperature &#x02265; 38. The procedures were performed by a total of five urologists.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed by Statistical Package for the Social science version 13.0. Continuous variables with normal distribution and without normal distribution were performed with Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test and Mann-Whitney U-test, respectively. Categorical variables were performed with chi-squared test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Potential factors associated with stone-free rate including BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), stone size (mm), stone number, presence of preoperative stenting, type of anesthesia and presence of hydronephrosis were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. A <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c; 0 .05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 176 unilateral procedures of fURS from 171 individual patients were included. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Figure 1</xref> shows the clinical outcome of all patients.

Of the 10 patients, five patients received a stent placement and subsquent fURS, four patients underwent a conversion to PCNL procedure,and one patient received a stent followed by ESWL treatment.

Stone number, stone site, and stone burden were also similar in both groups. Positive rate of preoperative urine culture was higher in stenting group. Stone-free rate was similar in both groups. Procedures for solitary stone accounted for 71.2% (111 of 156). For single stone, stone-free rate was highest for stone in renal pelvis, and lowest in lower pole. Stone-free rates were also similar for patients with solitary stone in both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>).

Obviously, the preoperative stenting passively dilated the ureter and facilitated access to renal pelvis in them. A study by <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Ambani et al. (2013)</xref> retrospectively analyzed 41 patients who underwent ureteral stenting after an initial failed attempt of fURS. The second fURS was performed in these patients after 4&#x02013;34 days and succeeded in 38 patients (93%). Therefore, when a difficult ureter was faced in first attempt of fURS, placement of a stent and subsequent second attempt was optional and even encouraged. In our study, stone-free rate (three months after operation) in patients with preoperative stenting was higher compared to patients without preoperative stenting, however without statistical significance (73.2 vs. 71.0%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.854). This result was not consistent with some previously published data (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Lumma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Shields et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Chu, Sternberg &#x00026; Averch, 2011</xref>). One possible reason was that ureteral stones account for a high proportion of all stones in these studies. Multivariate assessment also revealed that preoperative stent was not the independent predictor of stone-free rate after fURS in our study which was similar with a previous study (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). In our opinion, once the fURS successfully arrived at renal pelvis, stone-free rate for renal calculi would be more likely affected by stone characteristics and pelvicalyceal anatomy rather than the existence of preoperative stenting according to our experience and some published data (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Skolarikos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Jessen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Resorlu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Stone-free rate was not very high in our study. One reason may be that stone size (18.4 &#x000b1; 7.7 mm) in our study was higher than many studies (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Miernik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Perlmutter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2011</xref>). Although non-contrast CT was the most accurate modality for follow-up of urolithiasis, we also performed KUB for follow-up for its advantages of less cost and radiation exposure.</p><p>The operation time was similar in both groups. However, different results had been reported. <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Lumma et al. (2013)</xref> found that the operation time in patients with preoperative stent was extended by 4.9 min compared to patients without stent, and attributed this to stent extraction. Another study indicated that preoperative stenting decreased operative time of URS for stones (mainly in the ureter). The possible reason may be that preoperative stenting dilated the ureter and allowed a bigger UAS and better irrigation (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Chu, Sternberg &#x00026; Averch, 2011</xref>). In our experience, it would consume some time to remove preexisting stents; however, a procedure of rigid URS was generally not necessary before placing the UAS in these patients.</p><p>Severe complications were rare in our study, however, postoperative fever rate was much higher compared with other complications. Also, patients with preoperative stenting had a higher incidence of fever compared with without (17.9 vs. 6.0%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.027). The reason may be that majority of patients with preoperative stenting in this study received a stent just because of existence of fever or urinary tract obstruction and patients in stenting group indeed had a significant higher rate of positive urine culture. Therefore, we could not conclude that preoperative stenting increased postoperative fever rate, although an extended time of stenting may cause potential UTI (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Shigemura et al., 2012</xref>). Also, the incidence of fever in our patients without preoperative stenting was similar with the results (3.6% for 10&#x02013;20 mm renal stones) of CROES URS Global Study (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Skolarikos et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Perforations of ureter or pelvis were not very common in both groups (1.8% with stent vs. 4% without). As many mild injuries may be ignored in records of our operations, it was hard to know accurate incidence of ureter injuries for all patients. We speculated that ureter injuries (especially for mild injuries) were common according to our experience as well as published data (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Traxer &#x00026; Thomas, 2013</xref>). However, severe ureter injuries such as ureter avulsion never happened. In our experience, if unreasonable resistance was perceived when passing through the ureter, it was better to terminate the fURS procedure rather than try with a greater force to avoid severe ureter injury. As many above mentioned substitutes could be selected subsequently, an &#x0201c;adventure&#x0201d; was not necessary.</p><p>A recent published large scale study included 1,622 patients with renal stones who were treated with fURS and concluded that preoperative stent increased stone-free rates (79.6% with stent vs. 72.9% without stent) and decreased intraoperative complications (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Assimos et al., 2015</xref>). The results of this large scale study are very valuable, however, we still should note that heterogeneity of reasons for preoperative stenting may affect outcome of fURS for renal stones in different studies. This large scale study indicated that non-stenting fURS for renal stones may have some disadvantages, however, it still had an acceptable prognosis. In addition, it should be emphasized that non-stenting procedures would benefit patients for less cost and suffering.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, it is a retrospective study from single center. Second, the complications mentioned in our study were early stage complications, while late complications such as ureter stricture were not concerned due to limited follow-up time. Despite these facts, our study is one of the largest series to determine the prognosis of non-stenting procedure on management of renal calculi with fURS.</p><p>Our study showed that majority (91.2%, 104 of the 114) of the patients without preoperative stenting were successfully performed fURS at first attempt. The procedures of non-stenting fURS for renal stones have an acceptable prognosis compared with the stenting group in our study. If a preoperative stenting is optional, our study may help the patients and clinicians make a final decision. Large prospective randomized controlled studies are required to further figure out the role of pre-stent, especially for optional cases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title>Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.2728/supp-1</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 1</label><caption><title>Patient characteristics in non-stenting group.</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-04-2728-s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.2728/supp-2</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 2</label><caption><title>Patient characteristics of primary success of fURS cases in non-stenting group and stenting group (156 cases included for data analysis).</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-04-2728-s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional Information and Declarations</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><title>Competing Interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conflict-1"><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contributions"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-1"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-1">Jiaqiao Zhang</xref> conceived and designed the experiments, performed the experiments, analyzed the data, contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, wrote the paper, prepared figures and/or tables, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-2"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-2">Chuou Xu</xref> performed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-3"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-3">Deng He</xref> performed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-4"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-4">Yuchao Lu</xref> analyzed the data, contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-5"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-5">Henglong Hu</xref> conceived and designed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-6"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-6">Baolong Qin</xref> performed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-7"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-7">Yufeng Wang</xref> performed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-8"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-8">Qing Wang</xref> performed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-9"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-9">Cong Li</xref> performed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-10"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-10">Shaogang Wang</xref> conceived and designed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-11"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-11">Jihong Liu</xref> conceived and designed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Human Ethics</title><fn id="addinfo-1"><p>The following information was supplied relating to ethical approvals (i.e., approving body and any reference numbers):</p><p>Ethics committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.</p><p>IRB ID: 20150404.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Data Deposition</title><fn id="addinfo-2"><p>The following information was supplied regarding data availability:</p><p>Xu, Chuou (2016): fURS-rawdata.xlsx. figshare.</p><p><uri xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3407122.v1">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3407122.v1</uri>;</p><p>Zhang, Jiaqiao (2016): 110 cases unstented cases. figshare.</p><p><uri xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3976275.v1">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3976275.v1</uri>.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><ref-list content-type="authoryear"><title>References</title><ref id="ref-1"><label>Aboumarzouk et al.
