In view of steeply rising drug prices, various measures to limit prescription have been taken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. Swedish general practitioners (GPs) account for more than 50% of all drug prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>] indicating the importance of their knowledge in evidence-based medicine (EBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. The guideline on hypertension from the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>] is an EBM source.</p><p>The prevalence of hypertension has been estimated at 1.8 million (27%) Swedish adults; 60% with mildly, 30% moderately, and 10% severely elevated blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. In a study it was estimated that as many as 80% could be unsatisfactorily treated, entailing increasing risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. New expensive drugs augment the discussion on cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. The number of prescriptions of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) increased in Sweden prior to studies of the effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. They were considered too expensive and without major benefits compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. A Danish study showed that there was no clear association between GPs&#x02019; clinical interest and their prescribing of new drugs such as ARB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency introduced limitations on ARB prescriptions with proposed savings of SKr 250 million (&#x020ac;28 million, $US 36 million) annually. The SBU's recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>] for moderate hypertension (&#x0003e; 140/90) were; (a) encourage lifestyle changes, (b) prescribe low doses of one of the following drugs: thiazides, ACE inhibitors, calcium-blocking agents, and beta blockers; beta blockers were later downgraded to third-line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>], (c) increase or add a low dose of the other drugs until acceptable blood pressure was attained, (d) ARB should only be used as a last-line drug.</p><p>Most drug information emanates from pharmaceutical companies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>] and is often too abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. In Sweden, evidence-based drug information (EBDI) to GPs is frequently provided by non-commercial medical information officers (MIOs) from the drug and therapeutic committees (DTCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>], funded by the county councils.</p><p>A Welsh qualitative study highlighted the complexity in drug prescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. Not one method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>] but a combination is preferable to modify prescribing behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. A recent Swedish randomized controlled trial (RCT) among elderly patients showed no improvements in the patients&#x02019; quality of life when a prescription review was sent to the physician or to the physicians and to the patients themselves, compared with a control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. According to a health technology assessment report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>] dissemination of printed educational materials, audit with feedback, and multifaceted interventions with educational outreach improve physician performance by 6&#x02013;8% whereas reminders have twice the impact.</p><p>In a focus-group study, GPs&#x02019; thoughts on EBM and drug prescribing were related to benefit and results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. The core category was found to be: prompt and pragmatic benefit, delivered immediately, useful, and handy.</p><p>Motivational interviewing (MI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>] is a change-oriented, client-centred, and governing methodology mainly used in the area of lifestyle change. Interest in the use of MI in Swedish health care is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether tailored EBDI using MI, based on previous findings on GPs&#x02019; thoughts on prompt and pragmatic benefit, can change GPs&#x02019; prescribing pattern of ACE inhibitors more effectively than EBDI provided as usual.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="ss2"><title>Material and methods</title><p>An enquiry regarding participation was sent to all 29 Swedish DTCs; seven chose to participate. The MIOs of the seven DTCs, seven men and seven women (three GPs, 11 pharmacists), were previously assigned to provide information to GPs at specified PHCCs in the participating DTCs. The officers were matched pairwise as far as possible based on profession, number of GPs in their district, and sex; male and female pharmacists with an equal number of GPs in their domain, a female pharmacist officer with a female GP officer, and a male GP officer to a female GP officer. They were then randomized by an independent person. The GPs, the study objects, were as a result &#x0201c;cluster randomized&#x0201d; with their officer. There were 408 GPs in the intervention group and 583 in the control group.</p><p>Four male and three female officers (one GP, six pharmacists) provided tailored EBDI by using a motivational interviewing technique whereas three male and four female officers (two GPs and five pharmacists) provided EBDI as usual. In two DTCs the randomization resulted in control and intervention officers in the same DTC but never at the same PHCC.</p><p>The officers gathered in October 2004 and were lectured on the guideline on hypertension. Those randomized to provide benefit-tailored information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>] by using MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>] were further trained for eight hours. The point of departure for the training was the individual GP's own thoughts and beliefs and the benefit aspects were emphasized. The method resembles that of patient-centred communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. The MI training included role playing, which was videotaped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>], and the officers were given feedback. All officers were invited to cooperate within their own officer group. They were aware that a difference between the groups existed but did not know what constituted the difference. No one in either group had experienced a motivational interviewing technique before the study.</p><p>In data compilation we found 1031 physicians working at the PHCCs before and after the intervention. The majority were temporary doctors and substitutes. Statistics were calculated on all the physicians who worked at the PHCCs and who prescribed anti-hypertensive drugs during the study period. All physicians are referred to as GPs.</p><p>The intervention took place in November 2004. All GPs present at the 66 participating PHCCs, 28 in the intervention group and 38 in the control group, were presented with the new guidelines during a two hour session. The intervention group received EBDI using MI and tailored to GPs&#x02019; thoughts on prompt and pragmatic benefit, while the control group received EBDI as usual.</p><p>Prescription data from participating PHCCs for all antihypertensive drugs were collected from their computerized medical records according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification. The software systems for computerized medical records were Profdoc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Medidoc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and Swedestar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Change in prescription from baseline (0&#x02013;3 months before intervention) to the time periods 0&#x02013;3 months and 4&#x02013;6 months after the intervention were analysed. A separate file enabled linkage between data on prescription data and the prescriber.</p><p>The primary outcome was changed in the proportion of ACE inhibitor prescriptions relative to the sum of ACE inhibitors and ARB, comparing intervention and control groups during the two periods after the intervention.</p><p>A sample size calculation indicated that we needed an estimated total of 460 GPs (p &#x0003c; 0.05, power 90%); 991 were analysed. Statistics were calculated on the level of GPs.</p><p>Data were collected on several levels: (1) GPs&#x02019; prescriptions of antihypertensive drugs, (2) GPs, (3) PHCCs, and (4) geographical area including several PHCCs. Prescriptions were aggregated to produce just one change in proportion for each GP. A multilevel model was used to examine the effect of the levels <italic>PHCC</italic> and <italic>geographical area</italic> on the change in proportion of GPs&#x02019; ACE inhibitor prescriptions. As these levels explained less than 1% of the variation in the dependent variable/change in proportion of ACE inhibitor prescriptions, we decided to use the simpler multiple linear regression to compare the groups. The dependent variable was the change in GPs&#x02019; prescription proportion while independent variables were group allocation and those variables where groups differed at baseline: patients&#x02019; sex and type of clinic. The analysis was performed by intention-to-treat and per protocol.</p><p>The multilevel modelLing was made in the statistical program STATA. The multiple linear regression analyses were made in Epi-info 3.4.3 (CDC, Atlanta, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="ss3"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 1031 GPs, 40 were not present at the time of study.

This might dilute the effect of change as is described in a North American mini-review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. The outcome was dependent on how the message on the use of ARBs was received. The other messages, except for the changed status of beta-blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>], were well known. The ARB message might have had a stronger impact if there were less competition in time use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. However, the issue of how to prescribe ARBs was well known beforehand by Swedish GPs from the medical debate.</p><p>The relative increase in the number of prescribed ACE inhibitors is in line with the recommendations from the SBU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Because the numbers of prescribed ARB and ACE inhibitors has increased continuously since the year 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>], it cannot be determined whether the increase in the number of ACE inhibitors prescriptions can be attributed to our intervention or not. Possible interpretations of the study results could either be equal impact of the information in both groups, no impact of the information in either group, or a combination of both explanations.</p><p>Motivational interviewing is described in the literature as an evidence-based method for lifestyle change, especially with regard to alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. In a review of RCTs on substance abuse, including alcohol, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>] MI as a brief individual intervention (1&#x02013;4 sessions) significantly reduced abuse compared with no intervention; no significant differences were seen compared with treatment as usual. A meta-analysis of RCTs on MI compared with treatment as usual mainly in primary health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref>] showed significant effects on body mass index, systolic hypertension, total blood cholesterol, and alcohol measurement in about 75% of patients. However, the &#x0201c;as usual&#x0201d; in this study meant a GP-centred approach. This is not regarded as the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; in contemporary patient consultations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. Patient education using MI on diabetes by nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>] rendered no improvements on HbA1c compared with education as usual.</p><p>One major difference between our study and others is that GPs were informed in a group instead of individually. Another difference is that GPs differ from patients, having a different pre-understanding of the context than patients. In this study, the GPs were informed in a group and had a different relationship to the information provider than patients have to a care provider. However, an interesting similarity is that as in the review on MI and substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>] no differences were seen between MI and treatment as usual. A plausible explanation of the results in our study is that MI and other interventions share non-specific therapeutic factors, such as attention and therapeutic alliance, which might contribute to 30% of the effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="ss5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study could not prove that specially tailored EBDI using MI to GPs changes the outcome more than EBDI provided as usual.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all study participants, the Research and Development Council Southern &#x000c4;lvsborg County, and Christopher Pickering for valuable comments.</p><p><bold>Source of funding</bold></p><p>Financial support; the Research and Development Unit in Primary Health Care and Dental Care, and the Research and Development Council, Southern &#x000c4;lvsborg County, Region V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland, Sweden.</p><p><bold>Ethical approval</bold></p><p>The study was carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg (Dnr: 129-04/17 May 2004).
