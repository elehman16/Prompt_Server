Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation that improved serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was associated with at least a 1.5 fold alteration in the expression of 291 genes. There was a significant difference in the expression of 66 genes between subjects at baseline with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D&#x0003c;20 ng/ml) and subjects with a 25(OH)D&#x0003e;20 ng/ml. After vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation gene expression of these 66 genes was similar for both groups.

A total of 11 adult subjects were recruited for this study. However, two subjects dropped out before using supplement and the nine subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups (Group I and Group II) using a computer-generated simple randomization scheme. Four subjects were assigned to Group I to receive 400 IU/d of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for 8 weeks, and five subjects were assigned to Group II to receive 2,000 IU/d of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for 8 weeks. After signing a consent form and receiving the supplement, one subject from group I refused further participating in the study. The eight remaining subjects included 3 subjects in group I and 5 subjects in group II who received vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for 8 weeks and were assigned to the final analysis for studying the effect of vitamin D supplementation on broad gene expression. Based on vitamin D status at baseline, 4 subjects were vitamin D deficient and the other four subjects were insufficient or sufficient. Comparing gene expression in these two groups (deficient vs. insufficient or sufficient) led us to study the effect of vitamin D status on broad gene expression. The consent form was signed before the subjects were given the supplement so that we could evaluate the influence of vitamin D status and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on genome wide expression in white blood cells.

Total RNA was isolated using QIAGEN's RNeasy kit as described in manual (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For each sample, integrity was verified using RNA 6000 Nano Assay RNA chips run in Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). RNA was reverse transcribed using Whole Transcript cDNA Synthesis kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The obtained antisense cRNA was purified using GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and used as a template for reverse transcription (Whole Transcript cDNA Synthesis kit, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) to produce single-stranded DNA in the sense orientation. During this step dUTP was incorporated. DNA was then fragmented using uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE 1) and labeled with DNA Labeling Reagent that is covalently linked to biotin using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT, Whole Transcript Terminal Labeling kit, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).

Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA) algorithm was used to generate gene-level data.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Real time &#x02013;PCR verification</title><p>The cDNA was then used to check for the gene expression of four specific genes, via qRT-PCR. This was done in duplicate, so that a total of 32 samples were tested for each gene (2&#x000d7;16 samples). This was accomplished by adding 2.5 uL of each of the 16 samples into a 96-well plate. 22.5 uL of the TaqMan Master Mix was then added to each sample in the plate. The TaqMan Master Mix (per sample) included 12.5 uL of 2&#x000d7; TaqMan, 1.25 uL of oligonucleotide ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and 8.75 uL H2O. The expression of an 18S rRNA was also tested. Since the 18S gene is expressed in all cells it was used as an endogenous control. Each 96-well plate was covered and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm and 4oC for 5 minutes. After spinning the plate was put into the Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system to check for gene expression. The total run time for each plate in the StepOnePlus was about 40 min.

Since each subject had two samples (baseline and follow-up visits), a total of 16 samples were analyzed and linked to experimental factors of supplementation and time. All 16 arrays were normalized with the RMA method as described above. For data quality control regarding the similarity of the samples within and between the groups, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was used. Microarray data normalization was conducted to correct for the mean intensity for each array. To identify the differentially expressed genes before versus after supplementation and between two kinds of supplementation (400 IUs or 2000 IUs), a 2-way ANOVA in the linear model was applied. To assess the results, the p&#x0003c;0.01 was used as a cutoff due a small sample size. Also all subjects were classified based on basal levels of 25(OH)D. Four subjects were vitamin D deficient with 25(OH)D of 16&#x000b1;3.8 ng/ml and the other four subjects were insufficient or sufficient <xref rid="pone.0058725-Holick2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> with a 25(OH)D of 27.6&#x000b1;5.4 ng/ml.</p><p>It is standard practice in biostatistics to use a p value threshold of 0.05 for the decision as to whether a difference is significant or not.

Thus in this study the level of statistical significance was defined as alpha &#x0003c;0.01 i,e. there was a 1% maximum chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no association between vitamin D supplementation and genetic expression. The FDR &#x0003c;0.1, (False Discovery Rate) was applied to a list of genes, not any particular gene.

Two of the genes that had reduced expression; the cluster of differentiation 83(CD83) (2-fold) and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3)(1.5-fold) that are known to affect immune function also were found to have reduced expression by real-time PCR.</p><p>Our observation that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation increased serum 25(OH)D levels resulting in the suppression of CD83 (2-fold) is consistent with the observation that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> inhibited CD83 expression in cultured dendritic cells<xref rid="pone.0058725-BartosikPsujek1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

The current observation showed the specific pattern for broad gene expression of vitamin D deficiency and significant changes with increases in serum levels of 25(OH)D. Although larger studies are required to explain the clinically relevant gene expression patterns, the present genome-wide microarray study in human buffy coat for the first time identified a wide range of critical regulatory and metabolic pathways influenced by vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation that supports the vitamin D immunomodulatory effects and potential role in response to stress and DNA repair.</p><p>The major limitation of the study is the small number of subjects studied and thus the results are reported as an exploratory study. Although gene expression was determined with a suitable false discovery rate only a few of the 291 vitamin D responsive genes were verified by real time PCR.

An additional strength was provided by the real-time PCR analysis of two genes CD83 and TNFAIP3 from the 66 gene pool that were affected by vitamin D status and two genes KLF10 and SBDS from the 291 gene pool that were affected by vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058725-g004">Figure 4</xref>) that corroborated the microarray expression of these four genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058725-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this is the first report to reveal how vitamin D status and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation affects gene expression in healthy adults.
