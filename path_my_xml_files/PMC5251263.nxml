We investigated whether using telemedicine support (TMS) would permit hospital discharge after 1&#x02009;day without loss of self-assessed quality of life, loss of functionality, increased anxiety, increased rates of re-admission, or increased rates of complications after hip replacement.</p><p><bold>Patients and methods</bold> &#x02014; We performed a randomized controlled trial involving 72 Danish patients in 1 region who were referred for elective fast-track total hip replacement between August 2009 and March 2011 (654 were screened for eligibility). Half of the patients received a telemedicine solution connected to their TV. The patients were followed until 1 year after surgery.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> &#x02014; Length of stay was reduced from 2.1 days (95% CI: 2.0&#x02013;2.3) to 1.1&#x02009;day (CI: 0.9&#x02013;1.4; p &#x0003c; 0.001) with the TMS intervention. Health-related quality of life increased in both groups, but there were no statistically significant differences between groups. There were also no statistically significant differences between groups regarding timed up-and-go test and Oxford hip score at 3-month follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the rates of complications and re-admissions were similar between the groups, but the number of postoperative hospital contacts was lower in the TMS group.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold> &#x02014; Length of postoperative stay was shortened in patients with the TMS solution, without compromising patient-perceived or clinical parameters in patients undergoing elective fast-track surgery. These results indicate that telemedicine can be of value in fast-track treatment of patients undergoing total hip replacement.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Fast-track regimes can reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) (Gulotta et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Pivec et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Kehlet. <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Glassou et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Winther et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Reduced LOS, however, makes it more challenging for healthcare providers to logistically coordinate tasks involving education and training of the patients. The physical and psychological stress response of the patient on the first day postoperatively&#x02014;often combined with intake of opioids (Krenk et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>)&#x02014;challenges practical education and increases learning difficulties in patients.</p><p>In fast-track total hip replacement (THR) procedures, preoperative education of the patients has become standard (Husted et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>, Raphael et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Gulotta et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Different guidelines on how to make written information understandable have been described (Rud et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, NHS <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Reviews have concluded that there is little evidence to support the use of preoperative education in THR and total knee replacement procedures (McDonald et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, Aydin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). There have been no studies examining the use of telemedicine support (TMS) in conjunction with THR and its effects on LOS, adverse outcome, physical outcome, anxiety, hip-related function, pain, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).</p><p>We conducted a study to determine whether a novel and multifaceted TMS intervention would facilitate early discharge of patients undergoing THR without negative effects on clinical safety, physical outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes. Here we report the results of this randomized, controlled clinical trial with consecutive enrollment of patients who were referred for elective fast-track total hip replacement and with 12-month follow-up. We describe the effect of the novel TMS platform used as intervention.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0002"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>We performed a randomized, controlled clinical trial with 12-month follow-up. We consecutively enrolled patients who were undergoing elective fast-track THR. The novel TMS platform was used as the intervention.</p><p>The Remote Rehabilitation and Support project and the randomized clinical trial took place at the orthopedic department of a Danish urban teaching hospital from August 2009 through February 2012. The study was performed in accordance with the CONSORT Statement. Patients who were planned to undergo first-time elective THR were consecutively invited to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were a distance to the hospital of more than 60&#x02009;km, previous hip surgery of any kind, mental disability, inability to communicate in Danish, having no support person, and having no internet connection.</p><sec id="s0003"><title>Telemedicine intervention</title><p>Organizational innovation and the development of the telemedicine support were based on a need-driven innovation and participatory design approach (Greenbaum and Kyng <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). The intervention was performed in cooperation with CareTech Innovation, which is part of Alexandra Institute, Aarhus University, Denmark. It involved computer scientists, ethnographers, and architects. The needs addressed were documented using observation studies and interviews with patients and relatives.</p><p>A dedicated network from Silkeborg Regional Hospital (RHS) was connected to a multi-protocol label-switching (MPLS) network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The server, located at CareTech, used the same MPLS and the connection to each patient&#x02019;s home made use of an ADSL internet connection. At the patient&#x02019;s home we use a Wi-Fi network using a Check Point Wi-Fi router (Check Point Software Technologies Inc., San Carlos, CA) dedicated to the telemedicine solution.</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The network used in the RRS study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="iort-88-41.F01"/></fig><p>Logistic limitations and needs for optimizing the standard fast-track procedure were defined by staff from all departments working with fast-track THR. This was done in a multidisciplinary workshop. Participants defined just below 200 specific ways of optimizing the existing fast-track procedures. As part of the innovation and design process, hardware and software prototypes were developed and presented for patients and healthcare providers. Most prototypes were rejected at an early stage. The main goal of the information material was to address as many of the patients&#x02019; needs as possible. We created the material to match a possible low degree of health literacy (Gazmararian et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), focusing on the use of visualization and minimal use of text, and included elements of exposure and computer-aided cognitive behavioral therapy (Kaltenthaler et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) to minimize preoperative anxiety; we used the Illeris model for learning (Illeris <xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TB1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>The telemedicine solution worked as a box for the TV set and covered the material listed</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Interactive written information</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">With added speak and visualizations</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Animation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A narrative story with elements of exposure.

All patients were invited to and participated in a 2-hour group information meeting an average of 14 days before surgery. After the information meeting, the patients were informed about the outcome of the randomization. The patients were then introduced to the content of the study and the data collection procedure. The intervention group was introduced to the telemedicine platform and some of its features. They were instructed on how to set up the telemedicine solution in their home and how to use it. They were also informed about the goal of one day of hospitalization, and they were informed that we would try to motivate them but not force them to achieve that goal. They were informed that the use of the telemedicine support was voluntary but that it would be relevant for them to see some of the information films before surgery.</p><p>The patients were hospitalized at the same ward on the day of surgery. The same surgeon performed all operations. Spinal anesthesia was used for all patients, and wound infiltration was done during the final stage of the operation. The goals regarding treatment of blood loss, pain, and nausea&#x02014;as well as nutritional advice and mobilization&#x02014;were identical for all patients, and followed the Danish guidelines for THR.</p><p>At the outpatient clinic, the patients were seen by the physiotherapist. The patients using TMS returned the telemedicine equipment on day 90 and the internet connection was terminated. The primary outcome measure (LOS) was validated using the electronic health record. Among the supplementary outcomes were HRQoL, assessed with EQ-5D-3L. The Oxford hip score (OHS) was used to assess hip-related function and pain; function and pain was scored from baseline (2 weeks preoperatively) to the follow-up visit at 12 months. Furthermore, timed up-and-go (TUG) (Podsiadlo and Richardson <xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) and anxiety measured in mm on a visual analog scale (VAS) were recorded from baseline to the follow-up visit 3 months later. To evaluate a range of psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology that could theoretically affect the outcome, we used the validated symptom check-list 90 R (SCL-90-R) (Olsen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) at baseline. Data were collected in a study folder, which was returned at the 3-month follow-up. Data from follow-up at 6 and 12 months were obtained from the patients by post. Information about complications was validated using the Danish online e-Health Portal, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Sundhed.dk">www.Sundhed.dk</ext-link>), accessible through the local electronic health record.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Statistics</title><p>Calculation of sample size was based on a simulation of LOS. The simulation was based on distribution of patients and maximum LOS was set at 5 days. The calculations resulted in a sample size of 74.

The results also indicated that tasks and responsibilities for care can be assigned to patients without weakening the patients&#x02019; perceptions of an improved HRQoL. LOS cannot be regarded as a single primary outcome (Larsen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), but must be seen in relation to other outcome measures. To emphasize the importance of maintaining quality of treatment, we selected HRQoL as a primary outcome together with LOS. All outcomes in our study indicated that the 2 groups had a similar positive development over time, with some insignificant differences in favor of telemedicine support.</p><p>The fast-track procedure in THR has gained a strong foothold in the northern European countries, where patients are normally discharged directly to their own home (Husted et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The overall re-admission rate for THR in Denmark in 2011 was 5.4% (Overgaard 2012). No clear link has been found between short LOS and rate of re-admission (Husted et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>, Pivec et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Glassou et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). 2 American studies have indicated that there is a connection between a decrease in LOS and an increase in the rates of discharge to post-acute care and re-admission rates of up to 25% in the USA (Cram et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Wolf et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). We have found no explanation for these differences between countries.</p><p>It is difficult to conclude that the existing patient education program met the needs of the patients and there relatives. The program did follow the guidelines, and was evaluated extensively and considered "best practice" by the research group. Also, it is not possible to determine whether it was the new content, the way the content was distributed, or a combination of both that led to the results obtained with the TMS.</p><p>We have not found any papers that have documented the effect of telemedicine in patients undergoing THR. 1 study on patients undergoing a total knee replacement (TKR) found that "participants in the tele-rehabilitation group achieved outcomes comparable to those of the conventional rehabilitation group" at 6 weeks (Russell et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>We learned about the patients&#x02019; needs using observational studies and interviews. With that knowledge, we made a visual and simple interactive telemedicine solution containing educational material inspired by the Illeris model for learning (Illeris <xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and a didactic method accommodating anxiety, degree of health literacy, and elements of computer-aided cognitive behavioral therapy. The simplicity of the support, the emphasis on selecting and presenting information based on needs, and the possibility of creating close personal contact between the healthcare providers and the patient might explain our findings. The better connection between patient and hospital, and easy access to information, may be the reasons for being able to discharge 94% of the TMS patients on day 1 after major surgery&#x02014;without any increase in adverse effects and with a lower number of contacts with the hospital compared to the control group.</p><p>Our study, using novel technology as part of a multifaceted intervention, had many limitations. We tried to minimize selection bias using broad inclusion criteria and consecutive inclusion. Of the outpatient clinic patients who lived closer than 60&#x02009;km from the hospital, almost 90% were excluded because they were not candidates for hip surgery. Of the candidates, close to 20% refused to participate&#x02014;and we do not know the cause. Patients who declined to participate may not have felt comfortable using a telemedicine solution. The risk of being randomized to be discharged after only 1&#x02009;day of hospitalization might also feel challenging for some patients. Thus, we most likely studied a selected group of patients with a higher level of self-efficacy.</p><p>We found it impossible to establish blinding in this study, except from when conducting the TUG test. Those who conducted TUG were not informed about the patients&#x02019; randomization before testing. With TUG, we used a physical test that might not be regarded as first choice in patients undergoing THR with an average age of 63 years (Bohannon <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). But we found it easy to use, and chose to do the last test 3 months after surgery when the recovery period could still affect the outcome. The use of questionnaires and data from the electronic health record also minimized bias. We tried to avoid a contamination effect. However, ruling out of a contamination effect&#x02014;for example, by not favoring the control group&#x02014;was not possible. The discharge criteria were identical in both groups, and the staff were well informed. The decision about whether a patient fulfilled the criteria was managed by a small group of healthcare providers. The patients were informed about the criteria, and knew that they could stay in hospital if they were not ready to be discharged, but no-one wished to stay after being encouraged to leave. The fact that some patients in the control group were discharged after only 1&#x02009;day indicates that the guidelines were followed. The TMS group was informed about the use of the solution preoperatively, and had seen the animation of the procedure before filling in baseline data. We believe that the tendency to have a lower level of anxiety and better HRQoL at baseline in the TMS group can be explained by this. A small pilot test including patients undergoing THR with preoperative education confirmed this tendency. Patients who saw the animations after receiving preoperative education scored better on anxiety (on VAS) than those who do not. We are now conducting a study on a new and updated version of the TMS, with more animations. We have no explanation for the difference in the distribution of patients who had a job or were retired. However, this may have influenced the results in favor of the intervention.</p><p>There are many topics to be assessed in future fast-track studies (Kehlet and Soballe <xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). No previous studies appear to have addressed the need for more research using an evidence-based approach to educate fast-track patients, the effect of actively including relatives or support persons in fast-track procedures, the need for studies on organizational innovation, or the need for research in the use of health-IT or telemedicine in connection with fast-track procedures.</p><p>Most governments in the western world have included health-IT and digitalization of the healthcare system as a way of reducing costs and reducing waste (Blumenthal <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, EU. <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and such knowledge is now being shared (European Commision, Bhanoo <xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, Blumenthal and Dixon, <xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). More researchers, clinicians, and decision-makers must recognize that health-IT can create new ways of treating diseases&#x02014;including orthopedic conditions. There is a need for more and stronger evidence, a focus on health technology assessments, and inclusion of different research methods to innovate and meet healthcare challenges. We hope that this study will inspire researchers to look into the use of telemedicine for patients with orthopedic conditions, and also in other areas of surgery that have a strong need for education, rehabilitation, and support. We believe that it is possible to maintain high quality and to perhaps reduce length of stay and the risk of readmission even more.</p><p>MSV had full access to all of the data in the study and took responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
