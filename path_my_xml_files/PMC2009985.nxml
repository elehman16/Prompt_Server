DNCB+ patients were more likely to respond to either therapy, but no other test was predictive of response. In the follow-up period all chemotherapy patients had a reduction in white-cell count which was significantly greater in those responding to treatment. None of the other tests (phytohaemagglutinin response, immunoglobulins G, A and M, or Mantoux test) demonstrated changes that could be related to treatment or response, but there was a gradual unexplained fall in IgM levels in all groups the study progressed. It is concluded that the chemotherapeutic regimen (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil) is relatively non-immunosuppressive, and that hormonal therapy (oophorectomy, tamoxifen or androgens) had no detectable effect on the immune response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00152-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="676" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00152-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="677" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00152-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="678" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00152-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="679" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00152-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="680" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
