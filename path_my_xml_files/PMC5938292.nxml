[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] This has led to important changes in national guidelines which recommend the increased use of CCTA in patients with stable chest pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, CCTA images visualize more than just the heart, and noncardiac findings can be an important cause of symptoms or require further investigation and management. With the increased use of CCTA, it is important to understand the downstream consequences of such noncardiac findings.</p><p id="Par12">The follow-up of incidental lung nodules identified on computed tomography (CT) is dependent on local, national and international guidelines. In the SCOT-HEART trial, the 2005 Fleischner Society guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] were used to provide recommendations regarding lung nodule follow-up. These have recently been superseded by the 2015 British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the 2017 Fleischner Society guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Trials of CT screening in patients at high risk of lung cancer have also established that CT of the chest can identify early lung cancers and reduce mortality in a cost-effective manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. CCTA is often performed in patients with risk factors similar to those screened for lung cancer, such as smokers over the age of 55 years. Therefore, it is important to identify lung nodules on CCTA which may require further investigation and management.</p><p id="Par13">In this substudy of the SCOT-HEART trial, we assessed the frequency and follow-up of noncardiac findings. In addition, we assessed the impact of changes in lung nodule follow-up guidelines on downstream investigations and costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par14">The SCOT-HEART study was a multicentre randomized control trial of the use of CCTA in outpatients with suspected angina due to coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The primary results of the SCOT-HEART study have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Briefly, 4,146 patients who attended the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic were randomized to standard care or CT plus standard care, and followed up for symptoms, management and outcomes. Of these, 2,073 patients were randomized to CCTA, of whom 1,778 underwent CCTA. CCTA and non-contrast imaging for calcium scoring were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and this included a full field of view reconstruction of the chest in addition to CCTA reconstructions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessment of noncardiac findings</title><p id="Par15">The presence of noncardiac findings was assessed on CCTA images focused on the heart, and also on the wide field of view images reconstructed to cover the entire scanned volume. In patients with partially imaged noncardiac findings identified at the time of scanning, a further full thoracic scan was not immediately performed, but could be subsequently recommended by the reporting radiologist. Images were reconstructed with standard soft tissue and lung reconstruction algorithms from each scanner. The reporting radiologist used soft tissue, lung and bone windowing parameters to view the images, with further manual adjustment as required.</p><p id="Par16">Noncardiac findings were recorded by the reporting radiologist and the results were provided to the clinical team along with the CCTA results. Whether noncardiac findings were the cause of the patient&#x02019;s symptoms was assessed on a four-point scale (&#x02018;yes&#x02019;, &#x02018;probable&#x02019;, &#x02018;unlikely&#x02019; or &#x02018;no&#x02019;). Clinically significant noncardiac findings were defined as those causing symptoms (&#x02018;yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;probable&#x02019;) or incidental findings requiring further investigation, follow-up or treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessment of lung nodules</title><p id="Par17">Recommendations for lung nodule follow-up were provided to clinicians according to the 2005 Fleischner Society guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We assessed the potential change to the management of lung nodules if the 2015 BTS guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the 2017 Fleischner Society guidelines had been applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The lungs were assessed on wide field of view images reconstructed using a standard lung reconstruction algorithm. Lung nodule diameter was measured as the maximum diameter in any transverse projection, rounded to the nearest millimetre. Lung nodule volume was determined using Carestream Vue PACS (version 11; Carestream Health, Rochester, NY).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Follow-up of noncardiac findings</title><p id="Par18">Information on subsequent investigations for noncardiac findings were obtained from electronic health records. Information on clinic consultations were obtained from electronic health records or paper records where required.

In 118 (59%) of the patients with lung nodules, semiautomated measurement of nodule volume was possible. The median lung nodule volume was 55 mm<sup>3</sup> (IQR 32&#x02013;116 mm<sup>3</sup>). Volume measurements were not possible in the remaining patients due to the small size of the lesions, proximity to structures of similar density, such as the pleura or diaphragm, or technical reasons.</p><p id="Par27">Follow-up imaging for lung nodule assessment was recommended in 126 patients (7% of those undergoing CCTA). One patient died before follow-up imaging could be performed and 40 patients (20% of those with lung nodules) did not undergo follow-up imaging due to physician or patient choice. Thus 85 patients (4.7% of those undergoing CCTA) underwent CT follow-up for lung nodules. The median follow-up duration was 12 months (IQR 7&#x02013;19 months) and the median number of CT scans performed was 1 (IQR 1&#x02013;2). The first follow-up CT scan was performed at a median of 7 months after the initial CCTA scan (IQR 3.5&#x02013;9.0 months), the second at 14 months (IQR 10.3&#x02013;20.8 months), the third at 24 months (IQR 15&#x02013;25.5 months) and the fifth at 31 months (IQR 26.8&#x02013;35.3 months).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Application of new lung nodule guidelines</title><p id="Par28">The 2015 BTS guidelines suggest that no follow-up is required for lung nodules &#x0003c;5 mm or &#x0003c;80 mm<sup>3</sup>.

The 2017 Fleischner Society guidelines suggest that no follow-up is required for lung nodules of &#x0003c;6 mm or &#x0003c;100 mm<sup>3</sup>. In the SCOT-HEART study this means that 78 fewer scans would have been performed in 53 patients, all of whom were subsequently discharged from follow-up without evidence of malignancy.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par30">Although noncardiac findings on CCTA are common, only one quarter of these are clinically significant. Occasionally, these findings identify an important treatable cause of the patient&#x02019;s chest pain but usually they represent important incidental findings that require surveillance, especially lung nodules. The application of new guidelines for lung nodule assessment will reduce the number of follow-up CT scans required in these patients, without the risk of missing malignancy identified during screening, and will significantly reduce the cost of follow-up imaging.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Frequency and implications of noncardiac findings</title><p id="Par31">The frequency of noncardiac findings in patients undergoing CCTA varies widely, and depends on the classification of findings and the population profile, such as age and frequency of smoking habit. A systematic review identified an average prevalence of 41% for noncardiac findings and 16% for clinically significant findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our rates of noncardiac findings and significant findings were similar but slightly lower at 38% and 10%, respectively. This was possibly due to the wide inclusion criteria of the SCOT-HEART study, and the focus on a narrow detector range reducing both radiation dose and the scanned body volume.</p><p id="Par32">Causes of chest pain can be challenging to diagnose. Patients in the SCOT-HEART trial were referred because of concern that they had angina pectoris due to coronary heart disease. In the CCTA group, ultimately 696 patients (33%) were diagnosed with this condition. In contrast, only a further 55 patients (3%) were diagnosed with alternative conditions that accounted for their symptoms including pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and cancer. This suggests a very modest rate of noncardiac causes of chest pain in this population. However, some of these noncardiac causes of chest pain are serious and potentially life-threatening, underlining the importance of full and comprehensive scan reporting including noncardiac structures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Lung nodule follow-up</title><p id="Par33">The lungs were the commonest location of noncardiac findings in the SCOT-HEART study. This is similar to the findings of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and was largely driven by the prevalence of emphysema and lung nodules. The link between cardiovascular disease and respiratory diseases, such as emphysema, is complex and includes shared risk factors such as smoking and chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of death from cancer worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) recruited asymptomatic participants aged 55 to 74 years, with a 30 pack-year smoking history and who were current smokers or had stopped smoking in the previous 15 years. The NLST identified a 20% (95% CI 6.8&#x02013;26.7; <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) relative reduction in lung cancer mortality among 26,722 patients undergoing low-dose CT screening as compared with 26,732 patients undergoing plain radiography chest screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The NELSON study recruited 15,822 patients aged 50 to 75 years, who had smoked &#x02265;15 cigarettes per day for &#x02265;25 years or &#x02265;10 cigarettes per day for &#x02265;30 years and who were current smokers or had ceased smoking in the previous 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Participants were randomized 1:1 to CT screening or standard care. Early reports identified a beneficial effect of a screening interval of 2 years compared with 2.5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but at the time of this report the full trial results were awaited. The UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) trial recruited 249,988 participants aged 50 to 75 years who had a &#x02265;5% 5-year lung cancer risk based on the Liverpool Lung Project version 2 risk prediction model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Participants were randomized 1:1 to CT screening or standard care. Pilot results showed that lung cancer could be identified at an early stage with potentially curative treatment possible in over 80% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, at the time of this report the full results were also awaited.</p><p id="Par35">The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual CT lung cancer screening in people aged 55 to 80 years, with a 30 pack-year history, and who were current smokers or had stopped smoking within the past 15 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The proportion of patients with lung nodules in the SCOT-HEART study was lower than in the lung cancer screening trials. This is probably partly due to the lower risk in the SCOT-HEART population, which included younger patients and nonsmokers. In addition, only part of the lungs are imaged on the wide field of view reconstruction from CCTA images as the scan range is selected to cover just the length of the heart rather than the full thorax. CCTA therefore does not image the upper parts of the lungs, a frequent location for lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>New lung nodule follow-up guidelines</title><p id="Par36">The new revised lung nodule follow-up guidelines have changed the threshold for lung nodules that require follow-up. In the 2015 BTS guidelines, no follow-up is required for &#x0201c;clearly benign lesions&#x0201d;, lesions &#x0003c;5 mm maximum diameter or lesions &#x0003c;80 mm<sup>3</sup> volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the 2017 Fleischner guidelines, no follow-up is required for single nodules &#x0003c;6 mm average diameter or &#x0003c;100 mm<sup>3</sup> volume, but nodules with &#x0201c;suspicious&#x0201d; morphology or located in the upper lobe may be considered for a follow-up scan at 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both new guidelines include the assessment of lung nodule volume rather than diameter as a potentially more reproducible method of assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, the value of automated lung nodule volume measurement is limited as only 59% of patients with lung nodules could be assessed in our study. In addition, whether maximum or average diameter is used may also affect the results. We retrospectively applied these diameter and volume criteria to the SCOT-HEART data which means we may have underestimated the benefit of the 2015 BTS guidelines and overestimated the benefit of the 2017 Fleischer guidelines. Nevertheless, we have shown that the application of these guidelines would lead to significant cost savings.</p><p id="Par37">Previous studies have shown that the direct cost of imaging for significant incidental findings are between US$438 and US$606 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The cost of follow-up imaging for significant noncardiac findings was lower in the SCOT-HEART study than in previous studies with a cost per patient of &#x000a3;10.06 averaged across all patients undergoing CCTA. However, there were significant differences in the healthcare systems involved in previous studies and therefore these figures are not directly comparable. There may also have been differences in the classification of significant noncardiac findings, in &#x02013;the estimation of costs and in follow-up guidelines. In addition, the total cost of follow-up in the SCOT-HEART study should also include downstream clinic attendances and other nonimaging investigations which were not included in this estimate. The use of the national picture archiving system (PACS), that has been available in Scotland since 2008, for follow-up imaging means that any imaging performed in Scotland can be identified. However, a small number of patients may be missing if they have moved out of Scotland.</p><p id="Par38">It is interesting to note that 20% of patients in whom subsequent imaging for lung nodule assessment was recommended did not undergo further imaging. This is a limitation of this study, but does highlight the real-world implications of the identification of noncardiac findings on CCTA. A variety of factors have been found to influence referral for further imaging including patient and physician factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">Significant noncardiac findings occur in 10% of patients undergoing CCTA for suspected angina due to coronary heart disease. Occasionally, these findings identify an important treatable cause of the patient&#x02019;s chest pain but usually they represent important incidental findings that require surveillance, especially lung nodules. The application of new guidelines for lung nodule assessment will reduce the number of follow-up CT scans required in these patients, without the risk of missing malignancy identified during screening, and will significantly reduce the cost of follow-up imaging.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Guarantor</title><p id="Par40">The scientific guarantor of this publication is Professor David Newby.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par41">The authors of this manuscript declare relationships with the following companies.
