To increase physical activity, technology-based platforms are emerging and provide intriguing opportunities to prescribe and monitor active lifestyle interventions. The &#x0201c;Interval Walking in Colorectal Cancer&#x0201c;(I-WALK-CRC) study explores the feasibility and efficacy a home-based interval-walking intervention delivered by a smart-phone application in order to improve cardio-metabolic health profile among CRC survivors.

Patients who had completed surgery for local stage disease and patients who had completed surgery and any adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced stage disease were eligible for inclusion. Between October 1st<sup>,</sup> 2015, and February 1st<sup>,</sup> 2017, 136 inquiries were recorded; 83 patients were eligible for enrollment, and 42 patients accepted participation. Age and employment status were associated with participation, as participants were significantly younger (60.5 vs 70.8 years, P&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001) and more likely to be working (OR 5.04; 95%CI 1.96&#x02013;12.98, P&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001) than non-participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, recruitment of CRC survivors was feasible but we aim to better the recruitment rate in future studies.

Thus, CRC survivors who adhere to the current recommendation of at least 150&#x0202f;min of moderate intensity physical activity per week (approx. 9 MET-hours) have been shown to have 10&#x02013;40% lower CRC specific mortality and 20&#x02013;50% lower overall mortality relative to their sedentary counterparts [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Over the last decade, strong evidence has demonstrated positive effects of exercise interventions in cancer survivors including improved cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], muscle function [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], body composition [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and health related quality of life [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Typically, exercise-oncology trials have prescribed supervised hospital-based training as feasible and effective health promoting strategies, but important intra-diagnostic differences have been observed. For example, the Physical Activity during Cancer Treatment study [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] aimed to include 300 patients with early stage breast (target n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;150) and colon cancer (target n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;150) exploring an 18-week supervised exercise intervention compared to usual care. After three years, the study closed having included more than 200 breast cancer patients [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and only 33 colon cancer patients, but nonetheless an improvement was observed in physical fatigue among the CRC survivors [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similar reports observed positive effects on cardiovascular fitness [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and metabolic profile [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in CRC survivors, and this emphasizes the potential to improve physiological and patient-reported outcomes in this patient group. However, low accrual rates to traditional hospital-based exercise interventions comprise an ongoing challenge for CRC survivors.</p><p id="p0020">To address this issue, recent studies have explored the safety, feasibility and efficacy of various home-based strategies, including telephone phone-based counseling [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] in-home treadmill-interventions [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and home-based programs with personal exercise trainers [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Simultaneously, a rapid development in smart-phone application technology has created a novel platform for clinicians and researchers to deliver and monitor health promoting strategies including physical activity [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recently, the smart-phone application, <italic>InterWalk</italic> [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], was developed to disseminate an interval-walking-program to Danish patients with diabetes. The InterWalk-application delivers a home-based interval-walking program of interchanging fast-and-slow cycles: 3&#x0202f;min of fast walking followed by 3&#x0202f;min of slow walking. This program was based on studies showing that interval-walking was associated with high adherence and significant improvements in cardio-pulmonary fitness, plasma lipid-profile, glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in patients with type-2 diabetes [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These cardiometabolic health factors are linked to the risk of disease recurrence and mortality in CRC survivors [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and are therefore important targets for life-style intervention trials in this population. Accordingly, the &#x0201c;Interval-Walking in Colorectal Cancer&#x0201c; (I-WALK-CRC) study was designed to explore the InterWalk-application as a health promoting intervention in CRC survivors.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Aims of this report</title><p id="p0025">We here describe the aims, study design, and methodology of the I-WALK-CRC study: a randomized controlled feasibility trial.

The primary outcome is difference in baseline-to-week12 change in VO<sub>2peak</sub> in an intervention group (receiving 12&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;12 weeks InterWalk) compared to a waiting-list control group (receiving 12 weeks usual care followed by 12 weeks InterWalk). Key secondary outcomes are feasibility evaluated by inclusion rate (above 50% of eligible patients), attrition rate (below 20%); and adherence rate (above 75% of the prescribed program in none-drop out participants). Explorative outcomes include baseline-to-week12 changes in body weight and composition; plasma concentration levels of cholesterols, triglycerides, insulin, glucose and inflammatory cytokines; and glycemic control, by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

Afterward the staff member showed how to manage the test-function and the training-function by thoroughly reviewing a user guide together with the participant. The InterWalk test-function [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] is an individual adaptation procedure where participants perform an incremental walking capacity test consisting of the following steps by audio-instructions: &#x0201d;Stand still&#x0201d; for 30&#x0202f;s; &#x0201d;walk slowly&#x0201d; for 2&#x0202f;min; &#x0201d;walk at medium pace&#x0201d; for 2&#x0202f;min; &#x0201d;walk fast&#x0201d; for 2&#x0202f;min; &#x0201d;walk as fast as you can&#x0201d; for 1&#x0202f;min, and finally&#x0201d; stand still&#x0201d; for 1&#x0202f;min to conclude the test. The InterWalk-training function hereafter instructs repeating cycles of 3&#x0202f;min &#x02018;slow walking&#x02019; and 3&#x0202f;min &#x02018;fast walking&#x02019;. The target-intensity for the different levels were determined from the test-function with the &#x0201d;slow walking&#x0201d; intensity corresponding to the average of the participants' walking speed during the &#x0201d;<italic>walk slowly</italic>&#x0201d; phase and the &#x0201c;<italic>walk at medium pace</italic>&#x0201d; respectively. The &#x0201c;fast walking&#x0201d; intensity in the training function corresponds to the average of the participants walking speed during the &#x0201c;walk a medium pace&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;walk fast&#x0201d; phase of the test. If participants walk too fast during slow intervals or too slow during fast intervals compared to the individualized walking paces, a speaker instructs the user to &#x0201c;<italic>walk slower</italic>&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;<italic>walk faster</italic>&#x0201d;, respectively. Participants were instructed to perform a new individualization test at least every third week to ensure progression in the program.

Despite a wealth of studies reporting a strong inverse association between physical activity level and survival in CRC survivors, this population has been found to be among the least physically active relative to other cancer diagnoses [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The I-WALK-CRC study will serve to explore the feasibility and efficacy of interval-walking exercise, delivered by a smart-phone application in CRC survivors, and will provide initial information on the health promoting potential of a home-based, un-supervised exercise intervention using on a technology-based platform.</p><p id="p0165">A key component of the study rationale was that a home-based walking exercise would appeal more to CRC survivors. We defined successful feasibility <italic>a priori</italic> to require an inclusion rate above 50% of eligible patients. We only just reached this threshold as 42 of 83 (51%) eligible participants were included for baseline assessment. 3 were subsequently excluded prior to randomization and the 39 participants were randomized over a period of approximately 16 months, which corresponded to a rate of 2.4 participants randomized per month. Several studies have described that recruiting CRC survivors into lifestyle modification studies can be challenging. For example, Pinto et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] implemented a variety of recruitment strategies (informational mailings, in-clinic recruitment, and community presentations), to explore a telephone-based intervention to increase physical activity and improve quality-of-life outcomes. The study required a sample size of 134 participants, but after 39 months, the study closed with 46 randomized participants (&#x0223c;1.5 per month). In comparison, the COURAGE trial [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a phase 2 study exploring different exercise doses, enrolled 39 colon cancer survivors over 7 months (5.4 participants per month), however this required information letters to be sent to over 1500 potential candidates derived from cancer registries. Despite larger setups in the above described studies, recruitment barriers seem to be present. Danish Colorectal Cancer Group has in 2015 registered more than 600 CRC operations at the 3 recruiting surgical departments [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] which correspond to more than 50 per month, and we only received 136 inquiries in 16 month which correspond to 8.5 every month. A barrier in the I-WALK-CRC study recruitment process was the dependency of the recruitment staff at the hospitals since their commitment to the project may vary. Many trials have found variability in the ability of staff to achieve high level of recruitment [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We can only speculate about reasons for the low recruitment rate. This may stem from a lack of perceived importance of the study question and/or lack of capacity among recruiting staff members, or evaluation conducted by clinicians at the hospitals concerning the project's potential relevance to individual patients. Consequently, we cannot determine to what extend the referred subjects represents the true background population of the CRC survivors.</p><p id="p0170">For the present study, in-clinic recruitment was chosen as the only strategy based on previous experiences emphasizing the importance of doctors' recommendation for exercise participation in cancer patients [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our inclusion rate was comparable to previous reports but required recruitment from 5 departments covering most of the greater Copenhagen area, which complicated the on-site monitoring by study personnel and increased the risk of missing potentially eligible subjects. One potential way to improve the recruitment barriers may be to intensify on-site monitoring by including fewer recruiting departments. This may lead to a change in the responsibility of the recruitment from the clinical staff to the study personnel, and hereby initiate a more intensive and effective recruitment.</p><p id="p0175">We further hypothesized that if the intervention was more appealing to CRC survivors, the risk of selection bias would be reduced and the enrolled sample would comprise a more representative subset of the background population. The mean age of all eligible subjects were 65.5 years, which closely mirrors the estimated median age for newly diagnosed CRC patients [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the mean age of participants was more than a decade lower than non-participants. Elderly patients are generally less likely to participate in exercise-oncology trials [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], however few studies have distinguished between candidates who are not-eligible due to various exclusion criteria (e.g. prevalence of co-morbidities associated with advanced age), and subjects who are actually eligible but elects not to participate. The true background population comprises all eligible subjects and this group is important to characterize in order to evaluate the external validity of a trial. Our finding that eligible subjects who declined participation were more than a decade older than participating subjects emphasizes the on-going challenge to adapt these types of interventions to elderly cancer survivors. It is possible, that the technology-based nature of our intervention may have particularly precluded elderly subjects. However, in direct comparison the entire group invited to participate in the COURAGE trial (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;1,433, mean age 68) were even older (13 years) than the population randomized (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;39, mean age 55 years) [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which suggests that age-discrepancy occurs across interventions with or without technology as a key component.</p><p id="p0180">We also found difference in employment status between participants and non-participants, with participants being more likely to work. This is most likely associated with the age-discrepancy, and is also consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Besides age and employment status, no other background characteristics were significantly associated with study participation. An important observation was that we enrolled approximately equal number of patients who had undergone surgery only, and patients who had also undergone adjuvant chemotherapy. Previous exercise trials have typically included most patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and less patients who had received surgery only. The general trend toward higher proportion of included patients who have undergone adjuvant chemotherapy likely stems from the motivation to use physical exercise to improve or accelerate the course of rehabilitation after chemotherapy. However the available epidemiological evidence have not shown differences between tumor stages regarding the relative reduction in overall- and CRC-specific mortality risk associated with high level of physical activity, and patients who have only received surgery report similar (low) physical activity level as patients who have received both surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. From this perspective, the need to develop feasible and effective exercise-strategies in patients receiving surgery only is of equal importance, but appears to be under-prioritized in current exercise-trials.</p><p id="p0185">Strengths of the I-WALK-CRC study include a novel technology-based intervention with a pragmatic aim of increasing physical activity level to 150&#x0202f;min per week as per standard guidelines. The study includes gold-standard assessments of participants cardio-metabolic health profile, including CPET, DXA-scan, OGTT, and PRO assessments, by blinded assessors, and will serve to determine the capacity of a walking-intervention to improve these outcomes.</p><p id="p0190">Limitations of the I-WALK-CRC study may be the enrollment of a heterogeneous population within a small sample size. While this may broadly represent the background population, some participants may be too fit to improve significantly from walking-based exercise, while others may struggle to perform the prescribed program of 150&#x0202f;min per week. Further, in the recruiting phase we did not assess to which extend potentially eligible CRC survivors were not informed of the study, either due to lack of time and resources in the clinics or due to &#x02018;pre-screening&#x02019; by the clinical personnel. Also, we do not have self-reported data on non-participants primary cancer site (colon or rectum cancer), and thus, it cannot be determined if this variable was associated with participation. Finally, we did not stratify subjects by weight/BMI, which may be an important mediating factor, and we can only speculate on to which extend any potential health improvements may be derived from weight loss or a direct effect of the exercise-intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><label>7</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0195">In the present study, recruitment of CRC survivors was feasible by in-hospital procedures, but the trial clearly favored younger participants. The I-WALK-CRC study will provide novel and important information regarding the feasibility and efficacy of home-based walking exercise in CRC survivors, who are highly underrepresented in the current exercise-oncology literature. These findings will contribute to determine the relevance and perspectives of a smart-phone application based exercise intervention can be applied as standard rehabilitation among CRC patients. If the present study documents significant improvements in cardio metabolic health outcomes, a large-scale RCT will be required to determine if these changes translate into clinical benefits. However, exploration of different recruitment methods is necessary to establish a more effective recruitment strategy in order to improve recruitment rates.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p id="p0200">The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="sref1">Colorectal cancer statistics World Cancer Research Fund International: WCRF International; [cited 2016 30th of November].
