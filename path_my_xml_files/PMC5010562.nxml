Further information was also requested from the manufacturers of the individual direct oral anticoagulants. Thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome is a potentially fatal and devastating disorder. Although the disorder is rare, antiphospholipid antibodies are thought to be present in 10% of patients with deep vein thrombosis, suggesting possible underdiagnosis of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. Warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists are the standard of care for the secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. These drugs, however, can be particularly problematic in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome because of variable sensitivity of thromboplastins to lupus anticoagulant, which is present in many of these patients. Consequently, the international normalised ratio (INR), which is used to monitor warfarin treatment, might not accurately reflect anticoagulation intensity. Two randomised controlled trials in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome have reported no benefits with high-intensity versus standard-intensity warfarin in the prevention of recurrent thrombosis. Rivaroxaban and other direct oral anticoagulants are effective and safe compared with warfarin for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. Although antiphospholipid antibody status was not systematically documented in randomised controlled trials of direct oral anticoagulants, it is likely that patients with antiphospholipid syndrome were included. In the Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (RAPS) non-inferiority trial, therefore, we aimed to confirm the usefulness of rivaroxaban in secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>RAPS is slightly larger than the two previous randomised controlled trials in patient with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, and our inclusion criteria enabled recruitment of a more homogeneous study population, that is, only patients with previous venous thromboembolism needing standard-intensity warfarin and none with arterial thrombosis related to antiphospholipid syndrome, which is not a licensed indication for direct oral anticoagulants. Because thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome is clinically heterogeneous, the homogeneity of our study population maximises the clinical applicability of our results. Thrombin generation allows assessment of the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and rivaroxaban despite these drugs' different modes of action. When assessed by endogenous thrombin potential ([ETP] ie, the are under curve) alone, rivaroxaban was inferior to warfarin in terms of anticoagulation intensity, but peak thrombin generation favoured rivaroxaban. Warfarin affects all thrombin generation parameters equally, whereas rivaroxaban mainly affects the initiation and propagation phases of thrombin generation. Formation of the prothrombinase complex is delayed and lag time and time to peak thrombin generation are prolonged and, therefore, the ETP is greater than would be expected for the degree of anticoagulation. Thus, the overall thrombogram indicated no increase in thrombotic risk with rivaroxaban. This conclusion was supported by concentrations of in-vivo coagulation activation markers being increased in only a few patients in both treatment groups, and the absence of new thrombotic events during 6 months of treatment. No major bleeding episodes were noted, and rivaroxaban was significantly associated with improved quality of life. Additionally, we found no evidence in in-vitro studies of antiphospholipid antibodies interfering with the anticoagulant action of rivaroxaban.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Rivaroxaban seems to offer an effective, safe, and convenient alternative to warfarin in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome who have had previous venous thromboembolism requiring standard-intensity warfarin therapy (ie, target INR 2&#x000b7;5, range 2&#x000b7;0&#x02013;3&#x000b7;0). The RAPS findings are applicable to this group of patients due to the homogeneity of the study population. An alternative to warfarin would be welcomed by these patients and their treating clinicians, particularly because of issues with variable sensitivity of thromboplastins to lupus anticoagulant and unstable INR needing frequent and unpredictable anticoagulant monitoring. Warfarin is also associated with risks of thrombosis or bleeding due to underanticoagulation and overanticoagulation, respectively. The RAPS trial, however, was designed with a laboratory surrogate outcome measure that reflects the mechanisms of action of the interventions because the large-scale, long-term clinical trials needed to assess recurrent venous thromboembolism are not feasible in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. The absence of new thrombosis or major bleeding and the low rate of clinically relevant bleeding indicate low risks in the subgroup of patients assessed and puts into context anecdotal reports in case studies and small case series of recurrent thrombosis after switching from warfarin to a direct oral anticoagulant in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. The small but significant improvement in the quality of life visual analoge score seen with rivaroxaban in RAPS is encouraging. Further studies are needed to define the role of direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, including those who need higher-intensity anticoagulation after recurrent thrombotic events while they were taking standard-intensity anticoagulation, and those with stroke or other arterial thrombosis.</p></boxed-text></p><p>We did the Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (RAPS) trial to investigate whether rivaroxaban would provide anticoagulation non-inferior to that achieved with standard-intensity warfarin in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus.

We used a modified intention-to-treat approach to include all randomised patients with assessable data in all analyses. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise patients' demographic, clinical, and other outcomes. We assessed the primary outcome with a regression model to estimate the difference in log-transformed ETP between rivaroxaban and warfarin at day 42, with a two-sided 95% CI, adjusted for stratification variables and baseline ETP. Estimates and 95% CIs on the log scale were back-transformed to the original scale (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 24</xref>). This approach was also used to analyse differences between treatment groups for secondary thrombin generation parameters (lag time, time to peak thrombin generation, and peak thrombin generation) in-vivo coagulation activation markers, and EQ-5D-5L.

Pearson's correlation coefficient, or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were used to explore relationships between ETP, INR, and laboratory measures of adherence.</p><p>Values lower than the lower limits of detection for thrombin generation parameters and rivaroxaban concentrations (ie, censored values) were excluded from the analysis because they cannot be handled in linear regression models.

The final day 42 visit, when laboratory outcomes were assessed, was on Dec 22, 2014, and the final day 210 visit, when clinical outcomes were assessed, was on June 8, 2015. 57 patients were assigned to receive rivaroxaban and 59 to receive warfarin, and all patients received their allocated treatments. Of these 116 patients, six (5%) did not contribute data for the primary outcome. Therefore, the primary analysis population included 110 patients (54 in the rivaroxaban group and 56 in the warfarin group). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). 11 patients in both groups had systemic lupus erythematosus. Four (3%) of 116 patients had other autoimmune rheumatic disorders. Numbers of withdrawals, losses to follow-up, and missing outcome data, and the number and proportion of cases excluded from the analyses by outcome measure and treatment group are shown in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 25&#x02013;27)</xref>.

The mean percentage change in ETP did not reach the non-inferiority threshold. By contrast, lag time and time to peak thrombin generation were significantly longer and the peak thrombin generation was significantly lower in patients taking rivaroxaban (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Examples of typical RAPS thrombograms are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>.

Of these, one and two, respectively, also had raised in-vivo coagulation activation markers at baseline.</p><p>Peak rivaroxaban concentrations in plasma at day 42 were at least 160 &#x003bc;g/L in 29 (51%) of 57 patients (&#x0003e;360 &#x003bc;g/L in three) and correlated negatively with ETP (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub>=&#x02013;0&#x000b7;5, 95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;7 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;2).

No patients required dose reductions or discontinuation of the allocated intervention because of drug-related toxic effects.

The numbers of other safety events (SAEs and clinically relevant or minor bleeding events) did not differ between groups.</p><p>Four SAEs were reported in patients taking rivaroxaban. Two were judged to be unrelated to the trial drug. The first was an intracranial haemorrhage that pre-dated the trial and was detected incidentally on brain imaging without any clinical or imaging indications of new or recurrent bleeding (grade 1). The second was an episode of abdominal pain, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia (grade 2). The other two SAEs were deemed unlikely to be related to the trial drug. The first of these was a suspected deep vein thrombosis at day 176, identified after the patient presented with leg pain and swelling on a background of chronic post-thrombotic lower limb swelling following a previous femoral deep vein thrombosis. A lower limb venous doppler scan showed changes related to the previous femoral vein deep vein thrombosis but no new thrombosis. Rivaroboxan was stopped while the patient received treatment with therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin, then restarted (grade 2). This episode was reported as an SAE because of the potential seriousness of the situation. The second of these SAEs was intestinal perforation (grade 4).</p><p>Four SAEs were reported in patients taking warfarin, three of which were judged to be unrelated to the trial drug: one patient had an acute exacerbation of asthma associated with an upper respiratory tract infection (grade 3), one had sepsis (grade 4), and one developed high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma stage IVB and subsequently died. The fourth patient had clinically relevant haemorrhoidal haemorrhage that was deemed probably to have been related to warfarin (grade 3 severe adverse reaction). No suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported. There were no treatment-related deaths.</p><p>EQ-5D-5L health utility scores did not differ between groups (mean difference 0&#x000b7;04, 95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;02 to 0&#x000b7;09, p=0&#x000b7;19; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). A small difference was seen between groups in the visual analogue health score, favouring the rivaroxaban group (mean difference 6&#x000b7;5, 95% CI 1&#x000b7;4&#x02013;11&#x000b7;5, p=0&#x000b7;013).</p></sec><sec id="cesec130"><title>Discussion</title><p>When anticoagulation intensity was assessed by percentage change in ETP alone, rivaroxaban was inferior to warfarin in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism. However, peak thrombin generation was lower with rivaroxaban and, therefore, the overall thrombogram indicated no difference in thrombotic risk. This conclusion is supported by in-vivo coagulation activation marker concentrations being raised in only a few patients in both treatment groups. Additionally, no new thrombotic events were seen during 6 months of treatment. No patients had major bleeds, and the frequencies of clinically relevant and minor bleeding were similar in the two groups. Quality of life, as measured with EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scores, was significantly better in the rivaroxaban group than in the warfarin group.</p><p>Rivaroxaban and warfarin both inhibit thrombin generation in patients with venous thromboembolism who do not have antiphospholipid syndrome,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> indicating effective anticoagulation. Inhibition of thrombin generation, which indicates effective anticoagulation, has also been shown in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome when taking warfarin.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> However, the mechanism of inhibition of thrombin generation differs for the two agents: warfarin reduces functional levels of vitamin-K-dependent coagulation factors, whereas rivaroxaban directly inhibits factor Xa through specific binding to its active site.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Warfarin, therefore, affects all phases of thrombin generation equally, whereas rivaroxaban mainly affects the initiation and propagation of thrombin generation, leading to a delay in formation of the prothrombinase complex.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> As a result, the thrombin generation curve becomes protracted, which in turn lengthens the lag time and time to peak thrombin generation,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and leads to greater ETP than would be expected for the degree of anticoagulation.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p><p>The differential effects of warfarin and rivaroxaban were reflected in the treatment effects in this study. On average, in patients who switched from warfarin to rivaroxaban, ETP increased by 100% and time to peak thrombin generation by 70%, whereas peak thrombin generation decreased by 40%. The higher ETP associated with rivaroxaban can be explained by altered reaction kinetics that do not affect thrombotic risk. This conclusion reflects the clinical findings in the phase 3 randomised controlled trials of direct oral anticoagulants,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> which are likely to have included patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>The findings for ETP and peak thrombin generation in RAPS patients at day 42 can be attributed to anticoagulation rather than antiphospholipid antibodies. Indeed, in vitro, the effects of antiphospholipid antibodies on thrombin generation are limited to prolongation of lag time and time to peak thrombin generation.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Our exploratory post-hoc analysis showed no significant interactions between the effects of rivaroxaban and lupus anticoagulant positivity on thrombin generation. Antiphospholipid antibodies might interfere with the anticoagulant action of direct oral anticoagulants, but we have shown no effect with rivaroxaban in in-vitro studies.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p>A limitation of RAPS is that it was not designed to confirm clinical efficacy and long-term safety. Rather, the trial was designed with a laboratory surrogate outcome measure to assess the mechanism of action of the interventions in these patients. A trial with a primary endpoint of recurrent thrombosis would require a sample of several thousand patients, which is unfeasible for patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, and a much longer follow-up period. There was an intended selection bias because we excluded patients who had had venous thromboembolism and developed recurrent events while taking standard-intensity anticoagulation (ie, needing higher-intensity anticoagulation) and those with arterial events. Thus, our cohort seemed to have antiphospholipid antibodies that caused clinical disease at the less aggressive end of the range seen in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. Nevertheless, limiting the selection of patients to those with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism leading to treatment with standard intensity warfarin ensured a clinically homogeneous study population which is in contrast to two previous, slightly smaller, randomised controlled trials.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This feature is an important strength of RAPS. Thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome is clinically heterogeneous, with the risk of recurrent thrombosis and intensity of anticoagulation being dependent on the clinical phenotype.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Thus, trials, such as RAPS, that involve clinically homogeneous thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome populations, maximise clinical applicability for subgroups of patients. We caution, therefore, that our results are not applicable to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and venous thromboembolism who need greater than standard-intensity anticoagulation or with stroke or other arterial thrombosis.</p><p>Direct oral anticoagulants have several advantages compared with warfarin. They avoid the need for routine anticoagulation monitoring, which is particularly relevant to antiphospholipid syndrome patients because thromboplastins have variable sensitivity to lupus anticoagulants and, therefore, the INR might not accurately reflect anticoagulation intensity.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> If INR instability develops, frequent anticoagulant monitoring will be needed with unpredictable time intervals, and the risk of thrombosis or bleeding will be increased due, respectively, to undercoagulation or overcoagulation. The percentage of time in the therapeutic range for patients in the RAPS warfarin group was only 55% up to day 180. This finding highlights that the predictable anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban offers a potential advantage in antiphospholipid syndrome patients, but efficacy is dependent upon adherence to the treatment regimen. Unlike treatment with warfarin, where anticoagulation is constant, rivaroxaban leads to peaks and troughs. No range of therapeutic rivaroxaban concentrations have been defined for clinical use. Population pharmacokinetics indicate that peak rivaroxaban concentrations are in the range 160&#x02013;360 &#x003bc;g/L.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> 29 (51%) of 57 RAPS patients had peak therapeutic concentrations of at least 160 &#x003bc;g/L, and three of these had concentrations greater than 360 &#x003bc;g/L. Six (11%) patients had peak concentrations lower than 50 &#x003bc;g/L and were possibly non-adherent.</p><p>The absence of new thrombotic events during 6 months of treatment in RAPS justifies our selection of this subgroup of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and puts into context anecdotal case reports and findings in small case series of recurrent thrombosis after switching patients from warfarin to a direct oral anticoagulant. Of note, 28% of patients in RAPS had triple positivity for lupus anticoagulant and antibodies against cardiolipin and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>GPI at baseline and, therefore, had a particularly high-risk antibody profile.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p><p>Our findings suggest that in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who have had previous venous thromboembolism and need standard-intensity anticoagulation (ie, target INR 2&#x000b7;5) the overall thrombotic risk, based on the overall thrombogram, in-vivo coagulation activation markers and clinical outcomes, is not increased with rivaroxaban compared with that related to warfarin. The absence of new thrombosis or major bleeding and low rate of clinically relevant bleeding supports this conclusion. Further studies are required to define the role of direct oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid syndrome patients, including those with venous thromboembolism who need higher-intensity anticoagulation (ie, those without recurrent venous thromboembolism while taking standard-intensity anticoagulation) or antiphospholipid syndrome patients with stroke or other arterial thrombosis. Overall, rivaroxaban seems efficacious and safe, and might offer a convenient alternative to warfarin in this subgroup of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group
