gait and dynamic balance. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 19 male and 20 female
university students. There were 4 types of gait tasks: General Gait (walking without a
task), Task Gait 1 (walking while writing a message), Task Gait 2 (walking while writing a
message and listening to music), Task Gait 3 (walking while writing a message and having a
conversation). To exclude the learning effect, the order of tasks was randomized. The
Zebris FDM-T treadmill system (Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany) was used to measure left and
right step length and width, and a 10&#x02005;m walking test (10MWT) was conducted for gait
velocity. In addition, a Timed Up and Go test (TUG) was used to measure dynamic balance.
All the tasks were performed 3 times, and the mean of the measured values was analyzed.
[Results] There were no statistically significant differences in step length and width.
There were statistically significant differences in the 10MWT and TUG tests. [Conclusion]
Using a smartphone while walking decreases a person&#x02019;s dynamic balance and walking ability.
It is considered that accident rates are higher when using a smartphone.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Multitasking</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Dynamic balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The smartphone is a device that integrates personal scheduling, faxing, and email sending
and receiving, as well as data communication functions, by adding computer operations such
as internet access and information search to a cellular phone and allows users to install
and delete various applications as needed. In addition, it is possible to run 2 or more of
the various functions simultaneously. Owing to the convenient features of the smartphone,
the number of smartphone users in South Korea reached 43.23 million in 2012 and they are
using it for a large part of the day<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, the indiscriminate use of smartphones has many problems<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study of physical and mental health status according to degree and addiction of
smartphone use by university students, many subjects showed physical signs such as ocular
fatigue (31%), myalgia (15%), and neural dysfunction (5%). Furthermore, most subjects showed
social disabilities including unhealthy mental conditions such as smartphone dependence,
anxiety, and interpersonal disorder<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, long periods of smartphone use can cause incorrect posture such as forward head
posture and rounded shoulder<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> and injuries in surrounding tissues including ligaments<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, visual and auditory inattentions inevitably occur when walking while using a
smartphone.</p><p>One previous study reports that visual inattention can affect postural sways such as static
imbalance during simple and dual tasks<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In a study with children aged 5 to 7, an auditory task was the most significant obstacle to
walking velocity, cadence, and step length<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Today, people use a smartphone even while walking, and this
behavior interferes with the perception of moving cars and surrounding objects, decreases
walking velocity, and increases car accident risks such as the sudden speed reductions of
cars to avoid such persons<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of smartphone use while walking
(which has been increasing dramatically) on the walking ability and dynamic balance and to
examine how it differs from general walking when various smartphone functions are used as
dual- or multitasking, to suggest the danger of using a smartphone during walking. Specially
this study was conducted based on writing a message and listening to music, which is the
most used multitask in the twenties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was performed with 19 male and 20 female asymptomatic participants who
were recruited from a local university. Informed consent was received from every subject
prior to the study. The inclusion criteria of subjects were as follows: no problems in the
visual or vestibular system, no structural issues in a lower extremity or foot, and no
musculoskeletal or neurological disorders that affect walking, as well as a minimum
smartphone use of one year. The general characteristics of the subjects were an age of 22.26
&#x000b1; 0.27&#x02005;years, a height of 169.28 &#x000b1; 1.21&#x02005;cm tall, and a weight of 63.31 &#x000b1; 1.81&#x02005;kg.</p><p>This study was approved by the Daegu University Institutional Review Board
(1040621&#x02013;201611-HR-017&#x02013;02) in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki</p><p>General Gait was walking without a task, Task Gait 1 was walking while writing a message,
Task Gait 2 was walking while writing a message and listening to music, and Task Gait 3 was
walking while writing a message and having a conversation.</p><p>The Zebris FDM-T treadmill system (Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany) was used to measure left
and right step length and width. A 10&#x02005;m walking test (10MWT) was conducted for gait
velocity. In addition, a Timed Up and Go test (TUG) was used to measure dynamic balance. All
the tasks were performed 3 times, and the mean of the measured values was calculated. The
order of tasks was randomized to exclude the learning effect.</p><p>For the 10MWT, the subjects walked at a comfortable speed for 14&#x02005;m. In consideration of
acceleration and deceleration, the time taken to walk the 10&#x02005;m was measured, excluding the
first and last 2&#x02005;m. The 10MWT is a method of predicting the gait performance of stroke
patients and shows high reliability (r=0.97) (Hunt et al., 1981). The Zebris FDM-T treadmill
has 10,240 pressure sensor mats attached to the bottom of the treadmill belt and can control
velocity in 0.1&#x02005;km/h intervals in the range of 0.2&#x02013;22&#x02005;km/h. As a subject walks on the
treadmill, the plantar pressure is recorded at the rate of 120&#x02005;Hz. For the input pressure
signals, the temporospatial values are displayed in 2D/3D graphs including the center of
pressure during standing or walking.</p><p>The TUG test evaluates basic mobility skill. The subjects must stand up from a chair, walk
for 3 m, turn around and return to sit again on the chair. The score of the test is the time
that is required to complete the test. For this test, the subjects were instructed to walk
with or without a gait assistive device at a comfortable speed and the time was recorded in
seconds with a stopwatch. All statistical tests were performed with SPSS version 12.0. The
results are described as means and standard errors (Mean &#x000b1; SE) for various tasks. A one-way
ANOVA test compared left and right step length, step width, the TUG test, and the 10&#x02005;m
walking test according to performed tasks. In addition, Fisher&#x02019;s least significant
difference test (LSD) was performed as a post hoc test. A value of p&#x0003c;0.05 was used to
indicate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In step length and width, there were no statistically significant differences among tasks

walking on the gait parameter and dynamic balance.</p><p>In the results, the gait time of the task gait using a smartphone was longer than the gait
time without using a smartphone and this difference was statistically significant. Brown et
al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> report that gait velocity
decreased during the dual task. In a study on the elderly and balance disturbance by
Silsupadol et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, gait velocity
decreased in the experimental group who performed dual tasks in 3 different conditions.
Furthermore, Choi et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the
effects of a visual cognitive task on gait and argue that while performing the visual
cognitive task, the subjects lost the ability to control a constant gait pattern. The
findings of these studies agree with the results of our study.</p><p>However, there were no statistically significant differences in step length and width
between the General Gait and task gaits. This is different from the result of the study by
Kim et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, who claim that the visual
and auditory cognitive tasks decreased step length and width. However, this can be regarded
as the habituation of some gait parameters during the continued task gait, just as de Bruin
et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reports that if there were no
particular external stimuli for a certain time during walking task, which is classified as a
continuous task, it would become automatic and habitual.</p><p>Regarding dynamic balance during the smartphone multitasking, sways increased as the tasks
increased and became more complex, resulting in a longer gait time. In Hyong<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, in a dual task situation using a
smartphone, anterior balance, posterolateral balance, and posteromedial balance required
attention during simple tasks such as listening to music and web surfing, but they decreased
greatly during complex tasks such as writing a document and game playing. Furthermore, Kim
et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the effect of using a
smartphone on obstacle gait, and while overcoming the obstacles, the subjects showed
noticeably sizeable motion and sway and their gait velocity and cadence decreased. This
result agrees with the result of dynamic balance during the task gaits using a smartphone in
the present study.</p><p>Cohen et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> argue that balance is
achieved by the integration of information that flows through the interaction of the
vestibular system and visual and proprioception in the central nervous system. Geurts et
al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> claim that balance disturbance or
loss restricts the activity of daily living. In this way, various sensation participate in
walking, and when walking using a smartphone, visual and auditory factors are lacking, so
afferent information required for normal walking depends on only superficial sensory
perceptions and proprioception. As confirmed in this study, walking while using a smartphone
decreases gait velocity and dynamic balance to compensate for more stable walking. This will
lower the walker&#x02019;s ability to detect potential risk factors around them or to cope with
sudden dangerous situations, thus increasing the accident rate during walking.</p><p>The limitations of this study were as follows. The older generation who are unskilled in
smartphone use were excluded because this study focused on young people, more diverse
features of smartphones were not assigned as tasks, and the speed during the treadmill test
was specified and did not match the speed of individuals at ordinary times.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that smartphone use during walking decreases balance and
changes gait parameters. Thus, the lack of attention and cognition in the information
processing function is likely to increase the incidence of accidents when walking in complex
and varied outdoor places, as well as when walking indoors. Therefore, it is recommended
that individuals refrain from smartphone use while walking. The limitation of this study is
that it has been experimented in general environment, so it is necessary to study the risk
of multitasking in various environments in the future.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Lifestyle segmentation of smartphone users and its impact
