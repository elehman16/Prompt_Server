The latest World Cancer Research Fund report concluded that foods low in fibre, and high in red and processed meat cause colorectal cancer whereas physical activity protects against colon cancer. Yet, the influence of these lifestyle factors on cancer outcome is largely unknown even though cancer survivors are eager for lifestyle modifications. Observational studies suggested that low intake of a Western-pattern diet and high physical activity level reduced colorectal cancer mortality. The Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Health Action Process Approach have guided the design of intervention models targeting a wide range of health-related behaviours.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of two behavioural interventions intended to improve colorectal cancer outcome and which are designed to increase physical activity level and reduce consumption of a Western-pattern diet. This three year study will be a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in a 2x2 factorial design comparing the &#x0201c;Moving Bright, Eating Smart&#x0201d; (physical activity and diet) programme against usual care. Subjects will be recruited over a 12-month period, undertake intervention for 12&#x000a0;months and followed up for a further 12&#x000a0;months. Baseline, interim and three post-intervention assessments will be conducted.</p><p>Two hundred and twenty-two colorectal cancer patients who completed curative treatment without evidence of recurrence will be recruited into the study. Primary outcome measure will be whether physical activity and dietary targets are met at the end of the 12-month intervention. Secondary outcome measures include the magnitude and mechanism of behavioural change, the degree and determinants of compliance, and the additional health benefits and side effects of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study will establish the feasibility of targeting the two behaviours (diet and physical activity) and demonstrate the magnitude of behaviour change. The information will facilitate the design of a further larger phase III randomised controlled trial with colorectal cancer outcome as the study endpoint to determine whether this intervention model would reduce colorectal cancer recurrence and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov No: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT01708824?term=NCT01708824&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01708824</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>Cancer survivor</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Meat</kwd><kwd>Grains</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Behavioural intervention</kwd><kwd>Feasibility</kwd><kwd>Acceptability</kwd><kwd>Randomised</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Colorectal cancer, treatment outcome and lifestyle factors</title><p>According to the Hong Kong Cancer Registry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], colorectal cancer (CRC) was the second most common cancer and the second highest cancer-killer in Hong Kong with 4,370 new cases and 1,864 deaths in 2010, respectively. Moreover, the crude incidence rate of CRC increased from 48.2 per 100,000 in 2000 to 62.2 per 100,000 in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. CRC may soon become the most common cancer in Hong Kong. This alarming trend is mirrored in many Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The latest report of the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] summarises convincing evidence from published observational studies that physical activity (PA) protects against colon cancer (CC) while foods low in dietary fibre, high in red and processed meat, high levels of alcohol drinking in men, body fatness, abdominal fatness and factors leading to greater adult attained height cause CRC. However, the influence of these lifestyle factors on the outcome of patients with established CRC is largely unknown.</p><p>With advances in treatment, CRC survivors are now living longer. Many of them are highly motivated to seek information about lifestyle modifications that improve quality of life and increase their chance of prolonged life and recovery from cancer. Although evidence on certain aspects of PA or diet specifically affecting health outcomes in cancer survivors is emerging, it is not yet sufficiently established to allow firm recommendations to be made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The observational Nurses&#x02019; Health Study showed that recreational PA reduced cancer-specific and overall mortality for stage I to III female CRC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], while in another observational study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], maintaining weekly PA levels over 18 metabolic-equivalent-hours (MET-hours) reduced recurrence and mortality in stage III CC after adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>A recent observational study compared cancer outcome of stage III CC in two dietary groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Compared with patients with the lowest mean intake of a Western-pattern diet (i.e., 2.3 servings of red meat weekly, 1.8 servings of processed meat weekly, 2.0 servings of refined grains daily, and less than 1 serving of sugary desserts daily), those with the highest mean intake (i.e., 6 servings of red meat weekly, 5.6 servings of processed meat weekly, 5.8 servings of refined grains daily, and 2.5 servings of sugary desserts daily) had an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 3.25 (95% confidence interval 2.04-5.19). No association was found of a prudent dietary pattern (i.e., high intakes of fruit, vegetable, poultry and fish) with CC mortality and recurrence. Moreover, the two patterns were not inter-correlated (Spearman correlation 0.02).</p><p>Our literature review identified a small number of published randomised controlled trials (RCT) or feasibility studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] on lifestyle intervention of CRC survivors. No CRC intervention has been conducted in an Asian population. Furthermore, to date, there are no published data regarding the effect of PA and/or dietary interventions on CRC outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Theories on health behaviour</title><p>The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] is one of the most widely tested theories explaining and predicting intentions to perform a wide range of health-related behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The TPB has been the framework for the design of intervention models targeted at health behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and posits that an individual&#x02019;s behaviour is predicted by his/her intention to perform the behaviour. This behavioural intention is, in turn, determined by attitudes towards the behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control, with each of these being the result of beliefs. The likelihood that an individual&#x02019;s intention to adopt a health behaviour will therefore be increased if he holds a more favourable attitude towards the behaviour (behavioural beliefs), believes that significant others want him to adopt the behaviour (normative beliefs), and perceives that the behaviour is under his control (control beliefs). The three sets of belief constructs can thus be targeted by interventions for health behaviour change. Useful as the TPB is, it is important to note that intentions to behave do not necessarily lead to actual performance of behaviours. The discrepancy between intended and actual behaviours is termed the intention-behaviour gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] integrates social-cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the theory of reasoned action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and the volition theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. HAPA is particularly useful in guiding the development and design of intervention aimed to enhance health self-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] that involves motivation, volitional, and actional processes of abandoning health-compromising behaviours and adopting and maintaining health-enhancing behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The model addresses the intention-behaviour gap and defines ways to identify and modify the factors linking intentions with actual behaviour (mediators). The model categorizes health behavioural changes into two stages (processes): the pre-intentional motivation process and the post-intentional volition process, with the first process leading to behavioural intention and the second to actual health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. After a person has an intention to act, he/she needs detailed instructions on how to perform the desired action and the perceived self-efficacy to initiate and to maintain the action. All these require self-regulatory skills and strategies such as action planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interventions for changing health behaviours can target attitudes, perceived barriers, personal vulnerability and perceived self-efficacy, however, only stage-matched conditions can bring about benefits on the participants. For example, only intenders and actors will benefit from self-regulatory efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Study objectives</title><p>Based on the TPB and HAPA, this study aims to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of two behavioural interventions on CRC survivors intended to improve cancer outcome and are designed to increase PA levels and reduce consumption of a Western-pattern diet (i.e., high intake of red and processed meat, dietary fat, refined grains and sugary desserts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Ethical approval for the study has been received from the Institutional Review Board of the Hong Kong West Cluster, the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong (see later).

Nevertheless, we conservatively assume that 10% of them will reach the targeted levels at one year, which results in a larger required sample size to detect the intervention effects. Although we are optimistic about the intervention effect, based on our clinical experience, we consider that a 10-20% improvement in the intervention arm over the usual care would be regarded as minimally significant for promoting the use of the intervention. Hence, we assume an effect size of 15%. To achieve 80% power with a 5% false positive error rate to detect this effect size by a chi-square test, we need 50 subjects per cell and thus 200 patients in total. Expecting a 10% dropout rate, we will need to recruit 224 patients for the study. The sample size should be sufficient when the improvement is larger than expected.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><sec><title>Main analysis</title><p>Efficacy of the dietary and PA interventions in helping patients to reach the corresponding behavioural target will be assessed by logistic regression analysis. Model adequacy will be examined by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test. The analysis will be performed on two analysis sets, full and per-protocol, to examine the sensitivity of results due to non-compliance. The full analysis set includes all patients as randomised. Patients with missing values will be taken as if they did not reach the targeted level. The per-protocol set includes all patients who complied with the intervention and have no missing values. Conclusions will be made from the results derived from the full analysis set, which is consistent with the intention-to-treat principle. All analysis will be adjusted for recruitment sites and stoma status.</p><p>Analysis of secondary outcomes will be performed by mixed-effects analysis to account for extra covariance from repeated measurements taken from a participant.</p><p>A 95% confidence interval will accompany all effect estimates and a 5% level of significance will be used in all significance tests.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p>Focus-group discussions will be conducted in the last quarterly group meeting investigating the facilitators and barriers to both interventions.

Moreover, none of these interventions have been conducted in an Asian population where the culture, eating habit, built environment and climate is typically different to most Western populations. This knowledge gap shows the importance of our study.</p><p>The latest WCRF recommendation states that cancer survivors should follow the same lifestyle recommendations for cancer prevention. Our previous survey of 150 CRC survivors (unpublished data) showed that &#x0003c;4% of our patients were current drinkers and their mean body mass index and waist-hip ratio were 23.8&#x000b1;3.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 82.3&#x000b1;10.2&#x000a0;cm, respectively. These findings accentuate the importance of testing the effect of changing PA and diet as they are likely to be the only two modifiable factors worthy of consideration for intervention in our patient population.</p><p>In our study, we have chosen two PA targets: the general health target which corresponds to the general public health PA guideline of 10 MET-hours per week; and the cancer outcome target based on the study by Meyerhardt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] which suggested that a PA level of more than 18 MET-hours per week was required to significantly reduce cancer mortality. The on-going CHALLENGE trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] on CRC survivors also uses 20 MET-hours per week as the PA target at 6 to 12&#x000a0;months of intervention. Having two PA targets varying in difficulty and with corresponding health benefits may provide encouragement to those participants lacking self-efficacy for, or ability to, change. Besides, a more recent study has noted measurable cancer risk reductions associated with 6 to 12 MET-hours per week of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, given that the evidence is rather inconclusive and the possibility of lower levels of PA being sufficient to significantly improve post-diagnosis cancer outcomes, it is important to evaluate the feasibility of meeting this more moderate behavioural target. Furthermore, engagement in 10 MET-hours per week has been associated with significant reduction in overall mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], risk of a range of non-communicable diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and better quality of life in cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. These are important non-trivial health outcomes for CRC survivors as much as they are for the general population.</p><p>The study by Meyerhardt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] showed that the lowest intake of a Western-pattern diet significantly reduced cancer mortality when compared to the highest intake. Our previous survey (unpublished data) concluded that &#x0003c;1% of the 150 CRC survivors studied consumed more than one serving of sugary desserts daily. Therefore, the rounded-up lowest intake levels of red/processed meat (5 servings per week) and refined grains (2 servings daily) were adopted as our dietary target.</p><p>The main proposed mechanism of PA and diet influencing CRC outcome relates to energy balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Physical inactivity and a Western-pattern diet shift energy balance leading to hyperinsulinaemia, high insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] which stimulate growth and inhibit apoptosis of micro-metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] leading to cancer recurrence and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The luminal effect of carcinogens derived from red and processed meat is another possible mechanism associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. With reduced intake of red/processed meat, the reduced luminal effect of carcinogen may result in the reduction of local recurrence, especially for rectal cancer. Other potential mechanisms relating to PA and diet are alteration in vitamin D, hormonal changes, inflammation and immune modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Our planned study follows the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The design of this Phase 2 trial is based on the TPB and HAPA as well as the findings of our previous work including those from a literature review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], qualitative interviews and survey. The exact strategies to be adopted and the pace of the intervention to be delivered will depend on the HAPA stage of an individual subject, which will be determined monthly throughout the 12-month intervention.</p><p>The results of this Phase 2 trial will be key in establishing the feasibility of targeting the two behaviours (PA and diet) and demonstrating the magnitude of behaviour change. Such information will be essential in the design of a subsequent larger and definitive Phase 3 RCT with CRC outcome as a primary endpoint. By following the MRC framework in designing and evaluating our intervention systematically, we are in the best position to determine its effectiveness in promoting lifestyle changes in CRC survivors, and to determine whether this intervention would be effective in improving CRC outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CC: Colon cancer; CRC: Colorectal cancer; GCP: Good clinical practice; HAPA: Health Action Process Approach; ICH: International Conference on Harmonisation; MET: Metabolic equivalent; MRC: Medical Research Council; MVPA: Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity; PA: Physical activity; RCT: Randomised controlled trial; SAE: Serious adverse event; TPB: Theory of Planned Behaviour; WCRF: World Cancer Research Fund.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JH conceived of the study, participated in its overall design, obtained funding, coordinated the research team and drafted the manuscript.
