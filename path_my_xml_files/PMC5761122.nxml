This paper presents baseline data that were collected in ten districts of Cabo Delgado province, northern Mozambique, before treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A cross-sectional study of 19,039 individuals was sampled from 144 villages from May to September 2011. In each village prevalence and intensity of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> were investigated in 100 children first-year students (aged 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;years), 100 school children aged 9&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years (from classes 2 to 7) and 50 adults (20&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years). Prevalence and intensity of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection were evaluated microscopically by two filtrations, each of 10&#x000a0;ml, from a single urine specimen. Given that individual and community perceptions of schistosomiasis influence control efforts, community knowledge and environmental risk factors were collected using a face-to-face interview. Data were entered onto mobile phones using EpiCollect. Data summary was made using descriptive statistics. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The overall prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was 60.4% with an arithmetic mean intensity of infection of 55.8 eggs/10&#x000a0;ml of urine. Heavy infections were detected in 17.7%, of which 235 individuals (6.97%) had an egg count of 1000 eggs/10&#x000a0;ml or more. There was a significantly higher likelihood of males being infected than females across all ages (62% <italic>vs</italic> 58%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0005). Adolescents aged 9&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years had a higher prevalence (66.6%) and mean infection intensity (71.9 eggs/10&#x000a0;ml) than first-year students (63.1%; 58.2 eggs/10&#x000a0;ml). This is the first study in Mozambique looking at infection rates among adults. Although children had higher levels of infection, it was found here that adults had a high average prevalence and intensity of infection (44.5%; 23.9 eggs/10&#x000a0;ml). Awareness of schistosomiasis was relatively high (68.6%); however, correct knowledge of how schistosomiasis is acquired was low (23.2%) among those who had heard of the disease. Schistosomiasis risk behaviour such as washing (91.3%) and bathing (86.7%) in open water sources likely to be infested with host snails was high.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Urogenital schistosomiasis is widespread in Cabo Delgado. In addition, poor community knowledge about the causes of schistosomiasis and how to prevent it increases the significant public health challenge for the national control program. This was the first study in Mozambique that examined infection levels among adults, where results showed that <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection was also extremely high. Given that this controlled trial aims to understand the impact of different combinations of schistosomiasis control through treatment of communities, schools, and treatment holidays over a five-year period, these findings highlight the importance of examining the impact of different treatment approaches also in adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">The trials have been registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14117624">ISRCT 14117624</ext-link> Mozambique (14 December 2015).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Schistosomiasis</kwd><kwd><italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic></kwd><kwd>School-based treatment</kwd><kwd>Community-wide treatment</kwd><kwd>Mozambique</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007903</institution-id><institution>College of Public Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR374-053/4895056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fenwick</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">Schistosomiasis affects at least 240 million people worldwide, with an estimated 20 million suffering from severe and debilitating forms of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The burden is concentrated in Africa, where more than 90% of the infections occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Schistosomiasis is strongly associated with poverty, where the disease delays the social and economic development of endemic countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in Mozambique, as shown by an epidemiological survey of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) among school children carried out between 2005 and 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The mean estimated prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis, <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic>, was 47% but schistosomiasis is focal, and so prevalence varied dramatically across the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Cabo Delgado Province, the chosen area for this study, the prevalence was 57.9% ranging from 8.8% on the coast to 93% inland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contrast, the prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis, whose causative agent is <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, is extremely low in Mozambique, with an average prevalence of 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Regular large-scale preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel is the current control strategy recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that aims to alleviate subtle morbidity and prevent infected individuals from developing severe, late-stage morbidity due to schistosomiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The current recommended WHO treatment strategy for schistosomiasis depends on the prevalence among school-aged children (SAC) aged 5&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years, where if infection is higher than 50% the school-aged population should be treated once a year; if the prevalence is between 10 and 50% treatment is focused on SAC biennially; and if less than 10% SAC should be treated twice, once at school entry and once before finishing school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies have found, however, a community-wide approach for schistosomiasis a very effective strategy for reaching children who do not attend school as well as potentially high-risk adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

It comprises of multi-country field studies including &#x0201c;Gaining control of schistosomiasis&#x0201d;, investigating the impact of different treatment strategies involving community-wide treatment (CWT), school-based treatment (SBT) and drug holidays (years in which a village did not receive praziquantel treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The gaining control study has been implemented in various African countries, including Tanzania, Kenya and Mozambique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The SCORE study protocol and baseline characteristics have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the Mozambique study, the aim was to determine the strategy for the preventive chemotherapy that provides greatest reductions in prevalence and intensity of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> in school-aged children after four years of intervention in an area where baseline prevalence of infection was 25% or more. This article describes the baseline results pre-treatment and reports age, sex, prevalence and intensity of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> across all ages among 144 study sites selected for the study as well as potential environmental risk factors of local communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area and population</title><p id="Par16">We selected 10 out of 17 districts of Mozambique&#x02019;s northernmost province, Cabo Delgado, believed to be one of the least developed areas of the country. The province consists of lowlands adjacent to the Atlantic coast, with altitudes varying between 200 and 300&#x000a0;m above sea level. The climate is semi-humid with moderate rainfall of 800&#x02013;1200&#x000a0;mm in the rainy season from November until April.</p><p id="Par17">The area was chosen as the previous mapping had shown a high prevalence of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> and a low prevalence of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (around 1%)<italic>,</italic> which met one of the SCORE country selection criteria of not working in areas with mixed infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The ten out of 17 districts included in this study were Metuge, Mecufi, Macomia, Ancuabe, Meluco, Quissanga, Namuno, Montepuez, Chi&#x000fa;re and Balama.</p><p id="Par18">Eligibility for communities to be included in the study was determined by selecting only villages that had a primary school with a minimum of 100 children aged 9&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years who attend school, since several arms of the study are school-based, and each community was randomised to any arm of the study. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in May and June 2011 to identify communities eligible to participate in the SCORE study. In total, 155 villages were selected at random across the ten districts. In each school, 50 children aged 13&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years were randomly selected and tested for haematuria with dipsticks. The rationale for using 13&#x02013;14-year olds in the eligibility survey was that children who test positive must be treated, therefore testing children aged 9&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years and treating those infected could affect the subsequent study results, especially if prevalence is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Only those villages that demonstrated a microhaematuria prevalence of &#x02265;&#x000a0;21% by reagent strip testing (equivalent to &#x02265;25% microscopic examination of filtered urine) were included in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since the rainy season lasts from November to April, baseline data was collected between July and October every year, commencing in 2011, to ensure there was no seasonal variation across the five years of data collection. Additional criteria for eligibility were that if two nearby communities share water sources and schools have an overlapping catchment area they were not considered separate communities for the study, and therefore only one of the schools were chosen. Secondly, communities were only considered that had not previously received preventive chemotherapy against schistosomiasis. All communities in this study were treatment na&#x000ef;ve.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study arms</title><p id="Par19">This study was a parallel cluster-randomised, intervention trial with six study arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Communities received various combinations of CWT, SBT or drug holiday over a four-year period, with the final round of data collection carried out in Year 5. This paper only examines the baseline data pre-treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par20">To provide the sample size needed to complete all the planned arms, the baseline survey was conducted in 144 schools found eligible from July to October 2011. Initially, the school provided a list of the names, ages and sex of all children enrolled in each class. Primary schools have pupils at seven-year stages, Year 1 to Year 7. A year stage can, therefore, be defined as a group of pupils entering primary education at a common date. In each school 100 children aged 9&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years (Years 2&#x02013;7) and 100 children in the first class (Year 1) were then randomly selected from the list to participate. Where there were insufficient numbers of children in the age range, children were selected from outside of the age range. Also, parasitological data and information on the occupation of each sample were collected from 50 adults (aged 20&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years) from each community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Urine examination</title><p id="Par21">In each school, participants were given a wide-mouthed plastic bottle labelled with a specific identification number and asked to provide a single urine specimen. All samples were collected between 10&#x000a0;am and 2&#x000a0;pm and examined in the school by the field team straight away. Urine samples were vigorously shaken, 10&#x000a0;ml drawn into a syringe and pressed through a mesh nylon filter with a pore size of 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m (Sefar AG, Heiden, Switzerland). Two filtrations were carried out per urine sample. Both filters were placed on two separate microscope slides and, after adding a drop of Lugol, the filters were examined for <italic>S. haematobium</italic> eggs under a light microscope. All parasitological examinations were performed by experienced laboratory technicians. For quality control, around 10% of all microscope slides were re-examined by a senior technician. The intensity of infection was expressed as the number of eggs per 10&#x000a0;ml of urine filtered. For specimens of less than 10&#x000a0;ml, the volume of urine filtered was measured and the number of eggs per 10&#x000a0;ml calculated by extrapolation. If estimated counts were above 1000 eggs per 10&#x000a0;ml, they were truncated at 1000. The arithmetic mean of two filtrations taken from a single urine specimen was calculated to be the egg count of the child. A child was deemed egg positive if one or more eggs were found in any of the slides examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Village and household level data</title><p id="Par22">In addition to the parasitological survey, a village level questionnaire was asked to the community leaders to collect information that might affect schistosomiasis transmission. The questionnaire had sections on (i) general information (village name, population of village, number of households); (ii) main occupations of people in the village; (iii) local health facility information and whether they stock praziquantel; (iv) water contact sites (standing and flowing water); (v) water sources (drinking, washing and bathing); (vi) sanitation facilities in the village; and (vii) knowledge about schistosomiasis (heard about schistosomiasis, how to catch schistosomiasis, symptoms of schistosomiasis, how to prevent schistosomiasis, and name of the treatment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data handling and analysis</title><p id="Par23">Demographic data were collected on smartphones and uploaded to a dedicated database maintained on a central server (EpiCollect) hosted by Imperial College London. Laboratory data were collected on paper forms and entered into the smartphone retrospectively. Data cleaning and management were carried out by biostatisticians at SCI.</p><p id="Par24">Data analysis was performed using R version 3.2 (URL <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>/) and STATA version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The primary outcome of SCORE study is the change in prevalence and intensity of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> over the four years of intervention. Here, we present the findings of the baseline survey before treatment. Prevalence of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection from the eligibility survey was calculated from haematuria with dipsticks from a single urine sample from children aged 13&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years.</p><p id="Par25">From the baseline survey, infection categories for <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection were defined per WHO thresholds: light infection (&#x0003c; 50 eggs/10&#x000a0;ml of urine) and heavy infection (&#x02265; 50 eggs/10&#x000a0;ml of urine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Prevalence estimates were then calculated from the average egg count of two slides or egg count from one urine filtration (if only one 10&#x000a0;ml sample was taken) from three groups: (i) first-year students (aged 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;years); (ii) children aged 9&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years; and (iii) adults (aged 20&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years). Village-level prevalence was calculated for the prevalence of infection (0 for not infected, 1 for infected) and prevalence of heavy infection (0 for non-heavy infection, 1 for heavy infection). Prevalence of infection and heavy infection aggregated by other factors (e.g. age, sex) were calculated as arithmetic means of the infection categories. The Arithmetic mean of infection intensity was calculated for all subjects (including those with zero egg counts), which is a measure of community-level contamination potential. Although mean intensity was underestimated as egg counts were capped at 1000 eggs/10&#x000a0;ml, this was done consistently over the years, therefore, the trend in the change in intensity is believed to be valid. The association between sociodemographic characteristics (sexes, age groups, village and adult occupation) and infection was examined using Pearson <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests, while one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess differences in intensities of infection. All tests and confidence intervals used the 5% level of significance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Baseline prevalence and intensity of <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection</title><p id="Par26">Village level prevalence varied from 14.2% to 92.5%, with heavy prevalence ranging from 0 to 60%, across the 10 districts surveyed in Cabo Delgado (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is a map of the prevalence of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> across each village included in the study, in the 10 districts surveyed.

When first-year students (aged 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;years) and 9&#x02013;12-year-old children were examined with double filtration on a single urine sample in the baseline survey, the overall prevalence of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> was 63.1% and 66.6%, respectively. These findings were consistent with a national mapping survey carried out between 2005 and 2007 where schistosomiasis was found to be highly endemic among school children (aged 7&#x02013;22&#x000a0;years) in Cabo Delgado province, with an overall prevalence of 57.9% of <italic>S. haematobium</italic>. The study highlights urine examination with reagent strips as a rapid diagnostic tool to identify high-risk areas for urogenital schistosomiasis consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">As shown in other studies both gender and age had a significant effect on infection, with the highest prevalence and proportion of those heavily infected occurring in males and among 9&#x02013;12-year age group with those same factors decreasing into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This finding may be explained by socio-cultural factors where an increased predisposition in boys to behaviours that expose them to the risk of infection such as swimming or bathing. This group will, therefore, be the focus for the monitoring and evaluating disease transmission from baseline through to Year 5 of this SCORE study.</p><p id="Par35">This is the first study in Mozambique looking at infection rates among adults. Although children had higher levels of infection than adults, it was found here that adults had a high average infection of 44.5%. Per current WHO guidelines, children aged 5&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years should be treated once every year in such high-risk communities (prevalence &#x02265;50% measured by parasitological methods), as well as adults, considered &#x0201c;at-risk&#x0201d;. Occupation was recorded in two places in the baseline survey. When parasitological samples were taken from adults, they were asked their profession. Most adults (95.6%) stated that &#x0201c;farming&#x0201d; was their main occupation; however, there was no significant association between occupation and prevalence of infection. In addition, the village inventory questionnaire asked for village leaders about the main occupations of people in the village. Here, fishing and rice farming, which are widely shown to be a determinant of <italic>S. haematobium</italic>, were reported by 2% and 15.3%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

Among our study population, use of open surface water was widely reported for washing and bathing, basic sanitation facilities such as pit latrines were reported to exist in most communities, yet open urination was widely practised. Furthermore, many villagers spend months at a time sleeping in tented accommodation when they were working in the &#x02018;machambas&#x02019; (fields) with no access to sanitation. Although knowledge of the existence of schistosomiasis (translated into various local languages) was high, few understood the transmission cycle associated with spending time in open water sources. Misconceptions such as drinking dirty water and sexual intercourse were also described as ways to get schistosomiasis. Safe water, adequate hygiene and good sanitation interventions have shown to be successful in preventing schistosomiasis transmission elsewhere, and it would be recommended to complement the praziquantel treatment with supplementary measures such as health education and sanitation facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">In conclusion, the baseline results showed that Cabo Delgado Province in northern Mozambique is hyperendemic for urogenital schistosomiasis, particularly among school-aged children, and this risk appears to have remained unchanged over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Prevalence rates were found to be greater than 50% in all districts, which highlights the need for annual praziquantel treatment in accordance with WHO guidelines. It also shows that prevalence differs by age and sex where the infection was also high among adults, which needs to be considered when planning programmatic schistosomiasis control efforts. In addition to preventive chemotherapy, access to safe water for washing and bathing, improved sanitation facilities and developing suitable health education tools could help tackle the burden of schistosomiasis. The aim of the SCORE project in Mozambique is to provide an evidence base for the national control programme to make informed decisions about preventive chemotherapy strategies to gain and sustain the control of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection. The results after a five-year period will demonstrate the cost-benefit impact of alternative approaches to schistosomiasis control through treatment of communities, schools, and treatment holidays.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CWT</term><def><p id="Par6">Community-wide treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAC</term><def><p id="Par7">school-aged children</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBT</term><def><p id="Par8">school-based treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCORE</term><def><p id="Par9">Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STH</term><def><p id="Par10">soil-transmitted helminths</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par11">World Health Organisation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the members of SCORE secretariat and advisory committee for reviewing our study, their advice, input and support of our work.

Ethical review of the protocol was obtained from the National Bio-ethical Committee for Health of Mozambique (NBCHM), and the survey was conducted according to NBCHM guidelines (ref: IRB00002657). The study protocol was also approved by Imperial College London (ref: ICREC_10_8_2). In addition to these, the University of Georgia institutional review board IRB implemented an administrative human subjects review and issued additional approval 10533-0 for Mozambique.</p></sec><sec
