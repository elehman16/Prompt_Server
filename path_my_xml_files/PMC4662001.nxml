If left untreated, or treated too late, sepsis will progress to a systemically uncontrolled, dysregulated immune response leading to vascular instability, capillary leakage, septic cardiomyopathy, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute kidney and respiratory failure. This multiple organ failure (MOF) is associated with high costs of care, and more importantly high rates of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite much research and several attempts to provide specific drug therapies the treatment is still early application of broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. With the withdrawal of Xigris (drotrecogin alpha) in 2011, more effective and specific treatment strategies of sepsis are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There is also a need for adequate experimental models of sepsis as the most commonly used animal models have failed to mimic human sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Early studies focused on the endotoxic shock caused by intravenous (IV) infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial infusions or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in smaller animals such as mice and rats. Now more elaborate, sophisticated, and clinically relevant models in larger animals are emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In experimental sepsis the model of cecal incision in pig overcomes several pitfalls. Compared to rodents, pigs have a greater genetic, anatomical and physiological resemblance to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, their size enables repeated blood sampling for comprehensive analysis and the use of human medical equipment. Finally, exposing the pig to its own microbiota by cecal incision induces polymicrobial sepsis with a defined site of infection, often lacking in other experimental models. The model presented here is very close to clinical conditions like intestinal leak during anastomotic insufficiency, bowel perforation or bacterial translocation following conditions of sterile inflammation in the abdomen.</p><p>As the first line of defense, innate immunity acts upon infection with activation through pattern recognition. In sepsis, this activation is exaggerated and worsens the disease through overproduction of multiple cytokines, paracrine and autocrine factors. In numerous crisscrossing pathways the inflammatory network acts on the vasculature and organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the early phase, the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and complement systems together constitute the primary pathways of danger recognition through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and consequently, immune activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The three pathways of complement activation converge on component C3, which proceeds to activate complement component 5 (C5), generating C5a and the final, terminal C5b-9 complement complex (TCC) and C5a has a documented, harmful role in sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, C5 is a particularly interesting target for intervention in sepsis, leaving C3 free to opsonize in microbial defense. Equally, cluster of differentiation (CD)14 is an important coreceptor to several of the TLRs, including TLR4, TLR2, TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>We have therefore proposed inhibition of TLR and complement as a treatment regimen to attenuate the septic inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Recently, we showed convincing data in a murine CLP model of sepsis that supports this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The aim of the current study was to test our hypothesis by inhibiting both complement and TLR. We specifically inhibited the key proinflammatory components C5 and CD14 in a blinded, randomized, prospective study of porcine polymicrobial sepsis that closely mimics clinical sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Treatment reagents</title><p>Coversin, the 16.8&#x000a0;kDa, endotoxin-free recombinant bacterial <italic>Ornithodoros moubata</italic> complement inhibitor (OmCI; coversin) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], was kindly provided by Volution Immuno Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Coventry, UK).

Approximately 2&#x000a0;mg/kg intranasal midazolam was administered before gaining intravascular access to an ear vein (2.5&#x000a0;mg/mL or 5&#x000a0;mg/mL). Piglets then received 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mg/kg ketamine prior to endotracheal intubation with a 4.0&#x000a0;mm inner diameter tube with cuff. After intubation, IV infusions of propofol (10&#x000a0;mg/kg/hr) and fentanyl (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/hr) were initiated. Four piglets received small IV boluses of pancuronium bromide when shivering interfered with ventilation. Mechanical ventilation was provided and the following volume-controlled mode was used: tidal volume of 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mL/kg, respiratory rate of 26 per minute, inspiratory/expiratory time ratio of 1:3, positive end-expiratory pressure of 0&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.3. The respiratory settings were adjusted to maintain pH at 7.4 only before the surgical cecal incision. All subsequent changes in arterial blood gas values were considered a result of sepsis, and the respiratory settings were left unchanged. An arterial catheter was surgically inserted into the internal carotid artery and a 5-French Edwards Swan-Ganz catheter (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) was inserted in the external jugular vein and advanced until a satisfactory pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was obtained. All pressure transducers were zero-referenced to midchest level. With a minimally invasive technique, a urinary catheter was inserted during the laparotomy to monitor urinary output and core temperature. Temperature, heart rate (HR), mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure were displayed continuously on a Siemens SC 8000 Patient Monitor (Healthcare Diagnostics Ltd., Camberley, UK) and values recorded every 5&#x000a0;minutes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Animal model and experimental design</title><p>Piglets were allocated to receive either treatment (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) or saline as vehicle (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) before surgical sepsis was induced. Each week, two piglets were randomized as matched pairs to maintain homogeneity in regard to weight, age and gender, yielding 12 pairs of piglets receiving treatment or serving as the untreated counterpart. All investigators participating in the experiment were blinded to this allocation. Finally, three piglets served as sham controls, having a laparotomy and cystotomy but not a cecal incision. After baseline blood samples were obtained, the interventional reagents were then administered as follows: in the treatment group, an initial IV infusion of coversin (1&#x000a0;mg/kg) was delivered as a 5-minute bolus followed by a second 5-minute bolus containing the mouse anti-porcine CD14 monoclonal antibody (5&#x000a0;mg/kg). Immediately after the anti-CD14 bolus, a continuous IV infusion of coversin was initiated at 0.05&#x000a0;mg/kg/h and maintained throughout the experiment. For the untreated group, saline was administered in the exact same manner regarding volume and infusion time.</p><p>Piglets then had a laparotomy with a 10&#x000a0;cm longitudinal incision in the right lower lumbar region, the cecum was localized and a 2&#x000a0;cm longitudinal incision made. Intestinal content was allowed to leak into the abdominal cavity before closing the abdomen in two layers, as instructed by Kato and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Piglets were then observed until death or otherwise for 8&#x000a0;hours at which point they were euthanized by propofol (50&#x000a0;mg), fentanyl (200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g), and KCl (10&#x000a0;mmol).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Blood samples</title><p>Blood samples were drawn at baseline (immediately after IV access and before surgery) immediately after surgery and 1.5, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8&#x000a0;hours after surgery.

However, in the present porcine study, the transfer of these experiments to a surgically relevant, human-like acute and severe septic state revealed an improved survival in the treated group that was greater than anticipated. Although all animals developed severe tachycardia and prolonged hypotension, a remarkable difference between the two groups was observed. These piglets were of the same age, gender and farrow, selected at the same time of year with equal diets and conditions before the experiment. Furthermore, the animals were randomly selected as matched pairs, the intervention was unknown to the investigators and the animals received no other form of intervention or supportive therapy than that described.</p><p>Our analysis revealed subtle but distinct differences in MAP throughout the experiment but the greatest effect was seen on MPAP and MPAP in relation to MAP. On average, both groups had a lower MAP throughout the experiment, but the untreated group showed a more rapid decrease in MAP than the treated group. Clinically, both groups developed septic shock. However, the untreated group had a significantly greater increase in MPAP reaching higher maximum values than the treated group. Indeed, the MPAP in the treated group was comparable to sham for a long time period of the experiment. Notably, as shown by Kato and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the MPAP to MAP ratio can be calculated to reveal changes in both systemic and pulmonary circulation in sepsis; as the systemic pressure falls and the pulmonary pressure increases, the two merge as the factor approaches 1.0. In our study, the dynamic increase of MPAP in relation to decrease in MAP was significantly less pronounced in the treated group, underscoring a beneficial effect of blocking C5 and CD14 on the hemodynamic parameters.</p><p>In contrast to humans, pigs harbor large amounts of pulmonary intravascular macrophages serving as the predominant part of the mononuclear phagocytic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. There are several reports on porcine pulmonary hypertension following infusion of endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] triggering the release of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and other vasoactive mediators from macrophages. In this study, we can speculate that the combined treatment abolished recognition of endotoxin and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns, thus reducing the ensuing inflammation and vasoconstriction. The described leukotriene B4 (LTB4) capture by coversin could also enhance this effect.</p><p>Coversin has an internal binding pocket capturing LTB4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and thus has the potential to reduce LTB4-dependent effects in sepsis. In turn, LTB4 promotes neutrophil chemotaxis, increases adherence to capillary walls and may directly induce pulmonary arterial hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In sepsis, neutrophil-mediated tissue injury often affects remote organs, particularly the lungs. In this context, impaired lung function often correlates with the intensity of neutrophilic infiltrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As coversin&#x02019;s C5 and LTB4 binding activities are considered independent, producing a type of coversin that inhibits C5 but is unable to bind LTB4 could be used to further explore the selective contribution of LTB4 in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Complement activation was markedly increased in the untreated group whereas it was nonexistent or even decreased in the treated group, consistent with a complete block of C5 and thus no substrate for sC5b-9 formation. Excessive systemic complement activation with liberation of C5a has a number of concomitant detrimental effects both directly and through other inflammatory and hemostatic mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, complement-mediated endothelial cell activation, which was not measured in the present study, could likely have contributed to prothrombotic activity leading to intravascular coagulation. This would eventually reduce tissue perfusion and contribute to the hemodynamic instability subsequently leading to organ failure. Within the short observation time, all animals that died in the untreated group had substantially elevated sC5b-9 levels, consistently escalating before death. In return, three of the four animals that survived in the untreated group did not show this increase. Arguably, the anticipated lack of activation could have protected the treated group by lowering ischemia-induced inflammation during shock. In this line of thought, complement activation can be considered as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality in the untreated group. As a limitation of the study, a direct causal effect of complement activation alone cannot be proven from the present data. However, the increase in the activation product sC5b-9 seems to be a good marker for the processes affecting outcome. A similar close and highly significant correlation has been described between the levels of plasma sC5-9 in patients admitted to hospital with <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> sepsis and the mortality during the course of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Downstream effects of complement and TLR activation include the release of cytokines and chemokines. We therefore examined whether inhibition of complement and CD14 would have any effect on these inflammatory mediators. We documented a modest but distinct increase in several cytokines during the course of sepsis. Importantly, for IL-8 and IL-10, this increase was significantly less pronounced for the treated group, indicating an early effect of the treatment regimen on these two key cytokines. Increased levels of both the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 have been associated with severe sepsis and poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In models of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria-induced inflammation they are both highly dependent on activation of complement and CD14, IL-8 being relatively more complement-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This is in accordance with our present findings in polymicrobial sepsis where complement activation was completely abolished in the treated group, which probably is a main explanation for the reduced IL-8 release, although an additional effect of blocking CD14 is likely for both mediators. In order to attenuate the proinflammatory cytokine storm as well as the anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive state, we claim that early reduction of IL-8 and IL-10 might be beneficial in sepsis.</p><p>In the present study, however, the cytokine response was generally less pronounced than expected from such an aggressive model. This suggests that the rapid and extensive complement activation per se may play a major role at this early stage where the full-fledged systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and associated MOF did not have time to fully develop. Accordingly, few differences were seen in the hematological and clinical-chemical parameters reflecting organ damage. Yet, the unique finding of reduced mean total protein in the untreated group could be an early sign of capillary leak and therefore endothelial barrier dysfunction, which reportedly is one of the most important pathophysiological mechanisms in sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We do admit that the relatively short observational period as well as demanding nonparametric statistical analysis with increased risk of type II errors should be taken into consideration when interpreting the data.</p><p>Lastly, the blood cultures revealed growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, indicating a clinically relevant model of polymicrobial sepsis. We have previously shown that combined C5 and CD14 inhibition efficiently inhibits inflammation induced by both Gram-negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and Gram-positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] bacteria. Furthermore, we have shown that this combined inhibition, but not single inhibition of C5 and CD14, increased survival in a mouse CLP model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the present study we document for the first time that the combined regimen works in a large animal model of sepsis. It resembles human disease more closely and is clinically most relevant. The limited amount of inhibitors available and their high costs precluded us, however, from using adult pigs. Thus, the use of small piglets makes this model more relevant for neonatal sepsis than for adult sepsis, which also should be taken into consideration when interpreting the data. Finally, the fact that treatment was started at baseline, according with the &#x0201c;proof-of principle&#x0201d; of the protocol, is a limitation of the study with respect to clinical relevance for established sepsis. Recent data obtained in vitro using the combined complement- and CD14-inhibitory regimen &#x0201c;post challenge&#x0201d; indicates that a &#x0201c;therapeutic window&#x0201d; might exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], though an efficient effect of delayed treatment in vivo remains to be shown.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>From the results of the present study it is tempting to speculate that the combined inhibition of C5 and CD14 reduced the innate immune response to the extracompartmental gastrointestinal flora of the piglets, in turn reducing the derangement of the pulmonary circulation and thereby improving survival in this robust 8-hour model of sepsis. The need for antibiotic therapy in a clinical situation is obvious. Our hypothesis merits further testing in larger, longer and more comprehensive trials where the combined regimen we describe here is used to supplement conventional therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Key messages</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Treatment of sepsis is largely limited to antibiotics and supportive therapy.
