Traditionally, a standardized approach to exercise prescription has utilized relative percentages of maximal heart rate, heart rate reserve (HRR), maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max), or VO<sub>2</sub> reserve to establish exercise intensity. However, this model fails to take into consideration individual metabolic responses to exercise and may attribute to the variability in training responses. It has been proposed that an individualized approach would take into consideration metabolic responses to exercises to increase responsiveness to training.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomized control trial, participants will undergo a 12-week exercise intervention using individualized (ventilatory thresholds) and standardized (HRR) methods to prescribe CRF training intensity. Following the intervention, participants will be categorized as responders or non-responders based on changes in maximal aerobic abilities. Participants who are non-responders will complete a second 12-week intervention in a crossover design to determine whether they can become responders with a differing exercise prescription. There are four main research outcomes: (1) determine the cohort-specific technical error to use in the categorization of response rate; (2) determine if an individualized intensity prescription is superior to a standard approach in regards to VO<sub>2</sub>max and cardiometabolic risk factors; (3) investigate the time course changes throughout 12&#x000a0;weeks of CRF training between the two intervention groups; and (4) determine if non-responders can become responders if the exercise prescription is modified.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings from this research will provide evidence on the effectiveness of individualized exercise prescription related to training responsiveness of VO<sub>2</sub>max and cardiometabolic risk factors compared to a standardized approach and further our understanding of individual exercise responses. If the individualized approach proposed is deemed effective, it may change the way exercise specialists prescribe exercise intensity to enhance training responsiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02868710?term=individual+variability&#x00026;rank=6">NCT02868710</ext-link>.

Among these studies was an investigation into responses of maximal aerobic power in which it was reported that interindividual differences ranged from 5% to 88% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even though these original findings were reported over 30&#x000a0;years ago, substantial individual variability in response to prescribed exercise regimes remains a poorly understood phenomena. Nonetheless, it has been purported that a more individualized approach to the exercise prescription may enhance training efficacy and limit training unresponsiveness. For instance, it has been acknowledged as far back as the late 1970s that utilizing a relative percent method (i.e., % heart rate reserve [HRR]) to establish exercise intensity fails to account for individual metabolic responses to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, the relative percent concept remains the gold standard recommendation for exercise intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is both plausible and practical to think that an intensity set based on an individual&#x02019;s threshold measurement (i.e. ventilatory threshold) will not only encourage more positive physiological adaptations, but may account for some of the variability in training responsiveness by taking into consideration individual metabolic differences. Based on an extensive search of the literature, to our knowledge, there is only one investigation that set out to determine the incidence of response based on exercise prescription using standard methods (%HRR) compared to individualized methods (threshold based) in which they found 100% of the individualized group responded in a positive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, this investigation had several limitations including a modest intervention duration, only reported maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) changes, and sourced measurements for biological variability to use as criteria for response rate rather than testing for biological variability within the laboratory where data were collected.</p><p>A notable factor that confounds current understanding of training response variability is the absence of a set definition in the literature of how to interpret a response (i.e. what classifies someone as a responder or non-responder). Indeed, criteria to determine incidence of response for changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max have included classifying a fixed proportion of the lowest training response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], absolute changes in pre- to post-intervention values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and a change of more than one standard deviation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. More recently, it has been proposed that technical error (TE), the combination of day-to-day biological variability and measurement error, should be applied to categorize response rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If these values are considered for each research cohort to report incidence of response, there would be greater consistency of reporting results within the literature to provide further insight on individual variability. Moreover, interpretation of the individual variability in training responsiveness is limited due in part to the standard practice of past studies only reporting group means and standard deviations. With reporting of only the mean and standard deviation, results of the intervention may not be applicable to all since there is a lack of understanding related to the individual variability of the investigation.</p><p>This trial will be the first investigation to address the incidence of response of VO<sub>2</sub>max and cardiometabolic risk factors following individualized and standardized cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) training using a specific cohort-calculated TE as the criteria for response. Similarly, this will be the first study to evaluate the efficacy of modifying the CRF training intensity prescription for non-responsive participants (based on changes of VO<sub>2</sub>max) to investigate subsequent training responsiveness.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research aims</title><p>The objective of this research is to determine the incidence of response to VO<sub>2</sub>max after implementation of a standardized (%HRR) and individualized (based on first ventilatory threshold [VT1] and second ventilatory threshold [VT2]) approach to exercise prescription in a community wellness program for 12&#x000a0;weeks. The primary measurement outcome will be VO<sub>2</sub>max with secondary outcomes of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, blood glucose, and resting heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Thus, the main research aim is to determine whether an individualized exercise prescription decreases the incidence of non-response to CRF and cardiometabolic measurements compared to the standardized approach. Similarly, another primary research aim is to determine if changing the prescription of CRF intensity for a subsequent 12-week intervention elicits more responsiveness in previously categorized non-responders (based on VO<sub>2</sub>max responses). A key secondary aim of this research is to establish whether there are differences in the time course changes of VO<sub>2</sub>max and cardiometabolic risk factors between the experimental groups every fourth week during the 12-week intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have been taken into consideration for the planning of this trial (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The overall study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is a randomized control trial with participants completing a CRF training study 3&#x000a0;days a week for a duration of 12&#x000a0;weeks using a standardized (%HRR) and an individualized (based on VT1 and VT2) approach (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: overall SPIRIT study schedule or Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> for SPIRIT schedule design). If participants do not have a favorable outcome after 12&#x000a0;weeks (i.e. non-responders), they will complete a second 12-week intervention with a crossover design of the other exercise prescription. The protocol has been approved by the Auckland University of Technology Ethics Committee (16/264) and the Human Research Committee of the Institutional Review Board at Western State Colorado University (HRC2016-01-90R6) with data collection occurring only at Western State Colorado University.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of the research design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1735_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

</p><p>Participants will be excluded from the study if they have any signs, symptoms, or diagnosed cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease.

The control group participants must meet the same inclusion criteria and will not be allowed in the study if they meet the exclusion criteria, as previously mentioned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Sample size was projected with change in VO<sub>2</sub>max as the main outcome variable. The means and standard deviations of a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] were examined and the effect size for this research study was calculated. Assuming a power of 0.80 was needed and the calculated effect size for change in VO<sub>2</sub>max was 0.30, it was determined that approximately 16 participants would be needed for each group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is assumed there would be an approximate 20% dropout rate, so the aim will be to achieve 20 participants per group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Testing</title><p>Testing sessions for both the experimental and control groups will be conducted at baseline and every fourth week during the 12-week intervention period. Testing sessions every fourth week will help to establish the current physiological levels to develop the exercise prescription for the experimental groups.</p><p>Testing will be conducted in a university-based performance laboratory under the supervision of three exercise physiologists. Prior to completing the testing sessions, participants will be asked to refrain from food and drink (other than water) for 12&#x000a0;hours prior to the testing session, be well hydrated prior, avoid the use of alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco within 24&#x000a0;hours of testing, be well rested, avoid significant exertion or exercise the day of testing, and report any medication use prior to testing. Testing will occur as close to the same time of day as possible with the above directions prior to each testing session. Following the blood lipid profile testing (explained in detail later) and prior to the maximal exercise test, participants will be provided a small snack. The testing will be conducted as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Dietary analysis: participants will be instructed to not change their usual diets throughout the study and asked to complete a 3-day dietary intake recall including two weekdays and one weekend day to evaluate energy intake and the proportion of kilocalories from carbohydrates, protein, and fat.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anthropometric measurements: participants will be weighed on a calibrated, medical-grade scale to the nearest 0.01&#x000a0;kg and height will be measured using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.5&#x000a0;cm. Waist circumference will be measured by the narrowest horizontal circumference above the umbilicus and below the xiphoid process to the nearest 0.5&#x000a0;cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Resting heart rate (RHR) and BP measurements: procedures for RHR and BP will follow standard guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In summary, participants will be required to sit for 5&#x000a0;minutes with sufficient back support, feet on the ground, and arms supported at heart level. Resting heart rate will be recorded by using a medical-grade pulse oximeter after the 5&#x000a0;minutes of seated rest. Blood pressure will be measured using a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer to determine left arm brachial artery BP on consecutive measure separated by 1&#x000a0;minute. The mean of the systolic and diastolic measures will be considered the resting BP.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fasting blood glucose and lipid measurements: all fasting lipid and blood glucose measurements will be analyzed using the Cholestech LDX system (Alere, Waltham, MA, USA), which has been shown to have excellent reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. An optics check of the Cholestech LDX system will be completed at the beginning of each testing session. Participants will be asked to thoroughly wash hands with soap and rinse with warm water. The skin will then be wiped with an alcohol swab and allowed to dry. Using a lancet, the distal end of the third digit of the right hand will be punctured and a finger stick sample will be collected using a 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l capillary tube with blood flowing freely into the tube without milking the finger. The blood sample will then be extracted into a commercially available test cassette for analysis. Measurements of TC, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and blood glucose will be obtained. Upon completion of the blood profile testing and data collection, blood samples will be disposed of based on standard biohazard procedures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>VO<sub>2</sub>max and verification bout: participants will complete a modified Balke, pseudo-ramp graded exercise test (GXT) on a power treadmill. Participants will walk or jog at a self-selected pace with an increase in incline of 1% every minute until volitional fatigue. Heart rate and expired gas will be measured continuously using a heart rate monitor and a calibrated metabolic analyzer, respectively. Data will be analyzed following guidelines previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In summary, gas exchange data will be time averaged for every 15&#x000a0;seconds, VO<sub>2</sub>max will be determined by averaging the last two 15&#x000a0;second samples, and maximal HR will be the highest achieved HR during the GXT.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Since a verification procedure has been found to be effective in middle-aged and older adults to confirm VO<sub>2</sub>max [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], this procedure will be used to ensure participants have reached maximal capacity. The verification trial will be performed 20&#x000a0;minutes after the GXT as recommended elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and has been confirmed to be an effective procedure at altitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The verification bout will consist of a workload that is 105% of the maximal workload during the GXT (last fully completed stage) as this workload has been shown to be sufficient to elicit verification test durations of 2&#x02013;3 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and will continue until volitional fatigue. Analysis of the verification bout will follow the same protocol as the GXT. &#x02018;True&#x02019; VO<sub>2</sub>max will be considered to be attained if the GXT and verification bout are within&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. If participants are unable to reach VO<sub>2</sub>max, they will be asked to repeat the trial no sooner than 24&#x000a0;h later.</p><p>The control group will be asked to maintain their normal lifestyle activity habits. Therefore, in addition to the previously stated battery of testing, control participants will also complete the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) every fourth week at the testing session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Biological variability and technical error</title><p>In order to establish criteria to categorize participants as responders or non-responders, the biological variability will be established to determine the TE. Therefore, from the pool of experimental research participants, 15 participants will be randomly selected based on when the referral or inquiry into the wellness program is received (i.e., participants 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. until 15 confirmed participants have been reached. If there are not 15 participants after the first round, then participants 2, 4, 6, etc. will be asked until the desired total of 15 participants is met). Participants will be asked to complete the baseline testing assessments twice within a 2-week period to determine the day-to-day biological variability. The biological variability will be combined with the typical error of the equipment utilized (sourced from the literature and company of the equipment) to determine the TE. More details related to the statistical approaches are located in the statistical analysis section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Exercise intervention</title><p>After the completion of the baseline testing, participants will be randomly allocated to either the individualized or standardized arms at a 1:1 ratio using a computerized stratified minimization sequence. One of the primary investigators will have knowledge of the treatment groups to which participants have been allocated in order to interpret test results and prescribe target exercise intensities. However, this same investigator will not be involved in the implementation of the exercise training programs (to be completed by research assistants) in order to mitigate researcher bias. Participants will then be asked to come to the laboratory on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to take part in the community wellness program and subsequent research. Upon arrival each day, participants will be asked to rest comfortably for 5&#x000a0;minutes in the seated position. Then, their resting BP and HR will be recorded. Following the resting measurements, participants will complete a 5-minute warm-up starting at a low and progressively increasing intensity until they are ready to begin their CRF exercise session. At this point, participants will be asked to stay within the designated HR (described in further detail below) outlined on their exercise log as determined based on their experimental group and week of experimental trial. At approximately 1/3 and 2/3 the total session time, an exercise physiologist or research assistant will record their current HR, rating of perceived exertion (scale 1&#x02013;10), intensity of aerobic equipment, and any other pertinent notes. At the end of the CRF exercise session, the participant will be asked to complete a cooldown in which the exercise intensity is gradually reduced. While resistance training is not part of this proposed experiment, it is an integral part of the community wellness program and could be a confounding factor to the overall incidence of response. Therefore, all participants will be asked to complete the resistance training after the CRF training session is completed in order to have consistency among all participants. During the first 4&#x000a0;weeks, there will be no resistance training. During the next 4&#x000a0;weeks (week 4&#x02013;8), there will be a learning and anatomical adaptation phase to resistance training in which proper technique and range of motion will be emphasized and participants will be acclimated to the resistance training machines. During the last 4&#x000a0;weeks (week 8&#x02013;12) participants will complete one set of 8&#x02013;12 repetitions on eight machine-based resistance training exercises and progress to two sets by the end of the 12th week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Determination of workload</title><p>For the standardized group, the workload will be determined based on %HRR and completed based on the following calculation:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

However, there is still an overall lack of understanding as to why this variability occurs. Unfortunately, there is minimal consistency in methodology and the criteria for determining incidence of response leading to the overall findings indicating there are changes in training responsiveness of &#x02212;33 to +76% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, some of the data associated with individual responses may be misleading as measurements were recorded as peak values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and may not be a direct representation of the maximal efforts for participants and, therefore, not an accurate representation of true physiological adaptations.</p><p>In order to have an all-inclusive definition for incidence of response the TE must be taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, it would be important to know biological variability and measurement error for each outcome to determine whether responses are beyond that of the TE. Two recent investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] utilized TE to determine response rate by defining a responder as an individual with improvements from pre- to post-training by&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;TE in a positive direction and, in contrast, an individual who improves by&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;TE as a non-responder. Nevertheless, for the two aforementioned studies, values for day-to-day biological variability were used from previously published work and may not be directly applicable to the population being studied or the environmental conditions in which data collection takes place.</p><p>Conventionally, results of exercise-based studies are reported as the mean and standard deviation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and only illustrate the main effects and group differences of training responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Overall, there is a lack in attention to individual differences with these conventional methods of reporting data since nearly 32% of measurements (distributed normally) fall outside of one standard deviation. Recent literature proposes reporting not only the mean, standard deviation, and group differences, but also individual responses to the training program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] or at least ranges of endurance changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This approach will strengthen study findings and provide further insight into the phenomenon of individual variability and training responsiveness.</p><p>From the HERITAGE Family Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], a large, well-controlled, 20-week standardized endurance training program, insight was gained on the incidence of response. It was reported that genetics may play a critical role in the incidence of response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] with trainability of VO<sub>2</sub>max linked to familial aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, a potentially overlooked factor in the individual variability may be linked to poor methodology of exercise prescription. Indeed, due to the theoretical and physiological mechanisms of exercise prescription, utilization of a threshold-based measurement for exercise prescription has been suggested to decrease the incidence of non-response and improve CRF and cardiometabolic factors compared to the traditional approach using intensities set relative to VO<sub>2</sub>max, HRmax, VO<sub>2</sub>R, or HRR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, there have been few studies that have reported individual responses following training relative to a threshold measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently only one study reporting individual responses to training comparing set intensities based on the first ventilatory threshold (VT1) and the second ventilatory threshold (VT2) measurements and percentage of HRR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. During incremental exercise, VT1 is the point at which increases in ventilation become non-linear (an increase in the ventilatory equivalents of oxygen [VE/VO<sub>2</sub>] with no increase in the ventilatory equivalents of carbon dioxide [VE/VCO<sub>2</sub>]) and VT2 is the point at which there is an accumulation of blood lactate due to the inability to buffer the amount of lactate produced (simultaneous increase in both VE/VO<sub>2</sub> and VE/VCO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, exercise intensity has been prescribed based on a relative percent concept &#x02013; based on a percentage of HRmax, VO<sub>2</sub>max, VO<sub>2</sub>R, or HRR. However, caution has been advised for utilization of the relative percent method, specifically HRmax and VO<sub>2</sub>max, as criteria to determine workload as they may not be sufficient to elicit the desired metabolic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, percentages for both HRmax and VO<sub>2</sub>max correspond to a wide range of exercise intensities relative to threshold measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. For example, with exercise intensities between 58% and 75% of VO<sub>2</sub>max, some participants were found to be above while others were reported to be below their individual anaerobic threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Similar findings were noted when investigating a 12-month jogging/walking program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In order to make the prescription of exercise intensity more individualized, many researchers have used percentages of HRR as this takes into consideration not only HRmax, but also resting HR. However, aerobic thresholds were found to be at 70%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10% of HRR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] indicating large variability in the metabolic stress across individuals at a set percentage of HRR.</p><p>Indeed, genetics have gained a lot of attention to understand the specific roles of genes and response rates. However, based on the genetic evidence to date, there are many pathways that are associated with VO<sub>2</sub>max trainability and nearly an unlimited combination of signaling events that may influence the VO<sub>2</sub>max responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. With genetics proposed to account for less than 50% of the variance in responsiveness, the other 50% is still not well understood.</p><p>One of the major areas in which the literature is lacking in the understanding of training responsiveness is the investigation of an individualized approach to exercise prescription and the time course changes. With the emerging concept of &#x02018;exercise is medicine&#x02019; and the capacity to prescribe exercise to combat adverse effects of disease, the time course changes for VO<sub>2</sub>max and cardiometabolic risk factor measures need to be better understood to properly identify efficacious exercise doses (i.e., intensity, volume) that will elicit an adequate response. However, much of the literature on time course changes utilizes standardized methods of exercise prescription rather than individualized approaches. To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature in time course changes of VO<sub>2</sub>max and cardiometabolic risk factor outcomes with the use of a threshold-based protocol and exercise volume individualized based on kilocalories of expenditure per week with relation to body mass. Similarly, results of time course changes have traditionally been reported as only group means and standard deviations with individual time course changes not being reported. Based on a review of the literature, there have only been two studies to identify individual time course changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Reporting of individual time course changes for VO<sub>2</sub>max and cardiometabolic risk factor measurements will help to further understand the individual variability in training responsiveness.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations that merit discussion. It is possible there may be heterogeneity in training responses due to age alone given the large age range (30 to 75&#x000a0;years) that will be recruited for the current trial. However, the age range for the target sample will be comparable to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and also reflect the likely age range found in community exercise programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Another possible limitation is external validity given data collection will take place at moderate altitude. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence to suggest differences in training responsiveness (i.e. responders and non-responders) between altitude-residing individuals and sea level counterparts. A third potential limitation is the inability to anticipate how many participants will be categorized as non-responders following the first 12-week intervention. Indeed, this limitation could arguably be the most significant due to the second part of the trial (crossing over non-responders to the other prescription group) being underpowered if there are a low number of non-responders. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there are no previous investigations evaluating a crossover design to determine if non-responders can become responders with a different exercise prescription protocol. Therefore, even if the second part of the trial is underpowered, the results would provide valuable preliminary insight into the efficacy of individualized exercise prescription.</p><p>In summary, this original randomized controlled trial aims to (1) investigate the efficacy of an individualized exercise prescription at improving training responsiveness and, (2) to better understand the time course changes of training adaptations to both individualized and standardized exercise intensity prescription methods. It is anticipated that findings from this novel trial will add to our knowledge of how personalized exercise can enhance training efficacy and limit training unresponsiveness.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Study status</title><p>Recruitment will commence in September of 2016.
