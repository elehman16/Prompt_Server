Under these conditions, strategies to counter the impairments in cognitive function that accompany sleep loss (Belenky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>; Thomas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2000</xref>) are needed to help sustain workplace safety and productivity. Furthermore, appropriate countermeasures need to be developed based on both controlled laboratory and field experimentation.</p><p>Caffeine (1,3,7 trimethylxanthine) is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the world (Barone and Roberts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1996</xref>). When consumed, it is absorbed and distributed throughout the body, including the brain, and exerts its influence as an adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist (for reviews, see Carvey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>; Fredholm et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1999</xref>). Caffeine has significant effects on arousal of rested individuals (Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1987</xref>; Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1999</xref>; Warburton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1995</xref>) and substantial positive effects on vigilance, alertness and mood during periods of sleep loss (Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>). A relatively high 600-mg dose of caffeine is as effective as prescription medications such as modafinil and amphetamines for improving cognitive function and countering sleep loss during periods of prolonged wakefulness (Wesensten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>a). Daily consumption of caffeine is considered safe and without long-term risk for healthy adults (Bordeaux and Lieberman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>; Higdon and Frei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>; Nawrot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2003</xref>). Thus, caffeine is a viable candidate to sustain productivity and safety in the workplace during periods of extended operations that restrict sleep.</p><p>Military operations are an occupational setting where soldiers can be required to maintain periods of prolonged wakefulness, which can lead to extensive decrements in cognitive function (Belenky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>). Lieberman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>) studied the ability of caffeine to maintain cognitive function during a stressful military training exercise, which involved more than 3&#x000a0;days of sleep restriction together with physical and mental challenges. Following 72&#x000a0;h of sleep deprivation, a 200- and 300-mg dose of caffeine improved several measures of cognitive function including vigilance, reaction time, attention and mood, as well as improving speed of target acquisition during marksmanship testing compared with placebo (Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>; Tharion et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2003</xref>). A subsequent series of studies collectively demonstrated that a total dose of 600&#x000a0;mg caffeine provided throughout a night without sleep was effective in maintaining vigilance during both simulated urban and field observational tasks (McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>), restoring or improving physical performance compared with the rested state (McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2005b</xref>), as well as improving or maintaining marksmanship (McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005a</xref>; Tikuisis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2004</xref>).</p><p>Although caffeine&#x02019;s positive effects on vigilance and arousal during periods of sustained wakefulness have been repeatedly demonstrated (Beaumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2001</xref>; Bonnet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>; Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>; McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>), the effect of the drug on higher level cognitive function, such as executive control of attention and working memory, during periods of sleep deprivation appears less consistent (Wesensten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>a). Cognitive demands in a military workplace often require making complex decisions and responding and adapting to novel situations. Thus, to demonstrate caffeine&#x02019;s effectiveness in such an occupational setting, it is necessary to assess the efficacy of caffeine on more complex tasks, in addition to tests of vigilance and reaction time.</p><p>Furthermore, restricting sleep periods to the daytime over several days is a scenario consistent with current military engagements and demands of other occupations that require shift work. Often, these daytime sleep periods are not of sufficient duration or may not provide sleep of optimal quality (Torsvall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1989</xref>). Thus, it is not known whether these work conditions might increase the need to use a counter-measure strategy, such as caffeine, to help sustain cognitive function. Previous studies that have assessed the use of caffeine and afternoon sleep periods have used the afternoon sleep as a preventative measure prior to a period of overnight sustained wakefulness (Bonnet and Arand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1994b</xref>; Bonnet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>; Schweitzer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2006</xref>). The authors are unaware of studies that have compared the effectiveness of recovery afternoon sleep periods on performance with or without caffeine during subsequent overnight periods of sustained wakefulness.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of repeated administration of 200&#x000a0;mg doses of caffeine to sustain vigilance, reaction time, higher-order cognitive function that requires logical reasoning and live-fire marksmanship during three successive evenings of sustained wakefulness followed by 4-h afternoon periods for sleep. Caffeine was delivered in gum form since it is absorbed more rapidly into the circulation, presumably through the buccal tissue, than caffeine ingested in pill form (Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2002</xref>). Furthermore, this mode of delivery was chosen to be consistent with our previous studies that assessed the physical and cognitive effects of caffeine during sustained military operations conducted overnight (McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>). It was hypothesised that the cognitive function and marksmanship of participants receiving caffeine would be enhanced compared to those receiving placebo, despite the opportunity for all volunteers to sleep during the afternoon periods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was approved by the human ethics review committees of Walter Reed Army Institute of Research USA, Defence R&#x00026;D Canada&#x02013;Toronto, the New Zealand Northern Region and the New Zealand Defence Force. Volunteers were not enrolled if they were taking any medication or if they had given blood within 30&#x000a0;days of the study. Twenty male Special Forces personnel aged 28.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.7&#x000a0;years (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD), with height of 177.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.5&#x000a0;cm and body mass of 81.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.0&#x000a0;kg participated in this study. All were cleared to participate in the study by their base Medical Officer. An initial briefing informed potential volunteers of the details, discomforts and risks associated with the experimental protocol, and written informed consent was obtained. After the briefing, soldiers were assigned randomly into five groups of four with two soldiers in each group receiving caffeine (total <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) or placebo (total <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) in a double-blind manner. The soldiers were informed that no coffee- or caffeine-containing products were to be consumed after awakening on the morning of day 1 of the study. The limited number of volunteers precluded inclusion of additional caffeine and placebo groups that would not be given the opportunity for daytime sleep. However, since current military operational scenarios provide limited sleep opportunities during the day, the current study was designed to be of the greatest ecological validity for the end-user.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Caffeine questionnaire</title><p>A questionnaire was administered to determine average daily caffeine consumption. This questionnaire collected information regarding the type and volume of caffeinated beverages consumed daily, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks and energy drinks, daily consumption of chocolate bars and candies and the use of caffeinated over-the-counter medications. The calculated average caffeine use for each individual was used to examine the relationship between caffeine use and field vigilance test (FVT) performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Caffeine and placebo</title><p>Caffeine or placebo was administered at 2145, 0100, 0345 and 0700&#x000a0;h beginning the evening of day 2 and continuing through the morning of day 5 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Two pieces of 100-mg caffeine gum (Stay Alert&#x000ae;, Marketright Inc., Plano, IL) or placebo were chewed for 5&#x000a0;min for a total dose of 800&#x000a0;mg caffeine over a 24-h period. This total overnight dose of 800&#x000a0;mg caffeine was greater than used during previous studies that examined a single overnight period of sustained wakefulness and testing (McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>). However, this repeated 200&#x000a0;mg dose of caffeine at 2&#x02013;3-h intervals is effective for sustaining elevated plasma caffeine levels and maintaining cognitive performance throughout a night of sleep loss (Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Syed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>). In addition, the last 200&#x000a0;mg dose in the morning was provided in close proximity to the performance of an obstacle course. Both the placebo and caffeine gum contained sugar, gum base, corn syrup, natural and artificial flavours, fructose, glycerine, sucralose, artificial colour and butylated hydroxytoluene and were similar in appearance and taste.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The timeline for the study design</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Day</th><th>Time (h)</th><th>Task</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="5">One</td><td char="." align="char">0745</td><td>Participant briefing and initial training on cognitive tasks</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0815</td><td>Control live-fire and familiarization of obstacle course</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2000</td><td>Familiarization of cognitive tasks</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2030</td><td>Control FVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2230</td><td>Familiarization of cognitive tasks</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Two</td><td char="." align="char">0800</td><td>Control obstacle course</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0900</td><td>Control cognitive tasks</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">1815</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2100</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2145</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2200</td><td>Live-fire marksmanship followed by PVT</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="14">Three</td><td char="." align="char">0045</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0100</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0130</td><td>FVT session 1</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0330</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0345</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0415</td><td>FVT session 2</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0615</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0700</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0730</td><td>Obstacle course</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">1300</td><td>PVT followed by 4-h sleep period</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">1815</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2100</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2145</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2200</td><td>Live-fire marksmanship followed by PVT</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="14">Four</td><td char="." align="char">0045</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0100</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0130</td><td>FVT session 3</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0330</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0345</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0415</td><td>FVT session 4</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0615</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0700</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0730</td><td>Obstacle course</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">1300</td><td>PVT followed by 4-h sleep period</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">1815</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2100</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2145</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2200</td><td>Live-fire marksmanship followed by PVT</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="11">Five</td><td char="." align="char">0045</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0100</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0130</td><td>FVT session 5</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0330</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0345</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0415</td><td>FVT session 6</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0615</td><td>PVT, LRT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0700</td><td>200&#x000a0;mg drug or placebo, PVT</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0730</td><td>Obstacle course</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">0920</td><td>PVT followed by 2-h sleep period</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">1130</td><td>PVT, de-brief and release</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Cognitive tasks included logical reasoning (LRT), psychomotor vigilance (PVT) and the field vigilance (FVT) tests</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p>The study timeline is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

During these intervals, the stimuli were presented randomly every 5 to 20&#x000a0;min, with an average inter-stimulus interval of 15&#x000a0;min. The volunteer was instructed to push a small button on the monitor in response to the stimulus.</p><p>Each sequence of stimuli provided up to three opportunities to respond. Once a subject responded, no additional stimuli were presented until the next sequence occurred. If the subject did not respond to the first stimulus in the sequence (lasting 120 ms, 40&#x000a0;% max vibration) within 6&#x000a0;s, a second slightly longer (160&#x000a0;ms) and more intense stimulus (50&#x000a0;% max) was presented, and the subject had another 6&#x000a0;s to respond. If he still failed to respond a third and final longer (240&#x000a0;ms) and more intense (60&#x000a0;% max) stimulus was presented and the subject had eight additional seconds to respond. If the subject responded to any of the stimuli in a sequence, it was recorded as a &#x0201c;hit.&#x0201d; If the subject did not respond at all, it was recorded as a &#x0201c;miss.&#x0201d; Data were analyzed as correct responses and latency to respond from the first stimulus offset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Actigraphy</title><p>Volunteers wore an actigraph (Octagonal Sleep Watch, Precision Control Design, Ft Walton beach, FL) on their non-dominant arm for 7&#x000a0;days prior to and throughout the study.

In military theatres of operations, adverse changes in cognitive function are associated with increased friendly-fire incidents (Belenky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>), and in the transportation industry, these impairments are related to an increase in accidents (Horne and Reyner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1995</xref>). Importantly, this study suggests that the use of caffeine could sustain workplace productivity and safety in occupational settings that provide less than optimal periods of sleep during successive days of operations and require personnel to function during the overnight hours.</p><p>The impact of sleep loss on cognitive function is well documented (Dinges and Kribbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1991</xref>; Kreuger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1989</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>; Thomas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2000</xref>), and the magnitude of these effects can be equal to or greater than the impairments associated with moderate levels of alcohol intoxication, clinical doses of sedating drugs or clinical hypoglycaemia (Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>). It was evident in this study that under such adverse circumstances reaction time slowed, vigilance decreased and speed of decision-making was reduced. This supports the general recommendation of optimising sleep behaviour in occupations where these cognitive components are important for ensuring safety in the workplace.</p><p>The benefits of using caffeine as a countermeasure to offset cognitive impairments during a period of sustained wakefulness are well established (Beaumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2001</xref>; Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>; Penetar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1993</xref>; Walsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1990</xref>; Wesensten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>a). In a military setting, caffeine is also effective in maintaining vigilance and reaction time during periods of sleep deprivation (Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>; McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>), as well as restoring or improving physical performance (McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>) and maintaining or improving marksmanship (McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005a</xref>; Tharion et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2003</xref>; Tikuisis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2004</xref>). The findings from the current investigation extend these previous observations on the repeated use of caffeine during successive overnight periods of sustained operations with restricted opportunities for sleep.</p><p>Cognitive performance during the first overnight period of sustained wakefulness in the late evening of day 2 and early morning of day 3 was maintained with repeated 200-mg doses of caffeine as demonstrated by significant performance improvements in PVT, FVT and LRT compared with placebo. These differences between caffeine and placebo are consistent with our previous field studies that examined the effects of caffeine during a single overnight period of sleep loss (McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>). In addition, the current study demonstrated that subsequent 4-h sleep opportunities during the afternoon were not able to restore the impairments in cognitive function that followed the overnight periods of sustained wakefulness without caffeine supplementation. Those receiving placebo slept more during the overnight vigilance testing as well as during the afternoon sleep periods, yet their cognitive performance remained significantly impaired compared with those receiving caffeine. Despite obtaining less sleep during the afternoon periods, the soldiers&#x02019; cognitive performance improved with continued overnight caffeine supplementation and was comparable with baseline scores, with the exception of some reductions during the second overnight testing period.</p><p>It cannot be determined whether afternoon sleep periods assisted in maintaining cognitive performance for those receiving caffeine since our experimental design did not include a group that was required to remain awake for the duration of the study. Other studies that have included afternoon sleep periods prior to overnight sleep deprivation and compared the effectiveness of caffeine supplementation on cognitive function during the overnight period have used the prior sleep periods as a preventative measure (Bonnet and Arand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1994a</xref>; b; Bonnet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>; Schweitzer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2006</xref>), rather than for the purpose of restoration following sleep loss as was performed in the current investigation. Many studies that have examined the effectiveness of caffeine alone to enhance cognitive performance during sleep loss have either tested the effect during a single overnight period of sustained wakefulness (Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>; Walsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1990</xref>) or did not provide the caffeine until a longer period (40&#x000a0;h or more) of sleep loss had elapsed (Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>; Penetar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1993</xref>; Wesensten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>a). Thus, direct comparisons to the current investigation are not possible. However, during 48&#x000a0;h of sleep deprivation, it has been reported that repeated 300&#x000a0;mg doses of caffeine every 6&#x000a0;h beginning early during the first overnight period could not sustain cognitive performance at baseline levels during the second night of sleep loss (Bonnet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>). Similarly, although cognitive performance of the caffeine-treated group improved versus the placebo-treated group throughout 64&#x000a0;h of sustained wakefulness with twice daily doses of 300&#x000a0;mg slow release caffeine, performance began to deteriorate relative to baseline scores during the second overnight period of sleep loss (Beaumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2001</xref>). In the present study, there were also some decrements in cognitive performance for FVT during the second overnight period, but this was not the case for LRT, PVT or responses to the vigilance monitor and the FVT responses rebounded to baseline levels during the third night of testing. Thus, it appears that the additional sleep during the afternoon, albeit only 65&#x000a0;min as indicated by wrist monitors, was an effective strategy together with the repeated dosing of caffeine (total, 800&#x000a0;mg/night) during the overnight periods to sustain cognitive performance for the duration of the current study.</p><p>Interestingly, the combination of caffeine together with afternoon sleep periods maintained higher-order decision-making at baseline levels for the duration of the study. These effects are most clearly illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> where the overnight circadian effect is demonstrated by the prolonged decision-making latencies during the LRT for the placebo group but not for those receiving caffeine. The positive impact of caffeine on decision-making processes has been demonstrated during the initial 24&#x000a0;h of sleep loss (Bonnet and Arand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1994b</xref>; Bonnet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>), but the effects become either less consistent (Wesensten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>a) or become similar to placebo with longer periods of sleep deprivation (Bonnet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>). Thus, in the present study, the additional afternoon sleep periods and/or the higher total dose of caffeine during the overnight periods may have accounted for the extended benefits that were observed during the LRT. Experimental design for future study would ideally include a group that was required to remain awake for the duration of the study in order to conclusively determine whether afternoon sleep periods assisted in maintaining cognitive performance for those receiving caffeine.</p><p>Occupational circumstances in the civilian workplace would generally be less extreme than the sleep-loss scenario examined in the current study, as the former might include additional nights of sustained wakefulness but longer recovery sleep periods during the day. Nevertheless, it has been shown that reducing daily sleep from 9&#x000a0;h to 5 or 7&#x000a0;h over a 7-day period produces persistent reductions in cognitive function during the day. The sustained impairment in cognitive function for the placebo group in the current study is consistent with these reductions in cognitive performance observed over this 7-day period of chronic sleep restriction (Belenky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>). Use of a countermeasure strategy, such as caffeine, would seem necessary to restore cognitive function, even in these less severe occupational settings, as long as the daytime recovery sleep periods are less than optimal. However, one might expect that the caffeine dose required to restore cognitive performance to baseline levels would be less than the cumulative dose of 800&#x000a0;mg used in the current investigation.</p><p>It should also be noted that continued overnight dosing of caffeine could compromise and/or reduce the duration and quality of the limited sleep opportunities that exist during the day. If quality of sleep is reduced, then performance benefits from caffeine could be reduced during subsequent overnight periods of sustained wakefulness. Studies that have assessed the impact of caffeine on quality of sleep have typically administered the drug during a period of sustained wakefulness (from 24 to 64&#x000a0;h), which was followed by a single recovery sleep period during the day (Beaumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>; Carrier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>; Killgore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>; LaJambe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>; Wesensten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>b). Interestingly, those studies that assessed cognitive function following this recovery sleep period reported little, if any, impairment due to reduced quality of sleep following caffeine ingestion (Beaumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>; Killgore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>; LaJambe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>; Wesensten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>b). However, none of these studies continued to assess cognitive performance during subsequent overnight periods of sleep loss that included caffeine ingestion, with additional recovery sleep periods provided during the day. In the present study, despite receiving less sleep during the afternoon recovery sleep periods (as indicated by actigraphy) the caffeine group continued to perform better during the overnight periods of sustained wakefulness. Thus, at least for the scenario of three successive overnights sessions, caffeine was a successful countermeasure strategy to sustain cognitive function despite the reduced duration of afternoon sleep. We cannot state for certain whether continued redosing with caffeine during additional overnight periods of sleep loss would continue to sustain cognitive performance despite potentially less recovery sleep. Also, with continued overnight dosing, a tolerance to caffeine may develop, which could reduce the effects of a given dose of the drug on cognitive function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Marksmanship</title><p>Accurate targeting of friend and foe is a skill requiring both fine motor control and higher-order decision-making capability.

In addition, with highly trained Special Forces personnel, neither sleep loss nor ingestion of a cumulative 600-mg dose of caffeine affected live-fire marksmanship (McLellan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2005b</xref>). In the current investigation, accurate&#x000a0;live-fire decisions of friend and foe targeting were unchanged compared with placebo conditions over cumulative sleep loss. It is critical that caffeine not impair marksmanship if it is to be used in military settings where accurate marksmanship is essential. Fine motor control and hand steadiness may be reduced following ingestion of larger caffeine doses approximating 400&#x000a0;mg (Jacobson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1991</xref>), and these changes might be expected to impact marksmanship accuracy. In this study, when testing followed the initial 200&#x000a0;mg dose of caffeine provided in the late evening on each day, accuracy was unchanged. It is not known whether testing conducted following the overnight periods of sleep loss that accompanied total caffeine doses of 800&#x000a0;mg, (approximately 10&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) would have led to impairments in marksmanship. Although we did not directly assess hand steadiness, collectively, the findings suggest that caffeine will not have detrimental effects on live-fire marksmanship for highly trained military personnel. This observation is consistent with studies that assessed marksmanship with small arms simulators (Tharion et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2003</xref>; Tikuisis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2004</xref>) rather than using live-fire, friend&#x02013;foe testing scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Limitations</title><p>There were certain study limitations that could affect the interpretation of our findings. First, experimental control is reduced during field experimentation, and access to study participants and time constraints negated options for inclusion of caffeine or placebo study groups who did not receive afternoon sleep periods. Nonetheless, the ecological validity of the study design, which included input of the end-user, is an important consideration with field experimentation, and reduced experimental control may be one limitation that cannot be fully addressed.</p><p>Second, outcome measures for cognitive tests such as the PVT and LRT involve speed or time. It has been suggested that caffeine can have a direct effect on nerve conduction velocity (Bazzucchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>), which could account for some of the changes observed for the caffeine group with these dependent measures. In contrast, others have not observed an increase in motor unit firing rates following caffeine ingestion (Kalmar and Cafarelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>; Meyers and Cafarelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2005</xref>; Plaskett and Cafarelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2001</xref>), and these findings are consistent with our view that caffeine impacts cognitive function, as assessed by tests such as the PVT and LRT, through its antagonistic effects on central adenosine receptors rather than through a direct effect on nerve conduction velocity. Nevertheless, the reader should remain cognizant of the fact that caffeine&#x02019;s effects on peripheral motor responses may influence outcome measures of tests designed to assess cognitive function.</p><p>Also, it has been suggested that caffeine&#x02019;s positive effects on arousal and vigilance reflect primarily the reversal of withdrawal effects imposed by abstinence periods within study designs (James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1994</xref>; James et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>; Rogers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>). However, other investigators have disputed this hypothesis (Ein&#x000f6;ther and Giesbrecht <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>). In the present study, the abstinence period was almost 48&#x000a0;h prior to the first drug administration; thus, withdrawal effects, if present, should have begun to decrease (Juliano and Griffiths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>). In addition, the majority of participants would be considered light or non-habitual consumers of caffeine where withdrawal effects would be minimal or non-existent (Rogers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2013</xref>). Also, except for the one participant with the highest reported daily caffeine use, correlations between changes in performance during FVT over successive nights of testing and habitual caffeine use were weak and non-significant. Finally, the data were reanalyzed with the highest consumers of caffeine removed from both groups, and the main effect of the drug and the interaction effects remained as stated in the results. Interestingly, when only the low consumers (less than 50&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were compared for the caffeine (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) and placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) groups, the FVT still revealed an effect of the drug and a decrease in performance for the placebo group on nights 2 and 3, whereas the caffeine group&#x02019;s performance remained unchanged. As a result, it is unlikely that withdrawal reversal was responsible for the differential effects observed between the drug and placebo groups.</p><p>The LRT demonstrated significant effect in which the placebo group made more correct responses, but overall the caffeine group correctly responded more rapidly. This suggests speed/efficiency of processing was improved with caffeine. In the Marksmanship test, response time was not measured; hence, it is not known whether placebo treated personal took longer to identify and accurately respond to the friend&#x02013;foe stimuli resulting in the unchanged results in both groups for targeting.</p><p>Finally, cognitive function is known to exhibit a circadian rhythm (Monk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1997</xref>), and the control FVT scores were obtained at a time where cognitive performance would be expected to be better than performance in the early morning hours. Thus, in addition to the effects of sleep loss, some of the deterioration in performance observed among the placebo group could reflect this circadian effect, which was also evident during the LRT (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Nonetheless, caffeine was able to maintain performance during FVT comparable to the control condition throughout the overnight period of testing (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and the drug removed any evidence of a circadian effect on the response to the LRT (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that 800&#x000a0;mg of caffeine provided during overnight periods of wakefulness is an effective strategy to sustain cognitive function when less than optimal sleep periods are provided during the afternoon. Reaction time, vigilance and logical reasoning were all maintained with caffeine supplementation and remained at or close to control levels for the duration of the study. Thus, when individuals are required to work during the overnight and do not receive sufficient sleep during the day, caffeine supplementation at night should be considered to help maintain workplace productivity and safety.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was conducted in conformity with AR 70&#x02013;25 and USAMRDC Reg. 70&#x02013;25 on the use of human volunteers in research and the &#x0201c;Guiding Principles for Research Involving Animals and Human Beings&#x0201d;.
