The disease is characterised by abnormal and irreversible bronchial dilation, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality attributable to airway obstruction, poor gas transfer and chronic bronchial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. Up to 64% of patients with bronchiectasis are chronically infected with pathogenic bacteria, most commonly <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. These infections damage host defences and the respiratory epithelium, and can result in a vicious cycle of infection and inflammation with persistent symptoms, frequent acute exacerbations and disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. One of the main therapeutic challenges is the clinical management of chronic airway infection because of frequent antibiotic resistance (especially to oral antibacterials), common side-effects of systemically administered antibacterials and intolerance to inhaled antibacterials (bronchospasm). These problems make non-CF bronchiectasis a difficult disease to treat and there is currently no approved antibacterial therapy for long-term treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>].</p><p>Off-label treatments for non-CF bronchiectasis include systemic and nebulised antibacterials, oral and inhaled mucolytics, hyperosmolar agents, bronchodilators and sputum clearance techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. However, these treatments do not adequately manage the number of exacerbations that patients may experience and, in some cases, their benefits have not been investigated fully. The lack of adequate evidence supporting their use for managing exacerbations of bronchiectasis is noted in current European guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. There is a need to develop new therapies that will effectively treat the underlying chronic infection, thereby reducing bronchial suppuration and the number of exacerbations, and preventing disease progression.</p><p>Ciprofloxacin, a broad-spectrum antibacterial, has proven bactericidal activity against pathogens relevant to non-CF bronchiectasis, including <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. Ciprofloxacin has been formulated into a dry powder for inhalation (DPI) using PulmoSphere&#x02122; technology (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) for use with the small, portable, breath-actuated T-326 inhaler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. Controlling the particle size and density of the active drug using PulmoSphere technology allows for optimal drug delivery to the central and lower airways. Results from clinical trials conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with CF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed that ciprofloxacin DPI was well tolerated, with pharmacokinetics reflecting efficient lung targeting and low systemic exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>].</p><p>In addition to measures of respiratory function, techniques to assess health status are increasingly being evaluated and have been validated in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. These include the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), a self-completed questionnaire devised to measure HRQoL in individuals with chronic airflow limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. In addition, the Fatigue Impact Scale has been used to measure the correlation between fatigue and markers of disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin DPI treatment for 28 days, with 56 days of follow-up, in individuals with non-CF bronchiectasis by examining changes in bacterial load and other important clinical outcomes, as well as tolerability.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study subjects</title><p>Adult subjects aged &#x02265;18 years were eligible for inclusion into the study if they had: either proven and documented diagnosis of idiopathic or a post-infective non-CF bronchiectasis (documentation of investigations to exclude other aetiologies reviewed) confirmed by high-resolution computerised tomography (radiology report reviewed); a history of exacerbations (two or more courses of systemic antibacterials or one or more hospitalisation for intravenous antibacterial treatment for pulmonary exacerbations in the previous 12 months); stable pulmonary status, defined as stable symptoms not requiring a new therapeutic intervention in the preceding 30 days; stable disease for &#x02265;30 days before study entry; and if they were able to produce a pre-treatment sputum sample of &#x02265;5 mL that was culture positive for a pre-defined potential respiratory pathogen (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (mucoid or nonmucoid), <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>, Enterobacteriaceae, <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> and <italic>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</italic>).

Subjects on long-term antibacterials could stop for 1 month and then enter the study. To concede to clinical practice, chronic macrolide use was allowed as a stable anti-inflammatory maintenance therapy for bronchiectasis, but only if therapy had been commenced for at least the last 30 days before randomisation.</p><p>Subjects who had an exacerbation or another indication requiring administration of an antibiotic were discontinued from the study.</p><p>The conduct of this study met all local legal and regulatory requirements and was in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation guideline E6: Good Clinical Practice.

Further details are included in the online supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study end-points</title><p>The primary efficacy end-point was to determine the effect of ciprofloxacin DPI on total bacterial density of pre-defined potential respiratory pathogens in sputum, by measuring the reduction in log<sub>10</sub> CFUs per gram of sputum after the 28-day treatment period and comparing the difference between ciprofloxacin DPI and placebo in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (defined in the online supplementary material).</p><p>Secondary end-points included time to exacerbation, emergence of new potential respiratory pathogens, emergence of resistance among baseline pathogens, changes in inflammatory biomarkers, and change in 24-h sputum volume and colour from baseline. Changes from baseline in pulmonary function (FEV<sub>1</sub> and forced vital capacity (FVC)) and in health status (SGRQ) at days 29, 56 and 84 were also evaluated, in addition to AEs and results of physical examinations, vital signs and laboratory analyses. Study-defined &#x0201c;eradication&#x0201d; was failure of bacterial growth from a valid post-baseline sputum sample in subjects with a positive baseline culture (all subjects). Samples were taken at screening, randomisation, day 8 (during treatment), EOT, and 14, 28 and 56 days after EOT. Samples were also taken at premature discontinuation of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Two populations were considered for efficacy analysis: the mITT and per-protocol (defined in the online supplementary material populations). The primary analysis was performed on both mITT and per-protocol populations and was a comparison of change in total bacterial load at EOT between ciprofloxacin DPI and placebo, using a two-way ANCOVA method with baseline bacterial load as covariate and factors including treatment group and study centre.</p><p>Changes in sputum colour and volume were analysed by colour charts and 24-h sputum volume was analysed by frequency tables. The principal investigator provided investigators with photographs of mucoid, yellow, green and brown sputum. Changes in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC were analysed by a two-way ANCOVA with baseline values as covariates and with factors including treatment group and study centre. Lung function parameters (FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC) as absolute raw values and % predicted were analysed with descriptive statistics.</p><p>The safety analysis set (defined in the online supplementary material) was used for all safety assessments. AEs that occurred after the start of study treatment and up to 7 days after EOT were classed as treatment emergent or worsening of existing AEs. Laboratory variables, vital signs and other safety data were described by summary statistics (defined in the online supplementary material).</p><p>Sample size estimation is described in the online supplementary material.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study population</title><p>In total, 277 subjects were screened and 124 subjects were randomised to treatment (103 completed treatment and 74 completed the study) at 35 centres in six countries (Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the USA) from June 29, 2009 to September 17, 2010. Of the randomised subjects, 60 received ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg <italic>b.i.d.</italic> and 64 received placebo <italic>b.i.d.</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="erj-41-05-1107-f01">fig. 1</xref>). Most subjects who discontinued before randomisation provided an inadequate sputum sample (<italic>i.e</italic>. a sample from which the pre-defined pathogens could not be cultured). All subjects randomised were included in the safety and mITT populations, and 82 subjects (37 and 45 in the ciprofloxacin DPI and placebo groups, respectively) were included in the per-protocol population. Despite the high number of subjects excluded from the per-protocol population (mainly because EOT cultures were not available due to subjects not producing sputum), the results of the efficacy analysis in both the mITT and per-protocol populations were similar. The mITT data for all end-points are presented here, as are the per-protocol results for the primary end-point. The remainder of the per-protocol results are presented in the online supplementary material.</p><p>Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar in both treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="erj-41-05-1107-t01">table 1</xref>).

We excluded aetiologies in which response to treatment could be affected by complicating factors, for example, poor mucus clearance attributable to primary ciliary dyskinesia, allergic inflammation and immune deficiency. A relatively large number of study centres were required for recruitment but the results were conclusive despite any variability this may have introduced, and the interaction term between treatment and centre for the main analysis was not significant (p=0.214).</p><p>The results of the current study show, for the first time in non-CF bronchiectasis, that ciprofloxacin DPI produced a statistically significant reduction in total bacterial load after 28 days of treatment compared with placebo. The more than three-log-fold reduction in bacterial counts is equivalent to a &#x0003e;99.9% reduction in bacterial load. Moreover, a greater percentage of subjects receiving ciprofloxacin DPI had negative bacterial culture at EOT than did subjects receiving placebo. A reduction in colony count for the two most prevalent pathogens in non-CF bronchiectasis, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, was observed with ciprofloxacin DPI treatment. Although the study was not powered to show a significant difference in the number of subjects reporting exacerbations, a trend was observed favouring ciprofloxacin DPI, suggesting that it might be a useful agent in the management of this patient population. Reduction of bacterial load in the lungs should reduce both airway inflammation and the risk of exacerbations, which is supported by the observation of a reduction in sputum purulence. Prior data support associations between sputum colour and bronchial inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>]. Hence, the results of this study show an emerging pattern of clinically meaningful effects on the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis.</p><p>The most common dosing interval used for the aerosolised antibacterials currently available or in development is a cycle of 28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment. A rapid return to near baseline values in bacterial load was observed between EOT and the end of the study. However, at day 56, which would correspond to the return to treatment in this proposed cycled regimen, the decrease in bacterial burden was still apparent. The rapid drop in bacterial load followed by rebound is consistent with the apparent impact of ciprofloxacin DPI on the pattern of exacerbations, <italic>i.e.</italic> suppression relative to placebo in the first 42 days of the study and incidence rates becoming similar thereafter.</p><p>An important rationale for using this regimen (28 days on/28 days off treatment) is to minimise the development of antibacterial resistance. Resistance can develop after exposure of a pathogen to an antibacterial; the 28-day off-treatment period removes the selective pressure of the antibacterial, allowing pathogen susceptibility to return towards its pre-treatment level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. Potential resistance development, as indicated by changes in MIC, was observed in this study: isolates from six subjects in the ciprofloxacin DPI group demonstrated MIC increases by EOT, and subsequent MIC decreases in isolates from four of these subjects were reported by day 56.</p><p>In addition to improvements in clinical efficacy parameters, trends towards improvements in patient-reported health status for subjects receiving ciprofloxacin DPI were observed with the SGRQ at EOT, despite the brief treatment period. This was close to a clinically relevant improvement (-4.0 points in SGRQ; lower scores represent improved HRQoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. This trend was also observed at day 56 but not at the end of the study, indicating that any reported benefit on health status was temporary.</p><p>Ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg <italic>b.i.d.</italic> was well tolerated; the AEs observed are common in subjects with respiratory diseases, with the most frequently reported AE being exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>]. No significant changes in laboratory parameters were observed and there was a low incidence of drug-related AEs, with no significant differences observed between the ciprofloxacin DPI and placebo groups. The incidence of AEs associated with non-CF bronchiectasis, including bronchospasm, cough and haemoptysis, was low throughout the treatment period.</p><p>Ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg achieved a significant reduction in bacterial load compared with placebo in subjects with post-infective or idiopathic non-CF bronchiectasis whose disease profile and severity warranted consideration of inhaled antibiotic therapy. Ciprofloxacin DPI was well tolerated when administered <italic>b.i.d.</italic> for 28 days. The improvements observed with ciprofloxacin DPI in secondary clinical and quality of life-related end-points were not statistically significant. Further studies powered to evaluate the clinical effects of long-term intermittent ciprofloxacin DPI therapy are therefore needed in this patient population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p content-type="financial-disclosure">All analyses were carried out by the study sponsor and the Data Review Committee was responsible for validating all clinical failure data.
