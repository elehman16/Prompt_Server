Both energy metabolism and cerebral vaso-dilation are dependent on adequate micronutrient status. This study investigated whether supplementation with ascending doses of multi-vitamin/minerals could modulate the metabolic and cerebral blood-flow consequences of performing cognitive tasks that varied in difficulty.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups study 97 healthy females (25&#x02013;49 y), who were not selected on the basis of any nutritional parameters, received either placebo or one of two doses of multivitamins/minerals. Cerebral blood-flow (CBF) parameters in the frontal cortex, and total energy expenditure (TotalEnergy), carbohydrate and fat oxidation (CarbOxi/FatOxi), were measured during 5 tasks of graded cognitive difficulty and a control task (5 min per task) using Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Indirect calorimetry of exhaled pulmonary gas (ICa) respectively. Assessments took place 60 min after the first dose and following eight weeks supplementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During task performance supplementation with the first dose of micronutrients led to a dose-dependent increase in TotalEnergy and FatOxi throughout the post-dose assessment period following the higher dose, and increases in the total concentration of haemoglobin, a proxy measure for CBF, during task performance following the lower dose of vitamins/minerals (also containing coenzyme-Q10). Chronic supplementation over 8 weeks led to a dose-dependent increase in TotalEnergy during the task period. There were no interpretable effects on mood or cognitive performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results show that acute supplementation with micronutrients in healthy adults can modulate metabolic parameters and cerebral blood flow during cognitive task performance, and that the metabolic consequences are sustained during chronic supplementation. These findings suggest that both brain function and metabolism are amenable to micronutrient supplementation, even in adults who are assumed to have nutritional status typical of the population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02381964">NCT02381964</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12986-016-0071-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cognitive</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Indirect calorimetry</kwd><kwd>NIRS</kwd><kwd>Cerebral blood-flow</kwd><kwd>Vitamins</kwd><kwd>Minerals</kwd><kwd>Coenzyme Q10</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000801</institution-id><institution>Bayer HealthCare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Whilst the brain represents only approximately 2 % of body weight, it receives 11 % of cardiac output and accounts for more than 20 % of the body&#x02019;s total energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most of the brain&#x02019;s energy requirement is expended on neural signalling, with the high baseline levels of energy expenditure during resting wakefulness being augmented by comparatively small increases during focussed activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. During these periods of neural activity metabolic substrates (glucose/oxygen) cross the blood brain barrier and are delivered, on demand, to active brain areas via dilation of the local vasculature. Nitric oxide is a key mediator of this &#x02018;neurovascular coupling&#x02019; between neuronal activity and increased blood supply in active tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is released from cortical neurons in an activity-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The direct local increases in blood flow or metabolic substrates during local activity provide the proxy markers of activity for brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Interestingly, several studies have used indirect calorimetry (ICa) of exhaled pulmonary air to investigate changes in whole-body metabolism during brain activity. These studies have demonstrated increased overall energy expenditure during the performance of cognitive tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, as compared to other sleep stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and a shift towards fat oxidation during the middle and later stages of a chess game [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Vitamins and minerals play both direct roles in brain function (e.g. via neurotransmitter synthesis, receptor binding, membrane ion pump function) as well as indirect roles, for instance via their involvement in energy metabolism and the modulation of cerebral blood supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. With regards cellular energy production, most of the 13 vitamins and a number of minerals play direct or indirect roles in mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As an example, the water-soluble B vitamins play ubiquitous and essential interacting roles as coenzymes and precursors in the majority of cellular functions. Of particular relevance here vitamins B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>5</sub> are essential co-factors in mitochondrial aerobic respiration and cellular energy production via their roles in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the electron transport chain and the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell&#x02019;s energy currency; whereas vitamins B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>9</sub>, and B<sub>12</sub> play essential roles in all aspects of one-carbon metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Similarly, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential coenzyme required alongside the vitamins for the mitochondrial production of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. CoQ10, which is also a potent antioxidant, is synthesised endogenously at a low rate, and its level can be augmented from dietary sources. It has been noted that deficiencies in both the B vitamins and CoQ10 are associated with fatigue and a number of conditions related to compromised mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The role of multiple vitamins in overall somatic energy production has been investigated directly in a single study conducted in 87 obese females which used ICa to assess the effects of 26 weeks supplementation with multi-vitamins/minerals or placebo on energy expenditure. The results showed that supplementation was associated with a significant increase in resting energy expenditure and fat oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>As well as pivotal roles in mitochondrial energy production, both vitamins and CoQ10 are also associated with cardiovascular functioning, and therefore, by implication, the delivery of metabolic substrates to the brain. As an example, the status of vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and B vitamins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] have all been shown to be related to peripheral blood flow as indicated by measures of endothelial function. Similarly, single doses of vitamins B<sub>9</sub>, C, E and C/E combined have all been shown to increase vasodilation, as measured by flow mediated dilation, in groups with disease or dietary manipulation related endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similarly, there is evidence that longer term supplementation with vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], vitamin B<sub>12</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], vitamin B<sub>9</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] can improve endothelial function in groups with poor endothelial function, cardio-metabolic disorders or a deficiency in the specific vitamin. In the case of CoQ10, a recent meta-analysis of the results of five methodologically adequate studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] suggested that supplementation with CoQ10 can also engender improvements in endothelial function and other cardiovascular parameters. The underlying hypothesis for the vasodilatory effects of these micronutrients typically relates to their antioxidant properties. However, in the case of vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], vitamin B<sub>9</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. and CoQ10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], specific roles in the synthesis of nitric oxide or the activity of nitric oxide synthase have been identified.</p><p>The relationship between micronutrients and energy production/blood flow becomes most pertinent in light of evidence suggesting that a substantial proportion of the general population of developed countries are deficient in one or more vitamins and minerals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The reversal of marginal insufficiencies/deficiencies may well underlie recent demonstrations of improved mood or cognitive performance following supplementation with multi-vitamins/minerals in healthy cohorts of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Given the above, the current study investigated whether supplementation with multi-vitamins/minerals (&#x000b1; CoQ10) could modulate the increases in energy expenditure and concentrations of haemoglobin, a proxy measure of local cerebral blood flow (CBF), associated with differing intensities of cognitive tasks, using ICa and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) respectively. This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups study therefore involved the monitoring of metabolic parameters and CBF parameters during five tasks that exerted varying levels of cognitive demand and a somatically matched control task.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The study employed a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups design with energy metabolism, and cerebral hemodynamics during cognitive tasks being measured following a single dose (Day 1) and after eight weeks (Day 56) supplementation with one of two multivitamin/mineral supplements or placebo.

The differential path-length factor was adjusted according to the age of the participant using the proprietorial software. Relative concentration changes in Oxy-Hb, Deoxy-Hb and Total-Hb were calculated by means of a modified Beer-Lambert law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] using the proprietorial software. Given the extended recording period and the investigational aims, a simple two emitter/optode pair configuration was utilised (i.e. 2 channels). The emitter/optode pairs were positioned over the left and right frontal cortex using a standard optode holder headband, which separated the pairs from each other by 4 cm. Each pair therefore collected data from an area of prefrontal cortex that included the areas corresponding to the International 10&#x02013;20 system Fp1 and Fp2 EEG positions. Prior to the primary analysis described below, ANOVAs including hemisphere (i.e. optode) as an additional factor (i.e. hemisphere x day x epoch x treatment) were carried out. In the absence of any treatment related interactions with &#x02018;hemisphere&#x02019;, data from the two optodes were simply averaged for all of the analyses reported in this paper.

In this instance modified, five minute versions of the Serial 3 s and Serial 7 s tasks, and a novel Serial 17 s task were employed. For each task a standard instruction screen informed the subject to count backwards in threes (sevens or seventeens) from a given randomly generated number between 800 and 999, as quickly and accurately as possible. Subjects were also instructed verbally that if they made a mistake they should carry on subtracting from the new incorrect number. Each three-digit response was entered via the linear number keys with each digit being represented on screen by an asterisk. Pressing the &#x02018;enter&#x02019; key signalled the end of each response and cleared the three asterisks from the screen. The task was scored for total number of subtractions and number of errors.

The practice visit comprised the obtaining of informed consent, the collection of demographic and medical history information and review of conformity to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Vital signs, height, weight (plus calculation of BMI) were measured, and, where applicable, a confirmatory pregnancy test was carried out. Following screening, participants were instructed in the completion of the cognitive tasks, and were allocated their counterbalanced cognitive task order. They then underwent a full ICa/NIRS/cognitive assessment, as described below for Day 1 and Day 56, with the exception that the ICa and NIRS recording started 10 min before the cognitive task period rather than 70 min before (to allow for treatment absorption) on the subsequent days.</p><p>Within 28 days of the practice day participants attended the laboratory for the Day 1 assessment. Following confirmation of compliance with all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the measurement of vital signs, participants were randomized to their treatment group, after which a venous blood sample was collected. Once the ICa mask and NIRS were in place, and the proper functioning of the equipment had been confirmed, the participant sat for a 10 min resting ICa and NIRS measurement, the last 5 min of which was used as the pre-dose baseline measure for the CBF parameters. Once the participant had consumed their day&#x02019;s treatment they sat quietly for 60 min, the last 5 min of this period was used to calculate the pre-task, resting-period ICa parameters. Participants then completed the Bond-Lader mood scales and &#x02018;energy&#x02019; visual analogue scales. The six x five minute tasks were then completed in the counterbalancing order allocated to the participant, with a two minute rest period between each task. Finally, the participant completed the Bond-Lader mood scales and Energy VAS. NIRS data was collected continuously throughout the entire assessment.

The modulation of metabolic parameters was also seen following 8 weeks administration.</p><p>With regards to the metabolic parameters, the multivitamin/mineral treatment had a dose dependent effect, with significant modulation only achieved following the treatment containing the higher (3RDA) of two doses of water soluble vitamins. This treatment resulted in both increased fat oxidation (FatOxi) and increased total energy expenditure (TotalEnergy), as assessed using indirect calorimetry of exhaled pulmonary gas. These effects were seen throughout the cognitive task period which commenced 60 min post-dose. The increase in total energy expenditure was also sustained, and consolidated, at the end of the 8 week treatment period. Whilst not having a significant impact on metabolism, the lower dose of vitamins/minerals with added coenzyme Q10 (1RDA + Q10) increased the CBF hemodynamic response in the frontal cortex during tasks that activate this brain area following a single dose. In this case both Total-Hb, a measure of overall local CBF, and Oxy-Hb were increased, with no significant effect on concentrations of Deoxy-Hb. Interestingly, the pattern of hemodynamic responses was similar, if less striking, in the 3RDA group (and reached statistical significance during several tasks prior to the Bonferroni corrections). There was no evidence of acute modulation of hemodynamic parameters as a consequence of the day&#x02019;s dose of the treatment after 8 weeks administration of either treatment. However, as noted above, CW-NIRS generates concentration change, rather than quantitative data, and therefore only provides a measure of acute changes in CBF hemodynamics during each discrete recording session. It therefore provides no direct measure of any changes that have taken place between recording sessions, in this case as a consequence of chronic supplementation with micronutrients. The lack of a chronic effect may therefore reflect a simple attenuation of the acute effects seen following the first dose of 1RDA + Q10 on Day 1. However, this could equally, in turn, reflect either increased circulating levels of micronutrients as a consequence of 8 weeks administration, which may have precluded a further acute effect of an additional dose of micronutrients on Day 56; or it may indicate that a gross, undetectable change in CBF parameters had already taken place, attenuating the possibility of any additional acute effects of Day 56&#x02019;s treatment.</p><p>Whilst this study also provides the first demonstration that simply increasing the demands of cognitive tasks significantly modulates whole-body metabolic parameters, there was no significant interaction between treatment and specific tasks for either the metabolic or CBF parameters.</p><p>In general, the results with regards the effects of micronutrients on energy metabolism are broadly in line with those of Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], who examined the effect of 26 weeks supplementation with multivitamin/minerals on overall resting metabolism in obese females using ICa, and found that micronutrient supplementation was associated with a significant increase in resting energy expenditure and fat oxidation. The specific acute, dose-related increase in fat oxidation seen here is also consistent with previous ICa studies that have demonstrated an increase in fat oxidation as a consequence of acute and chronic administration of calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], acute supplementation with calcium and vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and chronic vitamin C supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In terms of the mechanisms underlying the effects on overall energy expenditure it is notable that vitamins as a group are directly involved in every aspect of mitochondrial function including aerobic respiration and cellular energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. With regards fat oxidation, the effects of calcium have been attributed in part to modulation of lipolysis and lipogenesis driven by modulation of levels of circulating 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and parathyroid hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], whereas vitamin C is theorised to have its effect via its role as a cofactor for the biosynthesis of carnitine, an essential molecule in the oxidation of fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Whilst the effects on fat metabolism here may be predicated simply on the inclusion of calcium, and vitamins C and D in the micronutrient preparations, it is not possible to preclude modulation of a multitude of metabolic parameters by the other vitamin and mineral components. It is also worth noting that whereas the chronic effects of supplementation on fat oxidation were not significant, the numeric pattern of the data was consistent with the acute results.</p><p>The pattern of CBF parameter effects seen here was for a treatment related augmentation of the hemodynamic responses seen during the performance of the active cognitive tasks, with significant increases in total-haemoglobin, a proxy measure of CBF, seen during four of the five active task periods. In this instance, due to the counterbalancing of the order of task performance, the benefits could not be attributed to specific task demands, and a secondary task x treatment analysis did not demonstrate an interaction between the two factors. The modulation of CBF parameters seen here may reflect the requirement to deliver more metabolic substrates to active neural tissue to support the increased energy metabolism during task performance, although the lack of the linear dose&#x02013;response that was seen with regards the fat/energy metabolism measures (for which the 3RDA elicited greater modulation) with respect to the NIRS measures argues against this. Rather, the increased hemodynamic response may well be driven by direct modulation of the neurovascular coupling of local blood flow to activity. In line with this, the cardiovascular/vasodilatory properties of several micronutrient components of the interventions here, including vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], vitamin B<sub>9</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and CoQ10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], have previously been attributed to their roles in the synthesis of nitric oxide, the ubiquitous signalling molecule that mediates both peripheral vasodilation and neurovascular coupling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The results here certainly find support from those previous studies that demonstrated improved peripheral vasodilation (as assessed by flow mediated dilatation), following single doses of vitamins B<sub>9</sub>, C and E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Naturally, the question arises as to why the CBF effects were greater in the treatment containing lower levels of water soluble vitamins. The obvious answer is that the 1RDA treatment also contained CoQ10, which is intricately intertwined with the working of the vitamins with respect to mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and which may also exert an independent effect in terms of NO synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Supplementation with CoQ10 has been shown to consistently engender improvements in peripheral endothelial function and other cardiovascular parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which would be expected to co-vary with modified brain vasodilation. Having said this, the dose administered here was comparatively small; 4.5 mg as opposed to 150 mg + in most of the previous cardiovascular studies. This suggests that the doses administered in the cardiovascular studies are unnecessarily large, or that co-administration with vitamins relevant to CoQ10 function engenders a synergistic effect. Either way, reference to the nutritional parameter data showed that the 1RDA + Q10 group had significantly greater plasma levels of CoQ10 than the other treatment groups after 56 days supplementation, suggesting that this dose was adequate to augment the levels of CoQ10 that were being synthesised endogenously by individuals during the supplementation period.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that single doses of multi-vitamin/minerals have previously been shown to modulate regional brain activity during a task measuring focussed attention as measured with functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], and cerebro-electrical activity during an attention task as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p>It is also worth noting that, in this instance, visual inspection of the data in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows that the pattern of concentration change in haemoglobin concentrations was for a gradual increase during the absorption period following all treatments. However, this pattern represents concentrations simply returning to approximately zero over this period i.e. reverting to the resting baseline values. We surmise that the initial reductions in haemoglobin concentrations immediately after the treatments reflect the break in &#x02018;quiet&#x02019; sitting and the consumption of the treatment capsules plus water at this point. Given that all of the reported significant effects of treatment are directly in comparison to placebo, and that these are seen only during task completion, it seems unlikely that any underlying pattern of gradual modulation during the absorption period could have influenced the results reported here.</p><p>In terms of cognitive function, there was no interpretable evidence of modulated performance. Whilst a single measure evinced an isolated statistical difference, there was no evidence of similar effects from any other measure, so it seems likely this was just a chance finding. The lack of cognitive effects may be attributable to several factors; this was a comparatively small study with less than 30 participants per group (as opposed to over 100 per group in previous cognitive studies showing benefits of multivitamins/minerals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; the participants were fitted with restrictive head gear and a face mask, potentially introducing physical or psychological noise into the data; and the cognitive outcomes did not have a baseline that could be used as a covariate, greatly reducing the sensitivity of the assessment.</p><p>With regards the nutritional parameters, Vitamin D was raised following 56 days supplementation with both multivitamin interventions, and plasma levels of CoQ10 were significantly higher in the 1RDA + Q10 group on Day 56 (although this did not represent a significant increase on the ANCOVA, possibly due to a trend towards higher pre-treatment levels in this group on Day 1). Homocysteine levels were also reduced by both treatments. This is of particular interest as this potentially neurotoxic amino acid, levels of which correlate positively with cardiovascular disease, age-associated cognitive decline and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], can be seen as a marker of low endogenous levels of a number of B vitamins. The mean pre-treatment homocysteine levels in this study were ~11.5 &#x003bc;mol/L on Day 1, a figure that is close to the 11.7 &#x003bc;mol/L reported as the average in the UK&#x02019;s Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The cut-off point in homocysteine levels associated with greater cardiovascular disease risk is typically taken as 12 &#x003bc;mol/L. Some 35 % of the current study&#x02019;s sample exceeded this cut-off. These figures, and the fact that supplementation with simple multi-vitamins significantly reduced homocysteine levels in a dose-related manner (to 10.5 and 9.5 &#x003bc;mol/L respectively for the 1RDA + Q10 and 3RDA treatments), suggest strongly that the cohort here, who were not selected on the basis of any nutritional parameters, did not have optimal, or even adequate, nutritional status as a group at the study outset. Similarly, pre-treatment vitamin D levels in the cohort of ~20&#x02013;25 mg/L would be regarded as insufficient by some established cut-off parameters, suggesting that a dose of 200 IU is adequate to rectify this insufficiency.</p><p>With regards the limitations of the study, the most obvious is that one of the working hypotheses here was that the treatments might have a greater effect on CBF parameters and metabolism during the more difficult tasks. The individual tasks impacted on CBF parameters and metabolism depending on their cognitive demands, but the effects of the micronutrients were seen as main effects or interaction effects of treatment, with no task interactions. In hindsight a more comprehensive assessment of simple resting metabolism would have been informative. Having said this, the study provides a very useful starting point for future studies looking at the metabolic effects of micronutrients, and in particular it demonstrates that ICa is a sensitive measure of the somatic metabolic effects of brain activity. A second limitation of the study was the inability of the NIRS equipment utilised here to measure quantitative changes over time. This makes the absence of acute effects on Day 56 difficult to interpret, but again, suggests that research using the more recently introduced quantitative NIRS systems, which can be used to measure changes over time, would be informative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the results of the current study suggest that simple supplementation with micronutrients, many of which are implicated in fat oxidation, mitochondrial metabolism and vasodilation, can increase fat oxidation, total somatic energy expenditure and cerebral blood-flow during task performance following a single dose, and increase energy expenditure following 8 weeks supplementation. These results suggest several conclusions. The first is that single doses of multi-vitamins/minerals are capable of modulating metabolic parameters, and that, furthermore, a single dose of multi-vitamins/minerals with added CoQ10 can increase the CBF response to task performance in the frontal cortex, thereby increasing the delivery of metabolic substrates to active neural tissue. Given that the higher 3RDA dose of water soluble vitamins failed to elicit significant modulation of oxygenated and total-haemoglobin these results suggest that the dosage of CoQ10 (4.5 mg) administered here was sufficient to act either additively or synergistically with the co-administered vitamins/minerals in terms of promoting cerebral vasodilation. Second, the results suggest that multivitamin/mineral supplementation over a longer period of time (in this case 56 days) is capable of significantly increasing overall energy metabolism/expenditure. Given that there was no interaction between task demands and treatment related effects, it is possible that these effects could also be seen at rest, and likely that they would be evident during physical exercise. These possibilities deserve further research attention.</p><p>Finally, the logical conclusion that can be garnered from the results here is that, if it is possible to beneficially modulate core physiological processes such as energy metabolism and cerebral blood-flow by simply administering vitamins and other micronutrients to healthy members of the population, then it must be the case that the nutritional status of the sample, and by implication the general population, is inadequate. This suggestion is supported by the comparatively high pre-treatment levels of homocysteine seen across the cohort here. If it is the case that our results reflect wide-spread nutritional insufficiency, and given the challenge that shifting the general population&#x02019;s dietary patterns poses, then, in the absence of a healthy diet, supplementation with vitamins and other micronutrients may prove a useful method of recharging nutritional status for a section of the population.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12986_2016_71_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</label><caption><p>Exploratory analysis of the effects of differing task demands on ratings of mental fatigue/difficulty and all physiological variables, irrespective of treatment. <bold>Table S1.</bold> Mean scores (+SEM) averaged across Day 1 and Day 56 from the exploratory analysis of the effects of differing task demands on ratings of mental fatigue/difficulty and all physiological variables, irrespective of treatment. <bold>Table S2.</bold> Means (+SEM) of ICa data obtained during the 5 min pre-task resting period, the control tapping task and 5 task periods on Day 1 and Day 56. <bold>Table S3.</bold> Cognitive task performance scores (mean plus SEM) on Day 1 and Day 56. <bold>Table S4.</bold> Subjective difficulty and mental fatigue data (+SEM) from Day 1 and Day 56.
