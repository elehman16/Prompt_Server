The early introduction group (EIG) continued breastfeeding with sequential introduction of 6 allergenic foods: cow's milk, peanut, hard-boiled hen's egg, sesame, whitefish (cod), and wheat; the standard introduction group followed the UK infant feeding recommendations of exclusive breastfeeding for around 6&#x000a0;months with no introduction of allergenic foods before 6&#x000a0;months of age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One thousand three hundred three infants were enrolled. By 5&#x000a0;months of age, the median frequency of consumption of all 6 foods was 2 to 3 times per week for every food in the EIG and no consumption for every food in the standard introduction group (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001 for every comparison). By 6&#x000a0;months of age, nonintroduction of the allergenic foods in the EIG was less than 5% for each of the 6 foods. Achievement of the stringent per-protocol consumption target for the EIG proved more difficult (42% of evaluable EIG participants). Breastfeeding rates in both groups significantly exceeded UK government data for equivalent mothers (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001 at 6 and at 9&#x000a0;months of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Early introduction, before 6&#x000a0;months of age, of at least some amount of multiple allergenic foods appears achievable and did not affect breastfeeding.

Infants who had consumed anything other than breast milk or water since birth, were part of multiple births, were born prematurely, had any serious medical condition, or were participating in other medical research were not eligible for enrollment. A&#x000a0;current household member with a food allergy was not an exclusion criterion.</p><p>Ethical approval for the EAT study was provided by St Thomas' Hospital REC (REC reference 08/H0802/93), and the study is registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register (14254740). Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all children enrolled in the study, and safety data were regularly reviewed by the EAT study's independent data monitoring committee.</p><p>Families were recruited to the study from those who responded to a flyer mailed to parents of young infants throughout England and Wales (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The 6 allergenic foods selected to form the trial's intervention, cow's milk, peanut, hen's egg, sesame, whitefish (cod), and wheat, were chosen from the foods most commonly found to be responsible for IgE-mediated food reactions in children.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The trial's primary outcome is the prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy, which we aimed to confirm using double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge to 1 or more of the 6 intervention foods at between 1 and 3&#x000a0;years of age (see <xref rid="tblE1" ref-type="table">Table E1</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0010">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). The trial is powered at 80% to detect a halving of food allergy prevalence between the study groups. At study commencement, the expected food allergy prevalence in the standard introduction group (SIG) was 6%. An analysis undertaken after 3&#x000a0;months of recruitment indicated that the EAT parental atopy rate was higher than that of a contemporary UK population-based study.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Data from the Early Prevention of Asthma in Atopic Children study was used to extrapolate the expected SIG food allergy rate based on the observed prevalence of 30% visible eczema among these initial participants.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Taken together, the revised estimate of expected food allergy prevalence in the SIG group was 8%.

After 6&#x000a0;months of age, introduction of allergenic foods was left to parental discretion.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>EIG</title><p>Infants in the EIG were randomized to the sequential introduction of the 6 chosen allergenic foods alongside continued breastfeeding (see <xref rid="dfig4" ref-type="fig">Fig E4</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="interref0010">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). Infants in this group underwent skin prick tests (SPTs) in duplicate to the 6 intervention foods and an open incremental food challenge if they showed any sensitization (SPT response &#x0003e;0&#x000a0;mm, no upper limit). Children who were not sensitized or who were sensitized but had a subsequent negative food challenge result were asked to follow the EIG introduction regimen. Those given a diagnosis of allergy based on results of a food challenge were advised to avoid that food and continue the introduction regimen for the other allergenic foods. Fundamental to the trial design was the intention that breast milk should remain an important source of nutrition until at least 6&#x000a0;months of age, regardless of study group. The EIG introduction regimen is described in more detail in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> section in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0015">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Online interim questionnaires</title><p>An online questionnaire completed monthly until 12&#x000a0;months of age and every 3&#x000a0;months between 12 and 36&#x000a0;months of age by the infants' parents was the main portal of communicating information about the health and diet of the participants to the study team.

Eight children were sensitized to 2 or more foods (milk/egg, 3 infants; milk/peanut, 2 infants; egg/cod, 1 infant; peanut/egg/wheat, 1 infant; and milk/peanut/egg, 1 infant). Histamine, like the food allergens, was tested in duplicate. There were no children with double-negative histamine responses.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Breastfeeding in the EAT study</title><p>The EAT study aimed to maintain high breastfeeding rates in the EIG and achieve high levels of exclusive breastfeeding in the SIG, in line with UK Government infant feeding policy. For the EIG, the intention was that exclusive breastfeeding ceased with the introduction of baby rice (or something similar) shortly after enrollment. In the EIG 97% (593/610) of infants were still being breastfed alongside solid food consumption at 6&#x000a0;months of age. This is significantly higher than the 81% reported to be breastfeeding at 6&#x000a0;months of age by IFS2010 (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001) among those mothers who had breastfed to 4&#x000a0;months of age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p>In the SIG 67% (425/636) of infants were still being exclusively breastfed at 5&#x000a0;months of age versus 27% in the IFS2010 by using the baseline of IFS2010 infants exclusively breastfed at 3&#x000a0;months of age (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001). At 6&#x000a0;months of age, 29% (137/636) of infants were still being exclusively breastfed compared with only 4% in the equivalent IFS2010 infants (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001). Similar to the EIG, 98% (618/633) of mothers in the SIG were still breastfeeding by the time their child was 6&#x000a0;months of age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Allergenic food consumption</title><p>Allergenic food consumption in the EIG from enrollment to 6&#x000a0;months of age is presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>. The data are taken from the 4-, 5-, and 6-month online questionnaires and refer to the 4&#x000a0;weeks previous to the participant's monthly birthday. Questionnaire completion rates were high (EIG: 90% at 4&#x000a0;months and 84% at 5 and 6&#x000a0;months). By 6&#x000a0;months, consumption of each allergenic food had occurred in more than 95% of EIG infants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The quantity of allergenic food consumed and the speed of introduction varied for each food. The protocol introduced cow's milk (as yogurt) as the first allergenic food, and this also being a familiar infant food was reflected in the consumption results. Wheat was introduced last and not before 4&#x000a0;months of age, and adherence to this instruction was 100%. The proportion of EIG infants consuming the recommended amount of 4&#x000a0;g of food protein per week by 6&#x000a0;months of age was as follows: cow's milk, 85%; peanut, whitefish, and wheat, 65%; and egg and sesame, 50% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>Cow's milk formula introduction was minimal in both groups before 6&#x000a0;months of age: 2% in the SIG and 3% in the EIG ever having had cow's milk formula by 4&#x000a0;months of age and 7% in both groups ever having had cow's milk formula by 5&#x000a0;months of age. It was unknown whether mothers would adhere to the SIG regimen and avoid early introduction of the allergenic foods. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> shows the differences between frequency of consumption of allergenic foods in the SIG and EIG at 4, 5, and 6&#x000a0;months of age. For every allergenic food, in each age group there was significantly higher consumption in the EIG than the SIG (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001 for each food). There was minimal consumption of all allergenic foods in the SIG until 6&#x000a0;months of age, when there was an increase in consumption of milk and wheat, although these were still consumed significantly less frequently than in the EIG (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0005). Only 2.6% of evaluable SIG participants had introduced any peanut, egg, sesame, fish, or wheat before 5&#x000a0;months of age (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>, criterion C). By 6&#x000a0;months of age, 5.6% of evaluable SIG participants had been given cow's milk formula in a volume exceeding 300&#x000a0;mL for 1&#x000a0;day or more (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>, criterion D), 8.8% had been given less than 300&#x000a0;mL/d, and 85.6% had never had any cow's milk formula.</p><p>In the EIG consumption was low for all allergenic foods except milk at 4&#x000a0;months of age but increased to a median of at least twice-weekly consumption for all allergenic foods at 5 and 6&#x000a0;months of age. However, although the median frequency of consumption of the 6 allergenic foods was at least twice weekly at 5 and 6&#x000a0;months of age, 4 of the 6 foods (peanut, egg, sesame, and whitefish) at 5&#x000a0;months and 2 (egg and whitefish) at 6&#x000a0;months of age were being consumed by 25% of EIG participants only once a week.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Overall per-protocol compliance</title><p>For more information on overall per-protocol compliance, see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>. The combination of the enhanced difficulty of being compliance assessable in the EIG (see section on per-protocol compliance status appraisal in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> section in this article's Online Repository) and a lower questionnaire completion rate in the EIG (data not shown) meant that there was a difference in the proportion whose compliance status was nonevaluable between the 2 groups (SIG, 7%; EIG, 19%). Hence participants in both groups in the EAT study fell into 3 compliance categories: compliant, noncompliant, and compliance not evaluable (not having completed the requisite questionnaires or formal dropouts from the study).</p><p>Ninety-two percent (558/606) of compliance-evaluable children in the SIG met the definition of per-protocol compliance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>).

Among 8- to 10-month-old infants in the IFS2010, egg and fish were being consumed less than once a week or never in 73% and 44% of infants, respectively.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Remarkably, 45% of all mothers in the IFS2010 actively avoided giving at least 1 particular ingredient. The most common allergenic food avoided was as follows: nuts (peanuts and tree nuts), 41% of all mothers; eggs, 12%; dairy, 11%; fish/seafood, 8%; and gluten/wheat, 3%. Concern about allergies (36%) was the most common reason for avoidance overall, but this varied by food: egg, 40%; dairy, 47%; and nuts, 63%. Concern about the infant being too young for the food and the presence of eczema were also common reasons for avoidance.</p><p>However, there are countries in which early allergenic food exposure is different. Observational evidence has emerged from both developed countries, such as Israel,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and developing countries, such as Ghana,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> where high amounts of peanut are consumed in a variety of forms during infancy, yet peanut allergy rates remain very low, suggesting a possible route of tolerance induction. Among Jewish children, genetic influences are not responsible because the prevalence of peanut allergy in Jewish children in the UK at 1.85% was significantly higher than the Israeli prevalence of 0.17%.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> It is interesting to note that the incidence of food allergy is believed to be increasing in Africa,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and a delay in introduction and reduced quantity of consumption of peanut has been postulated as a possible cause.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Despite the fear of allergy expressed in the IFS2010 survey, particularly with regard to peanut, we have demonstrated that parents were prepared to introduce peanuts and other allergenic foods into their infant's diet at less than 6&#x000a0;months of age.</p><p>Comments on the ability of EIG families to fulfill the overall per-protocol compliance targets have to take account of the compliance status being nonevaluable for 19% of the EIG participants. Consumption data from the questionnaires that were completed in this group demonstrate that their consumption pattern was similar to the noncompliant EIG participants, and hence the true overall per-protocol compliance target in the EIG group was likely to have been closer to 34% than 42%.</p><p>This difficulty in achieving the overall per-protocol target of 5 or more foods at 3&#x000a0;g of allergenic protein or more per week for 5 or more weeks was not a clear dichotomy of no consumption versus per-protocol target consumption because we have demonstrated that among EIG families completing the 6-month questionnaire, the percentage who had never tried each of the allergenic foods was minimal. However, clearly for at least 58% of EIG participants, the amount consumed during this early period was less than the overall per-protocol target we had set. For 4 foods at 5&#x000a0;months of age and 2 foods at 6&#x000a0;months of age, 25% of EIG participants were not consuming the foods twice weekly, as requested, making it significantly harder to achieve the per-protocol target in only 1 meal per week (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). However, the proportion of EIG participants not reaching the 3-g per week per-protocol target by 6&#x000a0;months was greater than 25% for egg and sesame, suggesting that although once-weekly consumption might partly explain why 58% did not meet the target, for other EIG participants, the amount being consumed at their 2 (or more) weekly meals clearly was not sufficient to meet the 3-g per-protocol target when the consumption for that week was combined.</p><p>Despite the low figure for overall EIG per-protocol compliance, at an individual-food level, for evaluable EIG participants, compliance with our per-protocol target varied from 42% for egg to 84% for milk. Wheat compliance was lower than that for egg but was distorted by the introduction regimen, which did not allow wheat introduction before 4&#x000a0;months, hence leaving less weeks available to achieve the target level of consumption by 6&#x000a0;months of age.</p><p>We deliberately set the bar high for overall per-protocol compliance in the EIG because the amount of allergen protein needed to potentially induce oral tolerance is unknown. We wanted to ensure that the majority of those not meeting the 3-g per-protocol weekly target were still consuming allergenic food protein in a quantity that might induce tolerance (1&#x000a0;g of peanut protein twice weekly in our previous research).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Our weekly per-protocol target had to balance the need to be recommending portion sizes appropriate for young infants with a frequency of consumption that was manageable for families given 6 foods were being introduced. Eighty-one percent of compliance-evaluable EIG children were consuming at least 2&#x000a0;g of protein a week (1&#x000a0;g of protein twice weekly) from at least 4 allergenic foods&#x000a0;for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks between 4 and 6&#x000a0;months of age (see <xref rid="dfig3" ref-type="fig">Fig E3</xref>).</p><p>Although overall compliance with the UK breastfeeding recommendations remains poor, the IFS2010 showed a continued increase in exclusive breastfeeding in the UK, with 69% of mothers exclusively breastfeeding at birth, up from 65% in 2005.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Exclusive breastfeeding until 6&#x000a0;months of age remains rare, with only 1% achieving this, but rates of nonexclusive breastfeeding have increased from 25% at 6&#x000a0;months in 2005 to 34% in 2010. Within this context, the breastfeeding performance in the EAT study exceeded that observed in equivalent mothers in the IFS2010 at every time point, demonstrating the commitment of the participants and the study team to promote breast-feeding. For the first time in a randomized trial, our study demonstrates that early solid food introduction has no deleterious effect on breastfeeding duration, which is consistent with the findings in the observational study by H&#x000f6;rnell et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> This is particularly important because murine research has suggested that breastfeeding might be a vital component in the mechanism to induce tolerance in patients with allergic disease,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and therefore the fact that 97% of EIG mothers continued to breastfeed while introducing allergenic foods might be a key part of our study findings.</p><p>The cohort's atopy status, as one would anticipate from the nature of the study, was enriched.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Eighty-two percent of EAT participants had a parental history of atopy (mother and/or father with self-reported asthma, eczema, or hay fever) that was greater than the 51% rate of allergy (the above conditions and self-reported food allergy in either parent or a sibling) reported in the IFS2010. In the latter the rate in mothers with a managerial/professional occupation (more similar to EAT mothers) was 56%, which was still significantly less than in EAT. At the 3-year visit, EAT parents undergo SPTs to a panel of airborne allergens, as well as to any food to which the parent suspects they are allergic. This will allow an objective measure of the degree of atopy in EAT parents and the extent to which this corresponds with the high parent-reported atopy rate. Our filaggrin mutation inheritance rate (11.9%) was slightly higher than that observed in the Isle of Wight cohort study (10.3%)<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> and a recent Irish birth cohort study (10.5%).<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Studies assessing unselected cohorts of 3-month-old infants are rare. The EAT visible eczema rate at age 3&#x000a0;months (24.4%) was higher than in the 6-month-old infants examined in the Irish cohort study (18.7%) by using the same diagnostic criteria, although the mean SCORAD score among those with eczema was significantly higher in the Irish study than in our study. The sensitization rate in the EIG in the EAT study was higher than the 1.2% observation in the Danish Allergy Research Centre&#x000a0;cohort,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> but the latter only tested for 2 foods, milk and egg, and used only a commercial SPT solution for the latter.</p><p>The EAT study differs from the LEAP study in a number of important ways. First, the EAT study is conducted on unselected infants, whereas the LEAP study only studied high-risk infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both. Second, the EAT EIG receives multiple food allergens, as opposed to only peanut. Third, the EAT study introduces complementary feeding earlier from 3&#x000a0;months of age. It is noteworthy that the window of opportunity to induce tolerance to peanut might be narrow. In the LEAP screening study a significant number of infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both could not enter the study or adhere to the study protocol because of potential or proved pre-existing peanut allergy (SPT &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm and those infants who reacted at baseline).<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The possibility of earlier introduction of peanut (as early as 3&#x000a0;months of age) could potentially enhance prevention of peanut allergy in the general population by inducing tolerance in those children who would otherwise have peanut allergy early in the first year of life. It remains unknown whether the window of opportunity to induce tolerance varies by food. Observational studies have suggested a protective effect of introducing egg between 4 and 6&#x000a0;months of age<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and for introducing cow's milk protein&#x02013;based formula milk before 14&#x000a0;days of age.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Among the randomized controlled trials published thus far, the Solids Timing for Allergy Research study introduced egg to 4-month-old infants with a nonsignificant reduction in egg allergy incidence,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and the LEAP study achieved peanut tolerance with introduction between 4 and 10&#x000a0;months of age.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>The EAT study has created 2 groups with significantly different early allergenic food exposure. This has been achieved without any adverse influence on breastfeeding performance. Although compliance with the early introduction of multiple foods in the amounts recommended proved difficult, at an individual food level, early introduction was more favorable. The EAT study design will allow us to assess the relative importance of the quantity, frequency, and number of allergenic foods in influencing food allergy development. We will also be able to investigate whether factors exist that can predict the likelihood of complying with the recommended EIG regimen. These findings will help inform future guidelines regarding early infant feeding policy.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Clinical implications</title></caption><p>The EAT study demonstrates that multiple allergenic foods can be introduced into the infant diet.

lipid profile tests), EIG infants proceeded to introduce&#x000a0;baby rice, pureed fruits or vegetables, or both during the first week until they were established on solid food. They then continued with these solids and additionally introduced cow's milk yogurt on 2&#x000a0;days of the second week. During weeks 3 and 4 of the early introduction regimen, peanut, hard-boiled egg, sesame, and whitefish (cod) were introduced sequentially in a random order, with 2 new foods introduced per week. Finally, wheat was introduced in week 5, reflecting the guidance on optimal timing of wheat&#x000a0;introduction after 4&#x000a0;months of age,<xref rid="bibE1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E1</sup></xref> and by week 6, infants were ideally consuming the required amount of all 6 allergenic foods each week (<xref rid="dfig4" ref-type="fig">Fig E4</xref>).</p><p>Introduction of nonallergenic foods was not restricted during this process, and the allergenic foods could be given in combination with other foods or each other once the allergenic foods had been successfully introduced and well tolerated.</p><p>The exact volume of allergen protein necessary to induce oral tolerance is unknown, but participants were asked to consume the equivalent of 2&#x000a0;g of each allergenic food protein twice each week (4&#x000a0;g of allergen protein per food per week). Therefore the full weekly amount for the allergenic foods consisted of 2 small 40- to 60-g portions of cow's milk yogurt, 3 rounded teaspoons of peanut butter, 1 small hard-boiled egg (&#x0003c;53&#x000a0;g), 3 rounded teaspoons of sesame paste, 25&#x000a0;g of whitefish, and 2 wheat-based cereal biscuits (eg, Weetabix).</p></sec><sec id="appsec1.2"><title>Allergenic protein dose</title><p>The 2&#x000a0;g of allergen protein per dose is based on our earlier research investigating peanut consumption among Israeli and UK Jewish children.<xref rid="bibE2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E2</sup></xref> In that study the median frequency of peanut consumption was 8 times per month (ie, twice per week), and the median monthly consumption amount was 7.1&#x000a0;g (ie, about 1&#x000a0;g per dose). Although the Jewish infants were older than those in our study (8-14&#x000a0;months), research also showed that significant numbers were eating much bigger doses than the 1-g average.</p><p>Therefore we elected to adopt a twice-weekly consumption regimen per food in accordance with this earlier research. We set our dose target at 2&#x000a0;g. This allowed for infants falling short of this target to still achieve a level of consumption that our earlier research had shown appeared to be tolerance inducing.</p></sec><sec id="appsec1.3"><title>Per-protocol compliance status: Definitions</title><sec id="appsec1.3.1"><title>SIG overall per-protocol compliance criteria</title><p>For the SIG, the criteria in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> reflect a pragmatic interpretation of the current UK status quo: an incomplete following of the infant feeding recommendations. Thus allergenic food introduction from 5&#x000a0;months (criterion C), by which point 75% of mothers in IFS2010 have introduced solids to their baby, including rusks (hard, dry infant biscuits) and yogurts, as well as up to 300 mL/d cow's&#x000a0;milk&#x000a0;formula consumption after enrollment (criterion D), was considered acceptable. The volume was chosen such that the majority of milk consumed by the infant was still breast milk. The amount of breast milk consumed by&#x000a0;exclusively breastfed infants was evaluated in a recent systematic review.<xref rid="bibE3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E3</sup></xref> At 3 to 4&#x000a0;months of age, the mean transfer volume of breast milk was 779&#x000a0;g/d (SD, 40&#x000a0;g/d); at 5&#x000a0;months, it was 827&#x000a0;g/d (SD, 39&#x000a0;g/d); and at 6&#x000a0;months, it was 894&#x000a0;g/d (SD, 87&#x000a0;g/d).</p></sec><sec id="appsec1.3.2"><title>EIG overall per-protocol compliance criteria</title><p>For the EIG, criterion C aimed for consumption of at least 5 of the 6 allergenic foods in&#x000a0;at least 75% of the 4-g recommended amount (3&#x000a0;g of allergen protein per&#x000a0;food per week) for at least 5 individual weeks between 3 and 6&#x000a0;months of&#x000a0;age.</p></sec><sec id="appsec1.3.3"><title>EIG food-specific per-protocol compliance criteria</title><p>In the EIG food-specific per-protocol compliance was determined by using the same threshold as criterion C: consumption of a specific allergenic food in at least 75% of the recommended amount (3&#x000a0;g of allergen protein/wk) for at least 5&#x000a0;weeks between 3 and 6&#x000a0;months of age.</p></sec></sec><sec id="appsec1.4"><title>Per-protocol compliance status: Appraisal</title><p>Criterion A&#x000a0;for both groups, exclusive breastfeeding at the point of enrollment, was a prerequisite to taking part in the study, and hence compliance with this was complete. The ability to determine compliance with the other individual criteria relied on data being available from the online questionnaires.</p><sec id="appsec1.4.1"><title>SIG: Overall per-protocol compliance</title><p>For the SIG, criterion B (continued breastfeeding up to 5&#x000a0;months) and criterion D (no or minimal introduction of cow's milk formula between 3 and 6&#x000a0;months of age) could be determined from any of the interim questionnaires because every questionnaire asked at what age the participant stopped breastfeeding and at what age they started giving their child formula milk. Criterion C (no consumption of peanut, egg, sesame, fish, or wheat before age 5&#x000a0;months) required the SIG mother to have completed both the 4- and the 5-month interim questionnaires for their compliance with this criterion to be evaluable.</p></sec><sec id="appsec1.4.2"><title>EIG: Overall per-protocol compliance</title><p>For the EIG, criterion B was the same as for the SIG and hence could be determined from the response to any interim questionnaire. However, it was criterion C that made assessment of compliance in the EIG more difficult to be achieved than in the SIG. Criterion C was consumption of at least 5 of the allergenic foods in at least 75% of the recommended amount (3&#x000a0;g of allergen protein/wk) for at least 5&#x000a0;weeks between 3 and 6&#x000a0;months of age. For this to be determined, the EIG family needed to have completed all 3 of the 4-, 5-, and 6-month interim questionnaires.</p></sec></sec><sec id="appsec1.5"><title>Sensitization status</title><p>At the enrollment visit, EIG infants underwent SPTs in duplicate to whole foods for fresh cow's milk, raw egg white, and tahini (sesame paste) and to cod, wheat, and peanut by using commercial solutions (Stallergenes, Didcot, United Kingdom). At 1&#x000a0;year of age, SPTs were undertaken for the whole cohort with commercial solutions only to a panel of foods (the 6 intervention foods, soya, and kiwi) and aeroallergens (house dust mite, cat, dog, 6-grass pollen mix, and 3-tree pollen mix). At 3&#x000a0;years of age, the 1-year investigations were repeated with additional SPTs to commercial solutions of Brazil nut, hazel nut, cashew, almond, and walnut and also to salmonella-free raw egg white. SPT wheal size was the mean wheal size of the duplicate tests. Attending parents underwent SPTs and blood tests at the 3 year visit.</p></sec><sec id="appsec1.6"><title>Food allergy status</title><p>All participants underwent an assessment of their allergy status at 1 and 3&#x000a0;years of age with SPTs to all 6 study foods as above and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges where sensitized (SPT &#x0003e;0&#x000a0;mm) and not consuming the food regularly or open challenges if they fulfilled the study's frequent consumer criteria (consumption of an EAT portion [2&#x000a0;g of protein] in the last month and &#x02265;3 times ever). Any participants with a positive open challenge result then underwent a double-blind challenge. At any time during the study, parents could report any allergy symptoms, in which case an unscheduled clinic visit with skin prick testing and food challenge, if indicated, was undertaken.
