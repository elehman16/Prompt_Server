Adults with pharmacoresistant focal seizures (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;112) received VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP or BMP (1:1 ratio). Medications and VNS parameters could be adjusted as clinically indicated for optimal seizure control while minimizing adverse effects. Primary endpoint was mean change from baseline HRQoL (using Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-89 total score; QOLIE-89). Secondary endpoints included changes in seizure frequency, responder rate (&#x02265;50% decrease in seizure frequency), Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory-Epilepsy scale (NDDI-E), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I), Adverse Event Profile&#x000a0;(AEP), and antiepileptic drug&#x000a0;(AED) load. The study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment difficulties prior to completing the planned enrollment of n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;362. Results for n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;96 who had baseline and at least one follow-up QOLIE-89 assessment (from months&#x000a0;3-12) were included in this analysis. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of variance was performed on change from baseline for the primary and secondary endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Significant between-group differences in favor of VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP were observed regarding improvement in HRQoL, seizure frequency, and CGI-I score (respective p-values&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05, 0.03, and 0.01). More patients in the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group (43%) reported adverse events&#x000a0;(AEs) versus BMP group (21%) (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01), a difference reflecting primarily mostly transient AEs related to VNS implantation or stimulation.

The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority over time in health outcomes of BMP with adjunctive VNS therapy compared with BMP alone in patients with pharmacoresistant focal seizures. A total of 28&#x000a0;sites across Europe and Canada participated in the study.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study time line showing the timing of the various study visits and efficacy assessments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="epi0055-0893-f1"/></fig><p>The design was dictated primarily by the need to ensure a relatively long duration of follow-up, in order to obtain a clinically meaningful assessment of long-term changes in HRQoL. This precluded on ethical grounds the use of a double-blind design, and required that the treating physicians be allowed to modify the regimen of AEDs as clinically indicated. Accordingly, BMP was defined as the individualized therapy judged optimal by investigators at each visit for each patient, which could include a change in dosage or type of AEDs (including their withdrawal). In a similar way, clinicians were allowed to adjust VNS stimulation parameters throughout the study. This approach has the advantage of reflecting routine clinical practice, thereby increasing the external validity of the study.</p><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Eligible participants were 16&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years old with at least a 2-year history of focal seizures not adequately controlled by ongoing AED therapy.

During visit&#x000a0;2, patients who continued to meet the eligibility criteria were randomized to VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP or BMP alone (1:1 ratio) through a centralized voice-based randomization service. All treatments were prescribed and delivered according to the procedures routinely used in clinical practice in each center. In particular, centers were responsible for covering the costs involved in the acquisition of the VNS therapy device. Study visits were scheduled at 3-month intervals over a 24-month assessment period. The database for the PuLsE study was originally held by the Bonn epilepsy center (Germany). Upon closure of the study, the database was transferred to Cyberonics, where data analysis was conducted by one of the coauthor (P. Raman, employee of Cyberonics).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The initial plan was to enroll 362&#x000a0;patients and to follow each patient for 2&#x000a0;years. The original statistical analysis plan included the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations, but such analysis was not possible because of early study termination due to low enrollment rates, requiring revision of the statistical plan. Only patients with a baseline QOLIE-89 score and at least one postbaseline assessment were included in the statistical analysis of data from 3, 6, 9, and 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up.</p><p>For longitudinal data collected at different visits post-baseline, we performed a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the SAS GLIMMIX (generalized linear mixed model) procedure to assess trend differences between the two treatment groups. The fitted model included fixed effects of treatment group (VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP vs. BMP), visit month (3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months following randomization), and interaction of treatment and visit month. The evaluated response endpoints included the primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in QOLIE-89 total scores, and changes in the following secondary endpoints:&#x000a0;seizure frequency, 50%&#x000a0;responder rate, CES-D, NDDI-E, CGI-I, AEP, proportion of patients reporting AEs, and AED load. An additional change in QOLIE-89 total scores was assessed in patients who had no changes in their baseline AEDs. The secondary endpoints are partially redundant with the primary endpoint; therefore, p-values from secondary endpoint analyses are being reported here for exploratory analysis purposes and correction of multiple comparisons were not conducted. When inferential statistics were conducted based on MMRM analyses, the least squares means and related standard errors were summarized. Inferential statistical analyses were not conducted for the visit-wise data, as there were limited numbers of observations, instead the visit-wise data are summarized using descriptive statistics including means, percentages, medians, standard deviation, and p-values.</p><p>When MMRM analysis results indicated significant treatment-group trend differences (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), post hoc visit-wise analyses were performed using patient data at each visit. p-Values based on means were generated using analysis of variance (F-test) for continuous data. p-Values based on medians were generated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous data. p-Values were generated using the chi-square test for categorical data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This study was conducted between February 2006 and July 2008 and was prematurely terminated by the sponsor due to a low enrollment rate and not as a result of a safety or efficacy signal. Low enrollment resulted primarily from the strong positive or negative views about the value of VNS therapy expressed by most study candidates, leading to only a minority of them accepting to participate in the study. As a result of early study termination, only a few patients (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7) achieved 2-year follow-up. The VNS therapy devices were not removed from the participating patients following study termination, and the patients continued to use their devices as part of routine medical care, as clinically indicated.</p><p>A total of 131&#x000a0;patients were screened and 122 were randomized to receive VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP or BMP alone. Data from one study site (including 10&#x000a0;randomized patients) were removed from the analysis datasets, as inadvertently a centrally approved informed consent form was used without the additional mandatory approval of the site's local ethics committee. The remaining 112 randomized patients were included in the safety analyses. Of these, 96&#x000a0;(83%)&#x02014;including 48&#x000a0;patients allocated to VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP and 48&#x000a0;patients allocated to BMP&#x02014;had baseline data and at least one post baseline follow-up QOLIE-89 assessment, and were thus included in the efficacy analyses. Sixty of these 96&#x000a0;patients had completed their 1-year follow-up visit by the time the study was terminated, including 55&#x000a0;patients with QOLIE-89 data available at each visit (assessments at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#x000a0;months; 28 in the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group and 27 in the BMP group).</p><p>Of the eligible randomized patients, 16&#x000a0;were not included in the statistical analysis, as their study participation ended prior to collection of baseline data and at least one post-baseline follow-up QOLIE-89 assessment for the following reasons: 9&#x000a0;patients due to premature study termination (two from VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group and seven from BMP group), 2 patients due to consent withdrawal (one from each treatment group), 2 patients due to compliance issues (one from each treatment group), 2 patients who withdrew early for reasons not listed (both from the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group), and one patient in the BMP group who withdrew early due to lack of efficacy.</p><p>Patients in the two treatment groups were comparable at baseline in terms of gender, age, age at onset of epilepsy, proportion with structural or metabolic versus unknown etiology, seizure frequency, AED load, and mean baseline scores from QOLIE-89, AEP, CES-D, NDDI-E, and CGI-I assessments (Table 1). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for any of the recorded baseline characteristics (p&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;0.05).</p><p>Among patients in the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP arm, there was a median interim period of 48&#x000a0;days (range&#x000a0;8&#x02013;162) between randomization and implantation surgery. The duration of the preoperative waiting period varied in relation to regional and national regulations for approving reimbursement of VNS therapy in individual subjects, and the local waiting time for nonurgent neurosurgical procedures.

It is important to note that the study endpoint was determined with an instrument, the QOLIE-89 inventory, which has been validated in many different settings and languages worldwide (including all languages used by our patients) and represents the most comprehensive epilepsy-specific measure of HRQoL currently available.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> On the other hand, an important study limitation relates to the smaller sample size and shorter duration of follow-up than initially planned. These were a consequence of a low enrollment rate that led to the early study termination by the sponsor. Despite this limitation, and the necessary revision of the statistical plan, the results supported the primary hypothesis by showing significantly greater improvement in HRQoL in patients receiving VNS compared with BMP alone.</p><p>The low enrollment rate resulted primarily from the fact that most study candidates had strong views (either positive or negative) about the value of VNS therapy and therefore were reluctant to be randomized. As a consequence, recruited patients are expected to be less biased than those who refused to participate, which might strengthen rather than limit the external validity of a study having quality of life as primary outcome.</p><p>It could be argued that because of the open label and flexible design, with individual changes in AEDs possible in both groups, results may have been affected by the patient's or physician's expectations or decisions. Although this limitation is acknowledged, a double-blind design, as well as less flexibility in AED changes, could not be justified for the duration of follow-up required to demonstrate clinically meaningful long-term effects on HRQoL. Indeed, blinding would have required that patients in the control group receive a sham operation or have their VNS device turned off for the entire duration of follow-up, two options that would be difficult to justify ethically. Similarly, flexibility in AED changes in both groups was believed necessary to ensure safe and adequate long-term management of a population with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Furthermore, this flexibility mirrored clinical practice and promoted the external validity of the study. It is notable that our main finding was confirmed after excluding patients from the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group who had changes in their AED treatment.</p><p>Changes in AEP scores, which reflect the burden of AED-related toxicity, showed a trend to have a more favorable course in the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group than in the BMP group. This is in contrast with the observation that AEs were reported with a higher frequency among patients treated with adjunctive VNS. This paradoxical finding reflects the fact that patients from the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group filled a specific questionnaire for VNS-related AEs that are not included among the AEP items. Because AED-induced AEs are a major determinant of HRQoL in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> the possibility that a reduction in AED toxicity contributed to the better HRQoL outcome in VNS-treated patients needs to be considered. The difference in AEP score changes between the two groups, however, was small and unlikely to account for the significant improvement in HRQoL in the VNS-treated group.</p><p>Similar to the trend toward a lower AEP score, the greater seizure reduction in the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group compared with the BMP group might have contributed to the HRQoL benefits associated with VNS. The reduction in seizure frequency in the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group was statistically significant, but of a magnitude that previous studies have shown to affect HRQoL only minimally.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Moreover, in previous studies, VNS-associated improvement in QOLIE-89 score and other measures of quality of life did not correlate with changes in seizure frequency.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Finally, our HRQoL findings do not seem to be primarily driven by an effect of VNS on mood, because no significant differences were observed between VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP and BMP groups in the two depression scales used in this study (CES-D and NDDI-E), or in the QOLIE-89 Mental Health subscale. Based on these findings, we suggest that the VNS-related improvement in HRQoL in our patients might reflect the sum of modest benefits in multiple factors rather than a single determinant.</p><p>The improvement in QOLIE-89 total score and in seizure frequency in the VNS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BMP group compared with the BMP group increased gradually over time and reached a maximum at the end of follow-up (12&#x000a0;months after randomization). However, findings at 3, 6, and 9&#x000a0;months after randomization were not statistically significant, possibly due to differences in the populations studied at each time point. Yet, these findings are in line with the progressive ramp-up and reported time course of the effectiveness of VNS on seizure frequency,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> as confirmed in this study.</p><p>Overall, the results from this trial provide further evidence for the added value of VNS therapy over flexibly adjusted AED therapy in patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy who are not candidates for surgical resection. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the benefits of such therapy may extend beyond the sole reduction in seizure frequency.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the patients who participated in this study, and the contributing staff at the study sites.
