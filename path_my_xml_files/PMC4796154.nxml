The secondary outcome was to improve the hemodynamic variables in the HS group compared with the NS group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Results</title><p>Between April 18, 2013, and January 20, 2015, a total of 102 patients were included in the study and randomly assigned to HS (51 patients) or NS (51 patients) groups.The mean age of the 102 study participants was 59 years (range, 22 to 84); 71 participants (59.7%) were men. After randomization, 11 patients in the HSS group and 11 patients in the NS group did not complete the follow up because they lack of complete data of blood lactate levels during the study. No significant difference was observed between the two study groups with respect to lactate blood levels (Table 3). No significant differences were observed in other secondary outcomes, there was also no difference in mortality and length of stay in the ICU. (Table 2)</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study failed to demonstrate a higher lactate clearance with the use of one dose of HS, but there was not a higher incidence of side effects in the HS group.</p></sec></body></article>
