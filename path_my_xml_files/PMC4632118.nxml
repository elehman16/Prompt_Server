In this subanalysis, 11,289 and 11,182 patients stratified by body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), respectively, were included.

The positive association between BP control and obese categories could only be found in subgroups stratified by BMI other than WC.

China status II was a multicenter, postmarketing, prospective observational study conducted in patients with essential hypertension whose BP was not adequately controlled by monotherapy. The study design and overall results have been described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Briefly, the study consisted of an 8-week open-label treatment period with two 4-week follow-ups. An additional antihypertensive agent was added to those patients whose BP was not controlled at follow-up after 4 weeks. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice, applicable local regulations, and routine clinical outpatient practice in China. All procedures followed conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study Population</title><p>Briefly, the study population included adult Chinese patients (both male and female patients aged &#x02265;18 years) with essential hypertension [mean sitting systolic BP (MSSBP) &#x02265;140 mm Hg (&#x02265;130 mm Hg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) and/or mean sitting diastolic BP (MSDBP) &#x02265;90 mm Hg (&#x02265;80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease)], whose BP was not adequately controlled by monotherapy as mentioned in the Val/Aml package insert approved by the State Food and Drug Administration. Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients before study enrollment. Patients were excluded if they had any conditions that precluded administration of the drug based on the investigator's discretion. Women were also excluded if they were pregnant, lactating, or of child-bearing potential and not using adequate contraception measures. Details of inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment assignment, and outcome measures had been previously described.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Subjects from full analysis set who participated in China status II trial were included in this study.</p><p>According to the guidelines for prevention and control of overweight and obesity in Chinese adults (2003), overweight was defined as BMI &#x02265;24 to &#x0003c;28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and obesity was defined as BMI &#x02265;28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> According to the Chinese guidelines for the management of hypertension (2010), abdominal obesity was defined as WC &#x02265;90 cm for males or WC &#x02265;85 cm for females.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Effectiveness Assessments</title><p>The primary effectiveness variable of the subanalysis included changes in MSSBP and MSDBP from baseline to endpoint (week 8). The secondary effectiveness variable was BP control [defined as the patients achieving MSSBP/MSDBP &#x0003c;140/90 mm Hg (&#x0003c;130/80 mm Hg for diabetes)] at endpoint. As the prevalence of diabetes increases with increasing weight,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> the above results might be affected by the difference in the numbers of diabetic patients in different subgroups. Hence, we redefined the patients achieving MSSBP/MSDBP &#x0003c;140/90 mm Hg as BP control at endpoint irrespective of the diabetic status and performed a post hoc analysis in both BMI and WC subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Subanalysis included patients with at least 2 post-baseline effectiveness evaluations.

Demographic and baseline variables were summarized using descriptive statistics, including the mean, SD for numeric variables, and the count number and percentage for categorical variables. Paired <italic>t</italic> test and 2-way analysis of variance were used to analyze effectiveness endpoints, as appropriate. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of BP control (including redefined) associated with obese categories relative to a reference category of normal body weight or normal weight were determined from multivariable logistic regression models that adjusted for gender (male, female), age (year), baseline MSDBP (mm Hg), baseline MSSBP (mm Hg), diabetes (absent, present), and previous antihypertensive history [&#x003b2;-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), others, unknown].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Demographic and Baseline Characteristics</title><p>A total of 11,312 patients with hypertension were enrolled in the study, of which 23 and 130 patients were excluded because of nonavailability of effectiveness assessments based on BMI and WC, respectively.

The association between BP control and obese categories was positive at endpoint in patients based on BMI, rather than those based on WC. This association was independent of gender, age, baseline MSDBP, baseline MSSBP, diabetes, and previous antihypertensive history. This suggests that BMI has a better association than WC with the BP-lowering effectiveness of Val/Aml SPC.</p><p>Presence of both obesity and hypertension is associated with poor BP control and may have additive effects in increasing cardiovascular risk.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Several clinical studies confirm that combination therapy might be more effective in controlling BP and reducing cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients with risk factors.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2013 guidelines recommend initiation of combination therapy containing agents with complementary mechanisms of action in patients with markedly high baseline BP or at high cardiovascular risk.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Furthermore, patients with obesity have abnormal metabolism of glucose and lipids, and both ARBs and CCBs can reduce serum cholesterol, which contributes to favorable metabolic effects.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Previous randomized clinical trials have reported significant BP-lowering effects of the Val/Aml combination in patients with hypertension,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> including Chinese hypertensive patients.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> It has been shown that patients using valsartan-based SPCs are significantly more likely to achieve BP goal than those treated with ARB-based free combinations in real-world clinical practice.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In our study, Val/Aml SPC resulted in significant reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP from baseline across all subgroups, regardless of the BMI and WC status. Moreover, in our study, the percentage of all obese patients achieving BP control was more than 60%, which was similar to a previous study.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Similarly, the Val/Aml combination has shown significant BP-lowering efficacy in obese (BMI &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) hypertensive patients in previous clinical trials<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and real-world observational studies.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Hence, Val/Aml SPC might be a better treatment option for hypertensive patients with excess body weight.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>In this subgroup analysis, baseline MSDBP increased with increasing BMI. Therefore, BMI is closely associated with the degree of hypertension. In our study, the prevalence of overweight/obesity was higher in males than in females across both BMI and WC subgroups, and a similar trend has been published previously.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Val/Aml SPC treatment resulted in significant reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP from baseline to endpoint, independent of BMI and WC in this study. Both normal weight and overweight subgroups achieved greater MSSBP reductions than the obesity subgroup. This might be because of a higher incidence of resistant hypertension in obese individuals with 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>&#x02264; BMI &#x0003c;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or with morbid obesity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>At endpoint, the association between BP control and obese categories was positive in patients based on BMI rather than WC. Eckert et al<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> also showed that patients with a higher BMI had lower overall BP control rates. It seems that BMI has a stronger association than WC with BP because an increase in BMI increases body volume, peripheral resistance (eg, cell membrane alteration, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperactivity of the rennin&#x02013;angiotensin system lead to structural hypertrophy and functional constriction), and cardiac output; however, WC is only a proxy indicator for increasing metabolic risk.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In a previous report, BMI had a strong association with hypertension, whereas WC had a strong association with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The key risk factors of cardiovascular disease included diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, which were both strongly linked to WC; so, it seems that WC has a strong association with cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Our study results are in agreement with previous studies<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and confirm that BMI is better associated with hypertension and can better predict BP-lowering effectiveness of Val/Aml SPC in Chinese hypertensive patients than WC.</p><p>This study has some inherent limitations. It did not contain a washout period. The information regarding the numbers and types of added treatments at week 4 might have influenced effectiveness of Val/Aml at week 8, and this impact has not been determined. There is a lack of study evaluating the safety of Val/Aml SPC in hypertensive patients with excess body weight uncontrolled by monotherapy. A short treatment duration (8 weeks) might have influenced the accuracy of the results of this subanalysis.</p><p>In conclusion, the present findings from subanalysis of the China status II study confirmed the effectiveness of Val/Aml (80/5 mg) SPC in reducing BP in Chinese hypertensive patients with excess body weight uncontrolled by monotherapy. Furthermore, BMI had a better association with the BP-lowering effectiveness of Val/Aml SPC than WC. Future studies should seek to compare the efficacy and safety of Val/Aml SPC with that of other ARB-based SPCs in hypertensive patients with overweight and obesity. This would aid in identifying a preferred ARB-based SPC to treat hypertension in this high-risk patient population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors acknowledge China Status II study group (Dayi Hu, Lisheng Liu, and Weimin Li, et al.), National Nature Science Foundation of China (30971244, 81270353), and Yong Xie and her colleagues of Novartis Pharma Co Ltd (China) for their support in accomplishing this article.
