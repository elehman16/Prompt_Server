This trial enrolled 402 preterm infants (mean GA was 31 weeks) with an increased risk of NEC. The risk was increased because they were growth-restricted and had abnormal antenatal Doppler.</p><p>The trial protocol used a slow feeding advancement (advance feeds by an average of 12 ml/kg/day).</p><p>This trial revealed no evidence of benefit in delaying the introduction of small volumes of enteral feeds in preterm, IUGR infants beyond 24 to 48 hours. Early introduction allows establishment of full feeds earlier with a reduction in cholestatic jaundice and improved weight gain. Delay in introducing feeds only caused morbidity, with no benefit.</p><p>This trial was included in a Cochrane review of 5 trials comparing early to delayed introduction of feeds in the preterm, also found no evidence of benefit of delaying the introduction of feeds.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Abstracted from</title><p>Leaf A, Dorling J, Kempley S, McCormick K, Mannix P, Linsell L, Juszczak E, Brocklehurst P; Abnormal Doppler Enteral Prescription Trial Collaborative G: Early or delayed enteral feeding for preterm growth-restricted infants: A randomized trial.
