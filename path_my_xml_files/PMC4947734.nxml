This number is expected to increase, mainly due to an ageing population and an increase in smoke exposure in women.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref></p><p>COPD has a major impact on daily life and quality of life that goes beyond airway limitation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;8</xref> The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guideline recommends a combined assessment of COPD using the so-called &#x02018;ABCD&#x02019; classification model, which, apart from spirometry, assesses future risk (exacerbations) and current burden/impact of disease using questionnaire data.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, tools advocated to assess the burden of COPD only measure a limited number of aspects and do not provide a visual display to educate and involve patients in their treatment. Perhaps even more importantly, the way in which to make use of the patient-reported outcomes or the impact of assessing the burden of disease in this way on outcomes of care has not been tested at all. Therefore, the Assessment of Burden of COPD (ABC) tool was developed,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> an innovative tool measuring and visualising integrated health status. An important part of the tool is the ABC scale (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> A), which is largely based on the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ),<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and which measures the experienced burden of COPD. The CCQ was adapted by adding 4 questions to the existing 10 questions, to comply with the definition of burden of COPD, which was formulated by an expert team and confirmed by patients and healthcare providers.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The ABC scale consists of five domains (ie, symptoms, functional state, mental state, emotions and fatigue)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and shows excellent reliability and validity.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This scale is combined with other parameters (ie, lung function, exacerbations, body mass index, comorbidity, smoking status and self-reported level of physical activity) to assess the integrated health status of a patient with COPD. The ABC tool visualises the outcome (using balloons, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011519F1">figure 1</xref>) and therewith promotes awareness for patient and healthcare provider, and offers a treatment algorithm. Moreover, it provides the opportunity to support personalised care planning including a personal treatment goal. When a balloon is selected, an evidence-based treatment advice is shown, which the patient and healthcare provider can discuss. They can then decide on a treatment plan together through shared decision-making (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>).

Ethics approval was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of Zuyderland Hospital, Heerlen, the Netherlands. A detailed protocol of this study has been published elsewhere.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Informed consent was signed by patients prior to enrolment.</p><p>Healthcare providers were recruited by the researchers, with no specific criteria or prerequisites. These healthcare providers recruited patients, who were eligible to participate if they had a spirometry-confirmed diagnosis of COPD (postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c;0.7), were 40&#x02005;years of age or over and could understand and read the Dutch language. Exclusion criteria were as follows: exacerbation &#x0003c;6&#x02005;weeks before initiation of the study, an addiction to hard drugs, a life-threatening comorbid condition or pregnancy at the start of the study.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Eligibility criteria were checked by the healthcare providers.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>We randomised at the level of healthcare providers to prevent contamination. Block randomisation of healthcare centres (random blocks of 2, 4 and 6), stratified by healthcare setting (ie, primary vs hospital care), was performed by the researchers using a computer program developed by the Maastricht University Centre for Data and Information Management (MEMIC). Blinding of healthcare professionals and patients was not possible due to the nature of the intervention, but the study team was blind to the nature of the treatment arms in the dataset. Unblinding was performed after unanimous agreement on data cleaning, handling of missing data, statistical analyses and conclusions drawn for the primary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>Healthcare providers (ie, general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, pulmonologists and nurse specialists) were instructed to use the ABC tool during their routine consultations. As described in the study protocol, patients should visit their healthcare providers at least four times during the 18-month follow-up.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Therefore, healthcare providers were instructed to invite patients for consultation at least once every 6&#x02005;months. In each consultation, patients were asked to fill out the ABC scale,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> report their dyspnoea using the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and self-report their level of physical activity. Healthcare providers were instructed to obtain some additional parameters (ie, lung function, exacerbations, body mass index, comorbidity and smoking status) and enter these into the computer program. The program displayed the results as balloons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011519F1">figure 1</xref> for an example). The colours and altitude of the balloons and corresponding implications could then be discussed, and consequently, patients and healthcare providers could decide on a treatment plan together. Patients were encouraged to formulate a personal treatment goal, in their own words, and a specific treatment plan in accordance with this goal (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref> provides an example). It was possible to print out an overview of the balloons, the personal goal and the treatment plan at the end of the consultation. The ABC tool is also meant to be used to monitor patients&#x02019; health status: previous results are displayed using grey balloons, resulting in the possibility to discuss progress and deterioration of different parameters and to evaluate treatment success.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Control</title><p>Healthcare providers in the control group were instructed to provide care as usual to their patients, as described in the Dutch COPD healthcare guidelines.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

To address the primary outcome and the first two secondary outcomes (see above), change scores in the SGRQ were calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the scores at the 6-month, 12-month and 18-month follow-up. These change scores were then dichotomised into improved (ie, a decrease of four points or more on the SGRQ total score<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) versus not improved, and into deteriorated (ie, an increase of four points or more on the SGRQ total score<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) versus not deteriorated. The relationship between treatment and SGRQ improvement (yes or no) was then analysed with mixed logistic regression, taking into account that the times of measurement (change after 6, 12 and 18&#x02005;months) were nested within patients, and patients were nested within healthcare providers (three levels). Treatment arm (ie, intervention group vs control group), time, treatment by time interaction and covariates were incorporated into the model as predictors. Covariates included in the analyses were age, sex, smoking status at baseline and healthcare setting (ie, primary care vs hospital care). This analysis was repeated three times for the outcome clinically relevant SGRQ improvement yes/no, with 18&#x02005;months (primary outcome) and 6 and 12&#x02005;months (secondary outcomes) as reference time points, respectively, in order to estimate and test the treatment effect in a simple way for each time point (primary: 18&#x02005;months, secondary: 6 and 12&#x02005;months).</p><p>The same analyses were repeated for the outcome clinically relevant SGRQ deterioration yes/no.</p><p>To address the other secondary outcomes&#x02014;the SGRQ total score, CAT total score and PACIC total score&#x02014;analyses were performed with mixed linear regression, with cluster, patient and measurements as three levels. Predictors used in the model were time using dummy coding with baseline as the reference category, and dummy indicators for the 12-month and 18-month follow-up, and for SGRQ and CAT also a dummy indicator for the 6-month follow-up, treatment by time interaction and the same covariates as mentioned above. The interaction effect of treatment with the dummy indicator for 18&#x02005;months represents the group difference in change from baseline to 18&#x02005;months, and likewise for the other two treatment by time dummy interaction terms. Further, given that baseline is the reference time point, the treatment effect itself is the group difference at baseline (0&#x02005;months), which can be expected to be zero due to the randomised treatment assignment. If this treatment effect was indeed not significant, then it was removed from the mixed model. The treatment by time interaction effect then became equivalent to the treatment effect at follow-up adjusted for the baseline as a covariate.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref></p><p>The primary treatment effect and the effect on improvement after 6 and 12&#x02005;months were tested using &#x003b1;=0.05 (two-tailed) following the protocol.

All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, V.21.0.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>For the purpose of sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome, a mixed logistic regression analysis was also performed on only those patients for whom an SGRQ score at baseline and at 18&#x02005;months had been recorded, allowing computation of change without borrowing information from other patients or other points in time in case of a missing value at 18&#x02005;months. Hence, patients were nested in clusters and the dependent variable was a dichotomous change score at 18&#x02005;months (ie, improved vs not improved). The results of this analysis were compared with those of the intention-to-treat analysis including all available measurements of all patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 62 healthcare providers were randomised into the two treatment groups: 42 from primary care and 20 from hospital care.

This result was also found after 12&#x02005;months, but not after 6&#x02005;months. The latter might be explained by the fact that the collaboration between patient and healthcare provider using the ABC tool requires time and experience to work optimally, and that interventions often also require a behavioural change of the patient. The additional analyses of the different domains of the SGRQ showed that there was mainly an improvement in the symptom domain and the impact domain, but these associations are just short of significance when taking the more stringent significance level of 1% into account to correct for multiple testing of secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>COPD Assessment Test</title><p>We expected to find results on the CAT comparable with the SGRQ since both questionnaires are strongly correlated<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref> and in previous studies the CAT and the SGRQ usually showed similar results.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;34</xref></p><p>Additionally, a systematic review about the CAT<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> found that the CAT is a reliable, valid and responsive instrument.

Positive effects on quality of care were perceived in patient activation, decision support, goal setting and problem-solving, which could be expected from the person-centred COPD approach with the ABC tool. When developing the ABC tool, the main goal was to make a tool that measures burden of COPD, and additionally visualises the integrated health status and provides a treatment algorithm. Furthermore, the tool had to provide room for writing down a treatment plan including a personal treatment goal. All of these components are considered to be important in order to involve the patient in the decision-making process and help them take control of the disease, eventually leading to improved self-management and a better quality of life.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;41</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>This research in the context of other research</title><p>In 2013, Agusti and MacNee advocated more personalised medicine for patients with COPD,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> by suggesting that healthcare providers need a &#x02018;control panel&#x02019; for the assessment and management of COPD.

<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Although no interventions like the ABC tool were found in literature,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> many studies have been described evaluating the effect of behavioural interventions in patients with COPD on disease-specific quality of life.

This has positive consequences for the generalisability of the results and potential implementation of the ABC tool. Usual care was based on national guidelines which are in line with international guidelines. However, different usual care in other countries cannot be excluded, which might affect the generalisability to some extent of our results towards other countries.</p><p>An additional strength was the pragmatic design to test the effectiveness of the ABC tool in real-life routine practice, which makes the results more applicable to daily primary and hospital care. However, the pragmatic approach also presented challenges. First, the use of the ABC tool was not actively promoted during the study, which meant that 4% of the patients did not receive the intervention. Second, healthcare providers were not actively stimulated to practice using the tool (if they requested the opportunity to practice, a dummy account was provided), since we believed using the tool would be self-explanatory. It is conceivable that with more training with the ABC tool, the effect might have been even greater, and more training might be warranted when implementing the tool with less motivated/experienced healthcare providers.</p><p>Owing to an error in data collection, smoking status was not recorded in all patients in the control group at baseline. However, at the 15-month and 18-month follow-up, smoking status was recorded and these data were used to impute the baseline status in patients with missing smoking status at baseline. To validate this imputed baseline smoking status, Cohen's Kappa measure of agreement was calculated between the observed and the imputed smoking status in patients with available baseline data. Kappa was 0.86, indicating good agreement, and it was therefore concluded that missing smoking status at baseline could be replaced with data at the 15-month or 18-month follow-up.</p><p>Perhaps due to randomisation at cluster level instead of individual patient level, there was some imbalance between both groups at baseline. The intervention group showed a lower initial lung function. In order to detect any possible confounding from this imbalance, we repeated the primary analysis with FEV<sub>1%</sub> predicted and forced expiratory ratio (FER) as covariates in the model. This analysis yielded similar results. Additionally, on the symptom domain of the SGRQ, the intervention group seemed to score worse at baseline. However, this difference was not significant and we corrected for this difference by calculating change scores. Therefore, we conclude that the results remain unchanged, despite these imbalances.</p><p>When calculating the required sample size, the expected proportions of patients improved were difficult to estimate, since little evidence was available on the effect of disease management interventions on disease-specific quality of life as measured by the SGRQ.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Therefore, the expected proportions of patients improved were solely based on results of previous drug trials.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>
<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> The results from our trial showed that the proportion of patients improved by four points&#x02014;our primary outcome&#x02014;was 33.6% in the intervention group compared with 22.3% in the control group. Although this difference was smaller than estimated for the sample size calculation, it was a statistically significant difference. This is at least partly due to the fact that the actual dropout rate and the ICC (18% and 0.01, respectively) were lower than expected in the study planning stage (25% and 0.05, respectively). The smaller than expected difference in the proportion of patients improved (11.3% observed vs 20% expected) may partly be due to the fact that, instead of for example a single drug intervention, a high variety of interventions were possible in this trial, which might dilute the effect. Another possible explanation is the fact that the group COPD patients included in the study was a stable group with better quality of life and therefore lower baseline SGRQ total scores than in other studies, leaving less room for improvement.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62&#x02013;65</xref></p><p>Furthermore, no blinding and allocation concealment was possible due to the nature of the intervention. However, the researchers performed the analyses on a blinded dataset and were therefore unaware of the coding of treatment arm until unanimous conclusions had been drawn about the results by all authors.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Implications</title><p>This study showed a promising development towards person-centred care. Visualisation of the integrated health status seems to be a valid contribution to efforts to place patients in the driver seat of care planning, together with their healthcare provider. Future research should focus on replication of this trial, in other settings and perhaps for other diseases as well, to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the effect of the ABC tool and especially the visually facilitated shared decision-making.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our trial results indicate that the ABC tool has an added value for patients with COPD. Patients treated with the ABC tool were more likely to report clinically relevant improvement in quality of life, as measured by the SGRQ, compared with patients treated with usual care. Patients also perceived quality of care as better when the ABC tool was applied. Further research is necessary to replicate the results and further investigate the added value of the ABC tool in different settings.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011519.supp3</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss3" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-011519supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The ABC tool was developed under the auspices of the Lung Alliance Netherlands (LAN) and prepared by an expert team installed by the LAN.
