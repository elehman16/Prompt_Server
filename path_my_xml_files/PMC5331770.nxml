Pre-eclampsia typically starts with high blood pressure after the 20<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy, and the rate has been increased 25% in the last two decades in the United States.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of prenatal events including premature delivery, severe hypertension, increasing risk of stroke, and death of mother.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Women with a history of pre-eclampsia have a higher risk of future cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.</p><p>Endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Several studies have reported that inflammation response and systemic effect during pregnancy on vascular endothelium lead to hypertension and proteinuria as signs and outcomes of pre-eclampsia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Several surveys tried to identify the different aspects of endothelial function and essential role of these cells in the process of endothelial-dependent diseases.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Vasodilation measurement due to nitric oxide (NO) effect on endothelium is considered a desirable method to evaluate endothelial function.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is used for this purpose by using high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography to measure brachial artery diameter before and after occlusion with a cuff.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In fact, it triggers shear stress that stimulates no synthesis.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Folic acid as a supplement has an important impact on endothelial function, coagulation cascade, blood pressure, and prevention of atherosclerosis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Some studies evaluate the effect of folic acid on the endothelial function improvement in diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Probably, it affects via tetrahydrobiopterin regeneration, as a major NO cofactor, which causes NO increase and leads to vasodilation and improvement of FMD.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although there are lots of surveys on pre-eclampsia, few studies evaluate the effect of folic acid in pre-eclamptic patients.

Endothelial function was assessed by FMD. Our results showed that daily oral administration of high-dose folic acid increased FMD significantly which means it can improve endothelial function.</p><p>The studies which investigate the effects of using folic acid on cardiovascular system have approved beneficial effect on this system including endothelial function, preventing hypertension, and atherosclerosis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Moreover, some studies showed that folic acid can improve endothelial function in different diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hyperhomocysteinemia. They reported that using more folic acid in high-risk populations can cause vasculoprotective effects. On the other hand, epidemic studies have shown that folic acid deficiency can lead to hypertension. Furthermore, there are some reports about a negative association between hypertension and plasma level of folic acid.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In this study, FMD increased significantly in the group who received high-dose folic acid. It may be in consistent with tetrahydrobiopterin regeneration, as a major NO cofactor, which causes NO increase and leads to vasodilation and improvement of FMD.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This effect also can be due to decrease in homocysteine by folic acid consumption and therefore causes endothelial function improvement. In addition, folic acid has an antioxidant effect on capillary bed and increases NO bioavailability.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In a meta-analysis study, Mark <italic>et al</italic>. represented that high-dose folic acid (e.g., 5 mg/day for at least 6 weeks) can decrease blood pressure and improve endothelial function and increase FMD, while supplements containing low-dose folic acid (400&#x02013;800 mg/day) have no appreciable effect on improving FMD. This study suggests that the primary mechanism proposed for the effect of folic acid on endothelial function is a reduction in plasma homocysteine concentrations by remethylation of homocysteine back to methionine. Homocysteine increases oxidative stress by increasing superoxide anion production that results in the downregulation of NO production.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] While some other studies report that folic acid supplement can significantly improve FMD, some studies did not approve the result.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Sandrahirsch <italic>et al</italic>. investigated that hyperhomocysteinemia in young people is associated with lower serum cobalamin and folate levels but does not impair endothelial function. Supplementation with folic acid during 8 weeks lowers homocysteine levels without effects on vascular function. It seems that using low-dose folic acid has an effect on achieving different results.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>There are strong evidences in several animal and human studies supporting the hypothesis of preventive effect of folic acid on pre-eclampsia and its outcomes.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In these studies, pre-eclampsia was considered as a two-stage disorder. At Stage I, we have a decrease in placental perfusion, and at Stage II, the maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia, secondary to systemic endothelial dysfunction, develops. Supplementation of high-dose folic acid in early gestation may affect both the stages. Folic acid, or folate, as a Vitamin B coenzyme, is required in the production of nucleic acid, and cell growth and folate supply play an important role in the implantation and development of placenta. While another cohort study in Denmark showed that periconceptional multivitamin consists of folic acid which is associated with a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia among normal weight women,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] there are other studies in 2009 and 2013 conducted in the Netherlands[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and China,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] respectively, that did not confirm this association. Li <italic>et al</italic>. in 2013 declared the results of their cohort study on 193,554 pregnant women. They did not find a decrease in the risks of gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia among women who took 400 &#x003bc;g daily folic acid supplementation in the first trimester of pregnancy. This study suggests that folic acid is not able to improve endothelial function or prevent vascular changing due to hyperhomocysteinemia in pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The discrepancy between the results of this study and previous studies, and our study may be the result of various factors, including the timing of the intervention, the dose of folic acid, the other components in the supplements, and the population. Finally, Hamad <italic>et al</italic>. reported persistent decrease in FMD in pre-eclamptic patients after 1 year. Meanwhile, in our study, FMD was increased only 2 months after delivery in intervention group who took oral daily high dose of folic acid.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Hua <italic>et al</italic>. assessed the effect of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy on gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia in a meta-analysis. Whether folic acid supplementation in pregnancy can prevent the occurrence of gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia remains uncertain.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study demonstrated an association between high-dose folic acid supplementation and increased flow-mediated vasodilation in the brachial artery in pre-eclamptic patients. Based on the appropriate setting of the trial, the study population, and the types of interventions used, we can conclude that increase in the mean of FMD in groups who took regular daily oral 5 mg folic acid starting right at the initiation of diagnosis until 2 months after delivery shows that this supplement through biological pathway can improve endothelial function and can significantly affect maternal blood pressure during pregnancy and some endothelium-dependent disease such as pre-eclampsia and its associated adverse outcomes. The first and most important limitation of our study is small sample size due to difficulties to diagnosis pure pre-eclamptic patients who met inclusion criteria. In addition, cultural difficulties limited our study. The last but not the least was unequal period of drug administration by participants due to emergency indications for cesarean section which some of the participants did meet.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>KH contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
