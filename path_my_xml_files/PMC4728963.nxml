It is a rhythmic breathing activity consisting of the following five stages.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Ujjayi, Bhastrika, Om Chanting, Sudarshan Kriya yoga (SKY), and Yoga Nindra. It is a practice of wellness that reduces stress and produces relaxation. SKY can remove stress by making changes at the endocrine level and molecular level.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Stress and working memory capacity</title><p>Working memory (WM) is the memory of the presented stimuli that registers information for a brief span when triggered. WM Capacity (WMC) is defined as the successful maintenance of the stimuli during encoding with a simultaneous engagement in another mental operation. WM performances get affected by stress. It has an inverted-U-shaped relation in which moderate stress facilitates performance (manipulation component of WM) while higher levels impair performance.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Acute stress can have devastating effects on WM, which can be explained by the limited capacity theory. This theory states that the cognitive representation of stressful life events competes with the task demands for attention and that this trade-off leads to memory impairment.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Therefore, it is necessary to identify the brain activity that gets modified under the influence of SKY which in turn combats stress and enhances WMC. To gauge the influence of SKY on WMC, besides psychological scores, there should be physiological recordings that can cross-validate the findings. Electroencephalograph (EEG) is one such technique that can solve the problem of real-time brain activity measurement. In this study, only gamma (30&#x02013;45 Hz), alpha (8&#x02013;13 Hz), and theta (4&#x02013;8 Hz) bands were considered due to their active roles in WMC. Gamma band oscillations are generally involved in the maintenance of WM information while alpha band activity reflects the active inhibition of the task-irrelevant information, and theta band oscillations underlie the organization of sequentially ordered WM items.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>Based on aforementioned relations between stress and WMC, we hypothesized that SKY would enhance WMC. Since SKY reduces stress at the endocrinal and molecular level and is termed as an antidepressant technique, it would be equally instrumental in enhancing WMC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>A total of fifteen and ten subjects, of ages varying between 30 and 50 years, were selected for the experimental and control groups, respectively. The two groups were matched on age, education, and economic status. A 7 days workshop was held by the Art of Living (AOL) foundation, teaching SKY only to the experimental group. Prior to the SKY training, both groups underwent a 5 min base line recording (rest time) and a 20&#x02013;25 min long WM test with simultaneous EEG recording. It was included as prerecording (duration of 30 min) of EEG data for rest and the WM task. After the 7 days workshop, each subject from the experimental group practiced SKY on their own under the monitoring of the experimenter daily, whereas the control group was left to continue with their existing lifestyles. After 90 days, a postrecording was done with a similar procedure as was adopted in prerecording showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overall procedure of experimental design adopted in this research study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJY-9-72-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Tools and techniques</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Working memory task</title><p>Automated of operation span (AOSPAN):[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It was an automated computer-based task in which the user was free from experimenter control. This comprised 15 trials and each trial consisted of remembering and retrieving letters along with solving mathematical problems. In the experimental conditions, letters remained onscreen for 800 ms. During the retrieval phase, the participants saw a 4:3 matrix of letters (F, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, R, S, T, and Y). They were required to click the box next to the appropriate letters (no verbal response was required) in the correct order. The task took approximately 20&#x02013;25 min to complete. The task was administered using E-prime software. Absolute scoring method was adopted to calculate AOSPAN score.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Electroencephalograph acquisition</title><p>Emotiv EPOC: EEG from each subject was recorded with an EEG device Emotiv EPOC; a 14-channel (followed the international 10&#x02013;20 locations), neural signal acquisition, and processing wireless neuron headset.

Data were acquired in a quiet and ventilated room.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Electroencephalograph signal analysis</title><p>As there were fifteen trials for each encoding and retrieval phase, the raw EEG data was segmented for each trial and each EEG channel. Then a Butterworth bandpass filter having a cut-off frequency (2-45 Hz) was applied on each segment of the data. For removing the noise, a wavelet-based denoising technique was used. For extracting the spectral bands gamma (30-45 Hz), alpha (8&#x02013;12 Hz), and theta (4&#x02013;8 Hz), discrete wavelet packet was applied. For calculating the relative wavelet energy of theta 1 (4&#x02013;6 Hz) and theta 2 (6&#x02013;8 Hz) bands, the signal was decomposed using wavelet packet transform up to the 6<sup>th</sup> level.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Power spectral density (PSD) was calculated using Welch method.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was applied to find out the significant differences in AOSPAN scores and all the EEG features (except theta band) for encoding and retrieval trials at the probability 0.05.

Previous literature indicated for a role of SKY in stress reduction.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] We hypothesized that since stress had a negative correlation with WMC, therefore, reducing stress would ultimately enhance WMC. These effects were measured using AOSPAN and an EEG signal analysis. The score saw an increase in both the groups, but the difference was more in the experimental group. To discern the effects of SKY on brain rhythms, EEG spectral analysis was performed for gamma, alpha, theta 1, and theta2. SKY promoted the efficient use of energy and PSD for different brain rhythms in the desired locations as depicted by the gamma (F8 channel), alpha, and theta 2 (F7 and FC5) bands. According to the neural efficiency hypothesis, neural activity in the postexperimental group started working more efficiently.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] As a consequence, the subjects of this group faced no difficulty in removing content from maintenance when no longer needed. They quickly adapted with the task load as AOSPAN was an indicator of cognitive control efficacy. One more theory seemed to fit the results, the global space theory. According to this, resource allocation was built in a productive manner, such that networks between nodes were formed for task-relevant stimuli rather than irrelevant stimuli. To paraphrase, global workspace neurons were mobilized (energy loss) in effortful tasks and were efficiently maintained by SKY. As described by Dehaene <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] an effortful task required a higher global workspace activation that could decline after habituation for that task. It seems plausible that WMC increased after SKY, because SKY reduced the latency of activation. Furthermore, the left hemispheric activation in theta 2 again reflected the effect of SKY in WMC as it had role in processing alphabets.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This result concluded that the role of SKY during the task along and the EEG features demonstrated SKY to be an effective method of training on comparing both the groups.
