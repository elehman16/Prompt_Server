To date the evidence for the efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment of naturally occurring equine tendinopathies is limited. The purpose of this placebo-controlled clinical trial was to describe the effect of a single treatment of equine superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) disease with PRP on clinical and ultrasonographic parameters. Twenty horses with naturally occurring tendinopathies of forelimb SDFTs were randomly assigned to the PRP-treated group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) or control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) after clinical and ultrasonographic examination. The SDFTs received an intralesional treatment with autologous PRP or were injected with saline, respectively (day 0). All horses participated in a standardized exercise programme and were re-examined clinically, with B-mode ultrasonography (5 times at regular intervals) and ultrasound tissue characterization (week 12 and 24 after treatment) until week 24. Long-term performance was estimated via telephone inquiry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to day 0, lameness decreased significantly by week 8 after treatment with PRP and by week 12 in the control group. Ultrasonographically there was no difference in the summarized cross sectional area between the groups at any time point. Ultrasound tissue characterization showed that echo types representing disorganized matrix decreased significantly throughout the observation period in the PRP-treated group. Echo type II, representing discontinuous fascicles, not yet aligned into lines of stress was significantly higher 24&#x000a0;weeks after PRP treatment. Eighty percent of the PRP treated horses reached their previous or a higher level of performance after 12&#x000a0;months compared to 50&#x000a0;% in the CG. After 24&#x000a0;months these proportions were 60&#x000a0;% and 50&#x000a0;%, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single intralesional treatment with PRP up to 8&#x000a0;weeks after onset of clinical signs of tendinopathy contributes to an earlier reduction of lameness compared to saline treatment and to an advanced organization of repair tissue as the fibrillar matrix is getting organized into fascicles while remodelling continues. Long term, PRP treatment has the potential to increase the number of horses reaching their previous level of performance. Earlier treatment of tendinopathy with PRP should be considered to enhance these effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Horse</kwd><kwd>Tendon</kwd><kwd>Lameness</kwd><kwd>Ultrasonography</kwd><kwd>B-mode</kwd><kwd>Ultrasound tissue characterization</kwd><kwd>UTC</kwd><kwd>Platelet-rich plasma</kwd><kwd>PRP</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Tendinopathy of the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is a common injury in Thoroughbred racehorses and other horse breeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and is regarded as a career-limiting disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinical injury is mostly strain induced and characterized by chronic degeneration after repetitive microtrauma in sport horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Tendinopathy may also be caused by a single external percutaneous trauma, such as a kick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A plethora of substrates for intralesional injection with a potentially regenerative effect on tendinopathy are currently under investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among these are platelet concentrates such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Concentrated platelets release numerous cytokines and growth factors, e.g. platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), transforming growth factor-&#x000df; (TGF-&#x000df;) and vascular endothelial growth factor. These factors are known to exercise specific actions during tendon healing (for review see Docheva et al. 2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. PDGF-BB, e.g. stimulates tendon healing depending on its concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. PRP has been shown to enhance tenocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], collagen and matrix synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and to influence vascular density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>PRP has shown significant enhancing effects on tendon healing such as improved biomechanical properties in a surgical model of equine SDFT lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and is increasingly used for intralesional treatment of tendinopathy and desmopathy in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in clinical practice. However, the efficacy of PRP treatment on tendinopathy is seen controversially in human studies: In a randomized controlled clinical trial on chronic human Achilles tendinopathy intralesional PRP treatment showed no beneficial effects compared to saline injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These results are supported by a further randomized controlled study demonstrating no differences in elasticity modulus of PRP- versus non-treated Achilles tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In other clinical studies without control groups PRP treatment of chronic Achilles and patellar tendinopathy significantly improved symptoms and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge the effect of a single intralesional treatment with autologous PRP on equine naturally occurring SDF tendinopathy has not been documented in a prospective randomized placebo-controlled clinical study with long term follow-up in the literature to date (for review see Brossi et al. 2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Autologous platelet concentrates are prepared by centrifugation or by gravitational cellular filtration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Blood samples from different horses and the use of different non-standardised and commercial kits for the preparation of PRP lead to differences in the platelet, leucocyte and growth factor content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Different breed, age and gender influences growth factor and cytokine release of platelets and leucocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The optimal platelet and leucocyte contents in PRP are a point of debate. Recent investigations have shown that a moderate increase in platelets seems to enhance equine tenocyte growth and collagen synthesis more effective than high platelet concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. High leucocyte counts in PRP were observed to enhance the inflammatory reaction in rabbit tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The process of tendon healing is mainly divided into three phases which merge into each other: The acute inflammatory phase (&#x0003c;10&#x02212;14 days) is characterized by phagocytosis of disrupted tendon tissue and demarcation of injured tendon tissue. A fibroproliferative callus is formed during the proliferative phase (4&#x02013;45 days), while collagen fibrils are organised into tendon bundles during the phase remodelling (45&#x02013;120 days; &#x0003c; 3&#x000a0;months) which may be divided into an consolidation (earlier) and maturation (later) phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>A critical parameter to determine the success of tendinopathy treatment is functionality, which can be characterized by lameness evaluation, long term recurrence rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and biomechanical testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To determine the quality of repair tissue tendon needle biopsies have been used successfully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Ultrasound based modalities such as B-mode ultrasonography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and colour Doppler ultrasonography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have been established to monitor the process of tendon healing non-invasively. However, B-mode ultrasonography has several limitations, e.g. lack of axial information, operator-dependence, influence of ultrasound beam angle and limited resolution that impair its sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Ultrasound tissue characterization (UTC) is a new technique to quantify tendon integrity based on a computerized analysis of the stability of echo-patterns in contiguous US images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Based on the echo-pattern stability, 4 different echo types can be discriminated, with histo-morphology of tendon specimen as reference test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Ultrasound tissue characterization has been shown a viable diagnostic tool to monitor experimental tendinopathy in horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and is increasingly used for the quantification of Achilles and patellar tendon integrity in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim of current study</title><p>The aim of the present study was to support the hypothesis that a single intralesional injection of autologous PRP into SDFT lesions up to 8&#x000a0;weeks after clinical onset (1) has a clinically detectable effect and (2) leads to improved ultrasonographic parameters (3) influences long term functionality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Inclusion criteria for client-owned adult horses was an anamnesis of clinical signs of uni- or bilateral SDFT disease in front limbs for up to 8&#x000a0;weeks (56&#x000a0;days) prior to the presentation at the Equine Clinic of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Foundation, or to collaborating veterinarians. Horses were only included if the clients agreed to the study design and tendons had not received intralesional injections before.

It consisted of 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;MHz linear transducer (LA T Transducer, Terason Ultrasound, Teratech Corporation, Burlington, USA) which was fixed in transverse position, perpendicular to the integrated stand-off, in a motorized tracking device (UTC scan unit, configuration 2011, Fa. UTC Imaging B.V., GD Stein, Netherlands) that moves the transducer automatically along the tendon. Within the UTC protocol the instrumental settings for the SDFT were selected which facilitated standard settings like persistence, depth, focal point, gain, TGC-curve, to be used for all scans.

Compilation of these images created a 3-D block of US information that was used for quantification of stability of contiguous echo-patterns. Based on the echo-pattern stability, 4 different echo-types were discriminated, with histo-morphology of tendon specimen as reference test: type I, generated by intact and fully aligned fascicles (secondary collagen bundles); type II, generated by discontinuous, waving, not (yet) aligned and/or swollen fascicles (secondary collagen bundles); type III, generated by a mainly fibrillar matrix (collagen fibrils not/no yet organized into fascicles) and type IV, generated by a mainly amorphous matrix and/or fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Scanning for UTC was performed in standing, fully sedated horses while all limbs were weightbearing. As the UTC device allows to scan a metacarpal segment of approximately 12&#x000a0;cm, the device was applied to the metacarpal area in a way during the initial exam that the zone of maximal injury (MIZ) was centered in the middle of the standoff. The distance from the most prominent point of the accessory carpal bone to the proximally located edge of the standoff was measured and recorded to ensure that the same segment would be scanned during following UTC scans. Additionally this point was marked in the horse&#x02019;s latero-palmar metacarpal haircoat with a shaving blade. A corresponding segment of the SDFT of the opposite front limb was scanned in the same manner.</p><p>With the help of the software, the stability of the echo pattern of corresponding pixels over 9 contiguous transverse images was analysed by UTC algorithms.

Within this segment, the entire cross sectional area of the SDFT was analyzed using every 15<sup>th</sup> consecutive transverse image, i.e. every 3&#x000a0;mm. Ratios of echo types were analyzed quantitatively as fractions of the entire cross sectional area and mean values for the proportion of each type were calculated. The distance from the center of MIZ to the proximal end of the scan was measured to retrieve the MIZ and thereby the segment to be analyzed in control scans during the remaining examination period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Preparation of PRP, Intralesional treatment, controlled exercise and follow-up examinations</title><p>Fiftyfour millilitres of autologous blood were collected by a single venipuncture of one jugular vein into a 60&#x000a0;ml syringe preloaded with 6 ml of the anticoagulant acid citrate dextrose (ACD-A). Approximately 5&#x000a0;ml of whole blood was aspirated into a tube containing EDTA (Vacuette&#x000ae;, Greiner Bio-One International AG, Kremsm&#x000fc;nster, Austria) for later cell counts. To ensure that the whole blood and anticoagulant homogenously mix, the syringe was inverted gently 4 times. The content was transferred aseptically into bag A of a commercially available PRP preparation system (Osteokine&#x000ae;, Orthogen, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany). The bag system was inserted in a swingout bucket of a centrifuge (Universal 300&#x000ae;, Andreas Hettich GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) and a corresponding swingout bucket was filled with a counterweight. According to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction the first centrifugation step was performed at a relative centrifugation force of 900 g for 3&#x000a0;min. The plasma including the buffy coat was transferred via the connecting tube to bag B by gently rolling the bottom of bag A upwards with a clamp. After closing the ports between bag A and B the system was centrifugated for 10&#x000a0;min at a relative centrifugation force of 1470&#x000a0;g. The supernatant platelet poor plasma (PPP) was aspirated via the withdrawal port. The remaining pellet of platelets and residual erythrocytes was resuspended by reinjecting a volume of 3&#x000a0;ml of PPP into bag B. The resulting PRP was completely aspirated from bag B which led to a volume of 4&#x000a0;ml. An aliquot of 1&#x000a0;ml PRP was transferred to a tube containing EDTA (Vacuette&#x000ae;, Greiner Bio-One International AG, Kremsm&#x000fc;nster, Austria), while the remaing 3&#x000a0;ml were used for intralesional injection.

SDFTs allocated to the PRPG received an intralesional treatment of 3&#x000a0;ml into the tendon defect (day 0). Tendons in the CG were injected intralesionally with 3&#x000a0;ml 0,9&#x000a0;% sterile saline solution (Isotone Kochsalzl&#x000f6;sung 0,9&#x000a0;%&#x000ae;, B. Braun Melsungen, Melsungen, Germany). The volume of PRP or saline was equally distributed to 3 sites. The first injection was performed at the maximal injury zone. Further injection sites were 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;cm distally and proximally to the first injection. A padded distal limb bandage was applied and left in place during a period of 3&#x000a0;days box rest in all horses. The contralateral SDFT was not injected. All front hooves of all horses were shod with a closed horse shoe with a straight bar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

At 24&#x000a0;weeks after PRP treatment ultrasound tissue characterization showed a significantly higher percentage of type II echoes which, in combination with decrease of type III and IV, is indicative for advanced repair as the fibrillar matrix is getting organized into fascicles, although not yet aligned into lines of stress. Eighty percent of the PRP treated horses reached their previous or a higher level of performance after 12&#x000a0;months and 60&#x000a0;% continued to perform at this level after 24&#x000a0;months compared to 50&#x000a0;% in the CG at both time points.</p><p>Because of the generally limited availability of adequate patients for a controlled experimental study in a clinical setting, horses of different ages, breeds and types of use were included in the current study. It is established that the potential for tendon healing is greater in younger horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and that among others male gender and high body weight are risk factors for tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The CG contains more horses used for show jumping and eventing which generally implies a higher tendon load and a potentially higher risk for self-inflicted blunt trauma than the use as e.g. dressage horse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This has a potential impact on the severity of tendon lesions and during the long term rehabilitation after 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Fiftyfive percent of the horses included in the current study had ultrasonographic signs of marginal/peripheral SDFT lesions which was considered as a high proportion compared to centrally located tendon lesions frequently diagnosed in race- and performance horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The etiology of peripheral tendon lesions has not been investigated separately. However, it has been assumed that these lesions typically occur in show jumpers, dressage horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and cutting horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. They may be attributed to degeneration or blunt trauma, e.g. self-kicking with the ipsilateral hind hoof, or to excessive strain on the lateral aspect of the affected limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. By contrast centrally located (&#x0201c;core&#x0201d;) lesions are the result of repetitive micro-injuries at high speed exercise and consecutive repair with insufficient tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This lesion pattern was detected in only 3 horses in the current study population which predominantly consisted of warmblood horses used for jumping and dressage purposes.</p><p>This might explain why the effect of a single PRP injection on several parameters of tendon healing study was less profound in the current than in the surgical model used by Bosch et al. (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] that mimics central core-lesions after single macro-trauma in young mature horses, thus no effects of underlying ageing and/or degeneration. A recent systematic literature review revealed that generally more experimental, especially <italic>in vitro</italic> PRP studies yield positive results than clinical trials do, which proves that experimental settings only imperfectly replicate conditions of natural tendon repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although the number of peripheral tendon lesions was similar in both groups of the current study, different lesion patterns potentially respond differently to intralesional injections. Fluid might more easily reflux to the subcutis after injection into marginally compared to centrally located lesions as the former are only surrounded by the peritendineum at their peripheral aspect. At the same time larger tendon lesions generally have a worse prognosis for functional repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and CSA of peripheral lesions is small in most cases. It has been shown that peripheral tendon lesions in cutting horses required a mean convalescent period of 4&#x000a0;months before horses returned to full exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] which is shorter than the usual rehabilitation period for other SDFT injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In the current study all tendon lesions were injected with the same volume of PRP or saline to avoid an impact of a variable volume on the outcome. This was practiced inconsistently in previous studies including injections of naturally occurring, i.e. non-standardized tendon or ligament lesions with variable dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. A volume of 3&#x000a0;ml was chosen based on encouraging results of an equine study using the same volume in an experimental model of SDFT tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Volumes used in previous case series mostly focusing on suspensory ligament desmopathy varied between 0.5 and 12&#x000a0;ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The volume chosen in the current study seemed to be appropriate as no resistance of the syringe plunger occurred during injection of the SDFTs being slightly under tension in a weightbearing position.</p><p>The volumes of PRP and saline were evenly distributed to three injection sites in the current study. A comparable approach was chosen in a human study comparing the effect of PRP and saline on chronic Achilles tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Saline led to similar improvements of the tendon structure as PRP which might indicate that also multiple injections with tiny volumes of sterile saline at one single time-point may trigger a healing response.</p><p>The number of horses with owner consent for a controlled clinical trial is generally limited and the current study was conducted in an equine referral clinic where horses are usually presented within several weeks after onset of clinical signs of tendinopathy. This led to the decision to include horses with a history of clinical signs of tendinopathy for up to 8&#x000a0;weeks. It had to be accepted that some tendons were most probably already in the late proliferative or even in the remodelling phase of tendon healing while most were in the late inflammatory and early proliferative phase. By contrast mechanically induced core lesions were treated as early as 1&#x000a0;week after creation of lesions, i.e. at the end of a well-defined acute inflammatory phase in the experiment by Bosch et al. (2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There is evidence that timing of intralesional tendon treatment has a significant influence on outcome supported by a comparative experimental equine investigation showing that PRP treatment 7&#x000a0;days after SDFT lesion creation led to an earlier improvement of ultrasonographic parameters than treatment on day 14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. It is known that growth factors from the &#x003b1;-granula of platelets such as PDGF and TGF-&#x000df; have a positive influence during the inflammatory phase of tendon healing: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In an experimental model of rat collateral ligament injury the effectiveness of PDGF dropped markedly if it was administered more than 24&#x000a0;h after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This is in accordance with results after treatment of chronic human Achilles tendinopathy which showed no beneficial effects of PRP versus placebo treatment with sterile saline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. At the same time PRP injections have been reported to be beneficial in chronic human tendon disorders refractory to other treatment modalities in several uncontrolled clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. During the proliferation and remodelling phase of tendon healing Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, which is a major component of PRP, might play a role as promotor of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>Horses in the current study received a single PRP treatment. This decision was based on the finding that growth factor and cytokine release from platelets continues from their mRNA reserves for at least 7&#x000a0;days after activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and on a significant and long-lasting effect of a single injection approach in an experimental equine tendinopathy study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Another reason was the intention to investigate a low dose of PRP as a basis for further research in equine naturally occurring tendinopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], because to date no dose dependent studies are available with regard to treatment of equine tendinopathies. The limited long term effect in the current study may have been influenced by the fact that most growth factors contained in PRP are <italic>per se</italic> short lived which probably contributed to a low concentration over time in the clinical setting chosen. In a study using a rodent experimental model it was also shown that a single injection of heterologous PRP immediately after Achilles tendon transection only had time-limited effects on tendon healing during the observation period of up to 6&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Results of another experimental study in a rodent model of tendinosis suggested that a single intratendinous injection of PRP does not lead to a local and systemic increase in several cytokines and growth factors over the observation period of 25&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p>The adequate number of injections over time is also a point of debate in naturally occurring human tendinopathy: In a long term clinical trial in humans it was shown that a second early PRP injection does not rapidly improve clinical signs of tendinopathy in case of incomplete resolution after the first treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. However, it has been shown in a controlled human clinical trial that patients with chronic patellar tendinopathy receiving two injections of a leucocyte poor platelet concentrate (autologous conditioned plasma&#x000ae;) showed better improvement in outcomes when compared to a monoinjection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Accordingly application of 3 consecutive PRP injections significantly improved clinical symptoms and function of human athletes with chronic patellar tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Summarily it cannot be excluded that more than one intralesional treatment might have enhanced the clinical effects observed in the current study.</p><p>Based on whole blood platelets and leucocytes were concentrated by a mean factor of 5.67 and 1.81, respectively in PRP in the current study. Compared to other PRP systems the bag system used in this study leads to an intermediate platelet and low leucocyte concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. By contrast platelets and leucocytes were enriched with factors 3.78 and 6, respectively, utilizing a different double centrifugation system in an equine surgical model of tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Among various other factors the different concentrations of platelets and leucocytes might have contributed to the differences in outcome between the latter and the current study.</p><p>Low platelet counts have been demonstrated to be inefficient in bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and increasing platelet concentrations in a leucocyte reduced PRP preparation leads to delivery of more anabolic and less pro-inflammatory cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, with increasing platelet concentrations the synthesis of collagen type I and III decreases suggesting a diminishing effect on tendon metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This observation corresponds to a dose dependent <italic>in vitro</italic> investigation showing that intermediate platelet concentrations, such as used in the current study, have stronger effects on tenocyte proliferation, migration and collagen production than highest concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p><p>While some beneficial effects such as anti-infectious properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], growth factor content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] and promotion of chemotaxis, proliferation and differentiation of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] have been attributed to leucocytes they also contribute to a greater acute inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] and to the expression of catabolic factors, e.g. MMPs and IL-1, that may influence tendon healing negatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], so that a low leucocyte content seems to be preferable to enhance anabolic effects during tendon healing.</p><p>In summary PRP characteristics vary significantly depending on the technique and preparation kit used for its production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] which has a significant impact on clinical outcome and makes comparison between clinical trials difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The optimal platelet to leucocyte ratio for treatment of tendinopathy is unknown to date and most probably dependent on the stage of tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p><p>Clinical parameters did not differ between the PRPG and controls at any time point which corresponds to the results of an equine PRP study using an experimental model of tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, clinical signs of inflammation such as the degree of lameness and scores for skin surface temperature decreased earlier in the PRPG than in the CG which may be attributed to anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of PRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. This correlates well to reduced pain scores in humans after PRP treatment of tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] and to uncontrolled observations in two horses that returned to competition level performance as soon as 4,5&#x000a0;months after PRP treatment of SDFT lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, mean scores for sensitivity to palpation decreased earlier in controls than in PRP treated tendons despite a similar curve progression in both groups. This is potentially attributed to a high interindividual variation of score values due to the inclusion of different lesion patterns. Established semi-quantitative clinical score systems were used to monitor clinical parameters in the current study. Accuracy could have been increased by the use of computerized gait analysis and thermography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p><p>With regard to B-mode ultrasonography total cross sectional area (T-CSA) decreased significantly between week 4 and 18 after PRP treatment while it did not change throughout the observation period in the CG. Sensitivity of CSA is potentially low to detect minor changes as shown by routine ultrasound assessment of racehorses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. However, a delayed decrease of T-CSA after the inflammatory phase of tendon healing can be interpreted as a therapeutic effect of the PRP injection.</p><p>In contrast to controls, scores for echogenicity were significantly higher which implies a low echogenicity of the tendon lesions at 4, 8 and 12&#x000a0;weeks after PRP treatment and at week 24, i.e. at the end of the observation period. Similarly scores for fiber alignment were significantly higher in the PRPG than in the CG at 4, 8 and 12&#x000a0;weeks after treatment suggesting a lower degree of continuity of fibrous structures. A potential explanation for the differences between groups is that TES and FAS as determined by B-mode were higher in the PRP group from the beginning of the experiment onwards, as comparison of the different time points reveals a tendency to a significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05&#x02212;0.1) for most of the remaining time points. Consequently the intermittent significant difference between groups should be interpreted with caution. However, it cannot be excluded that PRP injection effectively induced a transient inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] which might have contributed to a temporary decrease in echogenicity and in alignment of fibrous structures. This contrasts with results of an experimental equine study showing no differences at all for several B-mode parameters between SDFTs treated with a leucocyte poor single centrifugation plasma product and saline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Although echogenicity and fiber alignment scoring using B-mode ultrasonograms are established tools in clinical settings, they have a limited sensitivity to adequately reflect tendon intergrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Additionally lesion types included in the current study were heterogenous and the number of cases per group was relatively low. These factors made B-mode ultrasonography not the ideal modality to comparatively monitor especially subtle changes during the process of tendon repair in the current study. It could be proved that echogenicity and fibre alignment scores based on B-mode ultrasonograms do not correspond to the degree of echo continuity as determined by UTC implying a higher sensitivity of the latter technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>During ultrasound tissue characterization of PRPG tendons there was a significant drop in the proportion of non-structure related echo-type type IV representing a mainly amorphous matrix and/or free fluid between day 0 and week 12 while proportions for this echo type remained on the same level in the CG throughout 24&#x000a0;weeks. This phenomenon was previously observed in an experimental equine study after a single PRP injection and may be attributed to acute anti-inflammatory effects exerted by PRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><p>The decreasing proportions of non-structure related echo types III and IV between day 0 and week 12 after PRP treatment in the current study rather resembles the course between week 4 and 12 after surgical induction of SDFT lesions without treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the progression between week 5 and 18 after PRP treatment in another experimental equine study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and might therefore be an indicator for the chronicity of some tendon lesions included in the current study population. Hence, the delayed treatment up to 8&#x000a0;weeks after the onset of clinical signs might have contributed to a right-shift of the healing pattern as determined by UTC compared to experimental tendon lesions. However, more frequent UTC examinations between day 0 and week 12 would have been necessary to further prove this. This could not be realized due financial constraints and organisatory reasons as all horses were client owned and horses have to be sedated for 30&#x02013;60 min during UTC scanning.</p><p>Between week 12 and week 24 combined echo-types I and II (fascicular structures) increased significantly within the PRPG. This resulted in a significantly higher percentage of echo type II being representative for the organization of a fibrillary matrix into fascicles that are still discontinous and not yet aligned, thus still remodelling after 24&#x000a0;weeks in PRP treated compared to control tendons. An echo-type II ratio described for normal tendon tissue, i.e. approximately 0.18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], was almost reached. In combination with a significant decreases of summarized echo-types III and IV between week 12 and week 24 this indicates an advanced organization of fibrillar and amorphous matrix into fascicles that are less continuous, more swollen and not aligned yet. The latter interpretation is supported by a lack of significant differences between groups with regard to echo-type I proportions representing intact and fully aligned fascicles (secondary tendon bundles).</p><p>In contrast to the current study PRP treated SDFTs had a significantly lower percentage of echo type II than controls in a surgical tendon model at the end of the observation period of 24&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This indicates that in the Bosch et al. study, using a single macro-trauma, the PRP-treated tendons passed already the remodelling stage while during the experiment described in this manuscript the fascicles were still not aligned yet and still requiring remodelling. In general the higher proportion of echo-type II in the PRPG is an indicator of an active process of remodelling 24&#x000a0;weeks after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>The proportion of echo type III being representative for mainly fibrillar matrix continued to decrease significantly between week 12 and 24 only in the PRPG. Comparison of the proportion of this echo type to others in the PRPG suggests that the decrease in echo type III is rather in favour of echo type I than in favour of echo type II between week 12 and 24 as could be expected from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Main reason for this observation is that in our study there are only limited time-points for UTC scanning, missing some detailed information on stages of repair. Anyhow, this finding suggests a transformation from fibrillar components into intact and aligned tendon bundles during the remodelling phase after PRP treatment of naturally occurring tendinopathies.</p><p>All horses included in the current study underwent the same controlled exercise regimen as it is known that controlled exercise has a therapeutic effect on tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The duration of the controlled exercise prescribed for the included horses started on the basis of the estimated duration of tendinopathy (&#x0003c;4&#x000a0;weeks or 5&#x02013;8 weeks) to adequately address the potentially therapeutic effect of gradually increasing controlled exercise on the process of tendon healing in each individual. To avoid inadequate loading of the tendons immediately after treatment all horses were given 3&#x000a0;days box rest and the first actual exercise level was restricted to 10&#x000a0;min walk.</p><p>Similarly all horses were shod with a closed horse shoe with a straight bar because this type of shoeing has been described as adequate during rehabilitation in cases of SDFT tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Despite potential alternative approaches to decrease strain in the SDFT via orthopaedic shoeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] authors intended to assure that rehabilitation conditions including shoeing were as similar as possible for all horses which seemed to be achievable most consistently with the type of shoeing chosen.</p><p>Recurrence rate is one of the most critical parameters of long-term functionality after tendon injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Only 1 out of 10 horses in either group developed recurrence of tendinopathy in the treated limb within 24&#x000a0;months after treatment. This is a lower recurrence rate than that previously reported after conventional intralesional treatment of SDF tendinopathy in different types of performance horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, it has to be considered that several previous equine tendon studies mainly included racehorses typically developing centrally located core lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which probably have a different etiology than most of the tendon lesions in the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Due to the relatively low number of horses included and different types of use, recurrence rate in the current study should be interpreted cautiously. Biomechanical testing using tendon explants is the gold standard to determine elasticity and strength of tendon tissue. Due to the inclusion of client owned horses it could not be performed in the current study.</p><p>The performance level which is another important indicator of functionality did not differ statistically between groups at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months after treatment. However, the current study revealed that 8 versus 5 horses reached their previous level of performance 12&#x000a0;months after PRP and saline treatment respectively. After another 12&#x000a0;months only 6 of the PRP treated and 5 control horses performed at their previous level. This finding reflects the results of a clinical study including racehorses with midbody suspensory ligament demopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Horses treated with PRP had fewer starts than control horses delayed only during the third year after return to racing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This controlled clinical trial shows that a single intralesional injection of PRP up to 8&#x000a0;weeks after onset of clinical signs of tendinopathy contributes to an earlier reduction of lameness compared to a single intralesional treatment with saline. Compared to controls fibrillar matrix in PRP treated tendons is getting organized into fascicles that are not aligned yet after six months which is a sign of advanced tendon repair while remodelling continues. PRP treatment has the potential to increase the number of horses reaching their previous or a higher level of performance after 12&#x000a0;months which is not sustained after 24&#x000a0;months. Earlier treatment of tendinopathy with PRP should be considered to enhance these effects. Future controlled clinical studies should include higher numbers of horses.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACD-A</term><def><p>Acid citrate dextrose-A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p>Control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DICOM</term><def><p>Digital imaging and communications in medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDTA</term><def><p>Ethylendiamintetraacetate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>G</term><def><p>Gauge</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IV</term><def><p>Intravenously</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIZ</term><def><p>Maximal injury zone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDGF-BB</term><def><p>Platelet derived growth factor-BB</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPP</term><def><p>Platelet poor plasma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRP</term><def><p>Platelet-rich plasma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRPG</term><def><p>Platelet-rich plasma-treated group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDFT</term><def><p>Superficial digital flexor tendon</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p>Standard error of the mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T-CSA</term><def><p>Total cross-sectional area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TES</term><def><p>Total echo score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T-FAS</term><def><p>Total fibre alignment score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TGC</term><def><p>Time gain compensation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TGF-&#x000df;</term><def><p>Transforming growth factor-&#x000df;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p>Ultrasound</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UTC</term><def><p>Ultrasound tissue characterization.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all horse owners for their co-operation and to the veterinary staff of the Tierklinik Gro&#x000df;moor, Adelheidsdorf for their support.
