A comprehensive search suggests that no single drug combining these two hormones has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A product that combines 17&#x003b2;-estradiol with progesterone and offers good bioavailability of both hormones is difficult to achieve biochemically. Progesterone has poor bioavailability&#x02014;it is highly lipophilic and undergoes a complex metabolic process, making it difficult to administer orally or transdermally.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Administering clinically effective oral doses of estradiol and progesterone together in a formulation that does not compromise the bioavailability of either hormone is challenging because of differences in their structure and solubility.</p><p>Many compounding pharmacies manufacture products that combine estrogen and progesterone. Considering the poor bioavailability of oral and transdermal progesterone and the difficulty in determining the appropriate ratio of progesterone to estradiol, compounded hormone products should be viewed with caution.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Pharmacokinetic studies of products manufactured by compounding pharmacies (with the aim to ensure adequate bioavailability) are rarely performed, and few clinical trials have appropriately evaluated the safety and efficacy of compounded hormones.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> For example, despite the widespread use of custom-compounded progesterone gels and creams, no evidence exists to show that any of them opposes estradiol sufficiently to protect against endometrial hyperplasia.</p><p>Although some individuals have a legitimate need for compounded hormone therapy (HT),<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> use of compounded HT greatly exceeds the scope of need. Determining the full extent to which these unregulated, largely untested compounded HT combinations are being used in the United States is difficult because sales are not tracked and some may be obtained without a prescription. However, compounded hormones are believed to make up a large and growing share of estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for menopausal symptoms,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> suggesting an unmet need.</p><p>An investigational oral drug that combines 2&#x0200a;mg of solubilized 17&#x003b2;-estradiol with 200&#x0200a;mg of progesterone in a gelatin capsule (TX-001HR; TherapeuticsMD Inc, Boca Raton, FL) has been developed. The estradiol and progesterone ingredients used in the combination are plant-derived and chemically identical to human hormones of ovarian origin. Consistent with FDA guidelines that call for comparing the bioequivalence of any new product with the market standard, a randomized, open-label, three-period, three-sequence, two-treatment, partial-replicate, cross-over study was conducted to characterize the drug's pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in healthy postmenopausal women. The objective was to show that the bioavailability of the estradiol and progesterone compounds used in TX-001HR was equivalent to the bioavailability of the same doses of commercially available, separate formulations of oral estradiol and progesterone coadministered under fed conditions.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participant selection</title><p>Participants eligible for this randomized study were healthy postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years with a body mass index between 18.5 and 30&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. &#x0201c;Postmenopausal&#x0201d; was defined as a plasma estradiol level lower than 50&#x0200a;ng/L, a plasma follicle-stimulating hormone level higher than 30&#x0200a;IU/L, and no vaginal bleeding for at least 3 years. At screening, women were required to provide detailed medical history and to undergo physical and gynecologic examinations. Laboratory testing was performed to determine baseline hormone levels and to evaluate other hematological safety parameters.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breast-feeding, allergy or hypersensitivity to estradiol or progesterone, underlying disease or recent major illness, history of substance abuse, and use of menopausal therapy in the 6 months before dosing. Current smokers or women who had smoked in the past 3 months were also excluded. In relation to the study check-in date, other prohibited substances were as follows: prescription medications or hormonal agents in the past 14 days, over-the-counter medications (including herbal products) in the past 7 days, grapefruit juice or poppy-containing foods in the past 48&#x0200a;hours, and caffeine in the past 24&#x0200a;hours.

Based on the randomized schedule, participants were assigned, in equal numbers, to one of three dosing sequences (TRR, RTR, or RRT, where T is the test drug and R is the coadministered reference product). In each sequence, participants received a single dose of TX-001HR in one study period and a single dose of estradiol plus a single dose of progesterone in each of the remaining two periods. The same doses of the test and reference products were used for all three study periods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

The HPLC&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry device was equipped with a turbo ion spray and operated in positive ion mode. All three methods used multiple reaction monitoring for detection and quantification of progesterone, estradiol, estrone, and total estrone. Progesterone, estradiol, estrone, and estrone metabolites are endogenous steroid compounds. Calibration standards were prepared in charcoal-stripped human plasma, and quality control (QC) standards were prepared in unstripped human plasma matrix. Baseline endogenous concentrations of estradiol, estrone, and total estrone were measured and added to the spiked QC concentrations of the analytes. This corrected concentration was used as the nominal QC concentration for each analyte to backcalculate with calibration curve standards prepared in charcoal-stripped plasma. For estradiol, estrone, and total estrone, matrix stability experiments (eg, benchtop, freeze-thaw, and long-term stability) were conducted in charcoal-stripped and unstripped human plasma in the presence of coanalytes, including progesterone.</p><sec><title>Progesterone</title><p>Progesterone was extracted from 500&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L of human plasma using a liquid-liquid extraction method.

In this study, TX-001HR met bioequivalence for all analytes and all parameters, except for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for total estrone. Based on these bioavailability findings, TX-001HR is expected to have a safety profile similar to that of the combined reference products. No treatment-related adverse events occurred with either drug during the study.</p><p>Our study looked at progesterone levels under fed conditions, which differ from levels under fasting conditions. A cross-over study showed that taking micronized progesterone with food significantly enhances its bioavailability.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In that study by Simon et al,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> postmenopausal women (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15) received a 200-mg dose of oral micronized progesterone in the morning after a typical breakfast and while fasting, with a 7-day washout between doses. The mean (SD) maximal serum levels of progesterone on day 1 were almost fourfold higher when the drug was taken immediately after breakfast than when the drug was taken while fasting (81.6 [113.4] vs 19.4 [17.9] ng/mL, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The maximal progesterone levels observed under fed conditions in that study were similar to the maximal levels reported in this study, which ranged from 69.7 to 89.2&#x0200a;ng/mL. That study also found that AUC values almost doubled when progesterone was taken with food.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>The maximal estradiol levels observed with the test and reference products in this study are consistent with a pharmacokinetic study of oral 17&#x003b2;-estradiol by Lobo and Cassidenti.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> They reported a mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of 65&#x0200a;pg/mL after oral administration of a single 2-mg dose of micronized estradiol to nonsmoking women.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Ensuring that the progestogen and estrogen components used in combination HT have sufficient bioavailability is critical because improperly formulated EPT combinations could have serious health consequences for users. For example, data from multiple studies indicated that a sufficient level of progestagen is required to protect the endometrium from estrogenic stimulation, thus preventing endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor of endometrial cancer.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> For this reason, the FDA requires drug manufacturers seeking approval of investigational HT to provide high-quality evidence that the drug is safe and effective from pharmacokinetic studies and from clinical trials (in which endometrial safety is evaluated).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>In contrast, compounded HT is not reviewed and approved by the FDA, and makers of compounded HT are not required to conduct the costly trials needed to prove the safety and efficacy of the medications they create.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Compounded hormones that have inadequate bioavailability or do not contain the correct amounts of estrogens and progestogen may fail to protect the uterus. Several studies that evaluated compounded transdermal progesterone creams and gels in postmenopausal women observed posttreatment serum levels of progesterone far below the luteal level of 5&#x0200a;ng/mL.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Wren et al<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> reported serum levels of progesterone similar to baseline levels among 21 women treated with a 100-&#x003bc;g estradiol patch plus up to 64&#x0200a;mg of progesterone cream daily for three 28-day cycles. In addition, a biopsy after cycle 3 showed that 13 women developed endometrial proliferation during the study.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Vashisht et al<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> treated postmenopausal women (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;54) with a compounded cream delivering progesterone 40&#x0200a;mg/day and with a compounded gel delivering estradiol 1&#x0200a;mg/day for 48 weeks. Biopsy results at the study's conclusion showed that the progesterone had provided insufficient endometrial protection for 32% of participants: 27% had endometrial proliferation and 5% had complex hyperplasia.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>Many US women turned to compounded HT after findings from the Women's Health Initiative indicated that the risks of HT (used to prevent chronic diseases) outweighed its benefits.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Surveys suggested that some women have been persuaded by marketing claims from compounding pharmacies that compounded hormones&#x02014;also sometimes referred to as <italic>bioidentical hormones</italic>&#x02014;are safer than FDA-approved hormones, such as those used in the Women's Health Initiative.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Iftikhar et al<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> surveyed 184 women who were consulting a clinician at the Mayo Clinic for menopausal symptoms and reported that 63 were using, or were familiar with, custom-compounded HT. Of those women, 42 (67%) believed that compounded HT was safer than FDA-approved HT.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> However, clinical evidence from high-quality randomized trials in support of such claims does not exist.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Spark et al<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> surveyed 366 Australian women who were taking compounded progesterone and found that 89% started using compounded progesterone because they viewed it as natural. Women's desire for EPT formulations that contain bioidentical hormones, coupled with the need for a formulation that has proven safety and efficacy, was the impetus behind the development of TX-001HR. The active ingredients in TX-001HR are chemically and biologically identical to endogenous estradiol and progesterone. If approved, the non&#x02013;peanut oil&#x02013;containing TX-001HR would be the first FDA-approved EPT option for postmenopausal women with nut allergy who prefer oral progesterone to progestins. It would be a safer alternative to unregulated compounded EPT for symptomatic postmenopausal women with intact uterus who prefer an oral HT regimen that combines estradiol with progesterone.</p><p>Healthy postmenopausal women (aged 40-65 y) with intact uterus (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1,750) are being recruited for the phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled REPLENISH trial (NCT01942668), which aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TX-001HR. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of several doses of this novel estradiol/progesterone combination or to placebo for 1 year. The primary endpoint is the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia at 12 months in the overall population and the improvement in climactic symptoms at 12 weeks in a subset of women experiencing more severe vasomotor symptoms. To our knowledge, REPLENISH is the first phase 3 randomized controlled trial of an oral estradiol-progesterone combination designed to treat menopausal symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Results of this pharmacokinetic study show that the investigational drug TX-001HR, which combines natural progesterone and 17&#x003b2;-estradiol in a single oral capsule, is bioequivalent to an FDA-approved formulation of oral 17&#x003b2;-estradiol administered concurrently with an FDA-approved formulation of oral progesterone. Bioequivalence data from this early-stage trial suggest that the safety of TX-001HR would be similar to that of the respective reference products. The ongoing phase 3 REPLENISH trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of TX-001HR in a large population of postmenopausal women. Should the FDA approve TX-001HR, it would be another FDA-approved alternative to compounded EPT for women who prefer to treat their menopausal symptoms with a progesterone-based HT regimen.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge the medical writing support provided by Christin Melton, ELS, CMPP, and Laura Ninger, ELS, of Precise Publications LLC, which was funded by TherapeuticsMD Inc.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: The study was funded by TherapeuticsMD Inc.
