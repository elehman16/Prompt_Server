This study examined 1) the effect of a Danish multi-component school-based intervention (2010&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;2011) on key determinants of adolescents' fruit and vegetable intake and 2) if dose of curricular activities was positively associated with change in these determinants. Using multi-level linear and logistic regression analyses stratified by gender and socioeconomic position, we analyzed survey data from the cluster-randomized Boost study targeting Danish 13-year-olds' fruit and vegetable intake. We examined 1) differences in knowledge of recommendations, taste preferences and situational norms between students from 20 intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;<italic>=</italic>&#x000a0;991) and 20 control (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;<italic>=</italic>&#x000a0;915) schools at follow-up; and 2) associations between curriculum dose received and delivered (student and teacher data aggregated to school- and class-level) and these determinants among students at intervention schools only. At follow-up, more students from intervention than control schools knew the recommendation for vegetable intake (OR 1.56, CI:1.18, 2.06) and number of fruits liked (taste preferences) increased by 0.22 (CI:0.04, 0.41). At class-level, curriculum dose received was positively associated with proportion of students knowing the recommendation for vegetable intake (OR 1.06, CI:1.002, 1.13). In stratified analyses, this association was only significant among students from high social class (OR 1.17, CI:1.04, 1.31). The Boost intervention succeeded in improving students' taste preferences for fruit and knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake, but only the latter determinant was positively associated with curriculum dose.</p><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold> ISRCTN11666034</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0035"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Positive change in knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake</p></list-item><list-item id="li0040"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Positive change in taste preferences for fruit</p></list-item><list-item id="li0045"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake was associated with curriculum dose</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Curriculum dose</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>Fruit and vegetable intake</kwd><kwd>Knowledge of recommendations</kwd><kwd>Taste preferences</kwd><kwd>Situational norms</kwd><kwd>School-based intervention</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Many schoolchildren do not reach the international recommendation of eating at least 400&#x000a0;g of fruit and vegetables (FV) daily (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Currie et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2015</xref>). School-based multi-component interventions combining educational and environmental strategies have been shown to be effective in increasing children's FV intake (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Evans et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Knai et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Stewart, 2012</xref>).

To enable correct interpretation of intervention effects and develop effective intervention components, knowledge of the implementation of separate intervention components is important (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Linnan and Steckler, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, assessment of the implementation may clarify whether lack of change in important determinants of FV intake is caused by low implementation of the components addressing these determinants or by lack of effect of the chosen intervention tools (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Linnan and Steckler, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Durlak and DuPre, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Curricular components in previous multi-component dietary interventions among children and adolescents (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Wind et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bere et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lehto et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Story et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bessems et al., 2013</xref>) have targeted determinants such as taste preferences, dietary knowledge, awareness of national recommendations for FV intake, and practical skills.

Curricular activities specifically aimed at changing assessment of personal FV intake, FV intake in the class and family and personal goal setting (awareness, situational and social norms); analysis and production of food related advertisements (influence from media); study of how FV intake affects the body (short term outcome expectations); tasting different types of FV (taste preferences); cookery at school (skills and taste preferences), and discussing occasions and meals appropriate for eating FV (situational and social norms, influence from peers and family); field trips to local supermarkets or fruit orchards (awareness of availability) (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Kr&#x000f8;lner et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Kr&#x000f8;lner et al., 2012</xref>).

A time schedule specified 1&#x02013;3 activities which were to be implemented monthly to ensure regular exposure; 2) A teacher script for a project week (four compulsory and four optional activities); 3) A student workbook covering the activities presented in the teacher manuals; 4) A computer tailoring module tailored to students' FV intake, awareness level, taste preferences, and leisure time activities which students were expected to complete three times (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Kr&#x000f8;lner et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The activities were designed to be integrated in different school subjects for example maths, home economics and physical education, and to comply with national learning objectives for these (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Kr&#x000f8;lner et al., 2012</xref>). Teachers were to implement all compulsory activities in each of the seventh grade classes but were allowed adaptations to their local context.

Before intervention start (August 2010), 1121 students at intervention schools completed a baseline questionnaire (response rate of enrolled students: 95.4%). Of these, 991 students (84.3%) completed a follow-up questionnaire post intervention (May/June 2011).

Dependent variables: Determinants of FV intake (student data): 1) Correct knowledge of recommendations for FV intake. In Denmark, children &#x0003e;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;years are recommended to eat at least 600&#x000a0;g (2.5 cups) of FV daily , including at least 300&#x000a0;g of vegetables (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2015</xref>). Thereby, correct knowledge of recommendations was defined as &#x0003e;&#x000a0;2 pieces of fruit and &#x0003e;&#x000a0;2 pieces/portions of vegetables (1 piece/portion&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;counts as 100&#x000a0;g). 2) Taste preferences measured by number of specified FV liked by the student. 3) Situational norms for eating FV measured by number of occasions the student found FV suitable for (e.g. birthdays, being with friends).</p><p>Independent variables: Curriculum <italic>dose received</italic> at school- and class-level: average number of activities received by students at each school and in each class, respectively (student data). Curriculum <italic>dose delivered</italic> (teacher data) at school-level: average number of activities (compulsory, optional and additional) delivered at each school during the intervention (low: 0&#x02013;3.8, medium: 3.9&#x02013;6.7, high: &#x02265;&#x000a0;6.8 dose delivered). In the questionnaire, teachers could tick of a box called &#x02018;Additional activities&#x02019; if they had implemented any of the eight additional activities. It was therefore not possible for them to specify the number of additional activities implemented. Thus, in the estimation of the final dose delivered at school-level additional activities counted as one activity independent of the number of additional activities implemented. We measured both dose received and dose delivered to get detailed information on the implementation level and its effect on distal and proximal outcomes (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aarestrup et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>Covariates: <italic>Baseline level of outcome variables</italic> (student data): 1) Students' knowledge of recommendations, taste preferences and situational norms; <italic>Prior &#x02018;treatment&#x02019;</italic> (principal data): 2) Schools' focus on FV prior to intervention start; 3) Students' access to FV in school besides free Boost FV. We controlled for <italic>dose delivered of other intervention components</italic> (teacher data) to isolate the effect of curricular activities on students' knowledge of recommendations, taste preferences, and situational norms: 4) Number of parental newsletters delivered by Boost coordinators. At six schools, teacher data on number of newsletters uploaded were missing and substituted by parent data on number of newsletters received; 5) Dose delivered of a pleasant eating environment measured by how often the FV were cut up in appealing snacks; <italic>Sociodemographic factors</italic> (student and parent data): 6) Gender; 7) Students' information on mother's and father's job title and workplace was coded into parental occupational social classes based on standardized coding principles (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Kr&#x000f8;lner and Johansen, 2007</xref>). We used student data on occupational social class instead of parent data due to low response rate among parents; 8) Parent-reported educational background was coded into educational levels according to national coding principles (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Statistics Denmark and The Ministry of Education, 2006</xref>). Family occupational social class and family educational level were determined by highest ranking parent.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.6</label><title>Analytical model and statistical analyses</title><p>We analyzed differences in students' knowledge of recommendations, taste preferences and situational norms between intervention and control schools at follow-up, using multi-level analyses adjusted for baseline level of outcome measures.

Control schools were excluded from this analysis as they did not receive any of the intervention components.</p><p>We conducted logistic regression analyses of the dichotomous outcome (knowledge of recommendations) and analysis of variance of continuous outcomes (taste preferences; situational norms).

The highest average dose received and delivered, respectively, were seen at two different schools. Low, medium and high curriculum doses were delivered to students at seven, six and seven schools, respectively.

Curriculum dose received at the class-level was positively associated with changes in this determinant. In stratified analyses, the association was only significant among students of high occupational social class. The Boost intervention was also effective in improving students' taste preferences towards fruit at follow-up. At school level, curriculum dose was not associated with any of the determinants investigated.</p><p>Similar to our study, two multi-component studies (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bere et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>) were effective in changing students' knowledge related to FV at nine months' follow-up, while none of the studies were effective in changing taste preferences. The two studies included younger students (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;12&#x000a0;years old), determinants were not measured separately for FV and measurements of determinants differed from our measurements.</p><p>No previous studies have examined the association between curriculum dose and changes in determinants of FV intake among adolescents. The intervention dose of an entire multi-component intervention (FV snacks, FV events and parental letters) was associated with 10&#x02013;11-year-olds' knowledge of recommendations for FV intake and taste preferences for fruit (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lehto et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The observed effectiveness of the Boost intervention in changing knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake and taste preferences for fruit might be a result of the intended synergistic effect among simultaneously implemented intervention components (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Kr&#x000f8;lner et al., 2012</xref>). Our study did not explore this potential synergy as our analyses of the curricular component were adjusted for the implementation of other components. Still, our findings indicate that the curricular component contributed to the improved level of knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake, and that the number of activities received by students matters for the size of this change. For every extra activity received, students were 6% more likely to know the national recommendation (OR 1.06). Number of activities received by students in each class did not seem to explain the intervention effect on taste preferences for fruit. Future analyses should examine if this effect can be explained by the free daily provision of FV at class. The role of curriculum dose on actual FV intake self-reported by students has been shown (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">J&#x000f8;rgensen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous interventions have not succeeded in changing vegetable intake among children and adolescents (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Evans et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lehto et al., 2014</xref>). This study indicates that curricular activities may be one successful strategy for changing determinants of adolescents' vegetable intake. Curriculum dose seemed to be associated with knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake among students of high occupational social class only. These students may be more receptive to change their knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake as they are likely to experience more parental support in making healthy choices (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>). However, results from stratified analyses should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes and multiple test issues.</p><p>Curriculum dose at school-level may be too crude as it ignores the fact that dose received and delivered may differ by classes within the same school (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Baranowski and Jago, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">J&#x000f8;rgensen et al., 2014</xref>). The importance of measuring intervention dose at the class-level was supported by the greater between-class than between-school variation in curriculum dose received. Also, when estimating dose delivered, additional activities counted as one activity independent of the number of additional activities implemented. Unfortunately, data on the exact number of additional activities were not collected. This way of measuring additional activities might have implications for the classification of schools into low, medium or high dose. Potentially, some schools may have been misclassified with a lower number of activities than were actually implemented. For thorough discussions of methodological issues related to curriculum dose in the Boost intervention, see <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">J&#x000f8;rgensen et al. (2015)</xref>. It may be difficult for students to remember activities implemented in the beginning of the intervention period when asked at the end. To prevent recall bias students were presented with a short description of each activity. The same approach was applied in the teacher survey. Teachers may have over-reported implementation of the compulsory curriculum to please the research team (social desirability bias). In a qualitative study of barriers and facilitators for implementation of the Boost curriculum, teachers felt that their position as a chosen intervention school in a research project obliged them to implement the intervention (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">J&#x000f8;rgensen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The measurement of situational norms has not previously been validated, which might explain the lack of association with curriculum dose.</p><p>Changing complex determinants such as taste preferences and situational norms may depend on quality of the curricular activities delivered rather than number of activities. We do not know if teachers implemented the curricular activities according to the teacher manual. Work overload, competing demands, preparation time and research fatigue (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Knai et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">J&#x000f8;rgensen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Aarestrup et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Clark, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Naylor et al., 2015</xref>) may have lowered teachers' implementation of curricular activities scheduled to take place late in the school year.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the use of the multiple data sources and validated measurements of knowledge of recommendations and taste preferences (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">De Bourdeaudhuij et al., 2005</xref>), an explicit program theory, examination of the role of both curriculum dose received and delivered, and high response rates among students and principals. Also, this study focuses on FV separately which is needed as FV intake may be seen as two different behaviours (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Dudley et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Glasson et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The multi-component Boost intervention was effective in changing students' knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake and taste preferences towards fruit. There was a dose-response relationship between curriculum dose received at class-level and students' knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake. Future studies should explore ways to increase teachers' response rate in order to get more valid assessment of dose delivered. Exploring strategies for changing determinants of FV intake among boys and adolescents of low SEP are particularly important as these subgroups generally have low FV intake. It is important not to increase social inequities through whole of setting approaches. Such knowledge will be useful for planning future school-based curricular interventions in order to implement the most effective types of activities and to identify the minimum curriculum dose required to promote behavioral change.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conflict of interests</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TSJ, MR, RK and PD conceived the study and designed the analytical strategy.
