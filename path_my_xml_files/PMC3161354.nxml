Obesity has become a major health threat around the world. It is epidemic, and the risk increases with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In fact, it is estimated that ~70% of Americans over 60 years are overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Women are more prone to the risk of obesity than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Elderly women who have excess body fat accumulation face increased risk for coronary heart disease, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, osteoarthritis, diabetes mellitus, and other co-morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>A body of evidence has emerged to support the hypothesis that dietary calcium plays a role in decreasing the risk of obesity. Cross-sectional studies have shown that calcium intake has a negative correlation with body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat, and percentage of body fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For example, in the NHANES III survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the odds ratio of being in the highest quartile of body fat was significantly lower if individuals were in the highest quartile of calcium intake. The relative risk of high body adiposity was found to be highest in those with the lowest calcium intake and was progressively lower as calcium intake increased.</p><p>Randomized placebo-controlled trials have provided evidence that is supportive of the beneficial effect of high calcium intake on obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In these trials, greater weight loss and/or fat mass loss were observed in the high-dairy supplemented group compared to the placebo group. Data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study has provided supportive evidence as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, which involved over 36000 postmenopausal women over an average term of seven years, the calcium plus vitamin D supplemented group experienced smaller weight gain than the placebo group.</p><p>While the aforementioned clinical trials indicated a beneficial effect of calcium, two systematic reviews found no evidence of benefit from calcium supplementation on body weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, the role of supplemental calcium in preventing obesity remains controversial.</p><p>It should be noted that the abovementioned clinical trials were generally conducted in obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and/or low-calcium consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and that increased dietary calcium was primarily in the form of dairy products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the WHI Study, the phenotype is total body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, weight is a heterogeneous phenotype consisting of fat, lean, and bone mass. Therefore, the change in weight does not always reflect the change in fat.</p><p>It is reported that serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] is negatively associated with obesity status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. That is, those subjects who have high serum 25(OH)D levels generally have a lower risk of obesity. However, the relationship between vitamin D intake and obesity is yet undetermined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Our population-based study of older women who have a wide range of body size provided an opportunity to assess the effects of calcium, and calcium plus vitamin D supplements on obesity in a large sample over a sustained, four-year period of time. Moreover, this trial included a variety of phenotypes by which to assess the calcium and calcium plus vitamin D effects. Fat mass and lean mass are more homogenous phenotypes in comparison to body weight or BMI. Thus, these phenotypes should be more sensitive to the possible beneficial effects of calcium and calcium plus vitamin D.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><sec><title>1) The subjects for the 4-year clinical trial</title><p>The original cohort included 1179 non-Hispanic white women who were randomly selected from a population of postmenopausal women &#x0003e; 55 years of age in a nine-county rural area of the Midwest. A full-service market research firm randomly selected telephone numbers from all households with listed numbers in the nine-county rural sample area. The firm identified 1180 women meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria who were willing to participate in a four-year prospective study of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The participants were enrolled into study between May 2000 and July 2001. The study was approved by the Creighton University Institutional Review Board, and signed informed consent was obtained from each participant. The inclusion criteria for the 1180 subjects were: 1) at least four years since last menses; 2) in generally good health; 3) living independently in the community; and 4) weighing less than 300 pounds. Exclusion criteria included: a history of cancer except for basal and squamous cell skin cancers and other cancers treated curatively over ten years prior to enrollment; history of renal calculi or chronic kidney disease; and, a history of Paget's disease. One woman was excluded after entry, when she disclosed a history of hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy and reported having taken 50000 IU of vitamin D daily for the past 25 years.</p><p>The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) calcium, consisting of either calcium citrate (1400 mg/d) or calcium carbonate (1500 mg/d) plus a vitamin D placebo (defined as Ca-only group, 445 subjects); Heaney et al. found that, when taken with food, calcium from the carbonate salt is fully as absorbable as from the citrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]; 2) calcium plus vitamin D, consisting of calcium (as above) plus 1100 IU cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>)/d (defined as Ca + D group, 446 subjects); and 3) placebos, consisting of both a vitamin D placebo and a calcium placebo (defined as placebo group, 288 subjects). In the present study, calcium and vitamin D placebo, calcium and vitamin D, or placebos only, were taken three times daily, to be swallowed with meals.</p><p>Enrolled subjects were assigned to groups using computer-generated permuted blocks (<italic>n </italic>= 5) randomization scheme. By design (initially for fracture), the two active treatment groups (Ca only and Ca + D group) were each allocated &#x02248;40% (446 of 1180 participants) of the cohort, and the placebo group, 20% (288 of 1180 participants). Of the 1180 women enrolled, 1024 (86.9%) completed the 4-year study. Most withdrawals (<italic>n </italic>= 92) occurred within the first year. Compliance with study medication (both active and placebo) was assessed at 6-month intervals by bottle weight. The average compliance rate (defined as taking &#x02265; 80% of assigned doses) was 74.4% for the calcium component, and 85.7% for the vitamin D component.</p></sec><sec><title>2) Subjects selected for the present study</title><p>In order to reduce confounding effects, we established three exclusion criteria for selecting subjects for this analysis. Subjects who had metal prostheses/implants were excluded. Metal prostheses/implants interfere with the accuracy of a DXA in assessing trunk fat mass, the main phenotype in the study. In addition, subjects with cancer were excluded. It is well established that cancer patients usually lose weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, application of the cancer exclusion criterion is designed to minimize the influence of the disease on weight-related phenotypes. All subjects who did not complete the 4-year clinical trial were excluded. Among the 155 non-completing subjects, most of the drop-off (n = 128) occurred within the first two years. Because the beneficial effect of calcium on obesity is slow and is not evident in the initial two years, excluding any subjects who did not complete the study is reasonable. After applying the exclusion criteria, we retained 870 qualified subjects. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> lists the number of subjects excluded after applying each exclusion criterion. For the selected 870 subjects, the average calcium compliance rate was 76.0%; the vitamin D compliance rate was 86.9%.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Subjects selected for the project</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2">Groups</th><th align="center">Placebo</th><th align="center">Ca-only</th><th align="center">Ca + D</th><th align="center">Total</th><th align="center">

The phenotypes included BMI, trunk fat (TrF), trunk lean (TrL), and percentage of trunk fat (PTrF). Weight and height were measured with subjects' shoes, coats, and other heavy outerwear removed. BMI is calculated by taking a person's weight and dividing by their height squared. TrF and TrL were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a Hologic 4500C scanner upgraded to a 4500W running software version 8.26 (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). The DXA was calibrated each day of analysis, and the margin of error was maintained within 1.5%. Changes in BMI, TrF, TrL, and PTrF (&#x00394;BMI, &#x00394;TrF, &#x00394;TrL, and &#x00394;PTrF) were calculated as the primary outcomes in the present study.</p><p>Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured annually. Serum samples for 25(OH)D measurement were collected after a 3-hour fast. Participants were asked not to take vitamin or mineral supplements that morning. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay (Nichols/Quest Diagnostics, San Clemente, CA). The coefficient of variation (CV) for intra-assay was 5.1% and inter-assay was 7.9%. All analyses were completed in a single laboratory that participates in the Quality Assurance Program for Vitamin D (DEQAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Height, smoking status, and estrogen usage were determined. Age was recorded accurately to one day. Because obesity status may be affected by season, we divided a year into three seasons: a hot season (Jun.-Aug.), a warm/cool season (Mar.-May, Sep.-Nov.), and a cold season (Dec.-Feb.). Smoking status was quantitatively measured as pack-year (amounts previously and currently smoked), and was qualitatively recorded as "never," "former" or "current" smoker. Estrogen usage was recorded as "never," "less than 6 months" and "more than 6 months" of usage.</p><p>The total calcium intake included dietary calcium (from food), habitual calcium supplement, and the trial calcium supplementation. Habitual calcium supplementation is defined as "self-selected supplementation that a subject takes during the trial." Trial calcium supplementation was calculated using an assigned dose (1400 mg/d or 1500 mg/d) multiplied by the subject's compliance rate. Calcium compliance rate was measured at 6-month intervals. However, the dietary calcium and habitual calcium supplementation was measured only at baseline visit and at the final visit. To achieve consistent measurements, an average calcium compliance rate was used for calculating the trial calcium intake. The average compliance rate was calculated using all available records during the 4-year trial. Similar to calcium intake, total vitamin D supplementation was measured as a combination of habitual vitamin D supplementation and trial vitamin D supplementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed with SPSS for Windows, Release 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All tests were two-sided and <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as significant.</p><p>Descriptive statistics and analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed for confounding factors and phenotypes at baseline. For the follow-up phenotype changes, a Pearson correlation and a stepwise multiple regression were conducted to detect significant confounding factors for each phenotype at each follow-up measure (time point). For the primary analysis, we used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to model the effect of treatment on phenotype changes with significant confounding factors as covariates at each follow-up measure. Independent-sample t-tests applying the Bonferroni correction were performed when the differences between groups were significant. The same analyses were conducted for serum 25(OH)D. In addition to ANCOVA, repeated measures analyses using pooled measures were conducted. In the data analyses, treatment, age, season, estrogen use, and their interactions were included in the model.</p><p>For both baseline phenotypes and follow-up phenotype changes, Pearson correlation or Spearman correlation analyses were conducted against various sources of calcium intake and vitamin D supplementation. The same analysis was completed for the baseline serum 25(OH)D.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characteristics of the study subjects</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> summarizes the subjects selected for the study.

For &#x00394;BMI, the change trend is different among the three groups, even though significant differences were not observed among the three groups. After 4 years of calcium and vitamin D intervention, the BMI decreased in the Ca + D group, increased in the placebo group, and remained approximately unchanged in the Ca-only group. The weight change is consistent with that of the &#x00394;BMI (data not shown).</p><p>Although we did not observe a significant difference among the three groups for &#x00394;BMI, evidence of significant difference was found when we used &#x00394;TrF, &#x00394;PTrF, and &#x00394;TrL. We noted that the changes in TrF and TrL trended in opposite directions. After four years of calcium and vitamin D intervention, subjects from all the three groups gained TrF and lost TrL, although the rates of gain and loss are different between groups. For &#x00394;TrF and &#x00394;PTrF, the Ca-only and the Ca + D groups have lower TrF gain compared to the placebo group (mean 2.4%, 1.4% vs. 5.4%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.015 at year 3), and the effect is more evident for &#x00394;PTrF (mean 1.1%, 0.3% vs. 3.6%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.001 for year 3; and mean 1.8%, 2.0% vs. 4.9%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.003 at year 4). For &#x00394;TrL, Ca-only and Ca + D groups preserve more TrL than the placebo group, and the effect became significant in year four (mean -0.6%, -1.0% vs. -2.1%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.004 at year 4). The results suggest that an increase in calcium intake tends to modify body composition by gaining less TrF and preserving more TrL.</p><p>In the study, significant differences were not detected between the Ca-only group and the Ca + D group for any studied phenotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This suggests that, in the study cohort, vitamin D supplementation provides no additional beneficial effect on body composition. The correlation analysis provided supportive evidence for this finding.

The correlation coefficients between habitual vitamin D supplementation and TrF and PTrF are relatively modest when compared to those between serum 25(OH)D and TrF and PTrF.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial in a population-based postmenopausal women cohort, to observe that increasing calcium intake, in the form of non-dairy calcium supplementation, can prevent gain of fat mass and loss of lean mass. The effect of calcium supplementation in this population-based cohort is consistent with the effect of dairy supplementation in fat and lean mass changes in obese subjects with low baseline calcium intake (&#x0003c; 600 mg/d) as reported by Zemel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A similar significant finding is reported for body weight in the WHI study in a free-living population of 36282 postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In our study, although we did not find significant differences in the change of BMI among the three groups, we did observe that changes in TrF, TrL, and PTrF are significantly different between the calcium intervention groups and the control group. This may be due to TrF and TrL being more homogenous phenotypes and therefore more sensitive to the effect of calcium.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows that in all three groups, subjects tended to gain or maintain BMI in the first 2 years. After that, they began to lose BMI in year 3 and 4. This phenomenon is possibly age-related. In a similar study, Caan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] observed age-related weight change. Postmenopausal women (age &#x02265; 50) tend to gain and peak their weight in mid to late sixties. Later in life they begin to lose weight. In the present study, the mean ages of the three groups at baseline were 65.2 &#x000b1; 6.5 (SD), 66.0 &#x000b1; 6.6 and 66.5 &#x000b1; 7.5 years old in the placebo, Ca-only, and Ca + D groups, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The trajectory of BMI change in our cohort indicates that age ~67 may be the turning point of the effect of age on weight. Considering its potential effects, age was used as a covariate to adjust all studied phenotypes.</p><p>The effect of age on BMI (weight) is consistent with its effect on TrL. From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, it is evident that the subjects in all groups tend to increase TrL in the first year and lose TrL thereafter. The consistent trajectory of BMI and TrL indicates that the change of weight is largely because of the change of TrL. This is compatible with the fact that the main component of total body weight is lean mass.</p><p>In contrast to TrL, TrF tends to increase with aging. This phenomenon is consistent with other studies in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our data indicate that higher calcium intake prevents the accumulation of TrF, and helps to preserve TrL. Lean mass (mostly skeletal muscle) is a key site for energy metabolism. These effects collectively lead to the beneficial effect of reducing the risk of obesity.</p><p>In the present study cohort, mean &#x000b1; SD of baseline calcium intake was 1016 &#x000b1; 520 mg/d, and the baseline calcium intake for nearly 31% of the subjects was over 1200 mg/d. This is similar to the WHI study (over 39% subjects took over 1200 mg/d calcium). The mean &#x000b1; SD of baseline 25(OH)D in this study cohort was 73.2 &#x000b1; 19.9 nmol/L, which is similar to other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but higher than many other US cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The average (baseline to year 4) trial calcium supplement was 826 &#x000b1; 589 mg/d, which is higher than the average dietary calcium (666 &#x000b1; 323 mg/d) and average habitual calcium supplement (342 &#x000b1; 314 mg/d). At baseline, habitual calcium supplementation was negatively associated with BMI, TrF, TrL, and PTrF (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). At the end of the study, trial calcium supplementation is inversely correlated with &#x00394;TrF and &#x00394;PTrF, and positively correlated with &#x00394;TrL. The levels achieved with each type of calcium intake did not affect the correlation analysis.</p><p>An interesting finding in this study is that at baseline (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>), it is habitual calcium supplementation, not the dietary calcium intake, that contributed to the inverse correlation between BMI, TrF, TrL, PTrF and total calcium intake. This result is similar to that of Gonzalez, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], who reported an inverse correlation between weight gain and calcium supplementation, but not with dietary calcium intake. On the other hand, others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] have found that dietary calcium has more of an effect on weight than does supplementation. One reason for a lack of effect of dietary calcium is that self-reported dietary calcium intake is difficult to measure.</p><p>Clinical trials measuring the effect of vitamin D supplementation on obesity are few. Our study indicates that vitamin D supplementation may have no additional effect on body composition in the presence of high calcium intake. This result is consistent with a previous study conducted by Sneve, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which reported that high vitamin D supplementation does not lead to weight loss.</p><p>At baseline, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], we observed that low serum 25(OH)D is negatively associated with BMI, TrF, and TrL. At year 4, &#x00394;25(OH)D is inversely correlated with &#x00394;BMI, &#x00394;TrF and &#x00394;PTrF. These results indicate that serum 25(OH)D may play a role in obesity, although the change in serum 25(OH)D does not linearly reflect the change in trial vitamin D supplementation.</p><p>Our study shows that vitamin D supplementation and serum 25(OH)D have different effects on obesity. The different effects may be due to inter-individual differences in the effectiveness of the vitamin D supplementation. The increase of serum 25(OH)D in response to a given dose of vitamin D supplementation is, as reported, widely different from person to person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We found that, after a 12-month vitamin D intervention in our Ca + D group, among the 261 Ca + D subjects who took &#x0003e; 80% vitamin D supplement dosage (i.e. &#x0003e; 880 IU/d) and had serum 25(OH)D measurements at year 1 and baseline, 10 subjects decreased their serum 25(OH)D levels on average by 7% [ie. &#x00394;25(OH)D =-0.07]. Moreover, 251 subjects increased their serum 25(OH)D levels on average by 42% [i.e. &#x00394;25(OH)D = 0.42]. The average vitamin D supplement for the 10 subjects was 1039 IU/d, and for the 251 subjects was 1051 IU/d which was only a little higher than 1039 IU/d.</p><p>One strength of this study is that the ethnic backgrounds and living environments of these rural non-Hispanic white women are similar. Relative homogeneity of the population in the parent study is likely to reduce the influence of confounding factors on the measurement of the calcium effect. In addition to the aforementioned strength, we are aware of an extant limitation in this study. Compared with some randomized controlled trials specifically designed for obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], one limitation of the study is the lack of records of energy intake and physical activity. However, these results are still credible because the population was well-randomized (no significant difference among groups for any confounding factor).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, study results show beneficial effects of high calcium intake on obesity in a population-based study of postmenopausal women who have a relatively high baseline calcium intake. However, vitamin D supplementation may have no additional effect on body composition.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JZ, LJZ and QZ participated in the data analysis, interpreted the results, and in the preparation of the manuscript.
