The primary endpoint was proportion of patients achieving ACR20 at Week 48.</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> At Week 48, ACR20 responses were not statistically significantly different between the dose regimens. Compared with RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg (<italic>n</italic> = 134) or dose escalation (<italic>n</italic> = 119), ACR and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) outcomes in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group (<italic>n</italic> = 93) were consistently higher, with significantly more patients achieving EULAR responses (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0495). At Week 48, rituximab 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg was associated with a higher proportion of patients who, following retreatment, maintained or improved their Week 24 responses. Dose escalation from 2 &#x000d7; 500 to 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg did not appear to be associated with improved outcomes compared with continual 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg. All RTX regimens demonstrated comparable safety.</p><p><bold>Conclusions.</bold> RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 and 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg could not be clearly differentiated, although some efficacy outcomes suggest improved outcomes in the rituximab 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group. Retreatment from Week 24 resulted in a sustained suppression of disease activity through to Week 48.</p><p><bold>Trial registration.</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">http://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>, NCT00422383.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rituximab</kwd><kwd>Rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>Repeat treatment</kwd><kwd>B-cell depletion</kwd><kwd>Phase III</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rituximab (RTX), an mAb that selectively targets and depletes CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells, has demonstrated significant efficacy and a favourable safety profile in clinical trials conducted in patients with active RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg in combination with MTX resulted in a significant clinical and radiographical benefit in patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and this dose or a lower dose of 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg resulted in significant improvements in disease activity in patients with an inadequate response to non-biological DMARDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, questions remain, not only regarding the most appropriate dose of RTX, but also how and when patients should receive further courses. In long-term observational studies, patients who had an initial response to RTX were allowed further courses no more frequently than every 16 weeks if they had active disease (defined by at least eight swollen and eight tender joints) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], with the decision to retreat also being at the discretion of the treating physician. As a consequence, at an individual patient level, repeat treatment times were highly variable, with clear evidence of returning disease between treatment courses. While defining a fixed repeat treatment schedule suitable for all patients may not be appropriate, it would, however, be desirable to retreat patients before a significant clinical flare occurs.</p><p>Further, the benefit of repeat treatment in patients in whom an initial response was not achieved has not been established and requires further investigation. Similarly, data on any effect of dose used for such repeat treatments may provide clinically relevant information.</p><p>Therefore, the present study was designed to determine if initiating treatment with RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg followed by a repeat treatment at 24 weeks with 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg was different from repeat treatment with a higher dose of 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg. The study was also designed to compare the efficacy and safety of RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 and 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg over 48 weeks with a fixed repeat treatment at Week 24.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, Phase III trial conducted as part of the clinical development programme for RTX in patients with an inadequate response to disease modifying therapies. The study was conducted at 81 centres in 18 countries in patients with active RA who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX therapy. The overall study design is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. Patients were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: initial treatment with RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg with a repeat course at Week 24 also of 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg; dose escalation (initially RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg, with 2 &#x000d7;1000 mg on retreatment); or initial treatment with rituximab 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg and retreatment with 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg. All RTX infusions were preceded by intravenous methylprednisolone 100 mg.

Further, evidence suggests that even low circulating CD19 levels may be associated with poor response or returning disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Retreatment at 24 weeks, therefore, represents a reasonable time at which to retreat.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated using an interactive voice response system; the randomization was stratified by region, RF seropositivity and prior biological use. Although all patients were randomly assigned to RTX-containing regimens, allocation to dose and repeat treatment regimen was blinded. The sponsor, investigators and patients were blinded to the treatment allocation up to the time of the Week 48 analysis. Treatment assignments were unblinded to the sponsor at this time for the purpose of the data analysis.</p><p>Stable doses of MTX (10&#x02013;25 mg/week) were maintained throughout the study period. Permitted co-medications included folic acid (5 mg/week) NSAIDs and oral glucocorticoids (&#x02264;10 mg/day). IA glucocorticoid injections were restricted to not more than one joint per 24-week period. Use of additional non-biological and biological DMARDs was strictly prohibited.</p><p>The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Seronegative patients and patients with earlier exposure to biological therapies were limited to not more than 20 and 30% of the total population, respectively.</p><p>A sample size of 125 patients per arm (375 patients in total) was determined to ensure 80% power to discern a 17.5% difference in the proportion of patients with an ACR20 response at Week 48 between the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group and the dose escalation treatment group, using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test with a two-sided significance level of 0.05.</p><p>For the primary efficacy variable (ACR20 response at Week 48), the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group was compared with the dose escalation group (the primary analysis) using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel (CMH) test and logistic regression analysis, adjusted for baseline factors of RF status, region and earlier biological use. Further exploratory analyses were conducted to compare the 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group with the 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group.</p><p>Secondary endpoints were analysed to compare the 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group with the dose escalation group (the secondary analysis) using the CMH test for categorical endpoints and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous endpoints, both adjusted for baseline stratification factors. ANOVA models also included the baseline value for the endpoint, if applicable. Missing data were imputed using the non-responder method for ACR and EULAR (all patients who withdrew were classed as non-responders); last observation carried forward was used for all other endpoints. Further exploratory analyses were conducted to compare the 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group with the 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group.</p><p>During the conduct of the study, the sponsor became aware of treatment errors owing to a lack of synchronization between an updated medication list and the randomization schedule. These treatment errors affected 60 patients and subsequently potentially compromised any analysis based on the intent-to-treat population (ITT; all treated patients as randomized). Results are consequently presented from a modified ITT (mITT) analysis with patients analysed by the treatment they actually received as opposed to the treatment they were randomized to receive. Analyses using the standard (as randomized) ITT population were conducted on the primary endpoint (ACR20).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient disposition</title><p>In total, 378 patients were randomly assigned, with all except one receiving at least one infusion.

In total, 18.8% (3/16) of HACA-positive patients at Week 24 following the first course experienced an IRR during the second exposure to RTX, which is consistent with the overall incidence of IRRs during the second course (17%). The presence of HACAs did not appear to influence either the ability of RTX to deplete CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells or efficacy or safety outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>The incidence of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to withdrawal (RA flares excluded) was similar across treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Common AEs included RA flares, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections and IRRs. IRRs were reported in 39, 30 and 30% of patients in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg, dose escalation and RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg groups, respectively, with the incidence being higher following the first course than following the second course (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Two patients (both in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group) experienced a serious IRR during the first infusion of the first course, with three further patients experiencing IRRs that were CTC AE Grade 3 events. Multiple symptoms were reported for each IRR and included angioneurotic oedema, bronchospasm, flushing, hypotension, laryngeal or pharyngeal oedema, throat irritation, pruritus and pyrexia.

The most frequently reported infections included nasopharyngitis, upper and lower respiratory tract infections (including bronchitis) and urinary tract infections. A total of 11 serious infections were reported, including sepsis, skin ulcer, lower respiratory tract infection and sinusitis in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group; bronchopneumonia, respiratory tract infection, post-operative wound infection, gastroenteritis and bronchitis in the dose escalation group; and diverticulitis and acute pyelonephritis in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group. The rate of all infections and serious infections per 100 patient-years over 48 weeks was similar across treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>) and no opportunistic infections were reported during the study period. There was no apparent association between the occurrence of a serious infection and low Ig levels. Indeed, in 9 of 11 cases of serious infection, the patients had Ig concentrations (total and isotype) within the normal range. Two serious infections (bronchitis and diverticulitis) were reported in patients who developed low IgM levels following RTX treatment, although all other isotypes remained within the normal range.</p><p>Malignancies were reported in four (1.2%) patients, and included basal cell carcinoma (one case each in RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg and dose escalation groups), squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (dose escalation group) and Hodgkin&#x02019;s disease (RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of this study was to determine the impact of various repeat treatment regimens with RTX, either at the same dose (two courses of 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg 24 weeks apart) or at a higher dose (dose escalation, 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg followed by retreatment with 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg). In addition, the standard regimen of two courses of 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg 24 weeks apart was evaluated. With respect to the primary endpoint (ACR20 at Week 48), there were no statistically significant differences between the three treatment regimens. Although the power of the study to detect dose differences was somewhat compromised by the treatment errors that occurred, analyses based on the ITT population &#x02018;as randomized' or &#x02018;as treated&#x02019; (presented in this article), were consistent with each other.</p><p>RTX was found to be an effective treatment in patients with an inadequate response to MTX, with some important and relevant clinical observations being made. ACR response rates across the treatment groups at Week 48 were comparable with those previously reported with RTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and also with those reported for biological agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20">17&#x02013;20</xref>], albeit with the caveat that in this study there was no control group for comparison. Importantly, high-hurdle disease activity endpoints, such as ACR70, DAS low disease activity or remission at Week 48, were achieved by &#x0223c;20% of patients, further supporting the results of a previous study in patients with active RA resistant to DMARDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Secondary endpoints broadly supported the primary outcome; however, there was an indication that patients receiving RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg in each treatment course achieved better responses. For example, the proportion of patients achieving remission in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group was twice that in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group (9 <italic>vs</italic> 19%, respectively). Similarly, significantly more patients in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group achieved a EULAR good or moderate response compared with the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group (89 <italic>vs</italic> 73%, respectively). Supporting these observations, higher proportions of patients in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group maintained their Week 24 ACR response category compared with those in the dose escalation and RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg groups. Indeed, 78% of patients in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg group who achieved an ACR20 at Week 24 maintained or improved their ACR response category at Week 48. In contrast, 65% of patients initially receiving RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg maintained or improved their response following a further course of the same lower dose.</p><p>The study has also provided insight into the effect of repeat treatment in patients who had not achieved an ACR20 at Week 24. In a recent study, retreatment with RTX in patients who had not achieved a EULAR response on two consecutive visits following an initial course resulted in continued non-response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], indicating that further treatment of non-responding patients may not be beneficial. However, in this study, of 131 patients across all groups who were ACR non-responders at Week 24, 43% achieved at least an ACR20 response at Week 48 following repeat treatment.</p><p>This study is also the first study where a second course of RTX was given at a fixed time interval (24 weeks) following the initial treatment. Repeat treatments in previously reported studies have been given based on clinical symptoms, together with the physicians&#x02019; decision to give further courses. As a consequence, time intervals between courses were prolonged (&#x0223c;33 weeks), with patients&#x02019; disease activity returning close to pre-treatment levels before each course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, the strategy of administering two courses of RTX 24 weeks apart in the current study appeared to induce a sustained decrease in disease activity over time, as illustrated by maintained or improved outcomes in DAS-28 following the 24-week repeat treatment. This fixed repeat treatment approach would, therefore, appear to be more beneficial than waiting for disease symptoms to flare before offering retreatment. These observations are also supported by recent data indicating that clinical responses were better maintained in patients receiving 24-week treatment courses based on their DAS-28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Longer term follow-up of both efficacy and safety of rituximab using such repeat treatment regimens is therefore clearly warranted.</p><p>The efficacy of rituximab was apparent irrespective of whether patients had received prior treatment with a TNF inhibitor, with patients who had received prior TNF inhibitors deriving as much benefit from RTX treatment as the overall population. Patients in the earlier biological therapy subgroup receiving RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg tended to have consistently higher ACR and EULAR outcomes compared with those in the RTX 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg group. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, as patient numbers in this earlier biological subgroup were small and no statistically significant difference was found between the dose regimens.</p><p>The safety profile of rituximab reported in this study was consistent with previous experience, including that of repeated courses, with no new or unexpected safety signals being observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The rates of AEs were similar across treatment groups and were primarily characterized by IRRs and infections, experienced by 34 and 60% of patients, respectively. Clinically significant (serious or CTC AE grade &#x02265;3) infusion reactions were uncommon (five events, 3%); however, these led to discontinuation in two patients. Such events were predominately observed in the 2 &#x000d7; 500 mg dose group and were associated with the first infusion of the first treatment course. The rate of serious infections was lower than that observed in previously published studies (overall 3.36 compared with 4.7&#x02013;5.2 events per 100 patient-years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Importantly, there was no association between the incidence of serious infection and the presence of low Ig (including Ig isotypes). Other events of interest included malignancies, the incidence of which was also comparable with that reported in 1039 RA patients treated with RTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, these data support RTX as an effective and well-tolerated therapy in patients with RA and an inadequate response to DMARDs, irrespective of the earlier treatment with a TNF inhibitor. Although RTX doses and retreatment regimens could not be clearly differentiated, several efficacy outcomes favoured treatment with RTX 2 &#x000d7; 1000 mg. Repeat treatment at Week 24 with RTX maintained the response achieved with the first course and may be associated with improved efficacy outcomes. The safety profile of RTX remained favourable, with no new safety signals becoming apparent with repeat courses.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="keq116b1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank the principal investigators of the MIRROR Trial Group.
