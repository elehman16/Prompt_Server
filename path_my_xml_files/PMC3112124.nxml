The effects of mental health complaints on work can have serious consequences for the quality of care provided by these workers. To help health service workers remain healthy and productive, preventive actions are necessary. A Workers' Health Surveillance (WHS) mental module may be an effective strategy to monitor and promote good (mental) health and work performance. The objective of this paper is to describe the design of a three arm cluster randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of a WHS mental module for nurses and allied health professionals. Two strategies for this WHS mental module will be compared along with data from a control group. Additionally, the cost effectiveness of the approaches will be evaluated from a societal perspective.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study is designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial consisting of three arms (two intervention groups, 1 control group) with randomization at ward level. The study population consists of 86 departments in one Dutch academic medical center with a total of 1731 nurses and allied health professionals. At baseline, after three months and after six months of follow-up, outcomes will be assessed by online questionnaires. In both intervention arms, participants will complete a screening to detect problems in mental health and work functioning and receive feedback on their screening results. In cases of impairments in mental health or work functioning in the first intervention arm, a consultation with an occupational physician will be offered. The second intervention arm offers a choice of self-help e-mental health interventions, which will be tailored based on each individual's mental health state and work functioning. The primary outcomes will be help-seeking behavior and work functioning. Secondary outcomes will be mental health and wellbeing. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness in both intervention arms will be assessed, and a process evaluation will be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>When it is proven effective compared to a control group, a WHS mental module for nurses and allied health professionals could be implemented and used on a regular basis by occupational health services in hospitals to improve employees' mental health and work functioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=NTR2786">NTR2786</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Common mental disorders (CMDs) can have negative effects on work as they can impair work functioning and increase sickness absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In some occupations, the impairments in work functioning can have serious consequences, such as injuries to workers. One occupation in which this vulnerability is highly present is nursing. Nurses, the largest occupational group in healthcare, are at higher risk of developing mental health problems compared to workers outside of the health care sector and compared to other (health) service workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The relative risk for depression is high for nurses, RR = 3.5, 95% CI (1.3, 9.6), compared to other human service workers and other healthcare workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This high risk might partly be explained by the very nature of the work, with work environment characteristics that are known to promote the occurrence of mental health complaints, such as high job demands, low job control and low social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, in the health care sector, impairments in work functioning can have serious effects not only for the nurses but also for patients and their safety as a recent literature review showed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In the Netherlands, the occupational health care that is provided for employees with mental health problems can be considered effective. Care according to the guidelines for occupational physicians' (OP) treatment of workers with mental health problems has been proven to improve mental health and to enhance return to work for sick-listed employees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the health service for OPs is often not used by workers until they are sick-listed. Late or no help-seeking for mental health complaints is a well-known problem inside and outside of the occupational health service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Preventive actions are needed to provide timely help before work functioning is reduced to the extent that workers cause serious incidents or must call in sick. Early identification of health complaints and risks in work functioning to provide timely help is a first step in the prevention of more serious consequences for the health and safety of the nurses and their patients. Furthermore, preventive actions can improve the wellbeing of employees in the health care sector. Wellbeing can have positive effects on the engagement and productivity of employees. With the age of the caring workforce increasing, the importance of sustainable labor participation by senior employees is increasing. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to keep the caring work force engaged and mentally fit so they can continue to meet the high mental demands of modern-day work.</p><p>A Workers' Health Surveillance (WHS) mental module may be a successful preventive strategy for CMDs and impairments in work functioning in the health care sector. Within the occupational health care setting, WHS is a well-developed strategy for preventive actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. WHS aims to detect negative health effects of work in an early stage to enable timely interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although the use and application of WHS is rising for various occupations and health effects, little is known about WHS targeting mental health effects. In a recent literature review by Plat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] on WHS in military and emergency service personnel, three studies included psychological health aspects, one in police personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], one in rescue and recovery workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and one in soldiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. WHS for mental health effects in nurses has not yet been scientifically evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a job-specific WHS mental module for nurses and allied health professionals.</p><p>Although the International Labour Organization has formulated recommendations for the use of WHS, the design differs between countries. In the Netherlands, a policy guideline on how to conduct WHS exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This guideline does not prescribe any specific interventions, but includes principles and leading criteria such as the statement that screening for health problems should only be conducted if effective interventions for that health problem are available. Furthermore, one of the core aims of the guideline is the monitoring and improvement of both the health and functioning of workers. Therefore, our job-specific WHS mental module includes screening for early signals of mental health complaints and for impairments in work functioning. For the detection of impaired mental health, several validated instruments exist that are suited for the working population. However, until recently, no instrument for detecting impaired work functioning in healthcare workers related to mental health problems was available. Such an instrument has now been developed to be used in the hospital environment, the Nurses Work Functioning Questionnaire (NWFQ) (G&#x000e4;rtner, Nieuwenhuijsen, van Dijk, Sluiter, unpublished). The NWFQ was designed based on literature studies and focus group investigations with the workers' supervisors, human resource managers and occupational health professionals. The NWFQ has a high content validity, and its seven subscales show good or acceptable internal consistency.</p><p>For the interventions that follow the screening, two different strategies were developed. The first strategy is a consultation offered by the OP following a protocol for care for workers with mental health complaints, as developed for this study. The second strategy is a choice of self-help e-mental health interventions that is offered to all workers - those with and without complaints. The choice is tailored to the individual screening results.</p><p>The objective of the Mental Vitality @ Work study is to study the effectiveness of two strategies for the WHS mental module in one cluster randomized controlled trial design with three arms. Substudy 1 aims to test the effectiveness of screening for problems in mental health and work functioning plus advice on appropriate interventions by an OP compared to a control group. It will study the effects on adequate help-seeking behavior, work functioning and mental health. We hypothesize that employees who receive the WHS mental module with screening plus an invitation for OP-care will show more adequate help-seeking behavior than employees in the control group. Furthermore, we hypothesize that work functioning and mental health problems will improve in employees who receive the WHS mental module with screening plus invitation for OP-care compared to employees in the control group.</p><p>Substudy 2 aims to compare the OP-care strategy with a second strategy, including the same screening of problems in mental health and work functioning as in the OP-care strategy plus a stepped care e-mental health approach. Substudy 2 will compare the effects of both strategies on work functioning and mental health. We hypothesize that both WHS mental module strategies are equivalent in their effectiveness on work functioning, mental health and wellbeing compared to the control group. An economic evaluation of the WHS mental module will be conducted alongside the randomized controlled trial. Cost-effectiveness of the WHS mental module will be assessed from a societal perspective. The employer's perspective will be considered in a cost-benefit analysis. Regarding cost effectiveness, we hypothesize that the WHS mental module with E-mental health interventions is more cost effective than the WHS mental module with OP-care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>In the following description of the design of the Mental Vitality @ Work study we follow the CONSORT statement, which aims to improve the quality of reporting randomized controlled trials (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A cluster randomized controlled trial with three parallel arms will be performed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of two strategies for a WHS mental module for nurses and allied health professionals: the OP-care strategy and the E-mental health strategy. The study combines two separately funded substudies. Substudy 1 will compare the control arm with the OP-care arm - a screening on mental health complaints and impaired work functioning followed by a consultation with an OP and appropriate interventions if necessary. Substudy 1 will test the effect on help-seeking behavior, work functioning and mental health of employees with problems in mental health and/or work functioning.</p><p>Substudy 2 will compare the E-mental health arm - a screening on mental health complaints and impaired work functioning followed by a tailored choice of self-help e-mental health interventions - with the control arm and with the OP-care arm. Additionally, a subgroup analysis of the healthy participants comparing the E-mental health arm with the OP-care arm will be conducted. Substudy 2 will test the effect of the interventions on work functioning and mental health.</p><p>Participants will be followed for six months. Two follow-up measures will be conducted, one at three months and one at six months. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam (AMC) gave approval for the study. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> presents an overview of the study design. Below, differences between Substudy 1 and Substudy 2 are described. Otherwise, the information is equal for both parts.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study design</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-11-290-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The study will be performed in one Dutch academic medical center, a hospital with 7000 employees and 1102 beds. The organization has its own in-company occupational health service. Each of the different divisions in the medical center has one OP assigned for its occupational health care. In the Dutch occupational health care system, OPs fulfill preventive tasks, have the duty of detecting occupational diseases and provide (return-to-work) counseling for sick-listed employees. In the Netherlands, if they are reported sick, workers are required to visit their OP for independent judgment of sick leave and for return-to-work guidance. Furthermore, all workers can make use of the free accessible consulting hour for employees with questions about work and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. According to the in-company occupational health service, usage of the free accessible consultations by employees is limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The research population includes all nurses, including surgical nurses and anesthetic nurses, and allied health professionals working at one Dutch academic medical center. In total, 1731 nurses and allied health professionals work in the medical center in 86 different wards, including outpatient wards. Employees who are sick-listed at the start of the study and expected to be on sick leave for more than two weeks are excluded from the study, as they will in any case consult an OP.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of participants</title><p>For a successful intervention study in a work setting, all layers of the organization must fully support the study. As we received endorsement from the board of directors, the nurse directors and the workers' counsel to perform the study, the likelihood for the departments to accept participation is high and all departments are expected to participate. During the enrollment period, information will be given on the hospital intranet, posters will be put up in the hospital building and flyers will be given out to promote the study.</p><p>Prior to the recruitment of individual employees, all wards will be informed about the Mental Vitality @ Work study by personal letters to the nurse directors and head nurses and the managers of allied health professionals. Subsequently, the individual workers will be informed by a letter to their home address with detailed information about the study procedure and about the safety and privacy of the individuals. Ten days later, an e-mail will be sent to the employees' work-email account, encompassing study information, a link to the online questionnaire and a personal log-in name and password. Agreeing with the informed consent, which is shown online prior to the questionnaire, is a prerequisite for starting the questionnaire. It will be possible for participants to log in on the website at any time and from any computer. It is also possible to log out at any point during the survey and to continue after logging in again. In the four weeks after the invitation for the study, three reminders will be sent to employees who have not yet started or completed the questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>OP-care</title><p>The first WHS mental module strategy encompasses an online screening for mental health complaints and work functioning problems plus an optional consultation with an OP for employees with mental health problems and/or work functioning problems. Directly after filling out the screening questionnaire, participants will automatically receive digital feedback on the screening results. Participants who score above a cut-off point for either the mental health complaints, work functioning impairments or both will receive an invitation from the in-company occupational health service for a face-to-face consultation with their OP scheduled within two weeks after filling out the screening questionnaire at baseline. The consultation is voluntary and supervisors of employees will not be informed about the invitation or the content of the consultation with the OP.</p><p>In order to structure the consultation of the OP, a seven-step protocol will be applied. The seven steps are: 1) discussing expectations; 2) discussing screening results and characteristics of mental health/work functioning complaints; 3) discussing possible causes in the private, work and medical situation and consequences for performing the work; 4) giving a diagnosis and offering a rationale; 5) giving advice for reduction of health complaints and for the improvement of work functioning and the prevention of incidents at work and discussing communication with the supervisor; 6) discussing a possible follow-up trajectory or referral to other care givers; and 7) summarizing the consultation.</p><p>This protocol closely follows the care as usual of the OPs. It was developed by means of interviews with the five participating OPs and based on the evidence-based guideline for OP's treatment of workers with mental health problems, which was developed by the Dutch Society of Occupational Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The main difference with the care as usual is the focus on identifying impairments in work functioning and giving advice on the improvement of work functioning and the prevention of consequences of impaired work functioning. All participating OPs were trained in using the protocol for the consultations.</p></sec><sec><title>E-mental health</title><p>The second WHS mental module strategy encompasses an online screening for mental health complaints and work functioning problems plus tailored advice on self-help e-mental health interventions. In this strategy, after filling out the screening questionnaire, feedback on results will be provided digitally. Workers with impaired work functioning will be digitally offered advice on how to improve their work functioning. Furthermore, an electronic health intervention trajectory will be offered to each participant to improve mental health and wellbeing. The trajectories offered for improvement of mental health will be tailored to the needs of the worker as assessed by the screening. The e-mental health interventions that can be offered are:</p><p>&#x02022; Psyfit: aimed at the promotion of wellbeing. It is suitable for everyone, including healthy participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The effectiveness of Psyfit is currently being examined (Bolier, Bohlmeijer, Haverman, Boon, Kramer, Riper, unpublished).</p><p>&#x02022; Strong at work (Sterk op je werk): aimed at gaining insight into work stress and at learning skills to cope with work stress.</p><p>&#x02022; Colour your life (Kleur je leven): aimed at tackling depressive symptoms. Research has shown Colour your life to be (cost) effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>&#x02022; Don't Panic Online (Geen Paniek Online): aimed at reducing panic symptoms for sub-clinical and mild cases of Panic Disorder. This intervention is based on Don't Panic (<italic>Geen Paniek</italic>), a face-to-face group course for sub-clinical and mild panic symptoms. Don't Panic has proven to be cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The effectiveness of this online intervention is currently being studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>&#x02022; Drinking less (Minder drinken): aimed at reducing risky alcohol drinking behavior and shown to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The e-mental health interventions are self-help programs on the internet aimed at reducing specific mental health complaints or enhancing wellbeing. The programs are mainly based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles and combine a variety of aspects, for instance, advice, weekly assignments, the option of keeping a diary and a forum to get in contact with others who have similar complaints. The self-help e-mental health interventions were developed by the Trimbos-institute. E-mental health programs have been shown to be effective at improving impaired mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and at enhancing wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>In the control arm, participants will fill out the baseline questionnaire; however, results of the screening-questionnaires will not be reported back to participants, and no further interventions will be advised at baseline. As compensation, participants in the control arm will receive their personal screening results together with a tailored choice for a self-help e-mental health intervention six months after baseline, which is identical to the intervention in the E-mental health arm at baseline.</p><p>For ethical reasons, a suicide-risk protocol is implemented in all study arms. Participants identified as being at high risk of suicide will receive immediate feedback on their self-reported suicide risk. They will be advised to seek help instantly, and they are asked to choose between either contacting their general practitioner or receiving an invitation for an urgent consultation with their OP.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Co-interventions</title><p>To our knowledge, no co-interventions on the organization or ward level aimed at mental health or work functioning improvement will be taking place in the medical center at the time of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Screening instruments used at baseline</title><sec><title>Impaired work functioning</title><p>Impaired work functioning will be measured using the job-specific Nurses Work Functioning Questionnaire (NWFQ) (G&#x000e4;rtner, Nieuwenhuijsen, van Dijk, Sluiter, unpublished). The NWFQ aims to measure impaired work functioning due to CMDs in nurses and allied health professionals. This 50-item self-report questionnaire consists of seven subscales: 1) <italic>cognitive aspects of task execution and general incidents</italic>; 2) <italic>impaired decision making</italic>; 3) <italic>causing incidents at work </italic>(not applicable for allied health professionals); 4) <italic>avoidance behavior</italic>; 5) <italic>conflicts and annoyances with colleagues</italic>; 6) <italic>impaired contact with patients and their family</italic>; and 7) <italic>lack of energy and motivation</italic>. Cronbach's alphas vary between 0.70 and 0.94. Response formats vary between 5-category and 7-category scales; however, the number of categories is the same for all items of one subscale. The content of the response scales varies between Likert-type scales (0 = <italic>totally disagree </italic>to 6 = <italic>totally agree</italic>; 0 <italic>= disagree </italic>to 4 = <italic>agree</italic>; 0 = <italic>no difficulty </italic>to 6 = <italic>great difficulty</italic>), relative frequency categories (0 = <italic>almost never </italic>to 6 = <italic>almost always</italic>; <italic>0 = almost never </italic>to 4 = <italic>almost always</italic>), and absolute frequency categories (0 = <italic>not once </italic>to 6 = <italic>in general more than once a day</italic>). Sum scores of the subscales range from 0-100. As yet, no validated cut-off scores exist for this fairly new questionnaire. Based on prior data of the study population (G&#x000e4;rtner, Nieuwenhuijsen, van Dijk, Sluiter, unpublished), cut-off values were calculated according to the following principle. Sumscores on the different subscales can lead to three categories: green, orange, and red. Therefore, two cut-off values are set, at the 67th percentile and at the 75th percentile of participants with mental health complaints. In two of the 7 subscales (subscale 2 and 4) the cut-off values for orange and red were identical due to little variation; in this case, cut-off values were set at the 75th and 85th percentiles of participants with mental health complaints. For the total NWFQ, a red score on one subscale or three or more orange scores will lead to case identification of impaired work functioning. In the prior dataset, this resulted in 31% of the total sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Distress</title><p>Distress will be measured with the distress subscale of the Four-Dimensional Symptoms Questionnaire (4DSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

Differences between the percentages of participants having sought formal help between the two study arms will be examined using a Chi-square test. For an increase of 17% with alpha = 0.05 (2-tailed) and a power of (1-beta) = 0.80, power calculation using the Nquery Advisor software results in 114 participants with mental health complaints for each of the two arms. Based on data from a prior study in this population (G&#x000e4;rtner, Nieuwenhuijsen, van Dijk, Sluiter, unpublished), we assume that 50% of the population will have impairments in either mental health, work functioning or both. Thus, for a comparison of workers screened positive in the control arm and the OP-care arm, 228 participants in each arm are necessary. Randomization will take place at the ward level; however, we do not expect any correlation between wards in the help-seeking behavior of their employees. Therefore, no inflation factor is used in the power calculation for Substudy 1 with the outcome measure help-seeking behavior. With an expected loss-to-follow-up of 10%, we must start the trial with N = 228/0.90 = 254 per condition at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Substudy 2</title><p>The trial is powered to detect a clinically significant effect, defined as at least 0.33 standard units when the (primary) outcome is transformed into a standardized effect size, also known as Cohen's d or the standardized mean difference.

We will conduct tests at alpha = 0.05 (2-tailed) and a power of (1-beta) = 0.80. Using Stata, it is shown that n = 145 per condition is required. For the primary outcome measure of this substudy, work functioning, no information on probable difference on ward-level exists. But as a precaution, we compensate for possible cluster effects introduced into the data because of randomization on ward-level. For cluster correction, we must multiply by a factor 1.3, which returns 145*1.3 = 189 per condition. Assuming a loss-to-follow-up of 10%, we must start the trial with N = 189/0.90 = 210 per condition at baseline.</p><p>In sum, the required minimum number of participants is 254 for the control arm, 254 for the intervention arm 2 (according to calculations for part 1) and 210 for the intervention arm 2 (according to calculations for Substudy 2); thus, in total, 718 participants are required for all three arms. We expect a response rate of about 45%; thus, 1596 employees must be invited to recruit the required 718 participants. As we will include 1731 employees, the source population is large enough to meet the needed sample size.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>In this controlled trial, cluster randomization will be performed at the ward level. The argumentation for cluster randomization is two-fold. First, it prevents contamination effects between participants working in the same department. Second, it is in accordance with the practice of WHS, which is usually conducted for all workers in a department. The randomization procedure will take place before the inclusion of the individual participants. In the randomization, we will stratify for ward size. Randomization will be performed using block randomization with three departments in each block. To guarantee concealment of allocation, the randomization will be performed by one researcher (KN) who is not involved in the practical recruitment of participating employers, using the computer software program Nquery Advisor.</p><p>Researchers, managers of participating departments and OPs will not be blinded for the group allocation. However, as we have a prerandomization procedure with incomplete-double-consent design without mentioning the use of a reference group in the experimental groups and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], the head (nurses) of wards and the individual employees will receive only information that is applicable to the study-arm of their wards.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The baseline data and data of the primary and secondary parameters will be presented using descriptive statistics.

In turn, in this sector, impaired mental health can have serious consequences for the workers and their patients. A WHS mental module might be an effective preventive action to promote and monitor good (mental) health and work performance in the aging workforce. The aim of the Mental Vitality @ Work study is to test the effectiveness of two strategies for a WHS mental module for nurses and allied health professionals. This paper describes the protocol for a three-arm RCT in which the effectiveness of the two strategies for a WHS mental module will be evaluated. First, the effect on help-seeking behavior for the OP-care arm compared to a control arm and, second, a comparison of the effect on work functioning for the E-mental health arm with the OP-care arm and the control arm. Additionally, an economic evaluation of both procedures will be evaluated from both a societal and employer perspective.</p><p>WHS is a well-developed strategic concept to protect workers against health risks and to monitor and enhance their work functioning. Mental modules for WHS have been developed in some sectors, e.g., the police sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In these studies, the identification of workers in need of health care intervention was solely based on the mental health status. The innovative aspect of our approach is that, in addition to screening for mental health problems, a screening for work functioning problems is carried out. The identification of work functioning problems in workers with mental health complaints yields input for the kind of intervention needed to enhance work functioning and to prevent more serious consequences such as incidents at work. In line with this, our approach differs from other mental health screenings in the work setting, because we will test the effectiveness of the WHS mental module both at enhancing work functioning and at improving mental health.</p><p>Another innovative aspect of our study is the included e-mental health interventions. Although the effects of e-mental health interventions on mental health outcomes appear promising, applying them in the context of WHS in a specific working population is a new approach. An advantage of this context is that the e-mental health intervention can be tailored to the mental health outcome of the screening that precedes the offered interventions.</p><sec><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>One strength of our RCT-design is the cluster randomization with pre-randomization. Applying a WHS procedure to a ward as a whole is not only in line with WHS in common occupational health service practice, but it also reduces contamination of employees. The pre-randomization approach allows blinding of participants for information of the other study arms. Still, contamination effects due to communication and occasional switching between wards cannot be ruled out completely, as the study is conducted in one organization.</p><p>One methodological issue to be considered regards our choice for not applying an inflation factor for cluster correction in Substudy 1. This choice is based on two arguments. First, we do not expect any systematic differences between the hospital wards in differences on health seeking behavior of their individual workers, which makes cluster correction illogical. Furthermore, we do not expect any noteworthy differences between the study arms in baseline characteristics, due to the large amount of clusters (N = 86). For work functioning, the primary outcome measure of Substudy 2, the possibility of systematic differences between the wards, is more likely. It is conceivable that improvement in work functioning, e.g., decision making, is more difficult for workers of one ward than workers of another ward, due to differences in work context. Therefore, a cluster correction is applied on Substudy 2.</p><p>We expect the external validity of this study to be high, as the study is encompassed in a real-life setting. Furthermore, in the set-up of the interventions, good feasibility is allowed for by using input of (nurse) managers and the occupational health service that provides the OP-care. The protocol for the OP consultations is developed based on interviews with the OPs and follows care as usual closely.</p></sec><sec><title>Impact of results</title><p>The output of the Mental Vitality @ Work study will be two-fold. First, two WHS mental modules for nurses and allied health professionals will be delivered. Based on results on the effectiveness together with results on the process evaluation, a WHS mental module for nurses and allied health professionals could be implemented and used on a regular basis by occupational health services in academic medical centers. A WHS mental module can be used as a stand-alone intervention or as part of a broader WHS program. With minor modifications, the module can be adapted to the context of other healthcare organizations.</p><p>Secondly, the proposed study will yield valuable knowledge on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a WHS mental module. If it is effective in terms of costs and improvement of adequate help-seeking, work functioning, and improved mental health, the procedure for a WHS mental module will possibly be used as a blue-print and contribute to the development of WHS mental modules in other sectors. It also might promote the use of WHS in the Netherlands. Results of the study will become available in 2012.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>CMD: Common Mental Disorders; OP: Occupational Physician; RCT: Randomized Controlled Trial; VAS: Visual Analogue Scale; WHS: Workers' Health Surveillance;</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FG contributed to the conception and design of the study and drafted the article.
