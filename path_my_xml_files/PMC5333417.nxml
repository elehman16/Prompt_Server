Partial body-weight supported treadmill training has become an established therapeutic treatment approach to address this demand. Further, new robotic rehabilitation technologies have increasingly been implemented in the clinical setting to allow for longer training sessions with increased step repetitions while maintaining a consistent movement pattern. But the current evidence about its clinical effectiveness in pediatric rehabilitation is weak. The aim of this research project is therefore to investigate the effectiveness of robot-assisted gait training on improvements of functional gait parameters in children with cerebral palsy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Children aged 6 to 18&#x000a0;years with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy who are able to walk at least 14 m with or without walking aids will be recruited in two pediatric therapy centers in Switzerland. Within a pragmatic cross-over design with randomized treatment sequences, they perform 5&#x000a0;weeks of robot-assisted gait training (three times per week with a maximum of 45&#x000a0;min walking time each) or a 5-week period of standard treatment, which is individually customized to the needs of the child and usually consists of 1&#x02013;2 sessions of physiotherapy per week and additional hippotherapy, circuit training as well as occupational therapy as necessary. Both interventions take place in an outpatient setting. The percentage score of the dimension E of the Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) as primary outcome as well as the dimension D of the GMFM-88, 6-minute and 10-meter walking tests as secondary outcomes are assessed before and at the end of each intervention period. Additionally, a 5-week follow-up assessment is scheduled for the children who are assigned to the standard treatment first. Treatment effects, period effects as well as follow-up effects are analyzed with paired analyses and independent test statistics are used to assess carry-over effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although robot-assisted gait training has become an established treatment option to address gait impairments, evidence for its effectiveness is vague.

Parents of children with CP value walking, especially &#x02018;correct&#x02019; walking, as a key component of their children&#x02019;s present and future well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Children with poorer walking abilities report a reduced physical well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Accordingly, acquiring, retaining or improving gait function in these children is often a main goal of the families and the rehabilitation team.</p><p>As training intensity, frequency, specificity and level of repetition with variation play a crucial role in promoting sensomotor learning in patients with disorders of the central nervous system, partial body-weight supported treadmill training (PBWSTT) has become an established therapeutic treatment approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although two or even three therapists may be needed in severely affected patients to support the movement of the legs and stabilize the pelvis and the trunk, PBWSTT takes an important role in gait rehabilitation of adult patients with a diagnosis of stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) or multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is also an increasing body of evidence that PBWSTT improves walking ability, speed and endurance in children, with most evidence being available for children with mild to moderate cerebral palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>To allow for longer training sessions with more repetitions while maintaining a consistent movement pattern and reducing the burden of the therapists, new robotic rehabilitation technologies have emerged during the last 15&#x000a0;years and have increasingly been implemented in the clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. With the addition of virtual reality (VR) scenarios, especially game-based VR, this type of training further offers the patients diversification, fun and challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One domain of rehabilitation robots involves driven gait orthoses (DGO) for robot-assisted gait training (RAGT), which have been originally developed for adults and subsequently adapted for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. One of these DGOs is the Lokomat (Hocoma AG, Volketswil, Switzerland, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which, by using the pediatric version, allows a training for children starting at an age of approximately 4&#x000a0;years.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Pediatric robot-assisted gait training with the Lokomat. The Lokomat automates gait therapy on a treadmill by two actuated leg orthoses, which can be individually adapted to the patient&#x02019;s legs and attached with three cuffs, while the patient is secured by means of a counter system with a harness providing partial body-weight support</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12887_2017_815_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>RAGT with the Lokomat appears to be effective in improving walking abilities in adult patients with stroke or iSCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A systematic review confirmed these results and showed limited evidence in patients with MS, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>In the last years, RAGT has also been tested and implemented in the pediatric neurorehabilitation setting and has been found to be a feasible and safe therapeutic option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, the current evidence about the clinical effectiveness of RAGT in pediatric populations is weak. Most published results derive from uncontrolled single case studies or case series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the few published controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] provide inconclusive results so far.</p><p>The aim of this research project is therefore to investigate the effectiveness of RAGT on improvements of functional gait parameters in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy in a pragmatic, randomized cross-over trial.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that a 5-week phase of RAGT on the Lokomat in an outpatient setting is superior with regard to the improvement in gait function measured with the dimension E of the Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) compared to a 5-week phase of standard treatment encompassing conventional physiotherapy lessons in children with spastic CP within a cross-over design with a randomized treatment sequence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The design of the study was developed in accordance with the current (2013) version of the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and the extensions of the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement for nonpharmacologic treatment interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] as well as for pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Written informed consent and assent is obtained from all the legal guardians and the child by the PI prior to participation.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and setting</title><p>This study is designed as a bicenter, single-blinded, pragmatic, randomized cross-over trial. It is carried out in the outpatient setting of the rehabilitation center of the Children&#x02019;s University Hospital Zurich in Affoltern am Albis and the Pediatric Therapy Center of the Reha Rheinfelden (Switzerland). Children are randomized to two different pre-specified sequences of interventions. The two interventions are RAGT (T) and usual care (C). A child can be randomized to a T/C sequence (TC-group) or to a C/T/C sequence (CTC-group).</p><p>The duration of study participation varies dependent on group allocation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>): Children allocated to the TC-group start with a first assessment, followed by a 5-week period of RAGT (T-sequence), a subsequent second assessment, a 5-week period of usual care (C-sequence) and a third assessment. Individual study participation will accordingly last 11&#x000a0;weeks for children in the TC-group with three assessment time points.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overview of the outcome measures and the measurement time points per group.

</p><p>In contrast to that, children allocated to the CTC-group start with an assessment followed by 5&#x000a0;weeks of usual care (C-sequence) and a subsequent second assessment. This is succeeded by a 5-week period of RAGT (T-sequence), a third assessment, another 5-week period of usual care (C-sequence) and a follow-up assessment. Thus, study participation for children assigned to the CTC-group lasts 16&#x000a0;weeks. The rationale for the differences in study duration and number of assessments between the study groups is that we want to reduce the burden for the children and their families as much as possible while still gaining information on the preservation of a potential effect at follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Children aged 6 to 18&#x000a0;years with the diagnosis of a bilateral di- or quadriplegic spastic CP and a Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level II-IV, who are able to walk at least 14 meters with or without walking aids, are eligible for study participation. Although we are aware that these criteria encompass a wide range of different motor abilities and developmental states, we consider it important that our study population represents the whole range we encounter in clinical practice. Further, they have to be able to follow instructions and communicate pain or discomfort.</p><p>Exclusion criteria are neurosurgery or orthopedic surgery on the lower extremity or trunk within the last 6&#x000a0;months, having participated in another Lokomat training regime within the previous 6&#x000a0;months as well as a change in concomitant treatment within the last 4&#x000a0;weeks before or during the study period. This holds true for all contraindications outlined in the Lokomat manufacturer&#x02019;s manual, as for example severe contractures (i.e. &#x0003e; 20&#x000b0; knee extension deficit, &#x0003e;40&#x000b0; hip extension deficit), bone fractures, open skin lesions or circulatory problems. Further criteria and their clinical implementation are described in a recently published paper by a Lokomat expert panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Patients are recruited by announcement in schools for children with special needs, in pediatric clinics and in outpatient pediatric physical therapy practices. Additionally, we will inform parents of children who have previously trained on the Lokomat and who fulfill the inclusion criteria about the study in a letter. Information about the study is also made available on the website of the two participating centers as well as of the association of Swiss pediatric physiotherapists. Families interested in participating can then take the initiative and contact one of the two rehabilitation centers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding</title><p>Randomization into the two groups with different intervention sequences is performed using a minimization method with a random factor of 0.9, including the factors severity of impairment (GMFCS-level II or III/IV), age (6&#x02013;11 years or 11&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years) and Botulinum Toxin A-treatment (present or absent) in the preceding 6&#x000a0;months. Minimization facilitates balancing even small groups in terms of selected patient factors at all stages of a trial. To ensure that group allocation is concealed for patients and their families as well as everyone who is involved at any stage of the trial, the randomization list is generated by a person not belonging to the study team on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.at/">www.randomizer.at</ext-link> and stored off site. Directly after inclusion of the patient the principal investigator (PI) seeks information about group allocation through a phone call or an e-mail. As soon as a child is allocated to one of the two groups, the assessments and trainings are planned according to the assigned intervention sequence, taking into account as much as possible the families&#x02019; requests and the school schedule of the child.</p><p>The rater of the primary outcome and parts of the secondary outcomes is blinded as the performance of the child in these tests is video recorded and scored by means of these videos with the rater being unaware of the date the video has been recorded. The same applies to the statistician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>RAGT (T-sequence)</title><p>Protocols for PBWSTT as well as RAGT in children are very heterogeneous so far. Session frequencies range from 2 to 5 times per week, session durations vary with most studies reporting 20 to 30&#x000a0;min of treadmill walking per session, and length of treatment varies from 2&#x000a0;weeks to 5&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As our training protocol prescribes the Lokomat training on an outpatient basis, we consider a session frequency of three times per week with a maximum of 45&#x000a0;min of effective walking time on the Lokomat as feasible and a treatment duration of 5&#x000a0;weeks as clinically adequate.</p><p>Trained and experienced therapists, who are used to working with children, perform the Lokomat trainings. The trainings are executed following recently published recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Virtual reality scenarios and other available motivating strategies are used in order to increase the child&#x02019;s adherence to the training. Body-weight support, gait speed as well as guidance force of the Lokomat are individually adjusted according to the child&#x02019;s abilities and modified within training sessions and during the course over time. To ensure that uniform standards are applied in both centers, a joint practical training session has been performed and the clinical training standards have been discussed beforehand.</p><p>Standard therapies can be continued during the intervention period, but should not include specific walking training and not be changed in frequency. Parents list the type as well as the dosage of concomitant therapy in a personal logbook.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Usual care (C-sequence)</title><p>Usual care normally comprises 1&#x02013;2 sessions of physiotherapy per week. Hippotherapy, circuit training as well as occupational therapy can also be elements of standard treatment. These therapies, which are individually customized to the needs of the child, are often implemented in the school setting. The content of the usual care treatment does not specifically address gait training, but rather consists of elements addressing range of motion, tone reduction, balance, activities of daily living, etc. Information about the type and dosage of all therapies is documented in a personal logbook by the parents. As the treatment in our study should represent usual care in clinical practice, we refrained from increasing the dosage for the usual care treatment to a comparable level as for the RAGT intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Descriptive parameters and measures describing the interventions</title><p>An overview of all outcome measures and measurement time points is provided in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p><p>To make sure that the therapists from both centers apply common standards, all performed measures have been thoroughly discussed and trained within and between the teams.</p><p>Descriptive and clinical data like diagnosis, walking aids, undergone operations, age, height and weight are recorded in order to describe the characteristics of the included patients. A description and quantification of the RAGT sessions is provided by various measures including the percentage of body weight support, gait speed, guidance force, distance walked and the number and duration of training sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The primary outcome measure is the percentage score of the dimension E (walking, running, jumping) of the Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88). It assesses the gross motor function with regard to walking ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The GMFM is a well-validated measurement tool for children with CP, which can be regarded as a gold standard for the assessment of gross motor function in children with CP. The dimension E consists of 24 items, each of which is scored on a 4-point ordinal scale. The children perform the test barefoot, or with shoes and orthoses, if orthoses are used when walking indoors in everyday life. The test is performed without walking aids, regardless of the children&#x02019;s GMFCS-level. A GMFM-certified therapist instructs the children while the test is simultaneously videotaped. These videos are later scored by a blinded rater, who is also a GMFM-certified therapist. The psychometric properties of the total GMFM-88 are well explored in children with CP. Nevertheless, information on single dimensions is rather sparse. There is limited positive evidence for the responsiveness of dimension E, while evidence on reliability is still unknown because of too little patients included in the reliability studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A recently published study showed that video rating is a reliable option for the dimensions E as well as D with ICCs of 0.992 and 0.965 for the agreement of life and video scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>GMFM dimension D</title><p>The percentage score of the dimension D (standing) of the GMFM-88 to assess the gross motor function with regard to standing ability.

Evidence for the test-retest reliability of the 6MinWT is moderate; its responsiveness has not been established in children with CP so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Ten-meter walking test</title><p>Gait speed is assessed with the 10-meter walking test (10MWT), which is performed on a 14-meter long track with the child using the walking aid usually used in daily life. The time needed for the middle 10 meters is measured with a stopwatch, allowing 2 meters for acceleration and deceleration each. The test is performed twice without a break. For the evaluation of fast speed (10MWTfast), the child is instructed to walk as fast as possible but without running, from the first to the last line. The faster out of two trials is used for further analysis. For self-selected speed (10MWTss) the child is instructed to walk in a normal, comfortable speed from the first to the last line and the mean of two trials is calculated. All gait tests are performed with orthoses and walking aids usually used in daily life. Evidence for test-retest reliability of the 10MWTfast is moderate in children with CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. To our knowledge, responsiveness of the 10MWTfast as well as psychometric properties of the 10MWTss has not yet been established in children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Measures of body function</title><p>Regarding the child&#x02019;s body function level, range of motion, modified Ashworth scores, and muscle strength by means of manual muscle testing are evaluated in flexion and extension of the hip, knee and ankle joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

The Helen Hayes marker set with 16 markers for the lower body, seven infrared Vicon MX cameras (Oxford Metrix Ltd., Oxford, UK) and two floor-mounted force platforms (AMTI OR 6-7-2000, Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., Watertown, MA, USA) are used for the 3DGA. The mean of six clean force plate strikes for each foot and each parameter of interest is calculated for further analysis to obtain a reliability level of at least 0.9 for each evaluated discrete gait parameter irrespective of the child&#x02019;s GMFCS level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Sample size and power calculation</title><p>A sample size calculation for a 2&#x000d7;2 cross-over design was performed.

Treatment effects, period effects as well as follow-up effects of the two different treatment interventions are analyzed with paired <italic>t</italic>-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for paired samples, with the treatment effect being our primary end-point. Unpaired two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for unpaired samples are used to determine whether carry-over effects are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals are presented with a two-tailed level of significance set at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.

It has become an established treatment option in these clinics to address gait impairments in the in- as well as outpatient setting despite the fact that evidence for its effectiveness is vague. As we want to determine the effects of RAGT as it is applied in the clinical setting, we designed this pragmatic trial. The pragmatic trial design allows to evaluate the effects of an intervention under the usual conditions in which it is applied, whereas explanatory trials determine the effects of an intervention under ideal circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Thorpe et al. defined a pragmatic-explanatory continuum, an instrument to determine the extent to which a trial can be viewed as pragmatic or explanatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Our trial addresses most domains at the rather pragmatic end of this continuum. We make concessions towards a more explanatory approach in two domains: Regarding the flexibility of the experimental design, we standardize frequency, timing and duration of the RAGT intervention and impose some restrictions regarding the co-interventions. A further domain concerns the primary outcome assessment: While we use the dimension E of the GMFM-88, which is a standard outcome in our clinics as well as for the assessment of gross motor functions in children with CP, we deviate from a clear pragmatic approach by videotaping the assessments and including an additional follow-up assessment. We are confident that the chosen trial design allows the evaluation of the effects of RAGT as it is implemented in the daily routine of our clinics, while keeping the additional burden for the participating children and their families as low as possible. This is also the reason why we perform the follow-up assessment only in one group. As participation in this trial still requires a considerable amount of time, we expect some difficulties in recruitment. The study is therefore carried out in two centers, namely the only two centers in Switzerland that offer a pediatric Lokomat training on a regular basis so far. In addition, we designed the study as a cross-over trial. The strength of this design is that each child receives both treatments, but in a random order. Thus, each patient can act as his or her own control requiring only half the number of patients needed in a parallel group design. As variation within a person is usually less than between patients the treatment effect can be estimated with higher precision despite smaller sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. On the other hand, a disadvantage of the cross-over design is the risk of possible carry-over effects, which means that the effect of the treatment in the first period has an effect that lasts into the second period. A carry-over effect leads to an underestimation of the effect of the treatment in the second period. By introducing a washout period between the different treatment periods, this risk could be reduced. Introducing a washout period would lead to an additional assessment. In order to reduce the load of the participants to a minimum we abstained from a washout period being aware that this might influence our results.</p><p>Although the 5-week follow-up period is rather short, we opted for this time frame because of the increasing risk of confounding factors that is accompanied by a long time interval due to growth, new therapy approaches, illness, operations, increased school load etc.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>August 2009 - November 2018.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>10MWTfast</term><def><p>10-meter walking test fast speed</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>10MWTss</term><def><p>10-meter walking test at self-selected speed</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>3DGA</term><def><p>3-dimensional gait analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>6MinWT</term><def><p>6-minute walking test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CP</term><def><p>Cerebral palsy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DGO</term><def><p>Driven gait orthosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMFCS</term><def><p>Gross Motor Function Classification System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMFM</term><def><p>Gross Motor Function Measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iSCI</term><def><p>Incomplete spinal cord injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MS</term><def><p>Multiple sclerosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBWSTT</term><def><p>Partial body-weight supported treadmill training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD</term><def><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p>Principal investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAGT</term><def><p>Robot-assisted gait training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBI</term><def><p>Traumatic brain injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VR</term><def><p>Virtual reality</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the physiotherapists at the rehabilitation center of the Children&#x02019;s University Hospital Zurich in Affoltern am Albis and the Pediatric Therapy Center of the Reha Rheinfelden for their help regarding the execution of assessments and trainings.
