It only highlights the widespread failure to use treatments that have been known for many years. However, there has been a decline in the case fatality rate with the use of standardized protocol for the treatment of severely malnourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This standardized protocol prepared by World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] addressed overall management of severely malnourished children compiling the existing recommended treatment guidelines such as appropriate rehydration, infection control, appropriate feeding and micronutrient supplementation. But, there is a scope of further reducing the case fatality rate and enhance recovery from malnutrition by improving the treatment of common associated illnesses such as diarrhoea. Malnutrition predisposes to increased incidence and duration of illnesses, as well as to increased prevalence of prolonged illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since diarrhoea is associated with further loss of weight and deficiency of macro- and micronutrients, early recovery along with lessening of diarrhoea severity will help to prevent further weight loss and deficiency of these nutrients in severely malnourished children. Additionally, severely malnourished children have depleted potassium stores, and diarrhoea further depletes the serum potassium concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Early recovery from diarrhoea will prevent further deficits of serum potassium concentration and total body stores.</p><p>Current recommended ORS containing salts and glucose is effective in correcting dehydration even in severely malnourished children. Efforts have been made to further improve the efficacy of ORS in terms of reducing the duration of diarrhoea and stool output. One study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with WHO-ORS containing partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) and another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] PHGG supplemented comminuted chicken diet have shown to reduce diarrhoea duration and stool output in children with acute and persistent diarrhoea, respectively. PHGG is a soluble fiber and its addition doesn&#x02019;t alter the clarity of the solution, neither its taste. PHGG is produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of guar gum which is obtained from guar seed- one variety of legumes for use as a food additive and as a source of dietary fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The added PHGG in the ORS or diet escapes digestion in the small intestine and enter into the colon where the fibers are expected to be fermented by colonic bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. SCFAs will stimulate sodium and water absorption in the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] leading to early recovery from diarrhoea. In addition, SCFAs have trophic effect in the colonic mucosa, which utilize SCFAs as fuel thus enhancing nutritional recovery.</p><p>We hypothesized that the addition of PHGG to ORS will enhance recovery from diarrhoea and malnutrition of the severely malnourished children with acute diarrhoea. In this study we have used the current WHO/UNICEF recommended ORS formulation (Na<sup>+</sup> 75) with increased concentration of potassium (K<sup>+</sup> 40) for a better alternative in the management of severely malnourished children with watery diarrhoea in terms of correcting hypokalemia and preventing symptomatic hyponatraemia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of (i) modified WHO ORS plus PHGG (Currently WHO recommended ORS with some modification, Na 75&#x000a0;mmol/L, Cl 87&#x000a0;mmol/L, K 40&#x000a0;mmol/L, citrate 7&#x000a0;mmol/L, Mg 3&#x000a0;mmol/L, Zn 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L, Cu 45&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L, glucose 90&#x000a0;mmol/L) plus PHGG 15&#x000a0;mmol/L - Study group) compared with ii) modified WHO ORS (Na 75&#x000a0;mmol/L, Cl 87&#x000a0;mmol/L, K 40&#x000a0;mmol/L, citrate 7&#x000a0;mmol/L, Mg 3&#x000a0;mmol/L, Zn 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L, Cu 45&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L, glucose 90&#x000a0;mmol/L without PHGG - control group) in the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in children with severe malnutrition. The calculated osmolarity was 302&#x000a0;mosmol/L for both the solutions, because the PHGG does not change the osmolarity. The study was conducted at the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b) from July 2007 to December 2009.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>Children of either sex, aged 6&#x000a0;months to 36&#x000a0;months, presenting with acute watery diarrhoea (defined as 3 or more watery stool for 24&#x000a0;hours) of &#x0003c;7&#x000a0;days duration, some or severe dehydration, weight for length&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;3 Z-score/weight for age&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;3 Z- score, were eligible for the study. The children with bloody diarrhoea, severe diseases (severe sepsis, meningitis, severe pneumonia with respiratory distress requiring intensive care and ancillary support such as O<sub>2</sub> inhalation, oropharyngeal suction etc.) were excluded from the study.

An experienced statistician at icddr,b, not involved in the study, prepared the randomization list using the randomization table. The name of intervention was indicated on a slip of paper, kept inside the sealed envelope. The sealed envelopes were supplied to the pharmacists of Dhaka Hospital, not involved in the study in any way, to prepare the solutions, which were identical in appearance and similar in taste. They labeled the bottles with the assigned random number, patient&#x02019;s name, and hospital registration number and handed them over to the study staff for ready to drink. PHGG is a white powder completely soluble in water and does not make the change of color and taste of the solution at the concentration used in oral rehydration solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. After 12&#x000a0;hours, unused ORS was measured and discarded and a fresh bottle of ORS was prepared for continuation of therapy, if required. Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) was continued until resolution of diarrhoea but up to a maximum of 7&#x000a0;days. The children with some dehydration was randomized immediately after admission and children with severe dehydration were given intravenous (IV) fluid immediately after admission and was randomized as soon as the child was out of hypovolaemic shock (improvement of alertness, able to drink and countable radial pulse) and the signs of severe dehydration has disappeared but not later than 4&#x000a0;hours. After 4&#x000a0;hours, if the children still have signs of severe dehydration were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Baseline information</title><p>Children fulfilling the eligibility criteria were admitted to the Research Ward of the Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b and stayed in the hospital throughout the study period until discharged.

Dehydration was assessed according to the modified WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] followed in the hospital. In children with some dehydration, the fluid deficit was corrected with the assigned ORS in an amount 10&#x000a0;ml/kg/hour for the first two hours, then 5&#x000a0;ml/kg/hr until the deficit was corrected. In addition, ongoing stool losses were replaced with the assigned ORS 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;ml/kg after each watery stool. For high purging patient, the ORS intake was adjusted according to the on going stool loss. ORS therapy was continued until diarrhoea ceased. Children with severe dehydration were initially rehydrated with IV fluid (Cholera Saline containing Na 133&#x000a0;mmol/L, Cl 98&#x000a0;mmol/L, K 13&#x000a0;mmol/L, acetate equivalent to HCO3 48&#x000a0;mmol/L) until the patient was out of hypovolaemic shock (shock in these children was identified by altered consciousness/ lethargy, cold, clammy hands and feet, uncountable or absent radial pulse etc.) or disappearance of signs of severe dehydration. Then the rest of the rehydration was performed with ORS as for rehydration in patients with some dehydration, as described above. Children without apparent extra-intestinal infection received Injection ampicillin 100&#x000a0;mg/kg/24&#x000a0;h in 3 divided doses and Injection gentamicin 5&#x000a0;mg/kg/24&#x000a0;h in 2 divided doses for 5&#x000a0;days (as per protocol for management of children with severe malnutrition in icddrb and WHO). Children with lower respiratory tract infection received Injection Ceftriaxone 75&#x000a0;mg /kg/day for 5&#x000a0;days, and those with cholera initially diagnosed by positive Dark-field microscopy received syrup Azithromycin 20&#x000a0;mg/kg once within 20&#x000a0;minutes of randomization.</p><p>Mothers were advised to continue breastfeeding. Supplementary feeding with a locally prepared therapeutic diet of formula milk (cow&#x02019;s milk, rice powder mixture, energy 70&#x000a0;kcal/100&#x000a0;ml) was given in an amount of 10&#x000a0;ml/kg for each feed two hourly for day 1 and increased slowly up to 150 Kcal/kg/day over 7&#x000a0;days according to demand. If the child had poor appetite, or was weak, or had painful stomatitis or glossitis, food was delivered through nasogastric tube until able to take food orally.

Nude body weight was measured at admission, after rehydration and every 6&#x000a0;hours until recovery from diarrhoea and then at the end of every 24&#x000a0;hours and at discharge. Clinical evaluation was performed every morning and evening. Resolution of diarrhoea was defined as the passage of two consecutive soft/formed stool or no stool for 12&#x000a0;hours. Therapeutic success was defined as the cessation diarrhoea within 7&#x000a0;days of inclusion in the study treatment. Duration of diarrhoea was calculated in hours from the time of randomization to the last watery or loose stool within 7&#x000a0;days. Children were considered withdrawn from the study if their parents or legal guardian withdrew consent, or transferred to other units of the hospital for treatment of any complications; data (intakes and outputs) of such patients up to the time of withdrawal were included in the analysis (intent to treat analysis). Data of the children who failed to recover within seven days (study period) were also included in the analysis for a maximum of seven days; those were labeled as therapeutic failures and were treated in the hospital until recovery. All patients after cessation of diarrhoea and control of other associated infection were transferred to nutrition rehabilitation unit.

So, 52 patients in the study group and 54 in control group were included for analysis (per protocol analysis) for comparison of duration to attain 80% of the median weight for length without edema.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41043_2015_3_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Baseline clinical characteristics such as age, body weight, nutritional status, duration of diarrhoea, dehydration status, breastfeeding status, and biochemical parameters, stool pathogen etc. were comparable between the treatment groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The mean duration of diarrhoea (h) was significantly shorter in children of the study group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) compared with children of the control group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Similar results were also reported when PHGG added ORS was used in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in non severely malnourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], PHGG added comminuted chicken meat diet used in the treatment of persistent diarrhoea in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and PHGG added ORS used in the treatment of adult cholera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It has also been shown that PHGG added ORS in this study enhanced weight gain. So, the findings of the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and current study demonstrate that the beneficial effects of PHGG in the treatment of acute or persistent diarrhoea are consistent. It has also been shown beneficial effect of other unabsorbed carbohydrates (amylase resistant starch derived from maize) added ORS in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children and adult cholera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In Bangladesh, soluble fiber containing fruits (such as green plantain and semi ripe wood apple) are traditionally used as an anti-diarrhoeal food, with an expectation of beneficial effect in recovery. Recently one clinical study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in icddr,b examined the effect of cooked green banana (one variety used in Bangladesh as a vegetable) and pectin in the treatment of persistent diarrhoea in children. Both pectin and green banana have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of persistent diarrhoea in children in terms of reducing the duration of diarrhoea and stool weight. Similar results have also been found in a community based trial, with green banana-supplemented diet in the home-management of acute (&#x02264;7&#x000a0;days duration) and prolonged (&#x0003e;7&#x000a0;days duration) diarrhoea in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The anti-diarrhoeal effect of soluble fiber/unabsorbed carbohydrate is thought to be mediated through their bacterial fermentation in colon, resulting in production of SCFAs. In the colon SCFAs facilitate absorption of sodium chloride and water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], they also serve as an important source of energy for the colonocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and stimulate epithelial cell proliferation and exert a trophic effect on the colonic as well as small bowel mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The major limitation of the study was accuracy in collecting stool from female children. There might be some contamination of urine with stool. Careful recording of contamination was not possible. However, the distribution of female children in both the groups was similar in number due to the proper randomization effect that might take care for the comparability of the stool weight between the two groups. Other limitation of the study was that the stool test for diarrhoeagenic <italic>Eschericia coli</italic> was not performed and so majority of the unidentified pathogen in stool test might be diarrhoeagenic <italic>Eschericia coli.</italic> However, that should not influence the study results.</p><p>Despite the efficacy of ORS in correcting dehydration and preventing mortality that has already been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], its use has not yet achieved the widespread popularity, as it was initially expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Although this may be due to the lack of knowledge and appreciation of the effect of ORS, caregivers/parents in the community have been reluctant to use ORS as it does not substantially reduce diarrhoea. So, the present study was one of the efforts to find out an improved version of ORS that will reduce diarrhoea. To find out the best effective amylase resistant and fermentable carbohydrates for use in ORS, more clinical studies are to be carried out in future. Further more research on the issue of improved version of ORS should continue.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors' contribution</bold></p><p>NHA, SI, MKO, NG and RM conceived and designed the study.
