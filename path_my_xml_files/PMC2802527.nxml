 to have a delay of several weeks in the onset of their clinical antidepressant
 effects. Recent meta-analyses suggest, however, that antidepressants may have
 a much earlier therapeutic onset than originally
 thought.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
 This notion of early-onset antidepressant effects is supported by a series of
 studies in our laboratory demonstrating measurable psychological effects
 following acute and short-term administration of antidepressant agents to
 healthy
 volunteers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
 One of the most striking features of these findings is that these changes
 occur well before the purported onset of the therapeutic effects of
 antidepressants. Both depression and anxiety disorders have been associated
 with hyperactivity of the amygdala and converging evidence demonstrates that
 one mechanism by which SSRIs may exert their action is by constraining such
 overactivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
 A recent report of decreased amygdala responses to aversive facial expressions
 following acute intravenous citalopram administration to healthy male
 volunteers intriguingly suggests that modulating amygdala reactivity may be an
 immediate effect of SSRI
 administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
 However, interpretation of the clinical implications of this finding is
 problematic since intravenous SSRI administration is not typically used in the
 treatment of patients. The present study therefore investigated whether a
 single oral dose of the SSRI citalopram would have similar effects on the
 amygdala response to emotional faces in healthy volunteers. Given the likely
 role of the amygdala in the eventual therapeutic action of SSRIs, a decrease
 in amygdala reactivity to threat following a single dose of citalopram
 administered in the form and dose in which it would typically be given to
 patients would lend support to the notion of an early onset of therapeutically
 relevant antidepressant effects.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-six right-handed healthy volunteers (13 women and 13 men) aged
 19&#x02013;30 years took part in this study. Volunteers were recruited using
 adverts in university departments and screened through a medical examination
 and a psychiatric interview using the Structured Clinical Interview for
 DSM&#x02013;IV Axis I
 disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
 Exclusion criteria were: history of psychiatric disorder (including anxiety
 disorders, depression, eating disorders, psychosis and substance misuse); any
 significant medical condition (including migraine, diabetes, epilepsy and
 hypertension); pregnancy; current medication (excluding the contraceptive
 pill); or first-degree family history of bipolar disorder. Functional magnetic
 resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning also required the following exclusion
 criteria: cardiac pacemaker; mechanical heart valve; or any other mechanical
 implants. All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision. All
 participants gave their written consent to participate in the study, which was
 approved by the local ethics committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>Participants were randomised to receive a single oral dose of citalopram

 fearful, happy and neutral facial expressions was used to assess the effect of
 citalopram on the neural response to implicit and explicit threatening
 stimuli. The facial stimuli were taken from Ekman &#x00026; Friesen's <italic>Pictures
 of Facial Affect</italic>
 series.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> In the
 masked condition, fearful, happy and neutral faces were presented for 17 ms
 and immediately followed by a neutral face presented for 183 ms. In the
 unmasked condition, fearful, happy and neutral faces were presented in
 isolation for 200 ms. On each trial, participants were required to judge and
 report (via a button press) the gender of the face. In the masked condition,
 the gender of the target and the mask was always the same. The task consisted
 of four 20 s blocks of each of the six conditions (masked fearful, masked
 happy, masked neutral, unmasked fearful, unmasked happy and unmasked neutral)
 and there were ten faces/face-mask pairs presented per block. Between each
 block and at the start and end of the task, there was a 20 s baseline fixation
 block, where participants were simply asked to stare at a fixation point on an
 otherwise blank screen. Blocks were presented in a random order.</p><p>Following the faces task, a visual checkerboard task was used to control
 for a possible confounding effect of global drug-related modulation of the
 blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, by assessing the effect of
 citalopram on BOLD signal in the primary visual cortex. This was a passive
 visual task where the participants viewed two alternating configurations of
 black and white squares that switched at a frequency of 8 Hz. Stimuli were
 presented in a block design with 15 s blocks of stimulation alternating
 periodically with 15 s blocks of a stationary fixation cross. In all, 20
 cycles of visual stimulation/fixation were presented, lasting 5 min in total.
 Participants were instructed to lie quietly with their eyes open throughout
 the experiment.</p><p>Following the fMRI scan, volunteers were given a full facial expression
 recognition test, featuring examples of six emotions (fear, happiness,
 sadness, surprise, anger and disgust). The face stimuli were also taken from
 the Ekman &#x00026; Friesen's
 series<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> but there
 was no overlap with the stimuli used in the fMRI task. Each prototype had been
 averaged between full emotion and neutral in 10% steps using computer graphic
 techniques (see Harmer <italic>et
 al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> for more
 details). There were four examples of each emotion presented at ten different
 intensity levels, giving a total of 40 stimuli per emotion. Each face was also
 given in a neutral expression, giving a total of 250 stimuli presentations.
 Face stimuli were presented for 500 ms and replaced by a blank screen.
 Volunteers were asked to indicate which expression they thought the face
 depicted by pressing a labelled key on the keyboard.</p></sec><sec><title>Imaging data acquisition</title><p>All imaging data were collected using a Siemens Sonata scanner operating at
 1.5 T, located at the Oxford Centre for Clinical Magnetic Resonance Research.
 For the faces task, functional imaging consisted of 24
 <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>-weighted echo-planar image slices
 (repetition time (TR) = 3000 ms, echo time (TE) = 54 ms, 128&#x000d7;128
 matrix), 1.5&#x000d7;1.5&#x000d7;4.5 mm voxels. For the visual stimulation
 paradigm, functional imaging consisted of 35
 <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>-weighted echo-planar image slices (TR =
 3000 ms, TE = 50 ms, 64&#x000d7;64 matrix), 3 mm isotropic voxels. To facilitate
 later co-registration of the fMRI data into standard space, we also acquired a
 Turbo FLASH sequence (TR = 12 ms, TE = 5.65 ms), 1 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel size.
 The first two echo-planar image volumes in each session were discarded to
 avoid <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> equilibrium effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Imaging data analysis</title><p>Imaging data were preprocessed and analysed using FEAT (FMRI Expert

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>).
 The following pre-statistics processing was applied: motion correction using
 FMIRB's linear image registration tool
 (MCFLIRT);<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
 non-brain removal using the Brain Extraction
 Tool;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> spatial
 smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of full width half maximum 5 mm; mean-based
 intensity normalisation of all volumes by the same factor; highpass temporal
 filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with sigma =
 50.0 s). Registration to high resolution images and to a standard template
 (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 stereotactic template) was carried
 out using
 FLIRT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></p><p>Six experimental conditions were modelled: maskedunmasked fear,
 masked/unmasked happy and masked/unmasked neutral. Each condition was modelled
 separately by convolving trials with a canonical haemodynamic response
 function. Temporal derivatives were included as covariates of no interest to
 increase statistical sensitivity. All analyses were performed at the group
 level using mixed-effects
 analyses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
 <italic>Z</italic> (Gaussianised <italic>T</italic>) statistical images were thresholded using

 space.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></p><p>For the faces task, the neural responses in the control blocks were
 subtracted from those in the active blocks in the placebo group to reveal the
 main effect of the task. The active minus control comparisons were: masked
 fearful facial expression minus masked neutral facial expression; unmasked
 fearful facial expression minus unmasked neutral facial expression; masked
 happy facial expression minus masked neutral facial expression; unmasked happy
 facial expression minus unmasked neutral facial expression. For those regions
 with a significant main effect of task, the percentage BOLD signal change for
 each contrast was calculated in order to identify the profile of drug effect.
 This analysis method of assessing differences in activation patterns between
 the drug and placebo groups within a task-specific context has been used in
 previous pharmacological fMRI studies in healthy volunteers (e.g. Del-Ben
 <italic>et
 al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>).</p><p>For the visual checkerboard task, a region of occipital cortex activated by
 the task (compared with baseline) was identified. The percentage BOLD signal
 change was extracted for this region and compared between the citalopram and
 placebo groups using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with drug group as
 the between-participants factor (two levels: citalopram, placebo). Any effect
 of citalopram in this region would suggest a global drug effect on baseline
 cerebral haemodynamics or neural coupling.</p><p>Two participants' data (both in the placebo group) were excluded from the
 fMRI analysis. In one participant there was a fault in the high resolution
 structural image and in the other, a cerebellar cyst was identified on the
 structural scan. Thus, the fMRI analysis included 24 participants (13
 citalopram, 11 placebo).</p><p>Subjective ratings and behavioural data were analysed using a repeated
 measures ANOVA model. Significant interactions were further corroborated using
 independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subjective ratings</title><p>A single oral dose of citalopram in healthy volunteers did not
 significantly affect ratings of mood, anxiety or energy on the subjective
 rating scales used (all comparisons with placebo <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.15).</p></sec><sec><title>Imaging data</title><sec><title>Main effect of task</title><p>The main effect of task in the placebo group revealed significantly greater
 responses to the unmasked fear stimuli compared with the unmasked neutral
 stimuli in the right amygdala (peak cluster activation MNI coordinates:

 gyrus (peak cluster activation MNI coordinates: <italic>x</italic> =0, <italic>y</italic> =
 36, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02013;22). There were no main effects of task in the placebo
 group for the unmasked happy <italic>v</italic>. unmasked neutral contrast, or for the

 neutral contrasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of citalopram administration</title><p>In order to examine the effect of citalopram on the neural response to

 cluster, there was a significant interaction between drug group and facial
 expression (F(2,44) = 11.867, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) in the unmasked condition.
 This group &#x000d7; expression interaction was further corroborated by

 significantly decreased activation in the citalopram group to fearful facial
 expressions (<italic>t</italic>(22) = &#x02013;3.467, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) but no
 significant differences between groups to happy or neutral facial expressions
 in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). There
 was no significant main effect of drug group and no significant interaction
 with facial expression in the medial frontal gyrus cluster for the unmasked

 no significant effects of drug group on percentage BOLD signal change in this
 region of occipital cortex during visual stimulation (<italic>F</italic>(1,23) =
 0.651, <italic>P</italic> = 0.4), suggesting that the observed effects during face
 processing did not reflect global haemodynamic changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioural measures</title><p>To assess how the modification of neural responses by citalopram may relate
 to behavioural responses, we assessed facial expression recognition after the

 interaction between treatment group and facial expression in accuracy of
 facial expression recognition (<italic>F</italic>(6,144) = 2.265, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04).
 This was further corroborated using independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests for
 each expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>),
 which revealed that recognition of happy expressions was significantly
 increased in the citalopram group compared with the placebo group
 (<italic>t</italic>(24) = 2.057, <italic>P</italic> = 0.05). The recognition of disgust was
 conversely marginally decreased in the citalopram group compared with the

 significant main effect of treatment group or significant treatment group

 SSRI on the amygdala response to threat. Despite the lack of subjective mood
 effects, participants treated with a single dose of citalopram displayed a
 significantly reduced amygdala response to fearful facial expressions compared
 with placebo. Such a finding lends support to the notion that antidepressants
 may have an earlier onset of therapeutically relevant action than
 conventionally thought.</p><sec><title>Effect of citalopram on amygdala function</title><p>The processing of emotional stimuli is known to be aberrant in mood
 disorders such as depression and anxiety, with increased negative and
 threat-relevant processing. For example, patients vulnerable to depression
 show increased recognition of fearful facial
 expressions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> and
 heightened anxiety has been shown to be associated with increased attentional
 orienting to threat-related
 stimuli.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> The
 amygdala is known to be involved in the processing of emotional stimuli and in
 particular the rapid detection of threat-relevant cues such as fearful facial
 expressions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
 Consistent with these cognitive effects, neuroimaging studies of depression
 and anxiety disorders have reported hyperactivity in the amygdala both at
 rest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> and in
 response to presentations of emotional facial
 expressions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></p><p>The current study is consistent with a body of evidence that suggests that
 a key action of antidepressant drugs involves constraining such overactivity
 in the amygdala. In line with this, preclinical studies have shown that
 serotonin has an inhibitory effect on amygdala
 function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
 Clinical studies have also demonstrated that effective antidepressant
 treatment is associated with decreased resting amygdala
 metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref> and
 decreased amygdala response to emotionally valenced
 material.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
 Further support for a central role of the amygdala in antidepressant action
 comes from studies of healthy volunteers, which allow the direct action of the
 antidepressant to be examined unconfounded by symptom remission or mood
 change. To date, two such studies have shown a decrease in amygdala
 responsivity to aversive facial expressions following 7 days of treatment with
 citalopram<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> and
 acute intravenous
 citalopram,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
 suggesting that the effects on the amygdala may represent a direct action of
 the SSRI. Our finding of decreased amygdala reactivity to fearful facial
 expressions following a single oral dose of citalopram extends and strengthens
 this idea.</p></sec><sec><title>Acute effects of SSRIs</title><p>Paradoxically, the acute behavioural effects of serotonergic
 antidepressants can be opposite to those seen following chronic treatment. In
 particular, anxiety symptoms are often exacerbated early in SSRI treatment,
 before the therapeutic effects
 emerge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref> A
 reversal of action from acute to repeated administration of SSRIs has been
 demonstrated in animal models of anxiety, with an increase in auditory fear
 conditioning following acute administration of citalopram and a decrease
 following repeated (21 day)
 administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
 Similarly in healthy human volunteers, acute administration of citalopram
 increases the recognition of fearful facial expressions and the
 emotion-potentiated
 startle,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
 whereas repeated administration is associated with decreases on both of these
 measures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>Given that fear conditioning, the processing of threatening facial
 expressions and the emotion-potentiated startle response have all been shown
 to critically involve the amygdala, it has been previously hypothesised that
 increased activity in this structure might underpin the acute anxiogenic
 effects of
 SSRIs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
 However, the present study and the one previous study reporting reduced
 amygdala activation following acute
 citalopram<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> do not
 support this notion, suggesting that the amygdala may not be the locus of the
 acute anxiogenic effects of SSRIs.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that these adverse acute effects of SSRIs
 only affect a subset of patients clinically and the effects of acute
 manipulations of serotonin have been shown to be dependent on a number of
 factors such as
 gender<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref> and
 genotype.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> This
 raises the possibility that the amygdala may be involved in the acute
 anxiogenic effects of SSRIs but that the sample used in the current study were
 not susceptible to such an anxiogenic effect. Consistent with this hypothesis,
 the citalopram group showed the expected increase in the recognition of happy
 facial expressions on the behavioural facial expression recognition task but,
 unlike participants in a number of previous studies of acute serotonergic
 manipulation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>
 they did not show an increase in the recognition of fearful facial
 expressions. Although this may be due to the reduced sensitivity of this
 measure as a result of habituation effects resulting from repeated exposure to
 fearful faces during the fMRI scan, the involvement of the amygdala in the
 acute anxiogenic effect of SSRIs remains unresolved. Future studies are needed
 to examine the reactivity of the amygdala to threatening stimuli in those
 individuals who demonstrate a measurable behavioural increase in fear
 processing in response to acute SSRI treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Amygdala response to masked emotional faces</title><p>Repeated administration of citalopram to healthy volunteers has previously
 been shown to reduce the amygdala response to fearful faces when they are
 presented in a backwardly masked
 paradigm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> In
 contrast, in the present study there was no significant effect of acute
 citalopram on the amygdala response to masked fearful or happy faces. However,
 caution must be exercised in the interpretation of this lack of drug effect in
 the masked condition. In the placebo group, the amygdala response was not
 increased to masked fearful relative to neutral or happy facial expressions,
 which is inconsistent with
 some<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref> but not
 all<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref> previous
 findings. The amygdala response to masked fearful facial expressions appears
 to be a variable effect which is sensitive to individual variation in factors
 such as state
 anxiety<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref> and also
 the processing load of the
 task.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref> In the
 absence of the basic main effect of the task, it is not possible to draw
 conclusions about the effect of acute citalopram on non-conscious processing
 of threat.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacological fMRI</title><p>The use of BOLD fMRI to investigate the pharmacological modulation of brain
 activity by psychoactive drugs is a growing area of
 research.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>
 However, in such studies it must be considered whether pharmacological
 modulations of the BOLD signal reflect global influences on neurovascular
 coupling, rather than specific modulations of neural activity. For example,
 changes in the BOLD signal following drug administration could reflect
 influences of the drug not only on neural activity, but also on the synaptic
 and metabolic signalling to the blood vessels that control the cerebral blood
 flow responses, as well as the reactivity of the cerebral vasculature. One
 method that is often used to control for such non-specific global modulations
 of signalling or vasculature reactivity by the drug is the inclusion of a
 control task to assess the BOLD response in a region that is not expected to
 be modulated by the drug, such as the visual stimulation paradigm used in this
 study. Using this paradigm, it was found that citalopram has no significant
 effect on the BOLD signal change in the occipital region activated by this
 task, which suggests that global vascular effects of the drug cannot account
 for the presence of citalopram-mediated modulations of the BOLD response to
 threat-related stimuli. However, it is important to note that such a control
 task does not preclude the possibility of non-specific effects that are
 restricted to the regions that are engaged by the main task of
 interest.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref> Future
 studies employing perfusion methodologies for comparison of absolute values of
 blood flow during baseline conditions are needed to address this issue
 further.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>The present study demonstrates that SSRIs have immediate and discernable
 effects on neural circuitry that appear to be important in their eventual
 therapeutic action. This mirrors previous behavioural findings that
 demonstrate measurable psychological changes following a single dose of an
 antidepressant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> and
 suggests that altered processing of emotionally valenced stimuli may represent
 an important mechanism through which antidepressants eventually exert their
 clinical effects on subjective mood. It is possible that the rapid reduction
 in amygdala activity by antidepressant drugs is an important mechanism for
 subsequent clinical antidepressant effects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This research was funded by a <funding-source>Wellcome Trust
