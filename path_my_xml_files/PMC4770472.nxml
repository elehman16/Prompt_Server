Thus, the duration of anesthesia and its complications are very important in the recovery room.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Agitation is one of the important issues that occur in the process of children's recovery which has no clear reason. It depends on factors such as age, type of surgery, duration of anesthesia, pharmaceutical interference, pain, type of anesthetic agent, preoperative anxiety, early recovery, and their mood and temper.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In addition to the type of treatment and underlying diseases, the anesthetic agent affects the time and complications of recovery; therefore, it should be chosen carefully based on the patient's conditions. Safety, high effectiveness rate, fast recovery, and low complication rate are the significant characteristics of a proper anesthetic agent.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Propofol is a short-acting intravenous anesthetic agent which acts by increasing the function of g-aminobutyric acid type A receptor.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Its advantage is the quick effect, and its complications can be the pain during injection, cough, convulsion, seizure, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, restlessness or agitation, nausea, and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Isoflurane is one of the most common inhalant anesthetic agents used to maintain a deep anesthesia, and its required dose decreases with the patient's age. Hence, it should be used carefully and monitored continuously.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Of its complications are hypotension, tachycardia, and delayed recovery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Bispectoral index (BIS) is a noninvasive marker of the depth of anesthesia based on electroencephalography assessment.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Based on the depth of anesthesia, BIS is scaled from 0 to 100. In conscious patients, the score is between 90 and 100 while it is zero for the inactivity of the cortical part of the brain.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In order to maintain an individual in general anesthesia, BIS should be between 44 and 60.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] BIS monitoring is a simple way to prevent unwanted increases in the concentration of the anesthetic agent, which leads to fast effect and short recovery.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Considering the increasing need for general anesthesia in pediatric dentistry and complications of various anesthetic agents, this study was conducted to determine the relation between the values ofBIS during dental treatment and recovery conditions in children receiving either of two regimes of elective anesthesia with propofol and isoflurane. The null hypothesis was: There is no significant difference between BIS scores of individuals who receive propofol and those who receive isoflurane.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved under IRCT2013032212848N1 by System for Clinical Trials.</p><p>In this single-blind clinical trial, a total of 57-healthy children American Society of Anesthesiologists I with age range of 4 to 7 years who had been referred for dental treatment (pulpotomy, stainless steel crown and extraction) under general anesthesia and needed some anesthesia time between 60 and 90 min were selected by convenience sampling, after obtaining written consents from their parents to enter the study. The significance level was decided at 90% and &#x003b1; = 0.05. Patients who had been exposed to sedative or analgesic medicines before surgery and seven patients whose time schedule did not match with that of the study were excluded. In this study, no medical complications were observed during the anesthesia administration. The patients were given codes, randomly assigned to two similar groups and their data were evaluated confidentially by a single-blind method. In both groups, the patients were intubated, and the anesthesia was induced by inhalation, using a mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and isoflurane (Oretim Yeri; MINRAD, Inc.). After each patient had started sleeping, venipuncture and pure oxygen ventilation were performed. In the first group, the anesthesia was preserved by a mixture of oxygen (50%), nitrous oxide (50%), and isoflurane (1%). In the second group, the anesthesia was preserved by a mixture of oxygen (50%), nitrous oxide (50%), and propofol (Corden Pharm SpA, Italy) intravenously at a dose of 100 Ng/kg/min. A BIS sensor (Aspect Medical System, USA) specially designed for children was placed on their foreheads. For each patient, BIS was recorded after inducing the anesthesia. Pulse oximetry and heart monitoring were used to measure vital signs and cardiac rhythm during anesthesia. The patients were ventilated mechanically proportional to their weight, using the anesthesia machine. Their vital signs and BIS score were recorded during operation every 10 min. In the end, when the anesthesia terminated, a member of the research team would move the patient to the recovery room and keep them under observation by a standard single-blind method. In the recovery room, each patient was evaluated for agitation every 10 min for 60 min using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale(from Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with permission. &#x000a9;2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd)</p><p>[<xref ref-type="table" rid="A1">Appendix 1</xref>].

Propofol showed earlier discharge time than isoflurane (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01).</p><p>Mehmandoost and Naghibi[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] compared the effectiveness of isoflurane and propofol on consciousness levels of women undergoing a cesarean. The results of their study showed no significant difference between the two agents in terms of patients&#x02019; consciousness level, BIS, and hemodynamic variables. From 90 patients in their study, only 7 patients showed recovery complications (8.9% and 6.7% in propofol and isoflurane groups, respectively); and no significant differences were observed between the two anesthetic agents.</p><p>The results of the present study are consistent with those of Mehmandoost and Naghibi where there was no statistically significant difference between propofol and isoflurane in maintaining deep anesthesia; both agents provided similar anesthesia depth.</p><p>Katoh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] evaluated the role of age in BIS scores. The results of their study showed that the need for anesthetic agents had a negative correlation with age but had no effect on BIS scores. They concluded that BIS could be used in communities with a wide age range for determining the depth of anesthesia. The results of the present study revealed a statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) correlation between BIS scores and the patients&#x02019; age. They also indicated that BIS scores have a negative correlation with age and, consequently, with the dose of anesthetic agent needed for maintaining deep anesthesia. In both studies, the older patients needed a less anesthetic agent dose, though the changes in BIS scores varied by age in both studies. This variation could be due to the difference in the number of subjects in the sample groups of the two studies. The participants in the study of Katoh <italic>et al</italic>. were between 18 and 85 years of age; whereas, those in our study were 4-7-year-old. Katoh <italic>et al</italic>. used sedation in their study, while anesthesia was used in the present study. Hence, it is not possible to compare the two studies; further studies need to be conducted under similar conditions to verify the results.</p><p>In a study, Kaviani and Karamzadeh[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] evaluated the effect of two intravenous and inhalation anesthesia methods on the rate of postoperative agitation in children. Their results showed no difference in the degree of agitation between their groups but indicated a negative correlation between the rate of agitation and age. The results of the present study showed that the agitation scores were higher in the propofol group, and the difference between the two anesthetic agents was statistically significant at the 10<sup>th</sup> min. It can thus be inferred that the type of anesthetic agent in this study had no effect on the rate of postoperative agitation.</p><p>Regardless of the type of anesthetic agent in the present study, a significant correlation was observed between age and agitation rate; the younger patients showed higher agitation scores. Thus, basedf on the results of this study as well as those of Kaviani and Karamzadeh;[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] age is an important factor in the outbreak of postoperative agitation.</p><p>The incidence of recovery complications in various studies has been variable. In a study, Duncan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] investigated anesthesia complications in 6914 patients in 4 Canadian hospitals and reported the incidence of complications at 8%, whereas Hines <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in a study of 18,473 patients in a training hospital noted incidences of postanesthesia recovery complications at 23.7%.</p><p>In a study on 90 patients in 1987, Edelist[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] investigated the effects of two, propofol and thiopentone, anesthetic agents. His results revealed that, after regaining consciousness, recovery complications were detected in 38% and 47% of patients who had received propofol and thiopentone, respectively. Such factors such as duration of anesthesia, anesthetic technique; and even the organ which is being treated affect the incidence of recovery complications.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] These factors can justify the reasons for major differences between complications detected in different studies. In the present study, the recovery complications were detected in 31% and 39.3% of individuals who received isoflurane and propofol, respectively. The percentage of complications in the propofol group was the same as Edelist,s study.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The difference between the two used anesthetic agents was statistically significant; nevertheless, the isoflurane group showed fewer complications in maintaining the depth of anesthesia than the propofol group.</p><p>The results of the present study showed a significant correlation between age, agitation scores, BIS scores, duration of anesthesia, and the incidence of recovery complications. The younger patients showed more complications and had higher agitation, BIS scores, longer duration of anesthesia, and greater probability of complication occurrence. It is likely that younger children have more agitation after operations and are less able to endure the anesthetic agent. In addition, the results showed that younger patients needed a more anesthetic agent dose. The longer duration of anesthesia indicates the longer effect of the anesthetic agent, and the probability of a proportional increase in the anesthetic agent's side effects, which may entail recovery complications.</p><p>It is recommended that further studies be conducted on other anesthetic agents. In addition, we recommend similar studies using other methods of measuring agitation to compare methods and to ensure their accuracy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>
