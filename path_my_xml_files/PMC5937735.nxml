We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from &#x02212;9 to &#x02212;7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (JP)</institution></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR16G2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2268-2391</contrib-id><name><surname>Ueda</surname><given-names>Mitsuyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (JP (JPMJCR16G2) to Prof. Mitsuyoshi Ueda.

CREs are typically non-coding DNA regions and regulate transcription of downstream genes by binding regulatory factors [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mutations in CREs are one of the causes of phenotypic changes distinguishing species [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, mutations in CREs are frequent causes of human diseases [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, studies involving mechanisms of controlling gene expression by CREs have been attracting great interest [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In order to understand transcriptional regulation by CREs, it is necessary to investigate which parts of the nucleotide sequence of CREs are important. Effects of CRE mutations on transcriptional activity have been investigated by several approaches such as point mutation [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], saturation mutagenesis [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and promoter shuffling [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recently, a more high-throughput approach was developed [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] by combining DNA synthesis technology [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] with a programmable microarray [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and next generation sequencers (NGS) [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. By combining these technologies, a previous paper developed a synthetic saturation mutagenesis method to evaluate functions of mutant CREs in a high-throughput manner [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the report, mutant CREs were synthesized in parallel on a programmable microarray. Each oligonucleotide was designed to have a unique sequence (a DNA barcode) downstream of the transcription start site, and used to identify individual mutant CREs. The mutated CRE library was transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> and the constructed RNA library was reverse transcribed then sequenced by NGS. The relative abundance of each barcode revealed transcriptional activity of each mutant CRE. The synthetic saturation mutagenesis method has been used for analysis of various CREs, not only <italic>in vitro</italic>, but also <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, this method has two issues to be improved upon. First, this method requires a special instrument, a programmable microarray, to synthesize randomized CREs. Second, it is difficult to examine multiple base substitutions. Although the synthetic saturation mutagenesis method enables the evaluation of single- and double-base substitutions, it is difficult to evaluate more than triple-base substitutions because of the difficulty in synthesizing multi-base-substituted DNAs using the programmable microarray.</p><p>Here, we developed an improved method for characterizing a variety of mutant CREs without using special instruments and in a more high-throughput manner. Our method enables simple analysis of various base-substitution patterns with relatively high coverage. We used biased randomization by PCR to obtain a CRE mutant library. In addition, we added a unique DNA barcode sequence to each CRE mutant. The constructed DNA library was transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> to obtain a RNA library. Then the DNA and RNA libraries were analyzed by NGS. Based on DNA barcode information, the NGS analyses connect the information of the mutations in the CREs and the RNA abundance, which enables to explore the influences of single or multiple mutations in the CREs on transcriptional regulation.</p><p>To demonstrate our methodology, we selected the bacteriophage T7 promoter as a target CRE. The T7 promoter is a sequence of bacteriophage DNA recognized by T7 RNA polymerase [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The T7 promoter is used for expression of cloned genes [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In this study, we analyzed 7847 T7 promoter variants, and quantified their transcriptional activities in a single NGS run, demonstrating the usefulness of our simple method for investigating sophisticated transcriptional regulation by CREs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Strategy for high-throughput evaluation of randomized T7 promoter sequences</title><p>In this research, we selected 19 bases of T7 promoter sequence (<monospace>5&#x02019;-TAATACGACTCACTATA<underline>G</underline>G-3&#x02019;</monospace>) as a target CRE. Transcription starts at the underlined G in the 19 bases. We designed a strategy to develop a high-throughput, universal and simple method to evaluate transcriptional activity of mutant T7 promoter variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g001">Fig 1</xref>). First, we constructed <italic>ydaG</italic> gene fragments with a biased randomized T7 promoter and a barcode sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Barcode sequences are consecutive, defined 16 nucleotides. From constructed DNA library, 1 ng DNA fragments were used to clarify the relationships between the randomized T7 promoter sequences and the barcode sequences by NGS. In addition, DNA-seq enabled counting copy numbers of each T7 promoter variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

In the first PCR, a <italic>ydaG</italic> gene fragment (301 bp) obtained from ASKA library [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] was used as a template. The <italic>ydaG</italic> gene was selected because the sequence is short and easy to manipulate. In this PCR, an adapter sequence necessary for NGS analysis, a biased randomized T7 promoter sequence, and a barcode sequence were added to the <italic>ydaG</italic> gene fragment. Each T7 promoter nucleotide was designed to preserve the original base at 70% probability as described in the Materials and methods. For example, if the original base was A, it was designed so that 70% remained as A, 10% as T, 10% as G, and 10% as C. The retention rate was set to 70% because we aimed to obtain a randomized T7 library in which the number of base substitutions ranged from 0 to 5. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g002">Fig 2B</xref> shows the theoretical distribution of the number of base substitutions at various retention rates as described in the Materials and methods. If the retention rate is too high (such as 90%), original T7 sequence will account for the majority (13.5%). On the other hand, if the retention rate is too low (such as 50%), T7 promoter variants with almost no transcriptional activity due to many mutations account for the majority. When the retention rate is set to 70%, the number of base substitution is distributed around 0 to 5, and the population of the original T7 promoter sequence is under 0.1%. As a DNA barcode, a randomized 16 base sequence was used. Each base was synthesized with equal probability (A = 25%, T = 25%, G = 25%, C = 25%). We used DNA barcodes with 16 bases to make the library size of the DNA barcode much larger than that of T7 promoter variants.</p><fig id="pone.0196905.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0196905.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Strategy for construction of DNA and RNA samples.</title><p>(A) Strategy for construction of DNA samples.

Therefore, DNA fragments were amplified which maintained randomized DNA sequences. The amount of DNA used as template was 0.05 pg (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> molecules). This was because of the capacity of the MiSeq Reagent kit v3 used in this study and it can read 25 million sequences. However, exceeding the capacity of the kit causes significant decline in the read number. Therefore, we set the estimated read number as 60% of the maximum reads, i.e., 15 million in this research. In addition, we set the number of read depth coverage (times sequenced) as 100. Considering these factors, the molecular number of the template was set to 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> molecules. The number of T7 promoter variants examined in a single NGS run was approximately the same as this number. In the second PCR, the number of amplification cycles was set to 30 to obtain a sufficient quantity of DNA for NGS analysis. Results from an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer platform showed that the first and second PCRs worked as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196905.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Moreover, RNA fragments (334 nt) transcribed from DNA templates were also confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196905.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Based on these results, we concluded that high-quality DNA and RNA samples for NGS analysis were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Assessment of transcriptional activity of T7 promoter variants by NGS analysis</title><p>The DNA library with randomized T7 promoter sequences and transcribed mRNA with barcode sequences was analyzed by NGS. Firstly, the quality of the DNA library was assessed. The nucleotide bias at each position of the T7 promoter sequences was about 70% as we designed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196905.t001">Table 1</xref>). Although the average read depth of coverage was expected to be 100, the obtained average read depth was 24.8 times. There may be several reasons for the decrease in average sequence depth. One such reason could be NGS read errors that lead to detection of false T7 sequences which did not exist in the DNA library.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0196905.t001" orientation="portrait"

To obtain accurate data, we focused on the T7 promoter variants with read numbers greater than 100 in DNA-seq data.

First, based on the data from DNA-seq, the relationship between T7 promoter variants and barcode sequences was clarified. Using the Excel COUNTIF function, we examined the duplication number of each barcode sequence. According to this analysis, it was revealed that all barcode sequences were unique ones. This result demonstrated that the sequences of the T7 promoter variants corresponded one-to-one to the barcode sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196905.s002">S2 File</xref>). Then, based on data from RNA-seq, the read number of each barcode sequence was determined. The transcriptional activity was quantified by the counts of barcode sequences. Each barcode sequence was normalized by dividing by the counts of the corresponding T7 promoter variants. As a result, we succeeded in quantification of transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196905.s002">S2 File</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g004">Fig 4A</xref> shows the data of all T7 variants arranged in order of transcriptional activity.

One of the useful methods for examining CREs is synthetic saturation mutagenesis [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Compared with synthetic saturation mutagenesis, our proposed methodology is superior in terms of easy operation. In synthetic saturation mutagenesis, a microarray is necessary to prepare DNA fragments [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the other hand, our methodology requires only a PCR thermocycler and a NGS platform. In addition, a wide range of substitution patterns can be constructed in a single sample preparation. In this study, the coverage rates of single and double nucleotide substitutions were 100% and 90%.</p><p>Among the approximately 8,000 variants obtained in this study, the relative transcriptional activity of 97% of T7 promoter variants was less than 1% (low group) and the relative transcriptional activity of the remaining 3% of T7 promoter variants was over 1% (high group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This figure presents a histogram of the number of base substitutions for the low and high groups. The average number of base substitutions was 2.44 for the high group and 5.97 for the low group. Also, the number of base substitutions for 87.3% of the high group was three bases or less. These results suggested that as the number of base substitution increased, the transcriptional activity decreased.</p><fig id="pone.0196905.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0196905.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Distribution of the number of base substitution.</title><p>(A) Distribution of number of substituted bases in the high group (transcriptional activity over 1% compared with original sequence).

For 244 T7 promoter variants in the high group, the retention rate of each base in the 19 bp sequence <monospace>TAATACGACTCACTATAGG</monospace> (&#x02212;17 to +2) was examined. Based on the results, the nucleotides CTC (from &#x02212;9 to &#x02212;7) were well-preserved among the 19 bases, with a retention rate over 98% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196905.s005">S1 Table</xref>). The importance of this CTC sequence has been reported in previous studies, and mutations in this region are known to lower the transcriptional activity to less than 5% of the original sequence [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The reason why substitutions at these positions are not tolerated is that this region is involved in critical interactions between the T7 RNA polymerase and promoter. According to previous research, N748 of T7 RNA polymerase makes contacts with the base pairs at &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;11 [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], R756 interacts with the base pair at &#x02212;9 [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], Q758 interacts with the base pair at &#x02212;8 [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previous studies involving X-ray crystallography have clarified that the specificity loop of RNA polymerase (residues 739 to 770) recognized the T7 promoter by interacting with the DNA major groove from &#x02013;11 to &#x02212;7 [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Single base substitutions have a great impact on the specificity of RNA polymerase for promoter sequences in general [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, some members of the low group had conserved CTC sequences, yet showed very little transcriptional activity. Among these, 338 T7 promoter variants with between 0 and 3 base substitutions were obtained. The most frequent mutation involved the C at base position &#x02212;5. Approximately 28% of 338 T7 promoter variants had mutations at this nucleotide. The base pair at &#x02212;5 is the boundary between the binding region and the initiation region [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and DNA melting starts from this position [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It was clarified in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] that mutations at this site also significantly diminish transcriptional activity.</p><p>As stated above, these results obtained in this study coincide with the previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, we concluded that the usefulness of our novel method was verified strongly.</p><p>In order to confirm the intensity of T7 variants obtained in this study, the effect of T7 promoter variants on translation activity was evaluated by the production of protein employing an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation system (PURE). As a result, the transcriptional activity was found to correlate to the translational activity. From this result, it is suggested that in order to increase the production level of a protein by X fold, T7 promoter variants having a transcriptional activity X fold should be selected. The transcriptional errors of native T7 sequences (coefficient of variation = 11.2%) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g004">Fig 4</xref> was larger compared with the range of translation errors of native T7 sequences (coefficient of variation = 6.13%) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Difference in barcode sequences could increase the transcriptional errors in the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g004">Fig 4</xref>. These barcode sequences were removed in the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196905.g005">Fig 5</xref>, and this was likely to decrease the range of translational error bars. One reason of the outlier (the plot of transcriptional activity = 0.5) is that the transcriptional activity contains errors due to the influence of barcode sequences. Previous researches confirmed that DNA concentration correlates linearly with protein production levels under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

The reason we set this retention rate value was to control the number of base substitutions around 0 to 5. We defined the distribution of T7 variants by the number of base substitutions based on the following formula. In this formula, x represents the retention rate [%] and y indicates the number of base substitutions.</p><disp-formula id="pone.0196905.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0196905.e001.jpg" id="pone.0196905.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>19</mml:mn><mml:mo>!</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>!</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>19</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>!</mml:mo><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>19</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x02011;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x02011;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></alternatives></disp-formula><p>According to calculations based on this formula, we set x = 0.7 as the retention rate for obtaining target T7 promoter variant patterns.</p><p>The character N in the primer sequence means a randomized base (A: 25%, T: 25%, G: 25%, C: 25%).

Target average sequencing depth varies depending on types of researches [<xref rid="pone.0196905.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this research, there is a concern for decreasing data quality due to the sequencing errors. Therefore, we initially designed an experimental plan to obtain 100 reads of each DNA sequence, but the average depth obtained from our experiment was 24.8. Hence, we set the cut off for analysis at 100 according to the initial plan to avoid decreasing data quality. Using RNA fastq file and Python scripts (RNAcount.py and RNAextract.py), barcode sequences were extracted and the number of each barcode sequence was counted. Finally, using Python script bar_T7_read_ratio.py, DNA data and RNA data were integrated. Based on these data, transcriptional activity (read number of RNA/read number of DNA) was calculated.
