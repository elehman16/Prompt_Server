People with mental health problems are particularly vulnerable to loneliness and, for those with anxiety or depression, loneliness is associated with poorer outcomes. Interventions which support people to utilise existing networks and access new social contact are advocated in policy but there is little evidence regarding their effectiveness. People with mental health problems have potential to benefit from interventions to reduce loneliness, but evidence is needed regarding their feasibility, acceptability and outcomes. An intervention to reduce loneliness for people with anxiety or depression treated in secondary mental health services was developed for this study, which will test the feasibility and acceptability of delivering and evaluating it through a randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this feasibility trial, 40 participants with anxiety or depression will be recruited through two secondary mental health services in London and randomised to an intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) or control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10). The control group will receive standard care and written information about local community resources. The coproduced intervention, developed in this study, includes up to ten sessions with a &#x02018;Community Navigator&#x02019; over a 6-month period. Community Navigators will work with people individually to increase involvement in social activities, with the aim of reducing feelings of loneliness. Data will be collected at baseline and at 6-month follow-up &#x02013; the end of the intervention period. The acceptability of the intervention and feasibility of participant recruitment and retention will be assessed. Potential primary and secondary outcomes for a future definitive trial will be completed to assess response and completeness, including measures of loneliness, depression and anxiety. Qualitative interviews with participants, staff and other stakeholders will explore experiences of Community Navigator support, the mechanisms by which it may have its effects and suggestions for improving the programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Our trial will provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and acceptability of Community Navigator support and of trial procedures for testing this.

It is related to, and overlaps with, a range of concepts including social isolation, social capital, social network and social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although related to objective social isolation, loneliness is a distinct subjective experience which may be driven by the quality as well as quantity of social relationships.</p><p id="Par14">Prolonged loneliness is increasingly recognised internationally as a major public health issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is distressing in itself and has been demonstrated to predict a range of poor health outcomes in the general population, including shorter life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], elevated blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], diminished immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Loneliness predicts the onset of anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">While public policy has focused primarily on initiatives to alleviate loneliness in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], there is a growing recognition that these may need to be extended to people of all ages. In the UK, 6% of adults report being lonely all or most of the time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and 21% report being &#x02018;sometimes&#x02019; lonely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. People with mental health problems typically have smaller social networks than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Up to 40% of people with depression feel lonely most of the time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and a tenfold increase in the odds of being lonely has been reported, compared to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For people with anxiety and depression, loneliness independently predicts poorer symptom outcomes 1&#x000a0;year later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Interventions which alleviate loneliness for people with anxiety and depression, therefore, potentially promise not only improved quality of life, but also reduced mental health problems and less risk of a range of poor health outcomes.</p><p id="Par16">There are a range of related social interventions which have the potential to alleviate loneliness and reduce social isolation. Interventions can be classified as &#x02018;direct&#x02019;, explicitly targeting loneliness and social relationships, or &#x02018;indirect&#x02019; broader approaches to improving health and wellbeing that may have impacts for loneliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. There are several types of direct intervention which aim to reduce loneliness including: changing people&#x02019;s cognitions about social relationships; social skills training and psychoeducation about the value of social connections; supported socialisation; and wider community approaches to reducing loneliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Interventions involving supported socialisation are currently being widely adopted and appear to be particularly promising. These can include social prescribing &#x02013; the provision of groups and/or financial assistance to attend groups which promote social integration or wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Interventions can also involve brief individual support from a &#x02018;navigator&#x02019; or &#x02018;wellbeing coach&#x02019; for people to utilise existing networks and access new social contact and support in their local community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Social prescribing schemes have demonstrated that these approaches can be feasible and engaging in a mental health context. For example, Wellbeing Enterprises Community Interest Company (CIC) has been commissioned to provide social prescribing for people referred from primary care for over ten years. Routine evaluations suggest improvements in wellbeing and depression following receipt of their brief intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Social interventions such as this are advocated in research literature and policy to provide integrated health and social care and improve health outcomes for people with long-term conditions, including mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although they have been reported positively, there is little evidence regarding their effectiveness for people with mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is also unclear whether such interventions, most commonly provided in primary care, are appropriate for a population with enduring mental health problems and complex needs in secondary care, who may have even greater problems with loneliness.</p><p id="Par19">The aim of this study is to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a programme of support for people with complex depression and anxiety and to examine the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of this intervention. This programme will include receiving support from a &#x02018;Community Navigator&#x02019; based in secondary mental health services, who will help service users to increase social contact, participation in social activities and community engagement, with the aim of reducing feelings of loneliness. The study comprises modelling, preliminary testing and a feasibility trial of the programme, in accordance with guidance for developing and evaluating a complex intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This protocol is for the feasibility RCT of the intervention with mixed-methods evaluation.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par20">The main aims of the Community Navigator Feasibility RCT are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par21">To develop and manualise a social intervention involving Community Navigator support to increase social connections and reduce loneliness for people with complex depression and anxiety using secondary mental health services</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">To trial the programme with 40 service users to test acceptability of the intervention and trial procedures (including outcome measures and feasibility of participant recruitment and retention) and investigate optimal trial processes</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">To explore stakeholders&#x02019; experience of the programme, barriers and facilitators to its successful implementation, potential mechanisms of its effect, and refine a theory of change model which outlines the processes by which the programme may have an effect</p></list-item></list>

Both services support about 600 adult service users with moderate or severe depression, anxiety or other affective disorders. Both services offer care coordination, support from a multi-disciplinary team, and psychiatric outpatient appointments. Neither service offers Community Navigation support as a standard part of care delivered by the team. In both areas, service users may access a range of statutory and voluntary sector services which provide various activities and opportunities for social contact. Both the inner-London boroughs of Camden and Islington and the outer-London borough of Barnet include affluent areas and areas of high deprivation, and ethnically diverse populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par27">At each study site, 20 service user participants will be recruited at baseline (total <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40). This sample size has been chosen to be sufficient to give an indication of the acceptability of the Community Navigator programme and the feasibility of trial recruitment procedures. The treatment group will consist of 30 participants and the remaining 10 participants will form the control group.</p><p id="Par28">To ensure that we are working with a population who are experiencing loneliness, we will use the six-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] as a screening measure, for which a score of 2 has been established as a minimum threshold for loneliness. De Jong Gierveld and colleagues recommend categorising scores of 2 to 4 on this scale as moderately lonely and 5 to 6 as severely lonely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Other inclusion criteria have been kept deliberately broad, although we will prioritise service users currently receiving support from several disciplines (e.g. care coordination, psychology and medical review), to help us explore whether Community Navigation is a useful addition to multi-disciplinary care from a secondary mental health service.</p><p id="Par29">Inclusion criteria:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par30">Currently on the caseload of a secondary mental health service for people with depression or anxiety</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Aged 18&#x000a0;years or older</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Score at least 2 on the six-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] at initial screening</p></list-item></list>

Once the study researcher has established that people are eligible to take part, potential participants will be sent a study information sheet. The researcher will make contact again to check that the participant has understood the information sheet and has continued capacity to consent.

Loneliness has been demonstrated to predict poor recovery from both depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], while a recent Australian study provides promising preliminary evidence that a socially-focused group programme reduced loneliness and subsequently depression in a population of young adults with mild mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">According to the Social Identity Approach to health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], enhanced identification as a member of social groups and communities may lead to improved access to social support, a greater sense of control and enhanced self-esteem. Community Navigators will help participants to expand their awareness of opportunities for social contact. They will adopt a strengths-based, solution-focused approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] which will encourage participants to focus on what they can do. Community Navigators will also seek to normalise setbacks participants encounter with increasing social connections. Group sessions may serve to normalise worries about social interaction and provide inspiring examples of positive behaviour change. In these ways, participants&#x02019; hope, confidence and sense of self-efficacy may be increased. Ideally, a &#x02018;virtuous circle&#x02019; will be initiated, where increased social interaction fosters more positive thinking, which prompts and enables further social interaction.</p><p id="Par49">In this intervention, up to ten sessions are offered, rather than the briefer programmes of socially focused support typically offered in primary care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This recognises that the process of engagement, agreeing manageable goals and problem-solving barriers or setbacks may all take longer with a severe and enduringly ill client group. Effective engagement with participants will be enabled by building flexibility into the programme, to maximise its fit with participants&#x02019; needs and preferences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Principles of Community Navigation</title><p id="Par50">There are five principles which are central to the way that Community Navigators work with people:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par51">Socially focused &#x02013; Community Navigators will focus exclusively on support to enhance an individual&#x02019;s social world, working with people to feel more engaged and connected to other people, activities, and their community</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">Asset-based &#x02013; Community Navigators are champions of the community.

The approach is future-focused, looking for positive solutions using the person&#x02019;s strengths and resources rather than concentrating on the past or what is preventing the person from moving forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">Person-centred &#x02013; support will be individualised, focussing on the needs, goals, and preferences of the individual at each point in their recovery.

</p><p id="Par56">Community Navigators will also use the GROW model of coaching when supporting people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This involves identifying a &#x02018;Goal&#x02019; and then exploring the present &#x02018;Reality&#x02019;. Next, people are encouraged to explore all of their &#x02018;Options&#x02019; and finally commit to an action in the &#x02018;Way forward&#x02019;. This approach will be client-led and will allow participants to identify their own goals and plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It is conceptually congruent with the solution-focussed approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention outline</title><p id="Par57">Those receiving the intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) will be offered up to ten, hour-long meetings with a Community Navigator and access to up to three group sessions over a 6-month period alongside their standard care. Participants can have as many meetings as they want over the 6&#x000a0;months, up to a total of ten, and these meetings can be scheduled whenever they are most helpful within the 6&#x000a0;months. Each participant may use a budget of up to &#x000a3;100 on goals agreed with their Community Navigator to facilitate access to and participation in activities that provide opportunities for developing social connections. Meetings may take place in participants&#x02019; homes, community spaces or NHS premises, as the participant prefers.</p><p id="Par58">The Community Navigation intervention will comprise three main components. Firstly, Community Navigators will build up rapport through discussing the person&#x02019;s social network and interests. A social network mapping tool will be used to identify the people, places and activities that are important to the person. Items will be plotted in terms of importance and may be current, previous or potential new connections that the person would like to form. The aim is to collaboratively identify the person&#x02019;s current interests and social connections, potential areas for new activity or social contact and how existing connections could be strengthened.</p><p id="Par59">This social network mapping tool is bespoke to Community Navigation, and will be co-developed within the working group with input from the Community Navigators based on people&#x02019;s experiences. It will be informed by existing interventions to map social systems and activity and primarily based on a similar mapping process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This existing process involves getting people to generate the names of people that they know, places that they go to in their community, and the sort of activities that they do regularly. People are then asked to place all of the names generated on a &#x02018;map&#x02019; consisting of concentric circles, with items they feel closest to in the inner circles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Social network reviews may be informed by Wellbeing Reviews, a process developed by Wellbeing Enterprises CIC and reported in the Campaign to End Loneliness &#x02018;Promising Approaches&#x02019; bulletin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This involves identifying social issues that may be causing or exacerbating health problems. Community Navigators may also use the &#x02018;self-aspect pie&#x02019; to explore people&#x02019;s social networks. This is a tool from the Groups 4 Health programme, which prompts people to reflect on and visually present their self-concept (the important aspects of themselves) and consider whether it is well represented by their social identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Secondly, Community Navigators will provide support to develop and use an action plan to increase connectedness. This action plan will involve setting goals around connecting, reconnecting, exploring opportunities in the community, and joining in with new groups or activities. The plan will be based on &#x02018;SMART&#x02019; principles, meaning that goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. Creating this plan will involve identifying strengths and resources that people currently have which may help them achieve their goals. Community Navigators will help participants to break goals down into a series of steps, so that progress may be made, even towards challenging or long-term goals. Community Navigators will use their local knowledge of leisure activities, cultural and social support groups, and wellbeing support to help people develop this plan. The Community Navigators&#x02019; role includes time to &#x02018;asset map&#x02019; local communities to identify useful groups and social resources in general and in relation to goals agreed with individual participants.</p><p id="Par61">Support to use this action plan will be person centred and include: providing information about available activities and sources of support locally; practical help to access activity (e.g. planning travel routes or accompanying the participant to a new social group); access to financial support from a budget of &#x000a3;100 per participant; reinforcing strengths and successes; problem-solving challenges and setbacks; and providing encouragement and emotional support to increase social connectedness. Community Navigators can also utilise exercises from the Groups 4 Health programme to encourage people to focus on beneficial social activities and to develop reciprocity and give more to others in social interactions, potentially eliciting more positive responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">Finally, participants will be invited to attend up to three sessions to meet co-participants, discuss the programme&#x02019;s aims and their progress, and share information about helpful local resources and experiences. One session will be early in participants&#x02019; support from their Community Navigator, during the first half of the 6-month intervention period, and one towards the end of the programme. A third session may be added, depending on the enthusiasm for this in the group. Attendance is optional but Community Navigators will encourage and support all participants to join in where possible. Sessions will last approximately 2&#x000a0;h, with a break, and will be facilitated by the Community Navigators. Each meeting will have a loose agenda tailored to the needs of those taking part to achieve maximum impact. The group will follow the principles of the Community Navigator programme with a socially focused, person-centred approach.</p><p id="Par63">The Community Navigation programme is a social intervention focussed on increasing social contact and connection. Community Navigators will be dissuaded from helping participants with other problems (e.g. medication management, housing, employment, debts or welfare benefits), for which they may not have the time or clinical skills, and for which the participant may already be receiving support. Instead, Community Navigators will be encouraged to signpost participants back to the involved clinical team for help with these issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>The Community Navigators</title><p id="Par64">Community Navigators will be embedded within participating services in Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust and Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust. They have been recruited specifically to this role and do not need a professional mental health qualification. Lived experience of mental health problems constitutes relevant experience, but is not essential. Excellent interpersonal skills, sensitivity to and understanding of mental health difficulties, local knowledge, and awareness of assets in the community are essential requirements for the role. In this feasibility trial, three Community Navigators will be working with participants across Barnet, Camden, and Islington. Recruitment to these posts involved the study working group, who developed exercises to assess applicants&#x02019; rapport-building skills and awareness of community assets. Community Navigators will be supported to fulfil their role through training and supervision.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Training</title><p id="Par65">A five-day initial training programme provides instruction and practice in key activities of the role: community resource-finding; mapping people&#x02019;s social worlds; developing a personal social connections plan; using a solution-focused approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; and the GROW coaching model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Training is experiential in nature using group discussion and scenarios. Trainers with lived experience of depression or anxiety will help Navigators to role play tasks offering realistic practice and valid feedback. Practitioners from involved clinical services will also provide training about local service structures and available crisis support, the nature of the participant group, and guidance on how to respond to safety concerns regarding participants or urgent clinical needs. The Community Navigators will also learn through discussion and direct observation of experienced staff employed in social navigation roles at Wellbeing Enterprises CIC and Bromley-By-Bow Centre social prescribing projects.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Supervision</title><p id="Par66">Regular group supervision (monthly at each of the two services in this trial) will provide support with delivering the study activities and address issues or challenges in working with specific participants. Supervisors are mental health practitioners from participating services who know the study participants, bring clinical expertise and local service knowledge, and who are familiar with and supportive of the structure and aims of the Community Navigator programme. The Community Navigators will also have immediate access at all times to clinical staff in the event of any immediate concerns about participants&#x02019; safety or wellbeing.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The control group</title><p id="Par67">Participants in the control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) will be offered written information about community resources and activities within their area. Participants will otherwise receive standard care, unaffected by their participation in the study.

Additionally, 20 participants receiving the intervention, the three Community Navigators and ten other stakeholders (the Community Navigators&#x02019; supervisors, and other involved mental health team staff and participants&#x02019; involved friends or family) will be asked to take part in a qualitative interview following the intervention.

However, this is still a diverse group of service users. Except for this requirement, we have kept the inclusion and exclusion criteria broad so that most users of the participating services will be eligible to take part. This will maximise learning about the extent to which Community Navigation is generally feasible and acceptable in addition to standard care from secondary mental health services.</p><p id="Par116">As researchers will have ongoing contact with clinical teams, Community Navigators and participants throughout the intervention, it will not be possible for researchers to be blinded during outcomes data collection. However, outcome measures will be self-administered so should not be influenced by researcher bias. In a future definitive RCT, with more resources available, it would be possible for researchers to be blinded, but this procedure will not be tested in this trial.</p><p id="Par117">This intervention takes one approach to targeting loneliness. There are other components of loneliness which we are not attempting to tackle. For example, people who feel lonely may have cognitive biases, such as negative evaluations of others, and a lack of interpersonal trust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Alternative interventions for loneliness try to change people&#x02019;s cognitions about social relationships, for example cognitive &#x02018;reframing&#x02019; of loneliness to increase perceived control over reducing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Community navigation does not include a cognitive component, or other approaches such as social skills training and wider community changes. With current evidence, it is unclear which approach to reducing loneliness and increasing people&#x02019;s community connections may be most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Research implications</title><p id="Par118">Although social interventions such as Community Navigation are advocated in policy, and have been reported positively, there is little evidence to date regarding their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The appropriateness of using such interventions (most commonly provided in primary care) for a population using specialist mental health services with enduring mental health problems and complex needs is also unclear from current research. In this feasibility trial, we attempt to address these issues and provide preliminary evidence of the acceptability of this support.</p><p id="Par119">Evidence regarding the feasibility of Community Navigation should provide a basis for future research. If this feasibility trial of the Community Navigator programme yields promising results, it will provide a clearly defined structure and set of resources that can be definitively tested in a large-scale RCT. In addition, this study should reveal barriers and facilitators to implementing this social intervention within an RCT. This should enable us to implement the most effective recruitment strategy, develop clear trial procedures, consider key roles of clinical staff in the study, and address people&#x02019;s willingness to participate in this type of intervention. Our findings may have broader implications to inform randomised trials of social interventions within mental health services and in other areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Implications for policy and practice</title><p id="Par120">Loneliness can negatively influence the physical, psychological and social wellbeing of individuals. Interventions which alleviate loneliness are beneficial in their own right and hold promise in improving people&#x02019;s mental health, as well as having wider benefits for health outcomes and health service resources. If successful, this feasibility study will provide a clearly manualised social intervention designed to reduce loneliness, with evidence of acceptability and feasibility for use in mental health settings. As UK policy already advocates this kind of social intervention, and related programmes are already running, this would be immediately useful in guiding commissioning and delivery. It would provide a manualised intervention ready for delivery in clinical settings. This feasibility trial will also inform and support a future larger RCT of Community Navigation, which could establish the effectiveness of this type of support and potential cost savings, calculated through an economic analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par121">This is protocol version 2 (09/02/2017) which received ethical approval on 14/03/2017 and Health Research Authority approval on 23/03/17.
