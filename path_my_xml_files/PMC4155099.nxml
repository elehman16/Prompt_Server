Schools were enrolled between 2010 and 2011 and allocated using a centralized randomization list into 1) a student smoking prevention intervention (visit to an established interactive circuit), 2) the same intervention plus a parent intervention, and 3) a control group (visit to an established exercise and nutrition interactive circuit). Students were assessed at baseline, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months via self-report, as well as via carbon monoxide and cotinine in saliva at the 24&#x000a0;month follow-up. Statistical analyses uses multi-level regression models with cluster effects (school and class within school) based on the intention to treat population. Here we report descriptive baseline characteristics of recruited schools, and schools classes. Two schools from the control group dropped out after allocation. Hence, 47 secondary schools from all 12 districts of the city, including 161 school classes and 3023 students are participating in the study.

Although smoking rates in many industrialized countries have declined over past decades, absolute number of smokers is increasing and so is the absolute mortality attributable to smoking
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Tobacco use among children and adolescents in many industrialized countries has decreased in recent years, including Germany
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, compared to other western countries, smoking rates in Germany are still relatively high which is cause for concern, given the numerous detrimental health effects of smoking
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The majority of adult smokers initiate this unhealthy behavior during adolescence, and almost every adult who smokes started smoking before the age of 26
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Targeting children and adolescents is therefore the most appropriate approach to prevent smoking initiation in the first place. School-based prevention strategies have traditionally been an important approach to smoking prevention in children and youths. Particular advantages are that schools offer an almost universal reach of children and youths. In addition, educational strategies fit mutually with schools&#x02019; role
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of such strategies has been mixed and systematic reviews reported limited evidence of the long-term effectiveness of school-based smoking prevention strategies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Parents have a strong influence on their children&#x02019;s smoking behavior in various ways. For instance, children of parents who smoke are more likely to smoke
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, parental anti-smoking attitudes and rules have shown to be associated with children&#x02019;s smoking behavior, irrespective of their own smoking behavior
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Given the at best modest long-term effectiveness of behavioral smoking prevention strategies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. and the important role of parents in shaping children&#x02019;s smoking behavior, parental and family-based intervention strategies have been added to student centered school-based smoking prevention strategies. However, only a limited number of methodologically rigorous studies have investigated the effectiveness of family or parental approaches to smoking prevention and while some reported favorable outcomes, others reported less positive findings
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Recent systematic reviews of the evidence have suggested that studies incorporating parental or family components could indeed beneficially influence smoking behavior in children and adolescents
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition to a general paucity of relevant studies these reviews emphasized the fact that the additional effectiveness of parental or family interventions on top of a student targeted smoking prevention strategies was rarely investigated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In Germany, a considerable number of smoking prevention efforts and programs targeted at children and adolescents are available. However, the majority of these activities have never been rigorously evaluated for their efficacy and effectiveness. This is highlighted in systematic reviews of smoking prevention strategies that identified few methodologically rigorous studies from Germany
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, there seem to be considerable regional disparities in smoking behavior
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Especially in the former eastern parts of Germany and metropolitan areas, such as Berlin, smoking rates tend to be substantially higher compared to average smoking rates. At present, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. However, to reduce inequalities in risk taking behavior among adolescents and to subsequently reduce inequalities in health, efforts to target these disadvantaged populations will have to be strengthened. Hence, generally there remains a need to continue developing more effective smoking prevention approaches and to evaluate the effectiveness of individual intervention components, particularly in disadvantaged population groups.</p><p>The Berlin Evaluates School Tobacco Prevention - BEST Prevention study was designed to address important research needs. It aims to investigate the long-term comparative effectiveness of a school-based intervention versus a school-based plus parental intervention strategy. The BEST Prevention study targets adolescents in Berlin, a diverse population group with a relatively high proportion being from families with migrant background in a large metropolitan area. The present manuscript describes objectives, study design and methodology of the BEST Prevention study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The overall objective of this school-based intervention study is to compare the effectiveness of different smoking prevention strategies among 7<sup>th</sup> grade students.

The circuit (&#x0201c;Rauchst Du noch oder lebst Du schon?&#x0201d; [&#x0201c;Still smoking or already living?&#x0201d;]) was developed and is offered by KARUNA e.V. a non-governmental, non-profit organization for children and youths in need, with the support of the Berlin senate for health and social affairs The aim of the circuit is to inform students about the harmful consequences of tobacco use, to strengthen self-responsibility and self-confidence and to enter into a dialogue with the students. The design of the circuit, the practical approach, and the youth-friendly presentation aim to facilitate the development of a positive non-smoking image among students. In addition, the circuit aims to convey smoking-related preventive knowledge using a game-based approach, including competitions and activities in an age-appropriate and engaging way. Trained moderators lead through six interactive stations of the circuit and an informative billboard (s. Table&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Overall, completion takes approximately 2&#x000a0;hours. Students learn about the harmful effects of smoking, toxic ingredients of cigarettes, differences between smokers and non-smokers in terms of their health status (atherosclerosis prevalence), loss of smell, breathing capacity and premature aging. The framework for the six stations includes an introduction by the moderator in the form of a presentation (about 20&#x000a0;min) and a final discussion of &#x0201c;unbelievable&#x0201d; facts from the world of tobacco, e.g. from politics and media.

Two to three trained members of the study team are available during data collection and are responsible for all aspects of the data collection process within school classes. At each school, contact teachers supported the implementation of the data collection and intervention implementation. A query management was implemented by the research team to track data collection and intervention implementation at participating schools. To coordinate the assessments at schools, contact teachers were approached and reminded multiple times and eg. via email, phone, and through the principal in order to reduce the number of drop-outs at the cluster level (school and school class). Students who had provided complete written informed consent but were not available during data collection in schools received mailed questionnaires together with free return envelopes for completion at home.</p><p>The study questionnaire for adolescents was developed and pilot tested in a way to allow comparisons with existing and widely comparable questionnaires investigating adolescent health behavior and health. It includes questions related to socio-demographics, smoking and other health behaviors, such as alcohol consumption, nutrition, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, as well as height and weight. In addition to smoking behavior, the questionnaire addresses various other issues related to adolescent smoking, including smoking behavior of family members and peers, parental rules and attitudes towards smoking, as well as peer pressure.</p><p>About two months before the final follow-up of their children, all parents received a brief self-administered questionnaire via mail. Primary purpose of this questionnaire was to determine whether parents/caregivers whose children were allocated to Intervention 2 attended the parent&#x02019;s night. In addition, the questionnaire addresses parental smoking behavior, awareness about their child&#x02019;s smoking behavior, attitudes and rules towards smoking of their child or at their home, as well as a brief evaluation of the parental intervention. Parents whose children were allocated to Intervention 1 and Control group (parents who did not receive the parent intervention) received the same questionnaire except for items related to the evaluation of the parental intervention.</p><p>In addition to self-reported outcomes in students, the main outcome, smoking behavior, is assessed objectively at the final follow-up. Assessments are conducted in the class-room during questionnaire assessments. Measurements are conducted and handled in such a way that findings are not visible to other students or the teacher. Objective outcome assessments include CO measurements from exhaled air and saliva based cotinine measurements. Assessments are conducted on a random subsample of students from 15 schools. Students from 6 schools (2 in each intervention group) undergo CO measurements. The CO content
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] is measured in ppm (part per million) using the Bedfont Smokerlyzer Micro +. Smoking behavior according to this tool is classified as follows: 0&#x02013;4 non-smoker, 5&#x02013;6 dangerous exposure, 7&#x02013;10 smoker, 11+ heavy smoker. Another subsample of students from 6 schools (2 in each intervention group) provides saliva samples via passive drool to measure cotinine values using a NicAlert&#x000ae; dipstick. The NicAlert&#x000ae; test yields a semi-quantitative measure of cotinine based on a colorimetric immunoassay reaction. The test strip displays seven zones that represent a range of cotinine levels from 0 (0-10&#x000a0;ng/ml) to 6 (&#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;ng/ml). Results are recorded as values from 0 to 6; a result&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 indicated tobacco use
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In a further subsample of students from 3 schools (1 in each intervention group) students provide both objective outcome measurements described above.</p><p>Data management at the Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics is conducted according to standard operating procedures. Questionnaire data is entered by study personnel into a password protected database. Data quality is checked by means of plausibility tests and implausible data are compared against the original questionnaires. Double data entry of a random sample of participants is conducted to control the rate of data entry errors. Access to the data is only permitted to specific members of the research team.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Sample size determination</title><p>The analysis is following a hierarchical testing procedure. In a first step, intervention 2 (student smoking prevention circuit plus parent intervention) will be compared to the control group with regard to the primary outcome (proportion of regular smokers at 24&#x000a0;months). Only if step 1 is significant at the 5% level (two-sided), will step 2 be tested confirmatively (otherwise all following analyses will be considered explorative). The second step involves two hypotheses: Intervention 1 (student smoking prevention circuit) compared to control; and Intervention 2 compared to Intervention 1, each with regard to the primary outcome. The sample size determination is based on the second step (having a smaller assumed intervention effect, thus requiring a higher sample size than step one) with the two hypotheses tested equally (significance level alpha 0.025 each). Taking into account the cluster design with an assumed intra-cluster correlation coefficient for schools (ICC) of 0.001 and a power of 80%, 15 (14.7 and 13.3 precisely for the two hypotheses) schools (=clusters) are required in each of the three arms to detect a 5% difference in the proportion of regular smokers after two years (assumptions: intervention 1: 30%, intervention 2: 25%, and control group: 35%). Since we assume on average 60 participating students per school, this yields a total of 15 &#x000d7; 3 &#x000d7; 60&#x02009;=&#x02009;2700 required students. Assuming a drop-out rate of about 20% this yields a targeted sample size of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3375 students to be randomized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In general, multi-level regression models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM)) with cluster effects (school and class within school) will be used for all statistical analyses. For the primary analysis, a logit model will be used, which will be adjusted for smoking status at baseline, based on the intention to treat (ITT) population. Testing will be hierarchical as described above with an overall level of significance of 5% (two-sided). All further analyses will be considered explorative.</p><p>Secondary analysis of the primary endpoint include models with adjustment for smoking status at baseline and other baseline variables in case of relevant imbalances between treatment groups. In addition, missing values will be imputed as sensitivity analyses. A per-protocol (PP) population will be defined and analyzed in a similar manner.</p><p>Secondary endpoints will be analyzed within similar frameworks as applicable.</p><p>All analyses will be specified in detail in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be finalized prior to data analysis. Data analysis is conducted with the SAS for Windows, Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or other software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Recruitment process and distribution of participating schools and students</title><p>Schools, school classes and study participants were recruited over a period of two school years.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It was designed to address important and unresolved issues in the context of behavioral smoking prevention strategies. Findings will be of importance for a number of reasons: Firstly, the BEST-Prevention study targets specific intervention components and addresses the additional effectiveness of a feasible parental smoking prevention strategy to reduce smoking rates among adolescents, which few studies have done so far
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Secondly, it targets adolescents at increased risk of smoking due to their diverse background and their residence in a large metropolitan area in Germany. Thirdly, this study assesses the long-term effectiveness of a smoking prevention intervention.</p><p>Despite recruitment challenges due to the implementation of a school reform in Berlin in 2010, which reduced the number of potentially eligible schools by about 50%, the targeted number of 45 schools and 161 school classes was achieved or even exceeded. However, with 3023 students meeting all selection criteria, the estimated sample size was not fully met.</p><p>Although our study did not aim to enroll a representative population of 7<sup>th</sup> graders in Berlin we were able to recruit schools and students from all 12 districts of the city. This ensures that schools and students are located in districts and neighborhoods with diverse characteristics and SES. While we recruited schools, school classes and students from all these districts, the distribution of those does not fully reflect the general distribution across the city of Berlin. For instance, certain districts are overrepresented in terms of the relative number of schools and students enrolled, while others underrepresented. In terms of the type of school, there are 121 integrated secondary schools and 93 &#x0201c;Gymnasien&#x0201d; in Berlin. Within the BEST-Prevention study we enrolled 32 integrated secondary schools and 15 Gymnasien, reflecting a somewhat different distribution. Our population based sample in a major metropolitan area in Germany and its diversity will offer the opportunity to investigate the impact of various individual family characteristics, as well as neighborhood SES on smoking and other health behaviors. This will make findings highly relevant to populations which are frequently not adequately reached through prevention efforts.</p><p>Outcomes of the present school-based RCT are assessed at baseline, 12&#x000a0;month and 24&#x000a0;month through self-report, similar to many previous school-based smoking prevention studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, self-report has its limitations and can result in over- or underreporting of relevant behaviors. Another strength of the present study is that in addition to self-report, main study outcomes will be assessed using objective measures, namely CO and cotinine measurements. This will provide valuable additional information to strengthen conclusions based on self-report outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the present manuscript provides an overview of the study design and methodology of a large school-based smoking prevention cluster randomized controlled trial in a metropolitan area in Germany. Recruitment of the BEST-prevention study was successful in enrolling targeted numbers of schools and school classes, although the number of students was somewhat lower than planned. Moreover, enrolled schools and students represent all districts of the city. Findings from our study will soon provide valuable information with regards to the acceptability and effectiveness of specific smoking prevention strategies also in disadvantaged population groups. Furthermore, the additional effectiveness of strategies targeting parents will be determined.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Ethics</title><p>Approval from the Charit&#x000e9;-Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin institutional review board was obtained.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>FMR, NR, SR, JMN and SNW were conceiving the study.
