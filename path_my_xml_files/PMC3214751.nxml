Continuous epidural infusion with a local anesthetic is a standard regime for postoperative analgesia after TKA. Epidural analgesia and also peripheral nerve block analgesia have been shown to reduce opioid consumption compared with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Even though both modalities reduce the occurrence of the well-known side effects of opioid drugs, they involve extra equipment and are associated with substantial side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Choi et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Davies et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Boezaart 2006</xref>). Wound infiltration with multimodal analgesia has been a controversial issue for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Dahl et al. 1994</xref>). Different modes of perioperative analgesia either without or combined with intraarticular infusion or bolus injection(s) for both TKA and total hip arthroplasty have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Bianconi et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Rasmussen et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Reilly et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">Andersen et al. 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">b</xref>). Only a few studies have described high-volume peri- and intraarticular analgesia for TKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Busch et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Vendittoli et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Toftdahl et al. 2007</xref>). The hypothesis in our trial was that wound infiltration and intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and ketorolac would reduce opioid consumption during the active treatment period (0&#x02013;48 h postoperatively) after TKA compared to epidural infusion of ropivacaine and intravenous ketorolac. Primary outcome was 48-h opioid use. Secondary outcomes included pain at rest and during mobilization, side effects, length of hospital stay (LOS), and corrected length of stay (the day-patients fulfilled discharge criteria).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>With the approval of the Ethics Committee of the County of Copenhagen (KA-20060134) and the Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT.no 2006-004638-33) and after obtaining written informed consent, 40 patients &#x0003e;18 years of age undergoing elective, unilateral, primary TKA were enrolled in this randomized study. The study fulfilled the requirements of the Helsinki Declaration, and was conducted in accordance with GCP-ICH guidelines and monitored by the GCP unit at Copenhagen University Hospital. It was also registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT00421967) and at the Danish Data Protection Agency.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to study drugs, contraindications to spinal anesthesia and epidural analgesia, regular narcotic use, general anesthesia, inability to communicate in Danish, drug-treated diabetes, neuropathic pain or sensory disorders in the leg to be operated on, rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, severe obesity (BMI &#x0003e; 40), and treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and/or antacids. Secondary exclusion criteria were failure of spinal anesthesia and reoperation or trauma to the knee within the first 48 h postoperatively.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomized before surgery by using a block size of 8 with a ratio of 1:1 according to a computer-generated sequence, and each patient was assigned by opening a sealed envelope to receive either (1) wound infiltration combined with intraarticular infusion (group A) or (2) epidural infusion and intravenous treatment (group E).</p><p>Patients did not receive any premedication. To reduce blood loss, tranexamic acid (10 mg/kg) was given at the beginning of surgery and repeated 3 h postoperatively. No surgical drains or bladder catheters were used in any of the patients. Spinal anesthesia was induced at the L2-3 level by using a 27-gauge spinal needle with a dose of 3 mL plain bupivacaine (5 mg/mL).</p><p>In group A, at the end of surgery a mixture of 150 mL ropivacaine (2 mg/mL) and 1 mL ketorolac (30 mg/mL) was prepared. 50 mL of the solution was loaded into one 50-mL syringe. 0.5 mL epinephrine (1 mg/mL) was added to the remaining 101 mL, giving a total volume of 102 mL, and loaded into two 50-mL syringes, which the surgeon used to infiltrate below the capsule, muscles, and subcutaneous tissues. The syringe without epinephrine was used to infiltrate skin and subcutis in equal proportions along the whole length of the wound. A multi-hole epidural catheter was placed with the tip in the joint. The catheter was tunneled 8&#x02013;10 cm subcutaneously and connected to an infusion pump delivering a continuous infusion (flow-rate: 4 mL/h for 48 h) of 190 mL ropivacaine (2 mg/mL) at 8 mg/h plus 2 mL ketorolac (30 mg/mL) at 1.25 mg/h.</p><p>In group E, a combined spinal-epidural technique was used. On regression of the spinal block, a test dose of 3 mL lidocaine-adrenalin (20 mg/mL and 5 &#x003bc;g/mL) was given to confirm extradural positioning and this was followed by a bolus of 7 mL ropivacaine (2 mg/mL). An infusion pump was connected with a flow rate of 4 mL/h ropivacaine (2 mg/mL, 8 mg/h) for 48 h postoperatively. 0.5 mL intravenous ketorolac (30 mg/mL) was given perioperatively and 3, 20, 28, 34, and 42 h postoperatively (in a total volume of 3 mL). Both groups (E and A) received a total of 90 mg ketorolac during the active treatment period.</p><p>For rescue analgesia, intravenous PCA morphine (concentration 1 mg/mL, dose 2.5 mg, lockout 10 min) was used. All patients received oral acetaminophen (1,000 mg 4 times a day), starting in the post-anesthesia care unit. For thromboprophylaxis, an injection of 5,000 IE dalteparin was administered subcutaneously for 5 days, starting 8 h postoperatively on the day of surgery. Ondansetron and metoclopramid were used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting. All patients received laxatives. At 48 h postoperatively, patients received controlled-release oxycodone (10 mg twice daily) and immediate-release oxycodone (5&#x02013;10 mg).</p><p>Baseline preoperative values were recorded by the anesthesiologist for each patient. Surgical time was recorded as the interval between skin incision and closure. Supplementary cumulated morphine requirements were recorded for 48 h. Intensity of knee pain was measured both at rest and during coughing (first 4 h after surgery) and at rest and during walking (6&#x02013;72 h after surgery) on a 0&#x02013;100 mm VAS (where 0 = no pain, 100 = worst imaginable pain). Assessments of pain, of occurrence of nausea and itching on a 3-point numeric rating scale (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe), and of vomiting and constipation (no bowel function for 72 h) were made by patients themselves every 2 h on the day of surgery and every 4 h on postoperative days 1 to 3, excluding night-time hours. The highest of the 4 VAS scores in each interval was used for further analysis. Urinary retention requiring catheterization (bladder ultrasound showing a volume of more than 350 mL) was recorded. Total time in the post-anesthesia care unit was also recorded. LOS was recorded using standardized discharge criteria. Patients were considered for discharge if sufficient pain relief was obtained (VAS &#x0003c; 30 mm at rest and &#x0003c; 50 during mobilization), if they were able to maintain personal hygiene, if they had a basic mobility score of 6 (e.g. were independent in being able to get in and out of bed, sit and rise from a chair, and walk safely with walking sticks) measured on the cumulated ambulation score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Foss et al. 2006</xref>), if they were able to climb stairs, and if there was an uncomplicated wound-healing process, uncomplicated clinical and radiographic outcomes, no evidence of deep vein thrombosis, satisfactory hemoglobin level, and at least 90&#x000ba; of knee flexion.</p><p>1 month after surgery, each patient was contacted by phone by the first author (KVA) for information regarding wound complications, infections, and thromboembolic complications.</p><sec id="ss3"><title>Statistics</title><p>Calculation of sample size was based on an expected difference of 40% in analgesic consumption. With 80% power (&#x003b1; = 0.05, &#x003b2; = 0.2), a sample size of 36 patients per group would be required. A conservative sample size of 80 was chosen to allow for incomplete data collection.</p><p>Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, Pearson's chi-squared test, or Fisher's exact test. Results are reported as medians with interquartile range (IQR) or as frequencies. A p-value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. EpiData, version 3.1 (EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark) was used for data entry, and statistical analysis was performed with STATA software version 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).</p></sec></sec><sec id="ss4"><title>Results</title><p>The protocol was violated regarding sample size. Due to a prolonged inclusion period, it was decided to terminate the study when 40 patients had completed the protocol.

To our knowledge, this is the first study that has had adjustment for the systemic effects of intraarticular ketorolac.</p><p>2 studies have investigated the effect of continuous intraarticular infusion after TKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">DeWeese et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Nechleba et al. 2005</xref>). Both of them assessed intraarticular infusion with bupivacaine compared to PCA epidural analgesia and placebo, and they found no or only poor effect. The negative results of these 2 studies are not surprising because of the use of drainage and relatively low analgesic solutions. To our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the effect of high-volume periarticular infiltration and continuous intraarticular infusion after TKA.</p><p>The quality of analgesia provided by the epidural infusion was disappointing. The concept of epidural treatment varies, and there is no &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; to which all other treatment regimes can be compared, and therefore the epidural regime chosen for this study may not be optimal. Epidural analgesia can be improved through the synergistic effect of opioids. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">Andersen et al. (2007a)</xref> found no difference in pain intensity scores between peri- and intraarticular injection of ropivacaine and ketorolac compared with continuous epidural infusion of ropivacaine plus morphine in 80 patients after total hip arthroplasty. However, they demonstrated an opioid-sparing effect and reduction in side effects using the intraarticular administration.</p><p>There has been concern about the risk of infection with the use of intraarticular or wound catheters after major orthopedic surgery. In this study, 1 patient developed a deep infection after a spinal abscess during the 30-day follow-up. To our knowledge, no studies have had the capacity to investigate the potential risk of infection by intraarticular catheters after TKA. In a metaanalysis of studies involving continuous infusion of local anesthetic into the surgical wound after various surgical procedures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> found that there was no statistically significant difference in wound infection rates between patients who received active treatment (0.7%) and those who received placebo treatment (1.2%). Studies investigating the efficacy of local infiltration analgesia after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty or TKA have not found any increased frequency of infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Bianconi et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Vendittoli et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Toftdahl et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Essving et al. 2009</xref>) but in most studies the follow-up period is often very limited.</p><p>In conclusion, the intraarticular technique offers advantages in its simplicity and minimal risk of complications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>KVA: project set-up, planning, collection and interpretation of data, statistics, and writing of the manuscript.
