It is unclear how dietary fat composition may alter these parameters. We hypothesized that a meal rich in n-3 (&#x003c9;3) fatty acids would reduce endotoxemia and associated inflammation but a saturated or n-6 (&#x003c9;6) fatty acid-rich meal would increase postprandial serum endotoxin concentrations and systemic inflammation in healthy adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Healthy adults (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20; mean age 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.2&#x000a0;S.D. years) were enrolled in this single-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Participants were randomized to treatment and reported to the laboratory, after an overnight fast, on four occasions separated by at least one week. Participants were blinded to treatment meal and consumed one of four isoenergetic meals that provided: 1) 20&#x000a0;% fat (control; olive oil) or 35&#x000a0;% fat provided from 2) n-3 (&#x003c9;3) (DHA&#x02009;=&#x02009;500&#x000a0;mg; fish oil); 3) n-6 (&#x003c9;6) (7.4&#x000a0;g; grapeseed oil) or 4) saturated fat (16&#x000a0;g; coconut oil). Baseline and postprandial blood samples were collected. Primary outcome was defined as the effect of treatment meal on postprandial endotoxemia. Serum was analyzed for metabolites, inflammatory markers, and endotoxin. Data from all 20 participants were analyzed using repeated-measures ANCOVA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participant serum endotoxin concentration was increased during the postprandial period after the consumption of the saturated fat meal but decreased after the n-3 meal (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The n-6 meal did not effect a different outcome in participant postprandial serum endotoxin concentration from that of the control meal (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). There was no treatment meal effect on participant postprandial serum biomarkers of inflammation. Postprandial serum triacylglycerols were significantly elevated following the n-6 meal compared to the n-3 meal. Non-esterified fatty acids were significantly increased after consumption of the saturated fat meal compared to other treatment meals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Meal fatty acid composition modulates postprandial serum endotoxin concentration in healthy adults.

Current evidence suggests that dietary fat modulates plasma endotoxin concentration which is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and is implicated in the development of dysregulated metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Endotoxin, also known synonymously as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is considered a major predisposing factor for inflammation-associated diseases such as atherosclerosis, sepsis, obesity, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the effect of dietary fat on the plasma endotoxin remains poorly understood as it is not known if it is the total fat content of a meal or its fatty acid composition exerts the primary effect.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that consuming a high fat meal (50&#x000a0;g fat) is associated with a post-prandial increase in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] endotoxin concentrations in adult humans. Limited evidence also suggests that the type of fatty acid may be important with one study showing that consuming oleic acid-rich peanuts reduced serum endotoxin in healthy men compared to when they consumed standard peanuts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent study reported that, using an ex vivo swine intestine model, mucosal to serosal endotoxin transport was decreased with a high docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-meal but increased after a saturated fatty acid rich (coconut oil)-meal; however, the inflammatory response in these animals was not investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>High-fat diets have been linked with elevated blood concentrations of multiple inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF- &#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As bacterial endotoxin is recognized by the body&#x02019;s innate immune system and is a potent initiator of inflammation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], a postprandial increase in circulating endotoxin offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, while blood endotoxin concentration has been associated with incidence of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and metabolic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], others have reported an in vitro<italic>,</italic> but not in vivo<italic>,</italic> postprandial relationship between blood endotoxin concentration and inflammation following the consumption of high-fat meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Because the link between dietary fat intake, endotoxin, and inflammation is unclear, the primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary fatty acid composition on postprandial endotoxemia in healthy subjects. Based on a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] we hypothesized that postprandial endotoxin concentrations and markers of inflammation in healthy adults would be increased by meals high in saturated or n-6 fatty acids, but reduced by meals enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Pre- and postprandial serum was assayed for endotoxin, inflammatory markers, and metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Human subjects</title><p>Male and female participants (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [(average age 25 y (SD: 3.2 y); average body mass index (BMI) 22.4&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD: 2&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>); average weight 65.6&#x000a0;kg (SD: 8&#x000a0;kg)] were recruited via a mass email to faculty, staff, and students of Iowa State University or through personal contact during Spring and Fall of 2014.

Participants were then provided with the relevant test meal that was consumed in its entirety within 15&#x000a0;min. On each occasion, participants were blinded to which treatment meal they would be provided that morning. All treatment meals were served in a uniform, visually indistinguishable fashion to avoid participant recognition of treatment meal. Participants remained in the laboratory for five and a half hours during which additional blood draws (10&#x000a0;mL per blood draw) were taken at time points t0+ 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5&#x000a0;h.

Although serum endotoxin was found to increase after a saturated fatty acid rich meal or decrease after an n-3 PUFA enriched meal, markers of in vivo inflammation were unaffected. Whether an elevated blood endotoxin concentration following a single high-fat meal may lead to inflammation in people is unclear as other studies have reported an association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] while others did not find evidence linking postprandial endotoxin with inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This inconsistently-described relationship may be, in part, explained because previous studies involving humans have not fully explored the role of dietary fat composition in mediating outcomes of postprandial endotoxin and inflammation. The present study therefore, to the best of our knowledge, is one of the initial studies to directly examine this relationship in humans.</p><p>A clearly observed trend was generated from the effect over time of test meal on subject postprandial serum endotoxin concentration (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The low-fat meal, which provided 20&#x000a0;% of its energy from fat, was included in this study in order to examine whether a meal&#x02019;s percent energy from fat influenced postprandial endotoxin concentration. Notably, the higher-fat test meals, in which each meal provided 35&#x000a0;% of calories from fat, were not different from the low-fat meal in their effect on postprandial serum endotoxin (data not shown). This suggests that in an isoenergetic series of meals, a higher percentage of fat does not differentially alter postprandial serum endotoxin concentration.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Effect of treatment meal on participant postprandial serum endotoxin concentration over time<sup>a</sup>

</p><p>Among the higher-fat test meals, we found that the fatty acid composition of the meal had a significant effect on postprandial outcome serum endotoxin (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In particular, the saturated fat and n-3 fat meals elicited opposite effects on postprandial serum endotoxin. A similar relationship between saturated and n-3 fats on serum endotoxin has been previously demonstrated to occur in swine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, in mice, a diet rich in saturated fat had no significant effect on postprandial endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The reasons why conflicting results would be obtained from different species is not entirely clear. The comparative similarity of study design between the swine study and the present study, which yielded similar results, included the selection of coconut oil as the saturated fat treatment, and fish oil as the n-3 fat treatment. Laugerette et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] recently reported dissimilar findings when using milk-fat or palm, sunflower, and rape seed oils as dietary treatments. Specifically, saturated fat-rich palm oil resulted in the lowest blood endotoxin concentration whereas rapeseed oil, low in saturated fat, resulted in the highest blood endotoxin concentration. Another reason for conflicting results is that the measurement of serum endotoxin in swine and our present study followed ingestion of a single treatment meal, compared to mice that were fed for 8-weeks on differing dietary treatments and then endotoxemia assessed. Anatomical differences between species may also contribute to the different results obtained in each species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For example, mouse intestinal tract physiology is less similar to human than is that of swine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>That the n-6 meal raised postprandial endotoxin concentration but was not significantly different from other higher-fat treatments agrees with previous findings in swine where n-6-rich vegetable oil was not significantly different in treatment effect on serum endotoxin than n-3 or saturated fat meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The postprandial trend in our data for the effect of the n-6 meal where serum endotoxin appeared higher than that of the n-3 treatment but lower than the saturated fat-treatment, mirrors the treatment effect trend found in swine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The intestinal epithelial interface is known to play a role in immune recognition between host and non-host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 is one of the innate immune receptors involved in the recognition of the lipid A antigenic portion of endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Lipid A often contains saturated fatty acids common in human diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. While saturated fatty acids and n-3 PUFA have been demonstrated to reciprocally modulate human TLR-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], saturated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the blood of healthy Malaysian adults due to dietary fat intake did not increase inflammatory markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Likewise, in our study, n-3 and saturated fat test meals were found to effect significantly different serum NEFA but not inflammatory marker outcomes.</p><p>Test meal fat composition and postprandial changes in serum endotoxin did not associate with in vivo inflammation in any of our serum samples. While serum endotoxin concentration did uniquely change during the postprandial phase of each test meal, none of the test meals of our study caused a significant rise in endotoxin concentration when compared to baseline measurement (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). One possibility for this observation was that the subjects were healthy, young, and fed only a single meal to assess postprandial endotoxin. Although a separate study reported a rise in plasma IL-6 at 120&#x000a0;min postprandial in healthy men after a single meal containing 33&#x000a0;g fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], we did not observe an associated peak of IL-6. Similar to our findings, others have reported no association between serum endotoxin and IL-6 in healthy men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An intake of approximately 24&#x000a0;oz of orange juice was reported to blunt the pro-inflammatory response and rise in circulating endotoxin following a high-fat meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. As the present study included less than 8&#x000a0;oz of orange juice as part of each test meal, it is unlikely that orange juice contributed a significant anti-inflammatory effect.</p><p>The occurrence of inflammation following feeding does not appear to be dependent on changes in blood endotoxin concentrations. While in the present study we did not find a significant rise in endotoxin concentration following the feeding of any of the treatment meals, other studies that found postprandial increases in blood endotoxin after consumption of a single high-fat meal, likewise, did not report changes in inflammation. In male smokers, plasma CRP concentration, an acute phase protein, was not found to increase following a high-fat meal despite a significant rise in postprandial endotoxin when compared to baseline measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Morbidly obese men that had measurable serum CRP before ingestion of a 50&#x000a0;g fat meal, but following consumption had no increase in CRP despite a significant rise in serum endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The absence of an increase in inflammation, including no detectable production of CRP, in our samples may be, in part, due to the exclusion criteria in selecting for volunteers for the present study. Undetectable concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1; in human plasma have been previously reported to coincide with measurable increases in plasma endotoxin after a single high-fat meal that contained 50&#x000a0;g of butter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although endotoxin may induce in vitro IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] expression in human endothelial and Kupffer cells, respectively, we found no in vivo evidence of this relationship in our samples. Likewise, a separate group also reported no association between in vivo measurement of IL-8 and the feeding of a high-fat meal in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This may suggest that human cell line production of certain pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines after in vitro challenge by exogenous endotoxin does not adequately mimic in vivo conditions after dietary fat intake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the composition of dietary fat, but not a meal&#x02019;s percent calories from fat, is significant in determining postprandial changes in blood endotoxin concentration in healthy adults in vivo. Although endotoxemia has been associated with low-grade inflammation, we did not observe an increase or decrease in postprandial endotoxemia to modulate inflammation. As such, we could not prove a link between postprandial endotoxemia and inflammation following the consumption of a single meal unique in dietary fatty acid composition. Postprandial endotoxemia was found to be increased following consumption of a meal rich in saturated fatty acids but decreased after a meal containing n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Future studies should investigate whether long-term repeated consumption of such meals would chronically influence blood endotoxin and presence of inflammation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHA</term><def><p>Docosahexaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPA</term><def><p>Eicosapentaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EU</term><def><p>Endotoxin unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GC</term><def><p>Gas chromatograph</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LAL</term><def><p>Limulus amebocyte lysate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NEFA</term><def><p>Non-esterified fatty acids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF-&#x003b1;</term><def><p>Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant No. 2014-67017-21778 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
