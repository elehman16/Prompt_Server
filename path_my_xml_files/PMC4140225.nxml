completed a core 6-week randomized trial in which clinically stable, but symptomatic,
outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were switched to lurasidone.
Patients started the extension study on treatment with the same dose of lurasidone taken
at study endpoint of the 6-week core study; following this, lurasidone was flexibly
dosed (40&#x02013;120 mg/day), if clinically indicated, starting on Day 7 of the extension
study. The primary safety endpoints were the proportion of patients with treatment
emergent adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, or who discontinued due to AEs. Secondary
endpoints included metabolic variables and measures of extrapyramidal symptoms and
akathisia, as well as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global
Impressions-Severity (CGI-S), and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS).
The study was conducted from August 2010 to November 2011.</p></sec><sec id="abs3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 198 patients who completed the 6-week core study, 149 (75.3%) entered the
extension study and 148 received study medication. A total of 98 patients (65.8%)
completed the 6-month extension study. Lurasidone 40, 80, and 120 mg were the modal
daily doses for 19 (12.8%), 65 (43.9%), and 64 (43.2%) of patients, respectively.
Overall mean (SD) daily lurasidone dose was 102.0 mg (77.1). The most commonly reported
AEs were insomnia (13 patients [8.8%]), nausea (13 patients [8.8%]), akathisia (12
patients [8.1%]), and anxiety (9 patients [6.1%]). A total of 16 patients (10.8%) had at
least one AE leading to discontinuation from the study. Consistent with prior studies of
lurasidone, there was no signal for clinically relevant adverse changes in body weight,
lipids, glucose, insulin, or prolactin. Movement disorder rating scales did not
demonstrate meaningful changes. Treatment failure (defined as any occurrence of
discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response, exacerbation of underlying
disease, or AE) was observed for 19 patients (12.8% of patients entering) and median
time to treatment failure was 58 days (95% CI 22&#x02013;86). The discontinuation rate due to
any cause was 50/148 (33.8%), and median time to discontinuation was 62 days (95% CI
30&#x02013;75). The mean PANSS total score, mean CGI-S score, and mean CDSS score decreased
consistently from core study baseline across extension visits, indicating an improvement
in overall condition.</p></sec><sec id="abs4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this 6-month, open-label extension study, treatment with lurasidone was generally

persistent symptoms, or experience side effects associated with their current maintenance
antipsychotic. Treatment strategies include dose adjustments, addition of adjunctive
medications, or allowing the passage of time in the hopes of achieving further symptom
reduction and the diminution of adverse effects. Another important treatment consideration
is whether or not to change antipsychotic medications. The substitution of one antipsychotic
agent by another is informally known as &#x0201c;switching.&#x0201d; Based on the above, it is not
surprising that switching between antipsychotic medications commonly occurs in the routine
treatment of schizophrenia, in an effort to find the optimal regimen for an individual
patient.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">

evaluate the long-term efficacy of lurasidone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Method</title><p>This multicenter, open-label, 6-month study was conducted at 26 clinical sites in the
United States (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01143090). All patients had completed the
6-week core study, the details of which can be found elsewhere.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref> All patients received open-label lurasidone. The study was reviewed and approved by
an institutional review board at each study center, and the trial was conducted in
accordance with Good Clinical Practice as required by the International Conference on
Harmonization guidelines. Compliance with these requirements also constitutes conformity
with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="general"><title>Participants</title><p>Key inclusion criteria for the 6-week lurasidone switch study that immediately preceded
the extension study were that patients had to be adults with either schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder who had at least a partial response to, and were stable on, a
first-line antipsychotic at a dose consistent with product labeling. Patients who were
unstable (eg, recent hospitalization) or known to be treatment-resistant (eg, prior
treatment with clozapine) were excluded. Patients also had to have a clinically relevant
basis to change antipsychotics such that clinically significant efficacy or tolerability
concerns had to be present on their current medication despite efforts at optimization.</p><p>In order to enroll in the extension study, patients were required to have completed the
6-week core study, be judged suitable for participation in the extension trial and able to
comply with the protocol in the opinion of the investigator, and to provide informed
consent. The remaining study eligibility requirements were similar to that of the
preceding core study.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="general"><title>Interventions</title><p>All patients started the extension study on treatment with the same dose of lurasidone
taken at study endpoint of the 6-week core study; following this, lurasidone was flexibly
dosed (40&#x02013;120 mg/day), if clinically indicated, starting on Day 7 of the extension study.
When made, dose adjustments occurred at weekly intervals and in increments/decrements of
40 mg/day, based on investigator judgment in order to optimize efficacy and tolerability.
The study drug was taken once daily in the evening with food or within 30 minutes after
eating. The study drug, packaged in blister cards, was dispensed by the designated site
study staff. Patients took the study drug at home following the directions provided to
them by the study site.</p><p>Consistent with the preceding core study, medications used to treat movement disorders
were not given prophylactically, but agents for emerging or worsening parkinsonism or
akathisia were permitted. Concomitant use of agents for the treatment of anxiety symptoms,
agitation, or insomnia was permitted during the study at the discretion of the
investigator, as in the core study.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref> Patients may have initiated and/or continued treatment with concurrent lithium,
divalproex, lamotrigine, or antidepressants during the course of the study. Patients could
continue to participate in ongoing psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions during
the course of this trial.</p><p>Compliance was monitored closely and determined at each visit. Patients were instructed
to bring all used bottles and unused study drug with them to each visit. Patients who
missed more than 25% of the scheduled doses or who took more than 125% of the scheduled
doses were considered noncompliant.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="general"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with adverse events (AEs), serious
AEs (SAEs), or who discontinued due to AEs. AEs were defined as events with onset on or

the extension study. AEs that occurred during the core study are reported elsewhere.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">

measures were obtained. Regular study visits were scheduled at intervals of 1 month, with
weekly telephone contacts between visits. A post-treatment follow-up visit occurred 1 week
after the last dose of study drug to assess any post-treatment discontinuation AEs. At the
follow-up visit, the patients were instructed to contact the study site if AEs were
experienced in the 7 days following the last visit. If the patient was unable to make the
visit in person, a telephone contact was made to assess any post-treatment discontinuation
AEs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4" sec-type="general"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The extension study baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment during the
treatment period of the core study. The &#x0201c;safety population&#x0201d; consisted of all patients who
signed informed consent and received at least one dose of study drug in the extension
study. The &#x0201c;intent-to-treat population&#x0201d; (ITT) consisted of all randomized patients who
signed informed consent, received at least 1 dose of study drug in the core study, and had
a core study baseline and at least 1 extension study efficacy measurement from the same
scale. If a patient had only a core study baseline but no extension study values, all
change-from-baseline values would be missing, and the patient would be effectively
excluded from the ITT analysis.</p><p>No hypothesis testing was performed for the primary safety endpoints for this study; only
descriptive statistics were compiled. Summaries of change from baseline in all continuous
efficacy and safety measures included change from core study baseline and change from
extension study baseline. For secondary endpoints, change from core study baseline and
from extension study baseline in PANSS total scores, CGI-S, and CDSS were tested with a
1-sample t-test of the least squares (LS) means. Least squares means were provided from an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and pooled center as fixed factors and
baseline value as a covariate. The same pooled sites created in the core study were used
in this study.</p><p>Additional descriptive statistics were compiled for both time to discontinuation due to
treatment failure and time to any discontinuation. &#x0201c;Treatment failure&#x0201d; was defined as any
occurrence of discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response, exacerbation of
underlying disease, or AE, and was the primary outcome measure of the core study.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref> Time to discontinuation due to treatment failure and time to any discontinuation
were compiled starting from the first extension study dose. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier (KM) plots were
created for both time to discontinuation due to treatment failure and time to any
discontinuation. Patients who did not discontinue were considered censored in the KM
plots.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 198 patients who completed the core 6-week study, 149 (75.3%) entered the extension
study. The first patient was enrolled on August 10, 2010, and the last patient completed the
study on November 28, 2011. A total of 98 patients (65.8%) completed the 6-month study. A
total of 51 patients (34.2%) discontinued from the study: 18 (12.1%) withdrew consent, 17

and trismus were each reported by 1 subject. The most common cardiovascular/metabolic AEs
were hypertension (5 patients [3.4%]) and hyperlipidemia (3 patients [2.0%]). Three
patients (2.0%) had a weight increase reported as an AE, and 2 patients (1.4%) had a
weight decrease reported as an AE (we note that weight change reported as an AE by the
investigator is complementary to the objectively collected quantitative weight data).
Blood pressure increase and hypercholesterolemia were each reported by 1 subject. Sedation
was reported by 4 patients (2.7%), and somnolence was reported by 1 patient (0.7%).</p><p>There were 8 patients (5.4%) with 11 treatment-emergent SAEs. Six patients had 1 SAE, 1
patient had 2 SAEs, and 1 patient had 3 SAEs. The most common treatment-emergent SAEs were
exacerbations of schizoaffective disorder (3 patients [2.0%]) or schizophrenia (2 patients
[1.4%]) and suicidal ideation (2 patients [1.4%]). Bipolar I disorder, paranoia, and
homicidal ideation were each reported by 1 subject.</p><p>Discontinuation from the study because of an AE occurred in 16 patients (10.8%). The most
common AEs leading to discontinuation were schizoaffective disorder (4 patients [2.7%])
and vomiting (2 patients [1.4%]). No other individual AE led to the discontinuation of
more than 1 subject.</p><p>No clinically relevant changes were observed for changes from core study and extension
study baselines to last observation carried forward (LOCF) endpoint in weight, body mass
index, waist circumference, lipids, glucose, HbA1c, insulin, C-reactive protein, or
prolactin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the median change

7% weight gain over the 6-month observation period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>). The proportions differed depending on the antipsychotic received prior
to receiving lurasidone in the core study. From core study baseline to extension LOCF
endpoint, the percentage of subjects with &#x02265; 7% weight loss vs &#x02265; 7% weight gain were 3.2%

13.3% for quetiapine, 22.2% vs 11.1% for risperidone, and 16.7% vs 11.1% for ziprasidone.
There were absolute mean weight decreases from core study baseline to month 6 for all but
the risperidone pre-switch antipsychotic medication subgroup (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>). The largest mean decrease was &#x02212;1.0 kg (ziprasidone
subgroup). Change in lipid and glucose variables from the core study baseline to month 6

ziprasidone pre-switch are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>.
From core study baseline to extension study LOCF endpoint, most patients had metabolic
variables that did not shift categories (ie, stayed in same category: normal to normal,
low to low, or high to high). Among the 72 patients with high LDL cholesterol values at
core study baseline, 22 patients (30.6%) had normal LDL cholesterol values at extension

<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th edition, text
revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were switched to
lurasidone due to insufficient efficacy and/or safety/tolerability concerns. The overall
safety profile was consistent with findings from previous studies, and no new safety
concerns were identified. The most commonly reported AEs were insomnia (8.8%), nausea
(8.8%), akathisia (8.1%), and anxiety (6.1%). There were no signals to indicate clinically
relevant alterations in metabolic variables associated with lurasidone treatment. Greater
proportions of subjects experienced weight loss &#x02265; 7% from baseline than the equivalent
amount of weight gain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>). In terms of
efficacy, there were consistent and statistically significant decreases in mean PANSS total
score from the core study baseline to all extension visits, indicating consistent
improvement at each month. Similar findings were observed on the CGI-S and CDSS. Positive
subjective responses to treatment with lurasidone were generally observed in PETiT scores,
SF-12, and MSQ changes relative to the core study baseline, denoting the acceptability of
longer-term lurasidone treatment after switching from other agents. Improvement in these
assessments, taken together, may also suggest the potential for enhanced adherence to
treatment with lurasidone. Few patients required emergency room visits, or were in contact
with the criminal justice system, as measured by the HSUQ. The overall incidence of
discontinuation due to treatment failure in this study was low (12.8%), with a median time
to treatment failure of 58 days.</p><p>Generalizability of the study results is enhanced by the inclusion of patients with
schizoaffective disorder who comprised about 39% of the sample. The study was conducted
entirely in the U.S., and the racial/ethnic distribution of subjects was similar to that in
the Phase II schizophrenia trials of lurasidone, which were also conducted entirely in the
U.S. In those studies, black/African Americans comprised the majority of study
participants.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">

duration, it may still have been too short to fully characterize lurasidone's long-term
safety profile. Moreover, the open-label design and lack of a parallel control group limits
interpretability. As with any extension study, there may be a decrease in apparent incidence
of some AEs if these AEs had led to study discontinuation from the core study or if they had
been transient or successfully treated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this 6-month, open-label study, treatment with lurasidone continued to be generally
well-tolerated in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who had switched
to lurasidone from a broad range of antipsychotic agents. The most commonly reported AEs
were insomnia, nausea, akathisia, and anxiety. There was no signal for clinically relevant
adverse changes in body weight, lipids, glucose, insulin, or prolactin. Patients were able
to maintain clinical improvement (as assessed by PANSS, CGI-S, and CDSS) over 6 months of
follow up. Positive subjective responses to treatment with lurasidone were also observed (as
assessed by PETiT scores, SF-12, and MSQ).</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Disclosures</title><p>In the past 12 months, L. Citrome was a consultant for, has received honoraria from, or has
