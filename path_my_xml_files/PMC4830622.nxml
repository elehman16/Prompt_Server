However, it appears that blacks (BL) may not exhibit PEH following aerobic exercise. Hence, this study sought to determine the extent to which BL develop PEH, and the contribution of histamine receptors to PEH (or lack thereof) in this population. Forty-nine (22 BL, 27 CA) young and healthy subjects completed the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to take either a combined H1R and H2R antagonist (fexofenadine and ranitidine) or a control placebo. Supine blood pressure (BP), cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance measurements were obtained at baseline, as well as at 30 min, 60 min and 90 min after 45 min of treadmill exercise at 70% heart rate reserve. Exercise increased diastolic BP in young BL but not in CA. Post-exercise diastolic BP was also elevated in BL after exercise with histamine receptor blockade. Moreover, H1R and H2R blockade elicited differential responses in stroke volume between BL and CA at rest, and the difference remained following exercise. Our findings show differential BP responses following exercise in BL and CA, and a potential role of histamine receptors in mediating basal and post-exercise stroke volume in BL. The heightened BP and vascular responses to exercise stimulus is consistent with the greater CVD risk in BL.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12PRE9610007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Huimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funded by American Heart Association pre-doctoral fellowship #12PRE9610007 to Huimin Yan.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blacks (BL) are at greater risk for developing hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke and renal disease than Caucasians (CA) [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Even young, apparently healthy BL, who exhibit comparable blood pressure (BP) to their CA counterparts, have greater macro and microvascular dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Histamine receptors 1 and 2 (H1R and H2R) have been shown to be responsible for post-exercise vasodilation and associated PEH in normotensive CA [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but the role of H1R and H2R has not been examined either at rest or during post-exercise recovery in BL.</p><p>PEH has been widely observed in both normotensive [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and hypertensive [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] CA men and women, with greater and more prolonged responses in hypertensives (-2/-3 and -9/-9 mmHg in normotensive and hypertensive individuals, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The prolonged hypotensive effect of regular exercise training in CA may be due to repeated instances of PEH [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of post-exercise BP modulation can serve as a model for understanding the effect of exercise and physical activity on BP. Little information is available on PEH in BL, but some evidence suggests PEH may be absent in this population [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], consistent with their higher risk for hypertension. However, the lack of PEH in those studies may have been a function of diurnal variation [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or lack of an adequate exercise stimulus.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which normotensive BL develop PEH, and which mechanisms contribute to PEH (or lack thereof) in this population performed during a standardized time of day to avoid diurnal variations. Examining these mechanisms will provide basis for further investigations in clinical populations such as hypertensive patients. The central hypothesis was that PEH would be absent in normotensive BL, but present in CA, and that the lack of PEH in BL would be accounted for by reduced peripheral vasodilation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was approved by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institutional Review Board and each subject gave informed, written consent before participation.

SV was calculated by subtracting end systolic volume from end diastolic volume. CO was calculated as HR multiplied by SV. Systemic vascular conductance (SVC) was calculated as CO/brachial MAP and expressed as ml*min<sup>-1</sup>*mmHg<sup>-1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Exercise protocol</title><p>Participants were encouraged to hydrate normally before arriving for testing. Exercise was performed in a temperature-controlled room (22&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) and water was allowed ad libitum. The aerobic exercise protocol required subjects to exercise continuously for 45 min at 70% HRreserve, which has consistently been shown to cause PEH [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Up to 10 min of warm-up was employed to ensure subjects reached their target HR. Subjects were asked to keep their HR at target HR&#x000b1;5 bpm during exercise. HR and RPE were recorded every 10 min during exercise and average HR (ave_HRex) and average RPE (ave_RPEex) were calculated. Water intake during exercise (water_ex) and during the study visit (water_total) was measured. Body weight was measured at the end of the study visit to determine fluid loss.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data is presented as mean &#x000b1; SE. Descriptive variables and baseline hemodynamic variables were analyzed with <italic>t</italic>-tests for possible racial differences. Three-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for possible condition, race, time and their interaction effects. Post-hoc <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted if the initial ANOVA yielded significance. We also conducted these probes using ANCOVAs controlling for VO<sub>2peak</sub>. However, using ANCOVA adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness did not alter statistical results, therefore only unadjusted data from ANOVA analyses was reported. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec015"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Subject characteristics</title><p>Of the 59 subjects initially recruited, 49 (9 BL men, 13 BL women, 14 CA men, and 13 CA women) subjects completed the study.

Our major novel findings were as follows: (1) DBP was higher following exercise in BL than in CA without histamine receptor blockade with no differences between groups in cardiac output; (2) There were greater increases in Brachial DBP following exercise during the H1R and H2R blockade condition compared to the control condition. Brachial DBP was also higher in BL compared to CA in the H1R and H2R blockade condition following exercise. Our data show that BL exhibit altered BP control not only at rest (which has been shown in previous studies), but also following exercise which is consistent with an increased risk of hypertension. The BL group in our study was also less fit than CA. However, after adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness levels, none of the results were altered, suggesting that our findings were not driven by differences in cardiovascular fitness levels, also consistent with prior research in CA [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Responses without histamine blockade</title><p>Post-exercise hypotension is well documented in CA, but several studies have reported either unchanged or increased BP following exercise in BL [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Enweze et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found no PEH in young, normotensive BL women 1 hour after cessation of 30 min of moderate-intensity cycling exercise. Furthermore, Pescatello et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] monitored daytime BP by ambulatory BP monitoring after 40 min of moderate-intensity upright cycling exercise. The mean daytime SBP after exercise was increased in both normotensive and hypertensive BL women while no change was found in DBP. In contrast, exercise lowered SBP and DBP in hypertensive CA women but did not have any effect on SBP or DBP in normotensive CA. Thus, prior studies support the notion that BL do not exhibit PEH following moderate intensity endurance exercise. Our data provide support for these findings as brachial DBP increased in BL, but not in CA following exercise. This is also consistent with the notion that a greater stress induced BP response in BL compared to CA, as BL have been shown to exhibit cardiovascular hyper-reactivity to stress with an exaggerated blood pressure response to both behavioral and physiological sympathoexcitation [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Post-exercise BP is modulated by changes in peripheral vascular resistance and CO [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Central hemodynamics did not contribute to the differential DBP responses, because changes in CO following exercise were not different between BL and CA. Thus, differential changes in peripheral or systemic vascular resistance/conductance likely caused the greater increase in DBP in BL.</p><p>Although previous studies have demonstrated significant contribution of the lower limbs in mediating post-exercise BP changes [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], femoral vasodilatation did not seem to contribute to racial differences in BP changes after exercise in our study. We did observe increases in systemic vascular conductance following exercise, but there was no significant increase in femoral vascular conductance in either BL or CA, even though both groups had increased femoral arterial diameter. In contrast to our hypothesis, femoral and systemic vascular conductance were also not different between BL and CA following exercise, and both BL and CA increased systemic vascular conductance. Since vascular conductance was not statistically different between CA and BL in our study, it cannot explain higher DBP in BL subjects. Headley and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] suggested that increased systemic vascular resistance in BL and decreased systemic vascular resistance in CA women following exercise was possibly due to higher renin levels and downstream vasoactive substances in middle-aged borderline hypertensive BL women. The discrepancy between their study and ours is probably due to the different subject population. Our subjects were young and normotensive. We also did not measure renin or endothelin-1 levels in our study, but endothelin-1 levels have been shown to be higher in hypertensive BL compared to normotensives of the same race [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, future research in hypertensive BL and CA is warranted.</p><p>Although it was suggested that splanchnic, renal or cutaneous circulation has limited contribution to post-exercise BP regulation in CA, their potential contribution to PEH in BL is unknown. Previous research has shown no differences between BL and CA hypertensive patients with respect to the hemodynamic characteristics of the splanchnic or renal circulation [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, BL patients showed a significant positive correlation between the levels of mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance while no such correlation was found in CA [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, at any level of mean arterial pressure or total peripheral resistance, renal blood flow was significantly less and renal vascular resistance was significantly greater in the BL patients [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our study, both BL and CA had normal kidney function because eGFR in both groups were well above normal values. Therefore, it is less likely that reduced renal blood flow in BL contributes to the increased post-exercise DBP.</p><p>Racial difference in DBP was not likely due to differences in hydration status or exercise stimulus because water intake and HR during exercise were not different between CA and BL. Regardless of the cause, the greater increase in DBP in BL is an intriguing finding and deserves follow-up in future studies. Increases in DBP of ~10mmHg or more immediately after exercise (up to 5 min) have been considered an abnormal BP response because it represents an unstable form of hypertension, and may be associated with coronary artery disease (Akhras et al., 1985). The clinical significance of identifying high-risk patients by the increased DBP following exercise in BL should be interpreted with caution because the magnitude of increase in Akhras et al.&#x02019;s study was greater compared to our study (10~15mmHg vs. 5mmHg) [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the use of an exercise test as a means of early prediction of hypertension in BL still requires methodological development and confirmation.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports, it appears that the decrease in SBP was likely due to increases in Systemic VC despite a small increase in CO [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the decrease in SBP, although relatively small (~2 mmHg) was significant at 60 min post-exercise. It is unlikely this is a result of an insufficient exercise stimulus because the exercise intensity and duration was shown to consistently elicit PEH in prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The less pronounced PEH in our study may be due to the nature of our young and healthy subject population. This is in agreement with the literature suggesting that the magnitude of PEH is greater in subjects with a higher initial BP level [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and several studies even suggested that PEH was only observed in young males with hypertension but not in age-matched normotensive males [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, we failed to observe decreases in MAP in CA up to 90 min following exercise, which is in contrast to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In general, 4&#x02013;5 mmHg decrease in MAP was observed following 60 min of moderate intensity cycling exercise in young normotensive individuals up to 90 min during recovery [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], while there was also evidence of 1.2 mmHg decrease in BP in young and healthy individuals following 120 min of moderate intensity running [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The discrepancies in findings between previous studies and ours may be due to the &#x0201c;placebo effect&#x0201d;, a phenomenon often observed in pharmacological studies of hypertension [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The subjects in the present study were given identical capsules of either placebo or histamine receptor blockades on two separate study days. The ingestion of novel capsules (even placebos) might elicit sympathoexcitatory responses and elevated BP. Subjects in our study may also exhibit higher cardiovascular reactivity from being exposed to various testing measurements in the lab setting. Although it may appear to be a limitation of our study, it should be noted that cardiovascular reactivity experienced in the lab is correlated with field cardiovascular reactivity [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Lastly, a strength of our study was a larger sample size (n = 50) compared to most other studies [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Influence of H1R and H2R antagonists</title><p>Although previous studies have demonstrated significant contribution of the histamine receptors in mediating post-exercise BP changes [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], in our study H1R and H2R blockade did not affect post-exercise Brachial SBP or MAP. There were greater increases in Brachial DBP following exercise during the H1R and H2R blockade condition compared to the control condition, possibly driven by diminished increases in SVC, despite a blunted increase in CO in the blockade condition. Brachial DBP was also higher in BL compared to CA in the H1R and H2R blockade condition following exercise.</p><p>The vasodilator actions of histamine may be at least partially dependent on nitric oxide (NO) [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. NO is tonically released from endothelial cells (EC) and is essential to the maintenance of vasodilator tone and homeostasis, which are adversely affected by CVD risk factors [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Using invasive techniques, BL have been shown to have reduced NO bioactivity in forearm microcirculation coupled with reduced smooth muscle vasodilator response to NO donors [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Forearm blood flow is also significantly attenuated in young BL compared to CA men following various pharmacological infusions including isoproterenol, methacholine, acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Additional evidence from in vitro cell culture models performed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, from BL and CA donors, also support differential responses between race [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. BL seem to have an EC phenotype characterized by heightened oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant capacity [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Considering the notable differences in endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent vascular dysfunction in BL compared to CA, it is possible that NO plays a crucial role in mediating the differential effects of H1R and H2R antagonists between BL and CA.</p><p>Interestingly, baseline differences between BL and CA in stroke volume and systemic vascular conductance were evident after the administration of H1R and H2R blockade but not during the placebo condition. Histamine receptor antagonists do not seem to cause non-specific cardiovascular effects in the absence of exercise stimulus in CA. Intravenous infusion of H1R (hydroxyzine) or H2R (cimetidine) antagonist or a combination of both antagonists did not alter HR or BP in CA subjects [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Oral ingestion of a H1R antagonist (540 mg of fexofenadine) or H2R antagonist (300 mg of ranitidine) also did not change CO, HR, BP, leg blood flow or skin blood flow under normal resting conditions [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153445.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The mechanism responsible for lower stroke volume and systemic vascular conductance at rest in BL after H1R and H2R blockade in our current study at is not clear. It is possible that BL are more responsive to H1R and H2R blockade compared to CA. Infusion of histamine has been shown to increase cardiac contractility as percentage cardiac fractional shortening increased from 38.2 &#x000b1; 4.1 to 53.5 &#x000b1; 3.6% and mean fiber shortening velocity increased from 1.31 &#x000b1; 0.19 to 1.99 &#x000b1; 0.22 cm/s. These changes were both greatly reduced by H2R blockade along with H1R blockade [<xref rid="pone.0153445.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. BL may have decreased cardiac contractility in response to the H1R and H2R blockades even at rest without infusion of additional histamine and the hyper-responsiveness to H1R and H2R blockade remained during post-exercise recovery. This may explain the observed lower stroke volume in BL compared to CA during recovery from exercise during H1R and H2R blockaded trial in our study.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Limitations</title><p>We acknowledge potential limitations of the present study. We were unable to identity the countries of origin in our participants of blacks and Caucasians and there may be diversity within the descent populations potentially associated with disperse genetic influences.

Moreover, DBP is also elevated in BL after exercise with histamine receptor blockade. However, H1R and H2R blockade elicited differential responses in cardiac function between BL and CA following exercise, suggesting a potential role of histamine receptors in mediating post-exercise BP in BL. The heightened BP and vascular responses to exercise stimulus is consistent with the greater CVD risk in BL.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Supported by the American Heart Association pre-doctoral fellowship (#12PRE9610007).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0153445.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Vita</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Nitric oxide and vascular reactivity in African American patients with hypertension</article-title>. <source>J Card Fail</source>. <year>2003</year>;<volume>9</volume>(<issue>5 Suppl Nitric Oxide</issue>):<fpage>S199</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>204</lpage>; discussion S5-9.
