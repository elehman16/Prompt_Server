fibre, polyphenols and a number of vitamins and minerals, in addition to being rich in
fructose. In light of evidence demonstrating improvements in glycaemic control with
moderate fructose intake and low-glycaemic index (GI) fruits, our aim was to determine the
GI, insulin index (II) and postprandial responses to raisins in an acute feeding setting.
A total of ten healthy participants (four male and six female) consumed breakfast study
meals on four occasions over a 2- to 8-week period: meal 1: white bread (WB) (108&#x000a0;g WB;
50&#x000a0;g available carbohydrate) served as the control and was consumed on two separate
occasions; meal 2: raisins (R50) (69&#x000a0;g raisins; 50&#x000a0;g available carbohydrate); and meal 3:
raisins (R20) (one serving, 28&#x000a0;g raisins; 20&#x000a0;g available carbohydrate). Postprandial
glucose and insulin were measured over a 2&#x000a0;h period for the determination of GI, glycaemic
load (GL) and II. The raisin meals, R50 and R20, resulted in significantly reduced
postprandial glucose and insulin responses when compared with WB
(<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;05). Furthermore, raisins were determined to be low-GI, -GL
and -II foods. The favourable effect of raisins on postprandial glycaemic response, their
insulin-sparing effect and low GI combined with their other metabolic benefits may
indicate that raisins are a healthy choice not only for the general population but also
for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Raisins</kwd><kwd>Dried fruit</kwd><kwd>Glycaemic index</kwd><kwd>Glycaemic load</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>GI, glycaemic index</kwd><kwd>GL, glycaemic load</kwd><kwd>iAUC, incremental AUC </kwd><kwd>R20, raisins (20&#x000a0;g available carbohydrate)</kwd><kwd>R50, raisins (50&#x000a0;g available carbohydrate)</kwd><kwd>WB, white bread</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="27"/><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Raisins are one of the most commonly consumed dried fruits, are eaten across the globe, and
have a unique nutrient profile that may confer distinctive health benefits when compared with
other fruit. Raisins are a rich source of polyphenols and phenolic acids, which may serve as
antioxidants and promote an anti-inflammatory environment with potential health
benefits<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Raisins are also high in dietary fibre and prebiotics, such as inulin,
which have been shown to produce a healthier colonic microflora profile in addition to
possibly aiding weight management and reducing the risk of CVD<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">

</xref><sup>)</sup>. A clinical study found that raisins as part of a healthy diet improved
blood lipids and reduced other risk factors for CVD<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Raisins are also high in fructose, which has a low glycaemic index (GI). While concerns have
been raised that fructose may have adverse metabolic effects and promote weight gain, a recent
meta-analysis<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that moderate intakes of fructose may improve glycaemic
control, without harming cardiometabolic risk factors<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is especially important in light of recent evidence demonstrating
that low-GI fruits may improve glycaemic and cardiovascular markers, including HbA1c and blood
pressure<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Given that raisins are the most commonly consumed dried fruit, are high in fructose and the
controversy surrounding the cardiometabolic effects of fructose, we investigated the effect of
raisins on postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia in an acute feeding study.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria included men or non-pregnant women aged 18&#x02013;75 years who were in good
health. Individuals with a known history of AIDS, hepatitis, diabetes or a heart
condition, or individuals taking medication or with any condition that might make

methodology (ISO 26642:2010; International Organization for Standardization). Eligible
participants were studied on four separate days over a period of 2&#x02013;8 weeks with an
interval of no less than 40&#x000a0;h and no more than 2 weeks between tests. On each test day,
participants came to the clinic in the morning after a 10&#x02013;14&#x000a0;h overnight fast.
Participants were asked to maintain stable dietary and activity habits throughout their
participation in the study. If any participant was not feeling well or had not complied
with the preceding experimental conditions, the test was not carried out and was
rescheduled for another day. On each test occasion participants were weighed, and two
fasting blood samples were obtained by finger-stick at 5-min intervals. Finger-stick blood
samples were collected from hands warmed with an electric heating pad for 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;min before
each sample. Blood samples were collected into two separate vials: one (two or three drops
of blood) for glucose analysis and the other (between six and eight drops of blood) for
insulin. After the second fasting sample was collected the participant was provided with
the test meal. At the first bite, a timer was started and additional blood samples were
taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120&#x000a0;min. Before and during the test, a blood glucose test
record was filled out with the participant's initials, identification number, date, body
weight, test meal, beverage, time of starting to eat, time it took to eat, time and
composition of last meal, and any unusual activities. During the 2&#x000a0;h test, participants
remained seated quietly. After the last blood sample had been obtained participants were
offered a snack and then allowed to leave.</p><p>The present study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration
of Helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects/patients were approved by the
Western Institutional Review Board<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants before the start of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Study meals</title><p>Each participant participated in a total of four breakfast study meals. Two test meals
were consumed: meal 1: R50, consisting of 50&#x000a0;g available carbohydrate from raisins; and
meal 2: R20, consisting of 20&#x000a0;g available carbohydrate from raisins, which is one standard
serving (28&#x000a0;g) of raisins. The control white bread (WB) meal, which provided 50&#x000a0;g
available carbohydrate, was consumed twice. The macronutrient profiles of the study meals

provides a favourable postprandial glucose and insulin response. In terms of postprandial
glucose response, raisins elicited a swifter response compared with WB for the first 30&#x000a0;min.
This, however, was followed by a sharp decline and an overall lower AUC for glucose when
compared with WB (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;05), which is commonly observed with other
fruits. This postprandial glucose response pattern may be explained by the high sucrose
content of raisins. The sucrose would be rapidly digested and the glucose rapidly absorbed
relative to starch. However, the fructose, which is responsible for 50 % of the available
carbohydrate content of raisins, would not contribute to the rise in blood glucose. Evidence
from other studies suggests that the benefits of fructose on glycaemic control may extend
beyond simple replacement of glucose. Moore <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that the addition of only 7&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;g of fructose, levels which
are slightly lower than the fructose content of one serving of raisins, to 75&#x000a0;g of glucose
as part of an oral glucose tolerance test significantly lowered the glucose response when
compared with 75&#x000a0;g glucose with no added fructose<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. A potential mechanism of action for this improved glycaemic response
with fructose ingestion may be enhanced hepatic glucose uptake. Fructose ingestion increases
the hepatic concentrations of fructose-1-phosphate (first product of hepatic fructose
metabolism), which in turn competes with fructose-6-phosphate for binding to glucokinase
regulatory protein (GKRP). This leads to the release of glucokinase (rate-limiting enzyme in
the hepatic metabolism of glucose) from GKRP, causing hepatic metabolism and further uptake
of glucose and thus lower postprandial glucose concentrations<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. This glycaemic advantage with moderate intakes of fructose over glucose
is not a novel finding, and has been reported in both healthy individuals and patients with
diabetes in the 1970s and 1980s<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent meta-analysis put this link into perspective by demonstrating
that small doses of fructose&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;g/meal or&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;36&#x000a0;g/d can significantly improve
serum levels of HbA1c and fasting glucose levels<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, this daily intake level was not associated with any
adverse metabolic effects that have been linked to high intake of fructose such as
dyslipidaemia<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Also of interest is the low GI of raisins as determined by the present study (49 based on
the glucose scale). A previous study by Jenkins <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the GI of raisins to be 64. However, this study was conducted
on only six subjects. More recently a study by Kim <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> reported GI values of 49 in sedentary individuals, 49 in individuals
with prediabetes and 55 in aerobically trained adults. These results are very similar to the
GI value determined for raisins in the present study. The health benefits of low-GI fruit
were demonstrated in a recent secondary analysis of a clinical intervention that showed that
low-GI fruit consumption as part of a low-GI diet was associated with statistically
significant reductions in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and overall CHD
risk<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The original randomised clinical trial assessed the effects of a low-GI
<italic>v.</italic> a high-fibre diet on glycaemic control in patients with type 2
diabetes and included fruit intake advice as part of the dietary
intervention<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The secondary analysis included 152 patients and demonstrated that the
GI of fruit was an independent predictor of HbA1c reduction and that the lowest quartile of
GI intake led to the greatest reduction in HbA1c<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is important to note that in this study grapes were considered
high-GI foods (GI&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;90 based on the bread scale). However, the present study suggests
that raisins have a low GI (GI&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;70 based on the bread scale). The present study also
demonstrated that both serving sizes of raisins studied (69 and 28&#x000a0;g) are low-GL foods. The
beneficial effects of low-GI and -GL foods on diabetes and risk of CVD have been
demonstrated by a number of large cohort studies<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lastly, the type and amount of fibre present in raisins should not be
overlooked as another component that may account for the lowered glycaemic response.
Overall, the present findings support the notion that incorporation of raisins as part of a
healthy, low-GI diet in patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance can potentially
improve glycaemic management and provide additional cardiovascular benefits.</p><p>The present study also demonstrated that raisins lead to a lower postprandial insulin
response when compared with WB. This insulin-sparing effect may also be in part due to the
fructose content of raisins. Fructose is not an insulin secretagogue and, unlike glucose,
does not require insulin for cell entry<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The insulin-sparing effects of fructose have been demonstrated in a
number of other studies<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. While long-term impacts of raisins on insulin control require further
investigation, the present study suggests that raisins, through acute postprandial
insulin-sparing effects, may be a healthy food choice in patients with insulin resistance or
diabetes.</p><p>The major limitation of the present study, as with all acute feeding studies, is the
inability to translate these acute findings to long-term benefits. However, at least in
terms of the beneficial effect of fructose on glycaemic management, previous studies have
shown that these effects are sustainable over a longer period of time<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another shortcoming is the sample size. While the use of ten subjects
has been validated by a number of studies, nevertheless this sample size reduces the study
precision and may lead to exaggerated associations.</p><p>While the potential benefits of moderate consumption of fructose on glucose control have
been overshadowed by the adverse outcomes, especially on serum lipids<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, associated with overconsumption and over-utilisation of high-fructose
corn syrup in the everyday diet, the benefits of fructose as a component of whole fruits
should not be overlooked. Raisins are popular snacks that are readily accessible at a
reasonable price. Their nutrient profile, being high in antioxidants, dietary fibre,
prebiotics, vitamins and minerals, indicate that they could contribute to overall health.
While long-term studies are needed, the present study demonstrates that in addition to the
aforementioned benefits, raisins can acutely improve postprandial glycaemic control and, as
a low-GI food, may serve as a healthy snack, when used in moderation, in the diets of
healthy individuals and for those with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The present study was supported by Sun-Maid Growers of California, Kingsburg, CA, USA. The
