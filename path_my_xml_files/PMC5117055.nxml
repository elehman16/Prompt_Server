The primary aim of cold therapy is the removal of heat energy via conduction from the site of injury, in order to facilitate a therapeutic effect.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Cold therapy produces a number of physiological effects to the human body including a reduction in blood flow, oedema, haemorrhage,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> cellular metabolic rate, hypoxia, enzymatic activity and tissue damage.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Cold therapy has also been demonstrated to significantly increase the pain threshold and pain tolerance by reducing nerve conduction velocity and muscle spasm.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Cold therapy application varies with modality, duration and frequency.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> A number of different cold therapy modalities are currently used for the treatment of musculoskeletal trauma, ranging from bags of ice<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> to electrically powered continuous cold therapy devices.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The recommendations for the usage of the cold therapy modalities range from 10 to 20&#x02005;min (2&#x02013;4 times a day)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> up to 45&#x02005;min every 2&#x02005;h.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> To date a gold standard cold therapy protocol for the acute management of musculoskeletal trauma, which includes an optimum modality with the most effective treatment protocol, has not been established.</p><p>During cold therapy the dermal layer cools first. Deeper tissue and tissue adjacent to the modality gradually decrease in temperature, as heat is transferred via conduction to rewarm the superficial skin surface close to the modality.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There is a high correlation between skin surface temperature and intra-articular temperature during cold therapy. Skin surface cools in a very similar fashion to the deeper tissues, and therefore the skin surface temperature is a useful tool in measuring the effectiveness of cold therapy modalities.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> An effective cold therapy modality is one, which reduces skin surface temperatures quickly, not causing tissue damage and maintains these reduced temperatures over an extended period of time.</p><p>Many clinical studies have compared the effectiveness of cold therapy modalities on skin surface temperature of healthy participants with a single 20&#x02005;min application per modality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, repeated application of ice and gel packs is perceived to yield a more therapeutic effect, constantly withdrawing heat energy in the attempt to reduce inflammation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the postoperative setting, bandages used after knee surgery, have been shown to significantly impede the effects of cold therapy.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>We conducted a study involving cold therapy with compression on a rubber model of a human knee and compared the effectiveness of a gel pack (DonJoy-Orthopaedic Pty Ltd, Normanhurst, New South Wales, Australia) frozen at six different temperatures (1&#x02005;824&#x02005;364&#x02005;860 and 72&#x02005;h at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C) with an ice bag (ICE'N'EASY, Bokarina, Queensland, Australia) by measuring surface temperature. The cryotherapy was applied on top of a standardised surgical dressing. Results showed that gel packs were more effective at cooling than ice and water combinations, on average by 2.6&#x000b0;C (p&#x0003c;0.05).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>There have also been recent advances in technology to deliver cold therapy. Whole body cryotherapy (WBC) involves short exposures to air temperatures below &#x02212;100&#x000b0;C in a chambers containing two rooms. The first room contains a precooling room and then a cryogenic chamber. Cold water immersion (CWI) is a modality used by patients with rheumatic disease and athletes before and after sporting activity. A recent study compared the effect of 4&#x02005;min of WBC 110&#x000b0;C with CWI at 8&#x000b0;C on knee skin temperature, and if the modalities could achieve skin surface temperature required for analgesic purposes (&#x0003c;13&#x000b0;C), however, neither modality were able to achieve these levels.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Commercial devices, such as Game Ready (CoolSystems, Inc., Concord, California, USA)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> have been used more often in the outpatient setting. This device provides intermittent pneumatic compression while delivering cryotherapy to the patient. A recent study compared the effects of Game Ready (CoolSystems, Inc., Concord, California, USA) versus ice wrap on pain in patients in the postoperative week, following subacromial decompression and rotator cuff repair. The results showed that Game Ready (CoolSystems, Inc., Concord, California, USA) was not superior over the ice wrap in reducing pain or narcotic use.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Another study compared the cooling effects of six different modalities on quadriceps intramuscular temperature.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These included Game Ready (CoolSystems, Inc., Concord, California, USA), ice and ice wrap. This study concluded that ice and ice wrap should be used as modalities in the treatment of injuries given that they produced intramuscular temperatures lower than that of Game Ready (CoolSystems, Inc., Concord, California, USA).</p><p>To our knowledge, however, there have been no studies, which measure the progressive effect of ice bags and gel packs on human knee skin surface temperature of healthy participants, with a surgical dressing, for more than 3&#x02005;h.

Cold therapy was applied for 20&#x02005;min every hour for 4&#x02005;h. After the first application, the ice bag was more effective at reducing skin surface temperature, and had a greater cooling rate than the gel pack. However, in the subsequent three applications, both modalities were just as effective at reducing skin temperature from the initial baseline and both modalities cooled at similar rates. Both modalities had similar increases in skin surface temperature throughout all the recovery periods.</p><p>To our knowledge there are no other studies that have monitored multiple applications of the same cryotherapy, along with the recovery periods. The recovery period signifies the manner in which the tissue returns to physiological baseline. Using our protocol we have noticed that with each application there is an accumulative effect in reduction of skin surface temperature.</p><p>This study follows on from Lam <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> which assessed the effectiveness of gel packs and ice bags on a rubber knee model, and concluded that the gel pack was more effective at reducing surface temperature than an ice bag. Their study showed that after 20&#x02005;min, the ice bag had reduced surface temperature by 10.2&#x000b0;C (from 24.3&#x000b0;C), while the gel pack had reduced surface temperature by 13.7&#x000b0;C (from 24.4&#x000b0;C).</p><p>In contrast, this study evaluated skin surface temperature using knees from healthy human participants. The initial temperature of the human knee was approximately 3&#x000b0;C warmer than the rubber knee model. Our study showed that after the initial 20&#x02005;mi application, there was a reduction in skin surface temperature of 5&#x000b0;C and 4&#x000b0;C, respectively, for the participants in the ice bag and gel pack groups. In comparison, the knee model study<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> showed that after initial 20&#x02005;min of application there was a reduction in surface temperature of 10.2&#x000b0;C and 13.7&#x000b0;C, respectively, for the ice bag (with ice shavings and water) and the gel pack (frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for 36&#x02005;h). The reason for the differences between the effects of the cold therapy devices on the human leg, compared to the rubber model can be explained by the rewarming of the superficial area by the deeper tissue in the human leg.</p><p>Previous studies have assessed the effectiveness<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and efficiency<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> of ice packs, ice bags, gel packs, frozen peas and other modalities on healthy human participants with a single application and in sessions up to 2&#x02005;h.

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and more efficient<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> than gel at reducing skin surface temperature in healthy human participants. A possible explanation for the ice bag's effectiveness during a single application might be its ability to absorb more heat as it goes through a state of physical change (melts from ice to water). Gel has a much lower preapplication temperature but does not melt. Fourier's law of thermal conductivity states the importance of a steep temperature difference between two objects, in order to facilitate heat transfer.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In theory then, a cooler gel pack should lower skin surface temperature more effectively than the ice bag, but this law does not take into account the energy needed for phase change, which occurs with ice.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Studies have shown that secondary tissue damage after surgery<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and nerve conduction velocity<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> can be reduced, if the skin temperature is maintained between 10&#x000b0;C and 15&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02013;20&#x02005;min. Our results indicate that after 4&#x02005;h with our protocol of applications every hour, the skin surface temperature of healthy participants in the gel and ice groups were 20.8&#x000b0;C and 20.7&#x000b0;C, with a fall in temperature of 6.6&#x000b0;C and 6.5&#x000b0;C, respectively. It should be noted that bandages have also been shown to significantly impede the cooling ability of the cold therapy on the knee.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> There are no studies to our knowledge that compare the continuous cooling effect of gel and ice modalities, using our protocol, with the inclusion of a surgical dressing. Thus an application time longer than 20&#x02005;min is perhaps necessary when using our protocol, for gel packs and ice bags to achieve a therapeutic effect in the postoperative knee. However, this might increase the risk of cold injury.</p><p>The limitations of this study included that the sample size was relatively small comprising of only nine participants. There was not an even amount of male and female participants (8 males and 1 female). A test to assess the adipose thickness of the knees of the participants was not included. We only tested two cold therapy modalities. These results may not apply to other types of dressing used following orthopaedic surgery to the knee. Another important factor that must be addressed is that the modalities had differed in surface areas. Owing to the large difference in surface area of the two modalities, it could effect the reduction in skin surface temperature.</p><p>The strengths of the study were that the experiment involved healthy participants. Skin surface temperature was monitored and sampled every minute during the entire experiment. The experiment took place in a temperature-controlled environment. A surgical dressing applied over the knee was used to replicate a surgical dressing possibly used after a knee arthroscopy. This is the only study that tested the progressive effect of ice bag and gel pack on the skin surface temperature of healthy participants, with a standard surgical dressing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ice bag was more effective than the gel pack at reducing knee skin surface temperature, in the first application of 20&#x02005;min.
