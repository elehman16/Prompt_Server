Pre- and probiotics offer an opportunity to modulate anti-viral defenses and the response to vaccination via alteration of the gut microbiota. This study investigated the effect of a novel probiotic, <italic>Bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis</italic> CCUG 52,486, combined with a prebiotic, gluco-oligosaccharide (<italic>B. longum</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;Gl-OS), on the response to seasonal influenza vaccination in young and older subjects in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, taking into account the influence of immunosenescence markers at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in total antibody titres, vaccine-specific IgA, IgM and IgG and seroprotection to all three subunits of the vaccine in both young and older subjects, and in general, the increases in young subjects were greater. There was little effect of the synbiotic, although it tended to reduce seroconversion to the Brisbane subunit of the vaccine and the vaccine-specific IgG response in older subjects. Immunological characterization revealed that older subjects randomized to the synbiotic had a significantly higher number of senescent (CD28<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD57<sup>+</sup>) helper T cells at baseline compared with those randomized to the placebo, and they also had significantly higher plasma levels of anti-CMV IgG and a greater tendency for CMV seropositivity. Moreover, higher numbers of CD28<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD57<sup>+</sup> helper T cells were associated with failure to seroconvert to Brisbane, strongly suggesting that the subjects randomized to the synbiotic were already at a significant disadvantage in terms of likely ability to respond to the vaccine compared with those randomized to the placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ageing was associated with marked impairment of the antibody response to influenza vaccination in older subjects and the synbiotic failed to reverse this impairment. However, the older subjects randomized to the synbiotic were at a significant disadvantage due to a greater degree of immunosenscence at baseline compared with those randomized to the placebo. Thus, baseline differences in immunosenescence between the randomized groups are likely to have influenced the outcome of the intervention, highlighting the need for detailed immunological characterization of subjects prior to interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">NCT01066377</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12979-016-0061-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ageing</kwd><kwd>Influenza</kwd><kwd>Prebiotic</kwd><kwd>Probiotic</kwd><kwd>Vaccination</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H00470X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaqoob</surname><given-names>Parveen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Influenza is a major cause of death in older people and while vaccination offers a prophylactic solution for preventing infection and associated complications, immunosenescence significantly impairs vaccine efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Potential adjuvants and dietary strategies to improve the immune response to influenza vaccines are therefore of interest, particularly in older people. Emerging evidence suggests that the resident gut microbiota plays an influential role in shaping antiviral defenses and modulating the outcome of viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and this forms the basis for the hypothesis that pre- and probiotics may modulate responses to infection or vaccination.</p><p>Trials investigating the use of probiotics in prevention of common respiratory illnesses have produced mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], although a recent systematic review concluded that they significantly reduce episodes of acute URTI and antibiotic usage in infants and young to middle-aged adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Response to vaccination is increasingly being used as a surrogate for the response to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The majority of studies investigating the impact of probiotics on responses to vaccination have been conducted in healthy adults, and some show borderline effects of probiotics on serum or salivary IgA titres, although the clinical relevance is not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Studies in infants and in elderly subjects, particularly those examining the response to influenza vaccination, are very limited, as are studies on the effects of prebiotics on immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since ageing is associated with reduced biodiversity and compromised stability of the gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], as well as immunosenescence, older individuals may derive particular benefit from intervention with pre- and/or probiotics.</p><p>In selecting probiotics specifically for older individuals, Dominguez-Bello et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] suggest that &#x0201c;the healthy old, rather than the healthy young, are the best donors of probiotic species for old individuals&#x0201d;, because they may be better suited to colonization and establishment of a new equilibrium within an aged microbial community. The strain <italic>Bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis</italic> CCUG 52,486 fits this brief because it was originally isolated from a cohort of very healthy elderly subjects (independent life-style, free of chronic disease, and aged 90&#x000a0;years or over) in Italy as part of the CROWNALIFE EU FP5 project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it has been demonstrated to have particular ecological fitness and anti-pathogenic effects in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and it has immunomodulatory effects which are strongly influenced by the age of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, this strain has been fully genome sequenced so that genetic traits can potentially be related to biological effects. In this study, we examine the ability of <italic>Bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis</italic> CCUG 52,486, combined with a gluco-oligosaccharide prebiotic (Gl-OS), to modulate the response to seasonal influenza vaccination in a cohort of healthy young and older subjects. We also examine the extent to which baseline markers of immunosenescence influenced the outcome of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subject characteristics</title><p>The characteristics of the subjects recruited to the study are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Intervention with a novel synbiotic, <italic>B. longum</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;Gl-OS failed to reverse this impairment in older subjects, and in fact there were trends for reduced seroconversion to the Brisbane subunit and a reduced IgG response. However, further immunological characterization revealed a greater degree of immunosenescence at baseline in older subjects randomized to the synbiotic, which could explain the particularly poor response of these subjects to the vaccination. This demonstrates, for the first time, that the interpretation of interventions examining the response to vaccination in older people may be highly dependent on their baseline immunological phenotype.</p><p>While there is general consensus that ageing impairs the response to influenza vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], there are very few robust studies specifically comparing responses of young and older subjects, and the most comprehensive information available is from a meta-analysis published in 2006, which concluded that clinical vaccine efficacy in older subjects was only 17&#x02013;53&#x000a0;% compared with 70&#x02013;90&#x000a0;% in young subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the current study, antibody responses to all three subunits of the influenza vaccine were impaired in the older subjects and there was significantly greater seroprotection to the H1N1 and Brisbane subunits and seroconversion to the H3N2 and Brisbane subunits in the young subjects after vaccination. Accounting for differences in baseline seroprotection between individuals and groups was a particular challenge in the current study since the B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain had previously been used in the trivalent vaccine in the 2009/2010 season and the H1N1 strain had previously been used in the monovalent swine flu vaccination during the pandemic of 2009/2010 (although only three subjects had previously been vaccinated with this). In the current study, individuals who were seroprotected at baseline were not excluded because it was considered valuable to employ a &#x02018;real life&#x02019; scenario. Notably, the older subjects had high pre-vaccination antibody titres to the Brisbane strain and a poor seroconversion rate compared with the young subjects. On the other hand, baseline seroprotection for the H1N1 strain was greater in the young cohort, yet rates of seroconversion were similar in the two cohorts.</p><p>To date, studies which have examined the potential adjuvant properties of probiotics given in conjunction with influenza vaccines in healthy adults have shown promise in their ability to beneficially modulate the humoral response to influenza, but robust data is still lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The effects of probiotics on the response to influenza vaccination in older adults is of particular importance, given the consequences of respiratory infections in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Among free-living Chilean subjects over 70&#x000a0;years old, a complete nutritional formula containing a range of nutrients and vitamins plus the probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> (NCC 2461) and the prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharide was associated with a significantly lower incidence of respiratory infection, but had no effect on antibody responses to vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Provision of a probiotic drink containing <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> ssp. <italic>paracasei</italic> (Actimel&#x000ae;) to healthy elderly volunteers (&#x0003e;&#x02009;70&#x000a0;years) resulted in higher influenza virus-specific antibody titres post-vaccination, although these differences were only statistically significant within the confirmatory phase of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A small study of 27 elderly (mean age &#x0003e;&#x02009;85) subjects provided with <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> BB536, reported significantly lower incidence of influenza and fever in the probiotic group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the largest study to date investigated the effect of <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> Shirota (<italic>Lc</italic>S) on the susceptibility to respiratory symptoms and influenza vaccination responses among 737 nursing home residents (mean age&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;year) and reported no significant differences in antibody titres, seroconversion or seroprotection 4 and 22&#x000a0;weeks after vaccination, and no effect on reported respiratory symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus the evidence is not clear cut and it is possible that there are differences in the immunomodulatory potential of different strains.</p><p>In the current study, the response of the young and older subjects to the intervention differed to some degree. In older subjects consuming the synbiotic, there was a trend for reduced seroconversion to the Brisbane subunit, whereas in the young subjects, there were trends for enhanced production of vaccine-specific IgM and, to some extent, IgG. Increased production of vaccine-specific IgM and IgG following intervention with probiotics has been reported in several other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The possibility that there is a differential immune response to probiotics in young vs older subjects has also been explored to some extent. You et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from older subjects (60&#x02013;85y) were more responsive to the immunoregulatory effects (IL-10 induction) of two strains of bifidobacteria than young subjects (18&#x02013;30y), whereas PBMC from young subjects were more responsive to the immunostimulatory effects (IL-12 induction) of two strains of lactobacilli. Further studies demonstrated that probiotics (including the strain employed in the current study) increased the responsiveness of DCs in older subjects to a greater degree than young subjects, but this was not sufficient to overcome the impact of immunosenescence in a mixed leukocyte reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The choice of probiotic, particularly for older individuals, is a matter of debate and it has been suggested that &#x02018;successfully aged&#x02019; donors of probiotic strains might survive better in an older host and achieve a more suitable equilibrium with the resident microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. <italic>Bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis</italic> CCUG 52,486 is an example of a strain present in particularly healthy subjects aged &#x0003e;&#x02009;90y, which has subsequently been demonstrated to have particular ecological fitness and anti-pathogenic effects in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and immunomodulatory effects which are strongly influenced by the age of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The effects of prebiotics on immune function are less well characterized than those of probiotics, but are suggested to be mainly indirect via modulation of the gut microbiota. In the current study, the prebiotic Gl-OS was used chiefly to support the colonization of the probiotic, and although an independent effect of the prebiotic on the gut microbiota cannot be excluded, the fact that the intervention increased copy numbers of <italic>B. longum</italic> while having no significant effect on the fecal microbiota at genus level suggests that the prebiotic was selectively supporting the growth of the probiotic strain <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The results of the intervention must take into account the potential influence of baseline differences in immunosenescence, which in the current study were revealed after the study was completed and occurred entirely by chance. T cells are particularly susceptible to senescence, resulting in loss of CD28; repeated antigenic exposure, for example to cytomegalovirus (CMV), is suggested to play a major role in this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Latent infection with CMV has been demonstrated to result in a poor response to infection and vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the current study, not only did older subjects randomized to the synbiotic have a significantly higher number of senescent (CD28<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD57<sup>+</sup>) helper T cells at baseline compared with those randomized to the placebo, they also had significantly higher plasma levels of anti-CMV IgG and a greater tendency for CMV seropositivity. Moreover, higher numbers of CD28<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD57<sup>+</sup> helper T cells were associated with failure to seroconvert to Brisbane, strongly suggesting that the subjects randomized to the synbiotic were already at a significant disadvantage in terms of likely ability to respond to the vaccine compared with those randomized to the placebo and that differences in immunosenescence between the randomized groups at baseline may have influenced the outcome of the intervention. Future work therefore needs to consider prospective randomization of subjects based on robust immunological markers; this is challenging given the wide range of potential markers and uncertainty regarding their predictive value.</p><p>In this paper, we report the effects of the synbiotic on the humoral arm of the immune response only. However, recognizing the importance of the T cell response following vaccination, and the potential effects of the synbiotic on adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we conducted extensive analysis of antigen-specific T cell activation following in vitro vaccine recall challenge. We observed that while the synbiotic increased the responsiveness of cytotoxic T cells to re-stimulation with the vaccine in young subjects, it decreased responsiveness in the older subjects (unpublished data). Thus, the impact of greater immunosenescence in the older subjects randomized to the synbiotic group appears to be significant, extending beyond the humoral arm of the immune response and influencing the T cell response to the vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate marked impairment of the antibody response to influenza vaccination in older subjects and failure of the synbiotic to reverse this impairment. However, the older subjects randomized to the synbiotic were revealed to be at a significant disadvantage due to significantly higher numbers of senescent (CD28<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD57<sup>+</sup>) helper T cells at baseline compared with those randomized to the placebo, as well as significantly higher plasma levels of anti-CMV IgG and a greater tendency for CMV seropositivity. Thus, baseline differences in immunosenescence between the randomized groups are likely to have influenced the outcome of the intervention, highlighting the need for detailed immunological characterization of subjects prior to interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Ethics and trial registration</title><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Reading Research Ethics Committee (project number: 10/09) the National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee for Wales (10/MRE09/5).

Power calculations were based on mean antibody titres. Since the influenza vaccine is trivalent, it is unlikely that an intervention will alter the response to all three subunits in the same way. For example, in the study of Davidson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], there was no effect of probiotic on mean antibody titres in response to the H1N1 subunit, whereas the responses to both H3N2 and the B subunit were improved (72 vs 51 [SD 16.5] for H3N2 and 31 vs 25 [SD 7.1] for B subunit). Based on the smaller effect size for the B subunit, a sample size of 26 subjects per group within each cohort was determined to be sufficient for a two-tailed significance level of 5&#x000a0;% and a power of 80&#x000a0;%; this was adjusted to 30 subjects per group to allow for dropouts. Data on the co-primary endpoints, immunoglobulin subclasses, seroprotection and seroconversion, is very sparse, but a sample size of 26 subjects per group within each cohort was determined to be sufficient for a 376&#x000a0;mg/dL difference in circulating IgG levels in response to influenza vaccination, with an SD of 438&#x000a0;mg/dL, a two-tailed significance level of 5&#x000a0;% and a power of 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

The synbiotic approach was selected because in vitro data examining the growth and survival of this strain indicated that it was very vulnerable compared with other strains, but survived much better in the presence of an oligosaccharide substrate (data not shown). When comparing a number of possible substrates, the low water activity of Gl-OS, combined with its ability to support the growth of the probiotic strain, made it a clear choice for a powdered product. This prebiotic also has bifidogenic effects in batch culture models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Microbiological safety of the product was independently verified by Leatherhead Food Research associates (UK) prior to commencement of the study and viability of the probiotic strain was confirmed on random samples on a weekly basis during the study.

For the primary and continuous secondary endpoints, a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) was implemented. A first order autoregressive covariance structure was selected AR (1), with fixed factors of time (repeated measures), age and treatment and subject as a random effect. The main effects are reported first, followed by all two-way interactions of the variables. Following this initial analysis, the data were split by cohort (young/older) and the analysis was repeated in the same manner to determine time and treatment effects within each cohort. Vaccine-specific immunoglobulin subclass data were analysed as change following vaccination. The distribution of the data was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If data were not normally distributed, they were log transformed. Antibody titre data were transformed with binary log (log<sub>2</sub><italic>n</italic>) and were not analysed as change from baseline. Seroprotection, seroconversion and self-reported illness data were analysed by the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.
