training on mood state in children from multicultural families. [Subjects and Methods]
Twenty-four children participated in the study. Eight children from non-multicultural
families were assigned to the non-multicultural family children group. The remaining 16
children from multicultural families were randomly assigned to the multicultural family
children (control, n=8) or multicultural family children trained in Taekwondo (Taekwondo
training, n=8) group. Mood state was measured using the Profile of Mood States
(Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia,
and Confusion-Bewilderment). [Results] Vigor-Activity scores increased significantly,
whereas Tension-Anxiety and Anger-Hostility scores decreased significantly after
intervention when compared with the pre-intervention scores in the multicultural family
children trained in Taekwondo group. [Conclusion] It is suggested that regular Taekwondo
training may be effective in improving the mood states of children from multicultural
families living in Korea.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Taekwondo</kwd><kwd>Mood state</kwd><kwd>Multicultural family</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Since the mid-1990s, a large number of women from developing countries have been
immigrating to South Korea through international marriages. As a result, the number of
children born to multicultural families is burgeoning<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. As of 2011, the number of
children from multicultural families had reached 155,000, which accounts for approximately
11.9% of the entire foreign population of Korea. This is a substantial increase from 2006,
in which the number of children from multicultural families was 25,000<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it has been reported that children from
multicultural families may be faced with serious difficulties in acculturation because of
differences in their cultural and historical background, language, culture, and education
methods, low socioeconomic status, and communication problems<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such difficulties with acculturation may pose a significant threat
to mental health. In fact, Kim et al. reported that the degree of acculturation may be
intimately associated with mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, and with
behavioral problems, such as delinquency, in immigrant children and adolescents<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, Moon and An suggested that
children from multicultural families in Korea show relatively higher levels of hostility,
fear, anxiety, and anger than do children from non-multicultural families (i.e., those with
Korean parents)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Taekwondo (TKD) is a Korean traditional martial art that is highly popular worldwide, with
more than 70 million practitioner from more than 200 countries<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regular TKD training has been reported to have various benefits to
children&#x02019;s growth. More specifically, Lee and Kim reported that TKD training is effective in
improving children&#x02019;s physical fitness and promoting physical growth and development<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas Lakes et al. suggested that TKD
training could be effective in improving not only physical fitness, but also cognitive
function in children<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite TKD being a behavioral philosophy that emphasizes self-control, respect, integrity,
and perseverance<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, studies investigating
the effects of TKD training on mental health are rare. Thus, this study aimed to examine the
effects of regular TKD training on changes in mood state in children from multicultural
families.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-four fifth and sixth graders (elementary school) were enrolled in the study. Eight
of the subjects, for whom both parents were Korean, were assigned to the non-multicultural
family children (NMC) group (6 boys, 2 girls; mean age: 11.8 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;years; mean height: 149.3
&#x000b1; 7.6&#x02005;cm; mean weight: 46.0 &#x000b1; 6.2&#x02005;kg; mean BMI: 20.6 &#x000b1; 2.0&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The remaining
16 subjects were born to a Korean father and a Chinese or Vietnamese mother. Eight of these
subjects were randomly assigned to the multicultural family children (MC) group (6 boys, 2
girls; mean age: 11.6 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;years; mean height: 149.4 &#x000b1; 7.3&#x02005;cm; mean weight: 47.2 &#x000b1; 8.9&#x02005;kg;
mean BMI: 21.0 &#x000b1; 3.1&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and did not receive any form of intervention. The
remaining eight subjects were assigned to the multicultural family children trained in TKD
(MCT) group (6 boys, 2 girls; mean age: 11.6 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;years; mean height: 150.3 &#x000b1; 5.7&#x02005;cm; mean
weight: 45.3 &#x000b1; 9.3&#x02005;kg; mean BMI: 21.1 &#x000b1; 3.6&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and participated in a 16-week
TKD training program. The institutional ethics review board of the Dong-A University
approved the study protocol. All subjects and their parents were informed of the study
procedure and possible risks involved, and both the parents and the subjects provided
written informed consent.</p><p>The 16-week TKD training protocol was conducted once per week with an HRmax of 50&#x02013;80% for
each training session. Each training session lasted 60&#x02005;min and included 10&#x02005;min of basic
physical fitness training, 40&#x02005;min of the main exercise (basic TKD movements, Poomsae, kicks,
and Taekwon gymnastics), and 5&#x02005;min each of warm-up and cool-down exercises (stretching).</p><p>Changes in mood were assessed using the Korean version of the Profile of Mood States
(POMS), which has established reliability and validity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> and has been adapted from the original version developed by McNair
et al<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This questionnaire consists of six
sub-domains: Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity,
Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise
stated. For identifying differences in normally distributed results, two-way repeated
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed. When significant group by time interactions
occurred, simple main effects were assessed using one-way ANOVA and paired t-tests. The
level of significance was set at a value of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The POMS scores for the three groups before and after intervention are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in POMS scores before and after intervention</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="12%" span="1"/><col width="13%" span="1"/><col width="15%" span="1"/><col width="14%" span="1"/><col width="13%" span="1"/><col width="13%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1">Variables</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">NMC group (n=8)</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">MC group (n=8)</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">MCT group (n=8)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="6" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tension-Anxiety (scores)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.7 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1 &#x000b1; 0.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.0 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.5 &#x000b1; 0.6<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Depression-Dejection (scores)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.3 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.2 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.3 &#x000b1; 0.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.0 &#x000b1; 0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anger-Hostility (scores)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.4 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.3 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9 &#x000b1; 0.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.4 &#x000b1; 0.4<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vigor-Activity (scores)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.7 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.3 &#x000b1; 0.4<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fatigue-Inertia (scores)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.3 &#x000b1; 0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Confusion-Bewilderment (scores)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9 &#x000b1; 0.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9 &#x000b1; 0.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD.

than 20% every year. TKD is particularly a popular sport among children, and more than
300,000 children apply for a TKD belt test each year<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have suggested that
regular TKD training may be effective in improving aerobic capacity, flexibility, and body
composition<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. It may also have diverse
benefits for children, including physiological benefits, such as improving physical fitness
and promoting physical growth and development, as well as cognitive and academic
benefits<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study conducted a
Profile of Mood States (POMS), which comprises domains on Tension-Anxiety,
Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and
Confusion-Bewilderment, to verify the effects of regular TKD training on the mood states of
children from multicultural families. The results showed that there were no significant
differences between children from Korean parents and children from multicultural families in
any of the six subscales of the POMS. However, the Vigor-Activity score significantly
increased while the Tension-Anxiety and Anger-Hostility scores significantly decreased in
children from multicultural families who participated in the 16-week TKD training program.
These results suggest that TKD training may effectively improve the mood state of children
from multicultural families and that TKD training may have benefits to mental health similar
to that of traditional aerobic exercise training. Regular exercise is effective in
maintaining and improving mental health by reducing distress and negative effects while
promoting positive benefits for cognitive, emotional, and motor domains<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and several
studies have used the POMS to confirm that aerobic exercise results in positive changes to
mood state<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. More specifically, Brown et al. reported that a 9-week aerobic
exercise program resulted in a significant increase in the Vigor-Activity score<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas Sakuragi and Sugiyama reported
that a 4-week walking exercise program led to a significant reduction in the Tension-Anxiety
and Anger-Hostility scores<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, TKD training during childhood has been reported to promote emotional and social
development, mitigate anxiety, improve independence and leadership, and effectively control
aggression<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, all of which support the findings of our study. Additionally, TKD
exercise was effective for improving Vigor, Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, and
Confusion among POMS sub-variables<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. As
TKD training helps children improve mental health as well as self-accomplishment and
fulfillment while acquiring various techniques, TKD during childhood has been reported to
promote stable and positive emotional development<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, we also consider that TKD-induced positive
emotions elicited changes of mood states, albeit in a limited manner.</p><p>In conclusion, regular TKD training may be effective in improving the mood states of
children from multicultural families living in Korea. One shortcoming of this study was the
small sample size. Future studies should incorporate other exercise programs into the study
design to verify the sole effects of TKD training.</p><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the
