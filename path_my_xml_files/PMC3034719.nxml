We describe the design of a two phased study, i) assessing the local tolerability and safety of topical ranibizumab and ii) assessing the efficacy of topical ranibizumab against placebo in patients who underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C combined with phacoemulsification and intra ocular lens (IOL) implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In the first phase five patients that had trabeculectomy with mitomycin C combined with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation will be treated with topical ranibizumab (Lucentis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) eye drops (2 mg/ml) four times daily for one month. The treatment will be started at the first postoperative day. Patients will be assessed for local and systemic side effects using a standardised schedule. In the second phase, after successful completion of phase 1, consenting eligible patients who underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C combined with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation will be randomised to either receive topical ranibizumab eye drops (2 mg/ml) four times daily for 1 month or placebo (BSS 4x/d for 1 month). Patients will be reviewed weekly for 4 weeks until conjunctival sutures are removed. Further follow up examinations are planned after 3 and six months.

This fistula allows aqueous humour to drain from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival space providing a controlled lowering of the intraocular pressure (IOP). The intervention was first described 1968 by Cairns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Today it is the most commonly performed surgical intervention for patients with glaucoma who are not sufficiently controlled with medication or laser treatment alone.</p><p>An increased wound healing response with scarring of the episcleral tissue or encapsulation of the filtering bleb is the main reason for failure of filtration surgery with consecutive loss of IOP control. To enhance the success rate of filtration surgery, wound healing modifying agents, such as 5-fluorouracil or mitomycin C (MMC) are widely used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>However, severe side effects from these drugs to the surface tissue of the eye are observed regularly. Especially corneal epithelial toxicity is reported as complication of antimetabolite-augmented trabeculectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, after the use of MMC thin walled, largely hypocellular and avascular drainage blebs increase the risk of wound leak with consecutive hypotension and bleb infection. A T-lymphocyte mediated lysis of MMC treated Tenon's capsule fibroblasts could be responsible for this problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>As postoperative bleb vascularisation and tortuosity of the present blood vessels are associated with scarring of the filtering bleb recently available anti-VEGF-antibodies could be an alternative to known antiproliferative agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Anti-VEGF-antibodies may have a more precise effect in modulating the wound healing processes than anti metabolites and additionally may cause fewer side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><sec><title>Anti-VEGF-antibodies</title><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was first described as a molecule that increases the permeability of blood vessels. Additionally VEGF promotes the proliferation of new blood vessels. The growth factor is essential for normal embryonic development and wound healing. In conditions with neovascularisation and in malignant tumors VEGF is overexpressed. At least 6 isoforms of this molecule are expressed in humans.</p><p>In wound healing cell-mediators and growth factors such as VEGF play a central role. As soon as the balance of these growth factors is disturbed, altered wound-healing processes with extensive scar formation can occur. For example keloids show an increased density of blood vessels compared to normal scar tissue. In vitro experiments demonstrated an overexpression of TFG-beta and VEGF from keloid fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It was also shown, that dexamethasone induces keloid regression by suppressing endogenous VEGF expression and fibroblast proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>A similar type of pathologic wound healing process could be responsible for the bleb encapsulation after trabeculectomy. Following trabeculectomy bleb failure occurs due to massive inflammatory vascularisation of the conjunctiva with associated migration of fibroblasts. Without the treatment of antimetabolites, such as MMC, this process may lead to scar formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This reaction might be triggered by several factors such as surgical trauma, the presence of aqueous humour or previous topical medication. It was shown that cultured conjunctival fibroblasts could be stimulated to produce VEGF by pro inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The effect of angiogenesis inhibitors on Tenon's capsule fibroblasts has been described in the past and it was shown an inhibitory effect of proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Based on these findings it is imaginable that a selective inhibition of growth factors such as VEGF could be an approach to prevent or treat extensive wound healing. Different anti-VEGF-antibodies are used to treat pathologic conditions with over expression of VEGF. They differ in molecule size and binding site at the growth factor, which determines if all isoformes of VEGF are inactivated.</p><p>Currently, two therapeutic Anti-VEGF-antibodies exist; bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Bevacizumab is used in combination with intravenous 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and indicated for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Due to its inhibiting effect of angiogenesis, Patients undergoing surgery during bevacizumab therapy are at an increased risk of wound healing complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The use of bevacizumab to treat a failing filtering bleb in addition to a needling procedure has been described in one single patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, topical bevacizumab has been used to treat corneal neovascularisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]</p><p>At the moment there is one trial planned to compare the effectiveness of MMC to ranibizumab in patients undergoing filtration surgery for glaucoma (Michael J Pro, Wills Eye Institute). In this study it is planned to inject ranibizumab into the subtenon's space once during the initial surgery. The disadvantage of this form of application is the short half life time of the drug. In our opinion, this form of application does not cover the main peak of scarring reaction that is occurring around 2-3 weeks after surgery. The advantage of a topical application for 4 weeks is a continuous drug level during this critical phase.</p><p>Bevacizumab has been used already in ophthalmology to treat subretinal neovascularisation in AMD and neovascular glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. By an intravitreal use of the drug no toxic side effects to the retina were observed in an animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Ranibizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody-fragment and therefore has a low molecular weight, which results in good tissue penetration. The antibody inactivates all isoforms of VEGF-A. Ranibizumab is used for the treatment of subretinal choroidal neovascularisation and injected in the vitreous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The maximum tolerated single intravitreal dose of ranibizumab was 500 &#x003bc;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Ranibizumab has a short systemic half-life (12 hours) and a long intravitreal half-life (6 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical safety summary</title><p>For the intravitreal use a monthly dose of 500 &#x003bc;g of ranibizumab (one single injection) was shown to be safe. With higher doses a significant intraocular inflammation was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is not expected that topically applied ranibizumab reaches the same intraocular concentrations as if it is injected directly into the vitreous.</p><p>When injected into the vitreous, sometimes a remarkable reflux of the injected drug into the subconjunctival space is observed. Even in these cases, where relatively high concentrations of the drug are reached in the subconjunctival space, no local or systemic side effects were observed in clinical practice.</p><p>In clinical use, topical bevacizumab has been used safely in a concentration of up to 10 mg/ml. No systemic or local side effects such as uveitis have been observed up till now.</p><p>In summary, there are no data about topical applied ranibizumab so far. However, the serum half-life time is short (six times shorter than in the vitreous) and the administered topical dose low. These data suggest that topical applied ranibizumab has a good safety and tolerability profile.</p><p>When anti-VEGF drugs are used systemically (bevacizumab), side effects such as gastrointestinal perforations, fistulas, arterial hypertension, proteinuria, arterial and venous thromboembolic events, wound healing problems, tumour associated bleeding and encephalopathy have been observed. However, compared to the topical application, which is planned in this study, much higher drug concentrations are used in systemic use of bevacizumab.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objectives of the study are:</p><p>- Assessment of local tolerability and safety of topical ranibizumab</p><p>- Assessment of efficacy of topical ranibizumab in patients undergoing trabeculectomy with MMC for medically uncontrolled glaucoma.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Before initiating this study, the protocol, the informed consent form and any other written information to be given to patients was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Lucerne Cantonal Hospital.</p><p>The study will be carried out in compliance with the protocol and the declaration of Helsinki, concerning medical research in humans.

Surgical interventions will be performed by one fellowship trained, ophthalmic surgeon. Fully trained ophthalmic specialists will perform the follow up visits. The investigator and all co-investigators have attended a course in good clinical practice and are certified. The hospital pharmacy that will perform randomisation and prepare the study drug is fully approved.

In addition to reducing bleb neovascularisation, angiogenesis inhibitors may have an additional potential in modulating fibroblast activity. Anti-VEGF-antibodies might be more effective in preventing scaring and might have fewer toxic side effects than the currently used anti-metabolites and may replace them in the long term.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FB, CK, CNB and MAT conceived of this protocol and FB, IG, MK and LMB wrote a first draft.
