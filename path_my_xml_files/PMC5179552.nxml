Strongly influenced by mental health service consumer perspectives, personal recovery refers to being able to live a satisfying and contributing life irrespective of ongoing symptoms and disability.

In Australia, for example, approximately 4.5 per 1,000 people receive specialist mental health care for a psychotic disorder each year, not including those treated exclusively by private psychiatrists or in primary care (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In spite of the routine use of antipsychotic medication, and efforts over the past two decades to ensure psychosis is promptly treated at its first emergence, health outcomes remain unsatisfactory for many. For example, the 2010 Australian National Survey of High Impact Psychosis reported that 92% of people seen in specialist mental health services have either recurring or unremitting episodes, 62% experience continuous symptoms, and 90% have deteriorated social functioning (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>For individuals who experience persisting symptoms and disability, <italic>personal recovery</italic> has become an important target of mental health services internationally (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Often contrasted with the traditional treatment targets of minimizing symptoms (<italic>clinical recovery</italic>) or improving social and occupational functioning (<italic>functional recovery</italic>), the concept of personal recovery has developed from the perspectives of people who use mental health services to prioritize more personal and subjectively meaningful goals of treatment (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A widely used definition is that recovery is &#x0201c;a deeply personal, unique process of changing one&#x02019;s attitudes, values, feelings, goals, skills and/or roles. It is a way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by the illness&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The literature on personal recovery has primarily been based on mental health service consumer narratives about the processes that have been most relevant in their own recovery. Although typically characterized as an individual journey, there has been convergence on identification of processes involved in recovery. An influential synthesis of qualitative studies on recovery has highlighted five themes, summarized by the acronym Connectedness&#x02013;Hope&#x02013;Identity&#x02013;Meaning&#x02013;Empowerment (CHIME): (C) greater social Connectedness, (H) fostering Hope and optimism, (I) transformation of Identity from one dominated by stigma and a passive patient role, (M) developing new Meaning in life, often deriving meaning from mental health experiences, and (E) Empowerment and responsibility for self-managing mental health (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The understanding of processes associated with recovery provides a framework for the development of novel interventions suitable for use in mental health services. This field is at an early stage. Results of the recent REFOCUS trial suggested that delivering training based on the CHIME model to promote recovery-oriented practice in services may have a relatively limited impact on measures of personal recovery (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). On the other hand, positive outcomes for measures of recovery have been found for a number of self-management programs, which include materials on recovery (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Notably, these programs tend to incorporate a strong perspective of learning from shared lived experience, with trialed interventions typically featuring peer co-facilitation and group format delivery, encouraging peer contact and peer-to-peer discussion. Peer-delivered services, peer worker roles, and peer-facilitated interventions have increasingly been a key component of this broader recovery movement (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In a qualitative metasynthesis of what people find helpful about peer support, peers providing a positive role model, engendering hope, and forming new connections were the key themes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Likewise, peer contact is often highlighted as having contributed to recovery in consumer narratives (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which suggests that hearing directly from others with shared lived experience may be a useful component in recovery-oriented interventions.</p><p>In the project reported here [Self-Management and Recovery Technology (SMART)], we developed and piloted a scalable intervention tool suitable for use within mental health services to promote personal recovery. In developing the intervention, we saw potential in creating resources in a digital format that could be incorporated into mental health service consultations using a tablet computer as well as being directly accessible by consumers (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Initial studies of Internet-based applications with people with persisting psychosis have indicated self-guided use of digital tools to be feasible with this population (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Moreover, the Internet is potentially empowering of people with mental illness in facilitating peer-to-peer connections (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and is a means of presenting lived experience material in video format that may be useful in portraying positive hopeful views of peers with mental health problems (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Hence, digital technology offers a number of possibilities for promoting learning from lived experience.</p><p>We developed an online intervention tool featuring lived experience accounts of personal recovery as central to a series of modules based on the CHIME framework. This paper presents data on the feasibility and acceptability of using this tool in sessions with a mental health support worker and provides a preliminary examination of outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Website Development</title><p>The website was developed through parallel processes of end-user consultation; content conceptualization and writing; development of lived experience video materials; and site design. The consultation process included a reference group of seven mental health service consumers with experiences of psychosis who met every 2&#x02009;weeks during the development phase; a series of focus groups with mental health practitioners from both clinical services and community support services (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), followed by a monthly practitioner reference group; and a further focus group with family carers.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Content Development</title><p>The development of content was an iterative process, combining the conceptual framework of CHIME with input from consultations and emerging content from the filming process. The CHIME framework was used to inform the main content themes, presented as modules as follows:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Recovery</italic>, comprising an introduction to the concept of recovery and aiming to use lived experience material to promote hope and optimism about recovery being possible. As the recommended starting module, this also included guidance on using the site.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Managing Stress</italic>, covering recognition of the relationship between stress and mental health symptoms; identification of common stressors; and coping strategies. This was included as a key element of empowerment in self-managing mental health.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Health</italic>, covering self-management of physical health and medication as a further key element of empowerment, with topics encompassing the link between physical and mental health; making changes in areas such as diet, exercise, sleep, and substance use; and medication.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Me</italic>, covering topics related to identity including the effects of stigma; personal growth through experiencing mental health problems; and focusing on strengths.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Relationships</italic>, covering topics relating to connectedness, including the interaction between interpersonal relationships and mental health; considering the range of contexts in which connections with others can be fostered; nurturing existing relationships; and exploring opportunities for new social connections.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Empowerment</italic>, covering empowerment in interactions with mental health service providers, including material acknowledging the power imbalance experienced in receiving mental health services; how to get the most out of services; and rights and advocacy.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Life</italic>, covering topics related to developing new meaning in life including consideration of the personal values that make life meaningful and identifying related goals.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The video material that was central to the site was developed by conducting a series of interviews with persons with lived experience of psychosis using a semi-structured interview derived from the content framework. To develop the interview questions, a working group that encompassed academic, practitioner, and lived experience expertise developed ideas for questions based on topics within the CHIME model for each theme, refined further with reference group input. Questions were developed to draw out the following: (a) how the theme had been relevant to the interviewee&#x02019;s experience (e.g., the impact of mental illness and associated stigma on how the person saw themselves) and (b) what the person had done to navigate that issue in their own recovery (e.g., ways in which the person had changed how they viewed themselves during recovery). Questions were worded to generate talking from a first person perspective reflecting on their own experiences (e.g., what they had observed from their experiences) rather than from a second person perspective (e.g., advice they would give to a peer about recovery). Each question was preceded by a briefing to orient the participant to the types of material the interviewer was interested in (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), with the interviewer actively following up material provided in response, in order to thoroughly explore the topic.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Example interview question posed to video participants</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyt-07-00196-g001"/></fig><p>Selected interviewees were first phoned by the interviewer to discuss what participation would involve and to ensure they had thought through the implications of appearing on film. They were then sent information about what their participation would involve and were provided with interview questions a few days prior to filming. To ensure that interviewees felt in control of the experience, it was made clear that the interviewer wanted them to discuss only things that they felt comfortable with. The interviewer revisited whether they were willing for the interview to be used after it had been completed, with the option of having any material deleted if wished. A film crew of two (camera and audio) performed the filming, using a two-camera set-up to facilitate editing, with the interviewer off screen. The interviewer used the semi-structured interview as a guide, but allowed the interview to deviate when useful material was being generated. Questions could be repeated to be refilmed if needed to improve delivery, or align with the first person experiential style of the interviews. At the end of the filming session, each participant was given the option to review a transcript of their interview prior to giving permission for use. Interviewees were paid for their time.</p><p>From a pool of 20 potential interviewees who responded to advertising, 11 were selected to form a group with diversity in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, employment status, and sexuality. Interviews were conducted until the material elicited was judged to have reached saturation in its coverage of the content domains; each took approximately 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;h.</p><p>An extended editing process aimed to generate a series of 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;min videos featuring a selection of four to six interviewees discussing key issues for each topic. Given that recovery is characterized as highly individual (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), we aimed to capture different experiences and points of view within each video. Interviews were transcribed, and each line coded by a member of the research team into the various video topics. The combined filmed material for each video topic was reviewed by the content group, with excerpts selected that represented the most useful or impactful material obtained while reflecting a range of experiences and perspectives. A total of 26 videos were produced using this method. Additionally, 11 videos were made introducing each of the peers.</p><p>In addition to these lived experience videos, five videos of mental health professionals&#x02019; experiences and two videos of family members&#x02019; experiences (produced in a similar way) were included as part of material on working with services and relationships. Additionally, 12 videos were produced featuring either a consumer leader or academic expert contributing additional material that elaborated on what was raised in the other videos or by addressing points that had not been captured by the interviews. An introduction to each module was also filmed, featuring a consumer leader as guide. In total 64 videos were included in the final package.</p><p>Text content and reflective exercises were added to summarize key points and complement the lived experience content with material from relevant therapeutic approaches (e.g., on implementing coping strategies, on changing health behavior, on identifying personal values).</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Website Design</title><p>The design of the site was informed by published guidelines for website development for severe mental illness designed to minimize the impact of difficulties in thinking and memory (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), combined with input from the consultation process, and consideration of how the site could be designed in a way that reinforced recovery. The site was optimized for tablet computer and mobile phone use. Navigation was simplified by organizing content in a minimal number of levels (topic, subtopic), making use of touchscreen scrolling to reduce the required number of page loads and having a single constant menu button. Links between pages were clearly labeled, pages were designed to have minimal distractions, and content was developed to be simple, clear, and logically organized. Key design principles derived from the consultations were (a) simplicity of layout and navigation, (b)&#x02009;flexibility in use (e.g., material can be completed in any order), (c) interactivity, (d) catering to different learning styles and preferences by presenting content in multiple ways, (e) access to any information entered being controlled by the consumer, and (f) promoting a positive emotional experience while engaging with the website (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Consideration of how recovery processes could be facilitated by the design and features of the site included the following: (a) promoting connectedness by allowing users to comment on material and contribute to a user forum on the site and allowing users to share content with workers, family members, and others; (b) promoting the person taking ownership of their identity by allowing personalization of user profiles and customization of content; and (c) promoting empowerment and responsibility in self-management by the ability to track parameters such as sleep and mood and to set and view goals developed from the material.</p><p>The site is accessible only by creation of an account, which enables the user to enter information in reflective exercises, charts, and task lists and to select a username and avatar for posting public comments and using the forum. Forums and comment feeds are monitored by the research team to assess risk of harm to participants, and participants are also able to report any offensive comments for moderator review.

The Questionnaire for the Process of Recovery [QPR; (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)], a 22-item self-report measure developed in conjunction with mental health service users to assess personal recovery. The QPR has good psychometric properties (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and was used because of its strong alignment with the CHIME framework (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, because it was a relatively new measure for which sensitivity to intervention effects was unknown, we also included total score on the more established 41-item Recovery Assessment Scale (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) as a second measure of personal recovery.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5-1-2"><title>Recovery dimensions</title><p>Hope was measured using total score on the Schizophrenia Hope Scale (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), a 9-item questionnaire assessing optimism and hope for the future, rated on 3-point items (<italic>disagree, agree, strongly agree</italic>). Social connectedness was measured using total score on the Friendship Scale (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), comprising six 5-point (<italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>almost always</italic>) items.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5-1-3"><title>Psychotic Symptoms</title><p>The interviewer-rated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS; (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)] was used to assess the severity of psychotic symptoms and their impact on behavior and functioning. The two research assistants were trained in the standardized administration of the PANSS. In addition, the Subjective Experiences of Psychosis Scale (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) was used to assess the subjective impact of psychotic symptoms in participants reporting ongoing positive symptoms at baseline. This is a 29-item questionnaire on which participants rate the positive and negative impact of their symptoms on aspects of their feelings and behavior, such as &#x0201c;hope for the future&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ability to socialize.&#x0201d; Subjective impact is rated on a 5-point scale from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>very much</italic> in the past week. The negative impact subscale score was used in analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5-1-4"><title>Emotional Symptoms</title><p>The 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS-21; (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)] total score and its associated subscales were used to assess emotional symptoms. Participants reported on their experience of symptoms related to depression, anxiety, and stress in the past week, on a 4-point scale from <italic>did not apply to me at all</italic> to <italic>applied to me very much or most of the time</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5-1-5"><title>Quality of Life</title><p>Total score on the Assessment of Quality of Life-8 Dimension [AQoL-8D; (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>)] was used to assess health-related quality of life. This 35-item questionnaire encompasses eight dimensions of physical and psychosocial health, with lower scores indicating fewer issues related to subjective quality of life in the past week.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2-6"><title>Process Measures</title><p>It was hypothesised that the lived experience content of the intervention would influence outcome by increasing self-efficacy for positive recovery, and by reducing the extent to which mental illness is viewed in negative stigmatized terms. The proposed mechanism was assessed by the following measures.</p><sec id="S2-6-1"><title>Self-Stigma</title><p>Self-stigma was used as an index of negative views of illness, measured using the 29-item Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale [ISMI; (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)] which includes subscales of alienation, stereotype endorsement, discrimination experience, social withdrawal, and stigma resistance. Items are rated on a 4-point scale from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2-6-2"><title>Self-Efficacy</title><p>Self-efficacy was measured using total score on the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), a 10-item questionnaire rated on a 4-point scale from <italic>not at all true</italic> to <italic>exactly true</italic>.</p><p>Additionally, qualitative feedback on experiences of using the lived experience videos was collated from the post-intervention interview. Use of antipsychotic medication was also recorded at baseline and 3&#x02009;months as a potential confound.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2-7"><title>Treatment Evaluation</title><p>Subjective perceptions of the helpfulness or otherwise of the intervention were assessed by the item &#x0201c;Do you feel that using the website made the impact of your mental health problems better, or worse, or no different?&#x0201d; based on an item used by our group in previous trials with this population (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). This was rated on a 5-point scale from <italic>much worse</italic> to <italic>much better</italic>. Additionally, 11 5-point Likert items were developed to assess whether participants endorsed changes having occurred in relation to material covered on the site (e.g., &#x0201c;I feel more hopeful about my recovery&#x0201d;). Questions were also included in the qualitative phone interview to gather feedback on use of the site during sessions with a worker, and on specific site elements including the videos.</p></sec><sec id="S2-8"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>In this pilot study, the emphasis was on examining acceptability and feasibility, as well as allowing a preliminary estimate of treatment effects, rather than using inferential statistics to hypothesis&#x02013;test specific outcomes. Correspondingly, effect sizes and confidence intervals were calculated for the mean pre- to post-intervention change score. Standardized effect sizes were calculated by dividing the mean change by the average SD of pre and post-intervention scores or, if variances were unequal, the baseline SD (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). A series of paired <italic>t</italic>-tests was also conducted to indicate where two-tailed significances fell within <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.

Two of these were excluded at baseline: one due to a recent medication change and the other due to participation in another research project. Ten participants completed the baseline assessment (nine males; mean age 42.6&#x02009;years, SD 12.47, range 23&#x02013;62&#x02009;years; six single, four divorced). Nine had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and one of schizoaffective disorder. None worked full time; two were in paid part-time work and one in volunteer work. All were receiving antipsychotic medication. At baseline, seven participants reported using the Internet at least daily, one once per week, and two &#x0201c;rarely or never.&#x0201d; Half of the participants reported that they &#x0201c;rarely or never&#x0201d; used the Internet to access information about mental health.</p><sec id="S3-1"><title>Feasibility and Acceptability</title><sec id="S3-1-1"><title>In-Session Use</title><p>The website was used in 76 of 80 sessions that were attended. Of the remainder, two were initial sessions spent assisting participants setting up email to use the site, and one was a final session consolidating the program material without use of the site. There was only one session in which the support worker was not able to use the site with the participant. Session notes indicated that the participant&#x02019;s engagement had been threatened in a previous appointment, when the facilitator misunderstood something that the participant was discussing, and subsequently directed them to an unrelated topic on the site. The session was spent having a broader discussion of recovery without use of the site to re-engage the participant, and the participant and the worker went on to use the site further in their remaining sessions.</p><p>Qualitative feedback on the use of the site in-session is collated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Responses suggested that the process of integrating the website as a tool in sessions functioned well.

It involved the novel combination of lived experience-based content on recovery, presentation <italic>via</italic> a digital medium, and delivery integrated with face-to-face mental health sessions. Overall, it appeared feasible to deliver an intervention in this way, and there were promising findings on the primary outcome of personal recovery.</p><p>Our attempts to develop the main content of the site by using a process of editing together various lived experience interviews showed this to be a feasible approach. We used 11 lived experience speakers to provide diversity in age, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality within the group, which was sufficient to produce material for all topics. Not all content within the topics was covered in this way, but complementary scripted videos from experts and text material was used to complete an effective website in which the dominant content was explicitly authored by peers. While many online interventions include &#x0201c;client perspective&#x0201d; videos to illustrate other material [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>)], this is the first online intervention, we are aware of, that has an explicit focus on lived experience material as the main vehicle for change.</p><p>Use of the site in-session appeared to be feasible and acceptable to participants. The website was used regularly in-session, no participants dropped out, and participants gave generally positive feedback about how the use of the site integrated with face-to-face work. It appeared from participant feedback that many would have found it harder to use or maintain engagement with the site had it not been integrated with sessions with the facilitator. The feedback is consistent with the broader digital mental health literature, where therapist-assisted interventions tend to be engaged with for longer than self-guided interventions (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). However, lower levels of use of digital technology (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) and higher rates of disability among persons with severe mental illness suggest some people may be more reliant upon support to utilize online materials. A blended approach offers a means of capitalizing on the scalability of digital interventions to deliver quality structured interventions, while bearing in mind the barriers to independent Internet use experienced by this group. Indeed, although most participants used the site between sessions as well, which was encouraged, not all of the participants in this pilot did so, suggesting that a significant proportion of people in this population would be reliant on in-session use. Indeed, it should also be noted that most of our sample were daily Internet users at baseline, so their existing levels of computer use were higher than average for this population (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Given our vision for the website as a vehicle to facilitate discussion between the consumer and worker about recovery, the modest between-session use was not problematic. A number of participants&#x02019; responses confirmed that use of the site did help them discuss issues which otherwise might not have been raised or would have been difficult to raise.</p><p>Video-based tools may have benefits beyond the present aim of facilitating discussions about recovery: future research could investigate whether patient&#x02013;worker interactions around embarrassing or sensitive topics (e.g., discussing ambivalence about medication) are supported by tools of this kind. The technology may have broader applications in practice, such as in promoting supported decision making [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>)], or as a tool for formal psychological therapies.</p><p>As a preliminary proof-of-concept study with a small sample, analysis of outcome was not designed to hypothesis&#x02013;test efficacy, but to establish whether estimated effects were in a range suggesting full scale trialing to be worthwhile. While we cannot be certain that other ongoing interventions had no impact on outcomes, results were promising, with a moderate effect size being estimated on both measures of recovery that were used. Feedback from participants was also consistent with the intervention having a beneficial impact upon recovery, and participant feedback additionally identified no negative effects. The estimated effect size on recovery is similar to effects observed for other psychosocial interventions for persisting psychosis (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Together, these findings suggest value in conducting a larger-scale controlled trial of this intervention (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors participated in the development and pilot of the digital intervention.
