We investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single doses of CKD-519 in healthy adult subjects. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study was performed. Eight healthy subjects were enrolled in each CKD-519 dose group (25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg) and randomized to CKD-519 (n=6) or matching placebo (n=2). CKD-519 reached the maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) at 5&#x02013;6 h post-dose, and had a long terminal half-life ranging between 40&#x02013;70 h. The area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) and C<sub>max</sub> increased with the dose, however, C<sub>max</sub> and AUC normalized by dose decreased with each incremental dose. CETP activity decreased with dose, and the maximum decrease (63%&#x02013;83%) was observed at 6&#x02013;8 h post-dose. A sigmoid E<sub>max</sub> model best described the relationship between CKD-519 plasma concentrations and CETP activity with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 17.3 ng/mL. Overall, 11 adverse events (AEs) were observed. All AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, and resolved without any complications. There were no clinically significant effects on blood pressure. In conclusion, single doses of CKD-519 up to 400 mg were well tolerated and showed potent inhibition of CETP activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor</kwd><kwd>CKD-519</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the world, is closely related with dyslipidemia.<xref rid="b1-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) represents a major risk for cardiovascular events.<xref rid="b2-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> LDL-C lowering has been and still is a primary target to prevent or reduce cardiovascular events.<xref rid="b3-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although each decrease of 1.0 mmol/L in LDL-C with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has been reported to reduce major cardiovascular events by 24%, there remain some substantial residual cardiovascular risks.<xref rid="b4-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The decreasing level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was associated with increasing frequency of major cardiovascular events.<xref rid="b5-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A low level of HDL-C is regarded as a strong risk factor of cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="b6-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Even in patients who maintain very low LDL-C level with statins, a low level of HDL-C is predictive of potential risk of cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="b5-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b7-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Based on these findings, raising HDL-C levels has become a potential target for reducing cardiovascular events.

The Vd/F in this study was higher than the Vd of animal, and it showed a tendency to increase with the dose after being normalized with each participant&#x02019;s body weight: 19.8 L/kg for 25 mg group, 38.7 L/kg for 50 mg group, 69.9 L/kg for 100 mg group, 82.6 L/kg for 200 mg group, and 154.3 L/kg for 400 mg group. This property of CKD-519 might be the reason for its long terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> in plasma.</p><p>The C<sub>max</sub> and AUC increased with dose, but the increase was less than proportional. In fact, CKD-519 exposure when normalized to dose decreased with dose. This can be explained by the in vivo data that CKD-519 has decreased bioavailability at higher doses (Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corp., unpublished data, 2015). In vitro studies revealed that transport-mediated uptake did not play a role in CKD-519 absorption, and the solubility of CKD-519 in gastrointestinal fluid was shown to be poor in animal studies (Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corp, unpublished data, 2015). These data suggest that gastrointestinal absorption of CKD-519 in human may get saturated at high doses.</p><p>The inhibition of CETP activity by CKD-519 increased as the dose increased. In the dose range of 25&#x02013;400 mg, the single oral administration of CKD-519 achieved a maximum decrease in CETP activity by 62%&#x02013;83% from baseline at about 6.3&#x02013;8.3 h after dosing. CKD-519 400 mg inhibited CETP activity by 43% at 24 h post-dose. Within the range between 25 mg and 100 mg of CKD-519, CETP activity decreased sharply with dose, but then it appeared that inhibition of CETP activity was reduced with higher doses (200 and 400 mg) of CKD-519, as C<sub>max</sub> and AUC also showed similar pattern with ascending doses of CKD-519. The relationship between concentration of CKD-519 and CETP activity was best described as a sigmoid E<sub>max</sub> model, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 17.3 ng/mL. Considering the PK and PD profiles of CKD-519, once-daily dosing regimen seems to be appropriate, and it is estimated that CKD-519 100 mg would be the most appropriate dose in an ensuing multiple doses study.</p><p>One of the main concerns in the development of CKD-519 was a possibility of it having adverse effects on the change of SBP or DBP, because the first CETP inhibitor to be developed, namely torcetrapib, was withdrawn due to its undesired effect on BP.<xref rid="b9-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Elevation of BP caused by torcetrapib was associated with a substantial increase of aldosterone, resulting in electrolyte changes and BP increase,<xref rid="b16-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> which is considered an off-target effect related to the activation of mineralocorticoid receptor by aldosterone, irrespective of HDL-C increasing mechanism by CETP inhibitor.<xref rid="b9-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In this study, before investigating into a possible off-target effect of CKD-519, as described for torcetrapib, we first looked into the possibility if CKD-519 may have an effect on BP. There were no significant differences found between baseline and post-dose SBP and DBP in all dose groups, and between placebo and CKD-519 groups.</p><p>Furthermore, CKD-519 was well tolerated within the dose range of 25&#x02013;400 mg by all the participants throughout the study. There were no clinically significant changes in physical examinations findings and ECG. The AEs observed in the subjects who received CKD-519 were similar to those observed in the subjects who received placebo, and there were no serious AEs.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the safety, PK, and PD of CKD-519 administered for the first time in humans. With regard to an apparently long terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> and PK profiles suggestive of saturable absorption, we can possibly consider saturable absorption or distribution of the drug into adipose tissue. However, to better understand these PK profiles of CKD-519, other studies about absorption or disposition of CKD-519 in humans are necessary. Even though the results showed no undesirable effect on BP, it would be prudent to monitor BP closely in the subsequent studies of multiple doses, especially in patients with dyslipidemia. Evaluation of aldosterone, cortisol or intensive BP monitoring may be warranted to completely exclude a possibility of indirect effects of CETP inhibition on adrenal hormones, since adrenal gland requires cholesterol for the biosynthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, and human cells possess both scavenger receptor-BI and LDL receptors.<xref rid="b23-dddt-10-3763" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Furthermore, the results of this study cannot be generalized to patients with dyslipidemia because this study evaluated only healthy individuals. In order to determine the safety of CKD-519, the study needs to be conducted in patients with dyslipidemia. Although there may be some limitations to the study, the results of this study, especially overall safety and tolerability as well as PD data showing clinical evidence of CETP inhibition, provide reasonable ground that enables further development of the drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Single doses of CKD-519 ranging from 25 mg to 400 mg administered to healthy individuals were well tolerated with no serious or severe AEs, and showed potent inhibition of CETP activity (maximum 83% at 400 mg dose). Therefore, CKD-519 is a safe and potent CETP inhibitor that can be administered once daily.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The abstract of the study was posted at the annual meeting of Korean Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (KSCPT; December 03&#x02013;04, 2015; Seoul, Korea).
