Another procedure is laser conditioning of the enamel, which is performed at a specified frequency and duration.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>One of the main drawbacks of adhesive materials is polymerization shrinkage during curing, which creates a space between the adhesive and the enamel surface, thus allowing the infiltration of bacteria, fluids, ions, and even air from the oral cavity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>This phenomenon, called microleakage, could lead to secondary caries, pulpal inflammation, and the unpleasant &#x0201c;white spot lesions&#x0201d; commonly observed after orthodontic treatment.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>One of the causes of orthodontic bracket bond failure is the formation of space between the enamel and the bracket or between the bracket and the adhesive.</p><p>In addition to photopolymerization shrinkage, bonding materials are exposed to temperature changes in the oral cavity caused by the ingestion of food and beverages that could also lead to volumetric changes. These events would produce fatigue in the adhesive joint, which in turn causes microleakage.</p><p>Several protocols have been developed to prevent enamel demineralization and reduce bond failure. Despite these efforts, demineralization and bond failure continue to affect the outcome of orthodontic treatment.</p><p>The preferred method to study microleakages <italic>in vitro</italic> continues to be thermal cycling.

All the teeth were then etched for 30 s with 37% phosphoric acid solution (Ormco Etching Solution, Ormco, Glendora, California) followed by 5 s of water rinsing and 5 s of air drying.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The prepared teeth were then randomly divided into six groups (<italic>n</italic> = 10) of different adhesive systems, which were assigned a color code [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Groups by adhesive</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-11-180-g001"/></table-wrap><p>For this study, each orthodontic bracket (3M Victory series; 3M, St Paul, Minnesota) has been bonded to one tooth, particularly to the buccal surface, following manufacturer's instructions. This has been operated by a single operator. Photopolymerization was performed using the Elipar&#x02122; S10 LED Curing Light (3M ESPE, St Paul, Minnesota) at an intensity of 1200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, for 10 s on the mesial side and then 10 s on the distal side.</p><p>Two layers of varnish were applied to the teeth based on the color code assigned to each system leaving a 1 mm margin around the edges of the bracket.</p><p>Next, the teeth underwent accelerated aging by means of 2500 cycles of thermal cycling. They were alternately immersed in 5&#x000b0;C and 55&#x000b0;C baths; each bath lasted 30 s, and transferring the tooth from one bath to the other took 10 s. The teeth were then immersed in 2% methylene blue for 24 h away from light before rinsing with water and air dry.</p><p>The bracket was then sectioned down the middle in a buccolingual direction using a low-speed diamond saw under continuous irrigation (Isomet<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Low-Speed Saw, Springfield, Virginia). Microleakage in each sample was evaluated using a binocular microscope at 40X magnification (Olympus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> SZH10, Tokyo, Japan) and an image was taken using a Canon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> EOS 700D camera (Tokyo, Japan) connected to the microscope. The image obtained [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] was analyzed using ImageJ<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software version 2006 (Broken Symmetry Software) which enabled measurements to be made using different tools [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Finally, a score was assigned to the different degrees of microleakage at the bracket-adhesive and adhesive-enamel interfaces in the occlusal and gingival regions of the bracket, as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cemented bracket through binocular microscope (&#x000d7;40)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-11-180-g002"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Set scale and measure with ImageJ<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-11-180-g003"/></fig><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Criteria and evaluation of microleakage</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-11-180-g004"/></table-wrap><p>Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Statistics software (IBM, Armonk, New York).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test yielded a significant difference in the occlusal bracket-adhesive interface among groups depending on the type of adhesive, <italic>P</italic> = 0.033.

From an orthodontic perspective, microleakage could very well lead to the formation of white-spot lesions at the &#x0201c;adhesive-enamel&#x0201d; interface.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>These lesions are characterized by enamel decalcification, a known consequence of bacterial plaque's remaining on the enamel surface for a long period of time.</p><p>Teeth are daily exposed to temperature variations, due to the ingestion of food and hot and cold drinks and so would be adhesives on teeth. Thus, thermal expansion coefficient of the adhesive must be close to that of dental tissue; otherwise, the tooth and the material will contract and expand at different rates. These repeated movements at different values could cause influx of bacteria-rich fluids of the oral cavity into the spaces formed between the tooth and the filling material. this is known as percolation phenomenon.</p><p>Adhesive materials shrink differently while polymerizing. This shrinking factor differs depending on the composition of the adhesive.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Transbond Plus Self-Etching, (Group 2), used in this study is a self-etching system. The advantage of this sort of systems is that it reduces the number of steps involved in cementing, thereby reducing procedure time. The etching process is simplified because the etching acid and primer are applied to the dental tissue in one step.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The &#x0201c;Transbond Plus Self-Etching&#x0201d; system contains phosphoric acid methacrylate, which serves as etching acid and primer. The depth of the demineralized area in the enamel will be the penetration area of the adhesive. Uysal <italic>et al</italic>. reported that brackets bonded using a self-etching system returned higher microleakage scores than brackets bonded using conventional total etching systems.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Their results are consistent with those obtained in our study. As observed in other studies, the gingival margin of the bracket showed a degree of microleakage. However, the occlusal margin of the bracket-adhesive interface showed more microleakage; this was not so in several other studies.</p><p>Dye penetration was used for assessing microleakage. It is the easiest and most widely used technique. it is quick, directly measures microleakage, does not react with the hard tissues, is nontoxic, and is cost-effective.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The thermal cycling technique have been extensively used in this type of studies.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Thermal expansion is a factor that affects adhesion between the adhesive material and the tooth. The difference in expansion coefficients within the &#x0201c;bracket-adhesive-enamel&#x0201d; complex results in different dimensional changes during temperature variations that may produce fractures, cracks resulting in microleakage.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>According to the results obtained in our study, the occlusal margin was prone to microleakage at each of the interfaces and with all of the cementing systems, but this difference was not statistically significant. Unlike other studies, the difference in microleakage at the occlusal margin of the &#x0201c;bracket-adhesive&#x0201d; interface was significant.</p><p>In a previous study, microleakage scores were higher in the gingival margin of the brackets. Their interpretation of the results was that the differences in scores between the occlusal and gingival margins were due to the tooth morphology, which results in a narrower interface with the adhesive on the gingival side.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, no indication was given of whether the study used maxillary or mandibular premolars. Further, they compared a total etching bonding system against an antibacterial self-etching bonding system on ceramic and metallic brackets.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The same results were also obtained by the work of Uysal <italic>et al</italic>. that compared two adhesive systems on ceramic and metallic brackets. However, they hypothesized that the low microleakage scores at the occlusal margin were due to the adhesive curing method, as they applied the curing light occlusally for 40 s.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Looking at our results, the significant difference in the &#x0201c;occlusal bracket-adhesive&#x0201d; variable may be due to the fact that we applied the curing light on the mesial and distal sides for 20 s each time. Microleakage scores were observed with all the cementing systems. The [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>] shows the comparison between the mean values at the occlusal and gingival interface for each adhesive brands.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Mean scores of the different adhesive brands at each occlusal and gingival interface</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-11-180-g007"/></fig><p>Microleakage was present in all groups. We observed a significant difference in the &#x0201c;occlusal bracket adhesive&#x0201d; group. In the &#x0201c;gingival bracket adhesive,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;occlusal adhesive enamel,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;gingival adhesive enamel&#x0201d; groups, there was no significant difference. The adhesive that returned the lowest microleakage score was Group 6, &#x0201c;Transbond MIP;&#x0201d; conversely, Group 2, &#x0201c;Transbond Plus Self-Etching,&#x0201d; returned the highest microleakage scores. Group 2 was a self-etching system whereas Group 6 was a conventional etching system. We can conclude that enamel bonding using conventional etching results in greater, better-quality adhesion.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
