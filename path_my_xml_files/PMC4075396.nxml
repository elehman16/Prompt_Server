Patients without fixed coronary lesion (n=964) and without cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (n=946) were excluded. Patients older than 70 years, suspected Brugada syndrome, characterized by ST elevation in the right precordial leads (V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>3</sub>) and long and short QT syndrome were excluded.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Finally, we enrolled 570 patients in this study. ECGs of all patients were reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups according to ER; ER group (n=139) and no ER group (n=431). Clinical characteristics were obtained through chart review. All patients provided informed consents for their participation in this study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Seoul, Korea and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>ECG analysis</title><p>In all study subjects, we evaluated serial ECGs one month after coronary angiography. ECGs recorded during chest pain were excluded from the analysis. Twelve-lead ECGs were manually downloaded from the GE Marquette MUSE system (GE Medial System, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The presence or absence of left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed according to the Sokolow-Lyon criteria, and the QTc interval (corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula) was automatically measured. The ECGs were independently reevaluated in random order by two trained cardiologists who were unaware of clinical characteristics, patient grouping and outcome status.</p><p>The interobserver variations showed substantial agreement (kappa value, 0.79).<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> J-point was defined as a junction between the end of the QRS complex and the beginning of the ST segment. The amplitude of J-point elevation from baseline was also measured. ER patterns were stratified according to J-point elevation that was either notched (a positive J deflection inscribed on the S-wave) or slurred (a smooth transition from QRS to ST-segment) in at least two consecutive inferior or lateral leads.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>ST-segment patterns after the J-point were coded as follows: 1) horizontal/descending and 2) concave/rapidly ascending. The horizontal/descending type was defined as &#x02264;0.1 mV elevation of the ST segment within 100 ms after the J-point (arrow of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-1</xref>).<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The concave/rapidly ascending ST segment was defined as &#x0003e;0.1 mV elevation of ST segment within 100 ms after the J-point or a persistently elevated ST segment of &#x0003e;0.1 mV throughout the ST segment (arrow of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-1</xref>). The isoelectric line (baseline) was defined as the level between 2 T-P intervals. The J-point or ST-segment patterns had to be present in at least two inferior or lateral leads for positive grading. A prolonged QTc interval was defined as at least 440 ms for men and at least 460 ms for women.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Myocardial perfusion single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)</title><sec><title>Study</title><p>Stress/rest 99mTC-methoxyisobutylosonitrile (MIBI) myocardial perfusion SPECT was performed using a 1-day protocol. All patients underwent Tc-99m-MIBI gated SPECT one year after index procedure. Imaging was begun 30 minutes after the administration of 14.7 MBq/kg Tc-99m-MIBI. Image acquisition was obtained in supine position with a dual-head rotating gamma camera (GE, Fairfield, CT, USA) equipped with a low-energy, high-resolution collimator. A total of 34 projections were acquired over a 180&#x000b0; rotation with an acquisition time of 25 seconds each. At each projection angle, eight individual ECG-gated frames per R-R interval were acquired. Transverse sections were reconstructed in a 64&#x000d7;64-pixel matrix by using a filtered back projection with a Butterworth filter. No attenuation correction was used. Immediately after this first imaging, continuous intravenous infusion of low dose dobutamine (LDD); at a dose of 7.5 ug/kg of body mass/min was started and the second acquisition began 5 minutes later. The same imaging acquisition protocol was used for the rest and LDD SPECT.</p><p>Stress/rest SPECT imaging was interpreted by 2 expert nuclear cardiologists. A semi-quantitative visual interpretation was made using short axis-, horizontal-, and vertical long axis-myocardial tomograms and a 5-grade (0--4) scoring system in a 20-segment model. The summed stress score (SSS) and summed rest score (SRS) were obtained by adding the scores of the 20 segments on stress and rest imaging, respectively. A study was judged normal if the summed difference score between SSS and SRS was 0. Segment was classified as reversible defect if difference score &#x02265;4, and fixed defect if difference score &#x0003c;4 and rest score &#x0003e;1.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>Cardiac events including cardiac death, aborted sudden cardiac death or fatal arrhythmia were analyzed. To distinguish cases of sudden death from arrhythmia, we reviewed all deaths from cardiac causes. After reviewing data available from death certificates, hospital records and ECGs during events, we classified the deaths as follows; cardiac death from heart failure aggravation and aborted sudden cardiac death from fatal arrhythmia. The patient's activity and time of day when the event occurred were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous variables were reported as mean&#x000b1;SD, and categorical variables were presented as number and percentage in each group. Comparisons of continuous variables and categorical variables were performed using the two-sided t-test and chi-square test, respectively. The HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for death were calculated with the Cox proportional-hazards model, in which each subgroups with ER were compared with a reference groups that did not have ER. The multivariate model included age, gender, body mass index, heart rate, QRS duration, QTc duration, ECG signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, and ECG signs of CAD. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for different ER types and were compared by means of the log-rank test. The SPSS statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform all statistical evaluations. A <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Early repolarization pattern in patients with CAD</title><p>ER, which is characterized by an elevation of the J-point in leads other than V<sub>1</sub> through V<sub>3</sub> on 12-lead ECG, was persistently observed at least 30 days after chest pain in 139 (24.4%) patients with CAD.

Fourthly, CAD patients who had ER and horizontal/descending ST segments had a higher risk of cardiac events, if they had myocardial scar. In the absence of scarring, however, this same ECG pattern was not associated with excess risk. Our study suggests that ER may be related with myocardial scarring, predicting cardiac events in patients with CAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Early repolarization and CAD</title><p>ER has been considered a benign finding observed among healthy and young individuals.

Peri-infarction block, another form of terminal notching of the QRS complex, has been known to be caused not by early repolarization but by delayed depolarization of heterogenous myocardial scar tissues.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It has also been known to be frequently associated with ventricular late potentials in signal-averaged ECGs and increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death, caused by macro-reentry.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>In the present study, the prevalence of ER was found to be much higher than that of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients (12.1%) and vasospastic angina (VA) patients (21.4%).<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, it was lower than 32% reported in myocardial infarct patients with ventricular arrhythmia.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Therefore, it can be explained by myocardial damage, and might expect cardiac events.</p></sec><sec><title>Only early repolarization accompanied with myocardial scar increase cardiac event</title><p>It is not fully elucidated why ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurs only in some patients, although they all have similar clinical variables. CAD patients with ER and horizontal/descending ST segment had cardiac events more frequently than did those with no-ER. These results are consistent with previous observations that ER patterns in the inferior leads<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and ER patterns with horizontal/descending ST segment<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> were associated with mortality risk. However, in these studies, even CAD patients with ER did not have cardiac events, if they did not have myocardial scar. Moreover, reversible ischemia was not associated with increased risk of cardiac events.</p><p>The presence of a prominent action potential notch in epicardium but not endocardium produce a transmural voltage gradient during ventricular activation that manifests as a J wave.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Preexisting myocardial scars can produce tissue heterogeneity to produce fatal arrhythmia. Thus, CAD patients with both ER and scar might have an arrhythmogenic substrate, and are more susceptible to myocardial ischemia or triggers.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>There are several limitations in this study. First, absolute number of events was small in both groups. Therefore, a study with larger number of patients is needed. Second, because most patients experienced fatal arrhythmias at out of hospital, the association between ER during acute ischemia and the occurrence of fatal arrhythmias was not evaluated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Early repolarization in the inferior leads and horizontal/descending ST-segment variant was more frequently observed in CAD patients with myocardial scar. Furthermore, the CAD patients with ER and myocardial scarring had higher incidence of cardiac events. Our findings suggest that ER pattern may be related to myocardial scar, predicting the prognosis in CAD patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported in part by research grants of the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea, funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (NRF-2010-0021993, NRF-2012R1A2A2A02045367), and a grant of the Korean Healthcare technology R&#x00026;D project, Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare (HI12C1552).
