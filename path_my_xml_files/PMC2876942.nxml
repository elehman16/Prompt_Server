This study aims to test the efficacy of adding a low dose of ketamine orally, as a supplement to the midazolam-based oral premedication for reducing sevoflurane-related emergence agitation.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Ninety-two preschool children, aged between two and six years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, scheduled for elective dental filling and extractions under general anesthesia were included. The patients were allocated into two groups: Group M (46 patients) received oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg, mixed with ibuprofen 10 mg/kg, while group KM (46 patients) received a similar premedication mixture, in addition to ketamine 2 mg/kg. The acceptance of the drug mixture, the onset of action, and the occurrence of vomiting were monitored over the next 30 minutes. Induction of anesthesia was carried out using sevoflurane 8 Vol% in 100% oxygen via face mask. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1.5-2 Vol% in an oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture. After extubation, the standard scoring scale was used for assessing the quality of emergence. Agitation parameters were measured using a five-point scale. Agitated children were managed by giving intravenous increments of fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/ kg. The time of hospital discharge allowance was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Drug palatability, vomiting, and onset of action of premedication; showed no significant differences between both groups.

Extra nursing care may often be necessary as well as supplemental sedative and/or analgesic medications. Parents who witness emergence agitation in their child may worry about permanent sequelae.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Rapid emergence and increased pain sensation have been proposed as possible causes of emergence agitation seen with sevoflurane.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] However anxiolytic premedication and effective analgesia does not necessarily prevent emergence agitation and may even cause delayed recovery and hospital discharge or affect the quality of life of the child after discharge.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>]</p><p>Various pre-, intra-, and immediate postoperative pharmacological (analgesics, opioids, benzodiazepines, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine) and non-pharmacological techniques were used with the aim of reducing the occurrence of emergence agitation after sevoflurane-based anesthesia, with variable results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] Oral premedication with midazolam and/or ketamine is widely used in pediatric anesthesia, to reduce emotional trauma, ensure smooth induction, and minimize emergence agitation. However, various dosing regimens were used alone or in combination, with variable efficacies and side effect profiles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] Only few studies tested the role of intravenous ketamine in reducing emergence agitation after sevoflurane, with no available data regarding its use in small oral doses alone or in combination with oral midazolam.</p><p>The aim of the this study was to investigate the effects of adding a low oral dose of ketamine to midazolam-based oral premedication in preschool children undergoing dental surgical procedures, focusing on its effect on sevoflurane-related emergence agitation in comparison to midazolam alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, double blind, single center study that was carried out in the Doha Clinic Hospital (75 beds).

Parents were not aware of the premedication components.</p><p>After receiving approval from the Hospital Ethics Committee and with written consents from the parents, 92 preschool children, aged between two and six years, were scheduled for elective dental filling and extractions under general anesthesia, with the expected duration of surgery being one to two hours. The sample size was determined assuming that the probability of sevoflurane agitation was 40%. We calculated that a sample size of 42 children per treatment group would have at least a 90% power (B error = 0.1) to detect a difference of 30% in the incidence of emergence agitation. Because we expected some exclusions and failures to follow up during the course of the study (which almost did not happen), we increased the number of the sample size to 48 children.

The patients were randomly assigned to receive either midazolam (Group M) or ketamine-midazolam (Group KM) as oral premedication, via computer-generated random numbers.</p><p>During the preoperative visit, each enrolled child was asked to choose a sealed envelope with his code number inside. The name, file number, and body weight were recorded on the sealed envelope after been chosen.</p><p>On the morning of operation, the study drugs were prepared by a trained nurse (who was not involved in any other part of the study) into identical 5 ml-syringes being sequentially numbered.

Preoperative administration of 0.5 mg/ kg midazolam orally, for 15 minutes before induction, in children undergoing bilateral ear tube insertion reduced the incidence of EA with sevoflurane (from 66.7 to 39.3%),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref>] This was almost identical to the 37% incidence of EA recorded within the midazolam-premedicated patients in the current study. Similar studies using oral midazolam premedication in comparison to other drugs failed to show an improved incidence of EA following sevoflurane anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine is commercially available as a racemic mixture of R (&#x02212;) and S (+) enantiomeres. It is a non-competitive N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that can inhibit the &#x02018;wind up phenomenon&#x02019; (central sensitization) in spinal cord neurons. It is this antagonistic effect that accounts for most of the analgesic, amnesic, psychotomimetic, and neuroprotective effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>] Two previous studies have been investigated for the efficacy of using intravenous ketamine in small doses, in reducing the incidence of EA following sevoflurane. There are no available studies using oral ketamine to test this point. The results of the current study support the conclusion reached by Kawarguchi <italic>et al</italic>. who used ketamine 1 mg/kg intravenously after induction of sevoflurane anesthesia in children undergoing strabismus surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref>] Similarly, small doses of ketamine (0.25 mg/kg) given just before sevoflurane discontinuation in the study carried out by Dalens <italic>et al</italic>. (2006), on children undergoing cerebral magnetic resonance imaging were shown to be effective in ameliorating EA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref>] The discharge time was not prolonged in both studies. Orally administered ketamine has a very high hepatic first pass effect, with only 16% of the dose being bioavailable. Most of the drug is metabolized into norketamine, which may contribute to the analgesic effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref>]</p><p>Oral ketamine premedication avoids the very high peak concentrations produced by I.V. injection, which may be associated with the undesirable side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>]</p><p>In animal studies, ketamine was shown to potentiate the release of melatonin, while halothane did the opposite.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT25">25</xref>] Melatonin demonstrated beneficial results in children, in attenuating emergence agitation following sevoflurane anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref>]</p><p>One of the limitations of the current study is the absence of a placebo-controlled group. It was initially suggested, but rejected by the Hospital Ethics Committee. There is much debate about the reliability and validity of the tool used to measure emergence agitation in young children. Although the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale, which was developed in 2004,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] appears to be the most reliable tool for the measurement of EA; yet it was difficult for us to train the observers to apply it in a short time. Therefore we used the simpler and rapidly applicable &#x02018;Five-point scale&#x02019;. Although the focus of our study was to evaluate EA, one cannot neglect the effects of the used drugs on the induction criteria and the reaction to parents' separation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Adding a low dose of oral ketamine to midazolam-based oral premedication in preschool children undergoing dental surgery reduces sevoflurane-related emergence agitation, without delaying discharge.
