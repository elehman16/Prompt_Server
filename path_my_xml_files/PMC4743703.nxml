In previous Phase 1<sup><xref rid="DKV411C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and Phase 2<sup><xref rid="DKV411C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> studies, delafloxacin was well tolerated and exhibited clinical and microbiological efficacy at dosages of 300 and 450 mg intravenously every 12 h.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Investigator's assessment of global clinical outcome has been a common efficacy measure in clinical studies of investigational antibiotics.

The primary efficacy measure was cure rate based on investigators' assessments of clinical response with complete resolution of signs and symptoms. The study design was based on the 2010 draft FDA guidance for antibiotic development in ABSSSI.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> As such, this was an exploratory study to evaluate the utility, variability and measurement of several objective outcomes of clinical efficacy for use in future clinical trials in patients with ABSSSIs, including changes in erythema and induration surface areas, body temperature and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6. Other secondary endpoints were microbiological and clinical response rates in patients with MRSA infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a Phase 2, multicentre, stratified, randomized, double-blind trial designed per FDA<sup><xref rid="DKV411C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and EMA guidelines.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="DKV411C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Patients were enrolled at 23 US centres beginning in February 2011 and the last contact with the final patient was in November 2011. Patients with ABSSSIs were randomized (1&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;1&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;1 ratio) to twice-daily intravenous treatment with 300 mg of delafloxacin, 600 mg of linezolid or 15 mg/kg vancomycin (actual body weight) for 5&#x02013;14 days (per investigator judgement). Linezolid and vancomycin were chosen as comparators in accordance with guidelines established by the FDA<sup><xref rid="DKV411C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and IDSA;<sup><xref rid="DKV411C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> both are indicated for use to treat infections caused by MRSA.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The study drug was delivered in 5% dextrose (D5W) and was administered every 12&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1 h. Vancomycin levels were monitored in blood samples drawn from all patients on day 2 or 3 and on day 6&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1; dosing was adjusted based on achieving a target trough of 15&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;g/mL.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Patients with proven or presumptive Gram-negative infections could have aztreonam added to their treatment regimen in a blinded fashion at the investigator's discretion post-baseline. If an investigator ordered aztreonam for a patient in the delafloxacin group, the unblinded pharmacist was to supply a placebo infusion in place of aztreonam for that patient.</p><p>All study drug infusions were administered by study site personnel or as a home infusion service that had been trained on specifics of the study protocol. Scheduled study visits took place at screening, days 1 through to 14 of treatment (or until the last day of study drug administration), follow-up (day 14&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1 and &#x02265;12 h after the final study drug dose) and late follow-up (days 21&#x02013;28). Treatment was required to begin within 24 h after screening. Throughout the study, wound care (including any surgical procedures) was performed according to the study site's standards of practice. However, no antibacterial topical solutions or dressings were allowed, except for silver dressings for the treatment of burns. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was not allowed. Unplanned debridement procedures completed &#x0003e;48 h after study entry dictated that the subject be considered a treatment failure and that study drug be discontinued.</p><p>This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01283581.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were &#x02265;18 years of age and had a diagnosis of ABSSSI (defined as cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infection, major cutaneous abscess or burn infection), characterized by &#x02265;75 cm<sup>2</sup> of erythema or induration, as determined by planimetry plus lymph node enlargement or at least one sign of systemic infection, specifically fever &#x02265;38&#x000b0;C, lymphangitis, white blood cell count &#x02265;15&#x0200a;000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or serum CRP level &#x0003e;5.0 mg/L. Each patient was required to receive intravenous antibiotic therapy per the investigator's opinion. Patients were excluded for reasons including the following: hypersensitivities or allergies to quinolones, linezolid, vancomycin or vancomycin derivatives; concurrent skin conditions at the infection site; severely inadequate arterial blood supply to a limb containing the ABSSSI; severe immunocompromise; hypertension (&#x02265;180 mmHg systolic or &#x02265;110 mmHg diastolic, confirmed within 20 min after the initial reading); body weight &#x0003e;140 kg; use of potentially effective systemic antibiotic therapy for &#x0003e;24 h within 14 days before enrolment unless objective evidence of documented clinical progression; and use of more than one dose of an antibiotic potentially effective against the ABSSSI under study within 24 h before study entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomization</title><p>Patients were randomized using the interactive web response system. Site-based randomization was stratified by infection category, with &#x02264;30% of all patients having cutaneous abscess, and pre-treatment status, with &#x02264;30% of all patients having received a single dose of an antibiotic potentially effective against the ABSSSI under study within 24 h before study entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Blinding</title><p>All study drug infusions were prepared by unblinded pharmacists, who obtained all treatment assignments from an interactive web response system and ensured blinding of study drug. To monitor pharmacy and drug administration records, certain clinical research organization personnel were also unblinded. Stratification/randomization was managed by an unblinded statistician who was not involved in the study conduct. Other parties involved in the study, including all patients, investigators, laboratories and sponsor personnel, remained unaware of the randomized treatment assignments.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy measure was the investigator assessment of clinical response at the follow-up visit in the ITT population, defined as all randomized patients. Clinical response was categorized based on ABSSSI signs and symptoms: <italic>cure</italic> (complete resolution); <italic>improved</italic> (near resolution, some symptoms remain but no additional antibiotic treatment required); <italic>failure</italic> (additional non-study antibiotics required); or <italic>indeterminate</italic> (assessment was incomplete). Patients missing follow-up were considered indeterminate and mapped to failure in the ITT analysis. The cure rate was defined as the percentage of cures only in each treatment group; improved outcome was grouped with failure in the primary analysis. A <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was conducted to assess the cure rate in obese (BMI &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and non-obese (BMI &#x0003c;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) patients.</p><p>For exploratory objective assessments of clinical efficacy, the total areas of erythema and induration were obtained digitally (via planimetry readings of scanned acetate film tracings) and manually (with disposable rulers) at 12 h intervals through to day 5 and at follow-up. Clinical success was defined as cessation of expansion of erythema or induration (&#x02264;0% change from baseline in total area) accompanied by resolution or absence of fever, as assessed between 48 and 72 h after treatment inception and sustained through to 72 h. Resolution of fever was defined as three consecutive temperatures &#x0003c;37.7&#x000b0;C taken at 6 h intervals. CRP and IL-6 levels were obtained once daily through to day 5 and at day 10 and follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Microbiological assessments</title><p>At screening, specimens obtained from the ABSSSI site by biopsy, punch biopsy, aspiration or surgery were sent to a local laboratory for Gram staining, culture and <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility testing of microbial isolates.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Each Gram-stained preparation was forwarded to a central microbiology laboratory, along with subcultures of identified bacterial isolates for confirmatory identification and testing. Blood cultures were also obtained at screening and daily thereafter, if positive, until the results were negative. In patients with materials available for culture, ABSSSI samples were collected at follow-up and late follow-up.</p><p>In microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients (see the Statistical analyses section), microbiological response was categorized as <italic>documented eradicated</italic> (baseline pathogen absent in follow-up cultures), <italic>presumed eradicated</italic> (no follow-up material available for culture, but the patient had a clinical response of cure), <italic>documented persisted</italic> (baseline pathogen present in follow-up cultures), <italic>presumed persisted</italic> (no follow-up material available for culture, but the patient had a clinical response of failure), <italic>superinfection</italic> (new pathogen cultured during therapy from the original site of infection, in the presence of infection signs or symptoms) or <italic>new infection</italic> (new pathogen cultured after therapy from the original site of infection, in the presence of infection signs or symptoms).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Safety/tolerability assessments</title><p>At each study visit, all patients were asked a non-directed question to elicit reports of adverse events (AEs). Each patient receiving &#x0003e;5 days of study drug treatment was telephoned 30 days after the final dose for follow-up of AEs. Safety assessments also included physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12 lead electrocardiograms and clinical laboratory tests (including daily monitoring of blood glucose levels). Clinical laboratory tests were measured by a central laboratory (Eurofins, Global Central Laboratory, Chantilly, VA, USA). The CRP measurement method used Roche immunoturbidimetry and the IL-6 measurement method used R&#x00026;D ELISA (ELISA processor).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The statistical analysis plan was prospectively defined prior to database lock and unblinding. Clinical efficacy outcomes were analysed using the ITT population, comprising all randomized patients. Microbiological outcomes were analysed in the ME population, comprising all patients with an identified baseline pathogen known to cause an ABSSSI who received at least eight study drug infusions or &#x02265;80% of the total anticipated doses during the patient's treatment period (whichever was greater); did not receive any concomitant, systemic antibacterial therapy with activity against the identified pathogen; had no major protocol deviations; and had a follow-up visit at day 14&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.</p><p>Continuous variables were compared among treatment groups using an analysis of covariance model, with study site, treatment, infection type and prior antimicrobial therapy as main effects and baseline value as the covariate. Categorical variables were compared separately between delafloxacin and each of the two comparator drugs by the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test stratified by infection type. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05. Mean differences between treatments were expressed as vancomycin minus delafloxacin.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>A sample size of 240 was based on clinical and practical considerations and not on a formal statistical power calculation. Simultaneous application of the study's stratifications, however, was found to cause an imbalance in the size of the treatment groups. This was because there was a large variation in the total number of patients enrolled by each site. Multiple stratifications performed at the site level in the randomization process combined with the variable enrolment by site produced an imbalance in the sizes of the treatment groups. The unblinded statistician therefore recommended increasing enrolment from 240 to 256 patients. All enrolment was completed in a blinded fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was conducted according to principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite Guideline: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Before any study procedures, the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards and before enrolment, all prospective patients or their legally authorized representatives received a full explanation of the study and provided written informed consent.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient flow</title><p>Of 284 patients screened, 256 were randomized (ITT population): 81, 77 and 98 to delafloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin, respectively (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DKV411F1">1</xref>). Because of the variable numbers enrolled at each site, there was an imbalance among treatment arms. Among the patients enrolled, 210 (82.0%) patients completed the study: 69 (85.2%), 63 (81.8%) and 78 (79.6%) in the delafloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin groups, respectively. The most frequent reasons for premature discontinuation were &#x02018;lost to follow-up&#x02019; (21 patients), &#x02018;patient withdrew consent&#x02019; (9 patients) and treatment-emergent AEs [TEAEs; 9 patients (1 linezolid&#x000a0;and 8 vancomycin); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jac/dkv411/-/DC1">Table S1, available as Supplementary data at <italic>JAC</italic> Online</ext-link>].

Overall, a majority of patients were men (59.4%) and Caucasian (76.2%). The mean (SD) age was 43.2 (15.1) years (median, 43.0; range, 18.0&#x02013;91.0) and the mean (SD) BMI was 29.5 (6.6) kg/m<sup>2</sup> (median, 28.3; range, 15.4&#x02013;52.6). Obese patients (BMI &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) constituted 42.2% (108/256) of the ITT population. The most frequent ABSSSI category was cellulitis/erysipelas (44.9%), followed by major cutaneous abscess (28.5%), wound infection (25.0%) and burn infection (1.6%). Only 28.1% of patients had received antibacterial therapy prior to enrolment and randomization. The majority of patients enrolled with signs and symptoms consistent with systemic infection (fever, lymphangitis and/or elevated white blood cell count). Only three patients had only elevated CRP at baseline, without any other systemic sign of infection. The mean and median CRP levels at baseline were 50.8 and 24.0 mg/L, respectively.

Among the types most frequently reported (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jac/dkv411/-/DC1">Table S3</ext-link>), nausea was more common in the delafloxacin and linezolid groups, diarrhoea and vomiting were more common in the delafloxacin group and pruritus was more common in the vancomycin group. There were no reports of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> diarrhoea.</p><p>Five patients (two delafloxacin and three vancomycin) experienced a total of six TEAEs related to liver toxicity. None of these events caused treatment discontinuation or serious AEs (SAEs). One subject in the vancomycin group had one TEAE each of elevated ALT and AST; both TEAEs were assessed as probably related to the study drug. Three subjects had TEAEs of &#x02018;liver function test abnormal&#x02019;; two were in the delafloxacin group (one assessed as possibly related to study drug and one as probably related) and one was in the vancomycin group (assessed as possibly related to study drug). One of these subjects (in the delafloxacin group) had ALT and AST values that were flagged high at screening. The subject had further increases at follow-up and late follow-up. The subject's bilirubin values remained within normal limits. One subject in the vancomycin group had a TEAE of &#x02018;hepatic enzymes increased&#x02019;, assessed as possibly related to study drug.</p><p>No patient had a TEAE related to hypoglycaemia. Conversely, a TEAE of hyperglycaemia occurred in two, one and two patients in the delafloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin groups, respectively; a TEAE of increased blood glucose occurred in one linezolid-treated patient (the only patient with diagnosis of diabetes) and two patients in the vancomycin group. All hyperglycaemia TEAEs were classified as mild. The study drug was delivered in D5W, which may have had an impact on hyperglycaemia reports; additionally, these were non-fasting measurements. No deaths occurred during the study.</p><p>The three treatment groups were generally similar with regard to changes from baseline in haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis and glucose measurements. In all, 13 patients (5.2% of 249) had SAEs: 5 patients (6.4% of 78), 2 patients (2.7% of 75) and 6 patients (6.3% of 96) in the delafloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin groups, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jac/dkv411/-/DC1">Table S4</ext-link>); none was considered to be related to study drug. Reported SAEs of convulsions occurred in patients with a history of seizure disorder. There were no clinically relevant changes in the QT interval or clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormalities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The investigational fluoroquinolone delafloxacin was evaluated against two antibiotics approved in the USA and Europe for ABSSSIs (linezolid and vancomycin). Delafloxacin was significantly more effective than vancomycin for treating ABSSSIs by the primary endpoint, the investigator assessment of cure at the follow-up visit. This outcome appears to have been driven in part by statistically better outcomes in obese patients with delafloxacin. The improved outcome was maintained over the study period. Outcome with delafloxacin was not significantly different from either linezolid or vancomycin in the treatment of patients with MRSA.</p><p>The reason for the statistically higher cure rate for delafloxacin over vancomycin is unclear. Vancomycin was dosed according to recommendations by the IDSA and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists;<sup><xref rid="DKV411C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> however, dosing issues do not appear to have contributed to the lower cure rate. Vancomycin exposure as monitored by trough levels or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment (ratio of free-drug AUC&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;MIC) did not correlate with clinical outcome. There was a high percentage of patients classified as cured or improved among those with an AUC&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;MIC ratio of &#x02265;200, which suggests that the majority of patients had free-drug AUC&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;MIC ratios that were on the plateau of a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for clinical response and thus had sufficient vancomycin exposure.</p><p>Assessment of objective measures by digital and manual determinations 48&#x02013;72 h after the start of therapy revealed that all three agents were comparable in either cessation of spread or 20% reduction of total areas of erythema and induration, although digital measurements appeared to be associated with less variability. The present study was conducted in accordance with the FDA- and EMA-issued guidances for assessment of antibiotics in the treatment of ABSSSIs in terms of efficacy criteria and endpoints.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DKV411C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Historically, antibiotic trials have defined clinical success using investigator assessments that typically encompassed both cured and improved patients, in whom either all or most signs and symptoms were resolved, respectively. In this study, the protocol specified cure, the most stringent definition of clinical success, and excluded improved patients as the primary endpoint; improved outcome was mapped to failure in the primary analysis.</p><p>As previously stated, the statistically superior outcome in obese patients treated with delafloxacin appears to have contributed to the overall outcome compared with vancomycin. Obesity is a risk factor for ABSSSI and is also a predictor of poor outcomes and increased treatment cost.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DKV411C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Pharmacotherapy of obese patients presents additional challenges to physicians and pharmacists.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Based on these considerations, the potential for delafloxacin to improve cure rates in obese patients may provide a therapeutic advantage and thus may be clinically meaningful.</p><p>In the present study, delafloxacin had an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated; the most common TEAEs were similar to those observed in a prior Phase 2 study.<sup><xref rid="DKV411C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Hypoglycaemia has been associated with some fluoroquinolone antibiotics and, in a previous Phase 2 study,<sup><xref rid="DKV411C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> single low serum glucose values were observed in 4.1% and 17.6% of patients given 300 and 450 mg of delafloxacin intravenously, respectively; all but one patient in the 450 mg group was asymptomatic. In the present study, there were no AEs of hypoglycaemia in patients receiving delafloxacin and the decrease in blood glucose from baseline to the last recorded value was not statistically significant. Together, these data suggest that delafloxacin poses a low risk of hypoglycaemia.</p><p>This study is limited by the size of the database and larger Phase 3 studies would more definitively characterize the safety and efficacy of delafloxacin. The finding of an increased cure rate in obese patients with delafloxacin treatment, while notable, was not a prospectively defined outcome and merits further study in a prospective fashion.</p><p>In summary, the present trial provides objective and subjective evidence to expand the findings from a previous Phase 2 study and thus supports continued study of delafloxacin as a treatment for ABSSSIs and infections due to MRSA. Delafloxacin met the primary endpoint of the trial and appears to be well tolerated. The statistically significant clinical benefit seen with delafloxacin compared with vancomycin, particularly in obese patients, warrants further study. With the challenges for physicians and pharmacists in treating obese patients, any therapeutic advantage in these patients could be particularly clinically meaningful.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by <funding-source>Melinta Therapeutics</funding-source> (formerly <funding-source>Rib-X Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</funding-source>).
