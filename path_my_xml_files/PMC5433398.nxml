As the clinical presentation is often complex, with motor symptoms, ataxia, cognitive difficulties, bladder dysfunction, pain, visual deficits, depression and fatigue, a multidisciplinary approach of care with different MS specialists and allied health professionals is frequently needed. Several reports have suggested the value of rehabilitation stays on disability and on some aspects of QoL.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, apart from rehabilitation stays, the potential benefit of a multidisciplinary intervention has not been assessed.</p><p>An integrated intervention within a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic gathering the different team members is thought to offer the best management of MS. However, whether this multidisciplinary approach is more beneficial for the patient than more usual type of care, where interventions are not integrated but proposed through successive referrals to needed medical and allied health professionals, is unknown. This question is of importance not only for the benefit of the patient, but also for the health organization. To gain insight into this question, we set up a prospective, randomized, controlled study, aimed at comparing the integrated multidisciplinary program existing since 2001 in our MS clinic with a nonintegrated approach, using QoL as a primary endpoint.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2-2055217315608864"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3-2055217315608864" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Piti&#x000e9;-Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012. Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist). Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded.</p><p>Previous history of MS, previous and ongoing disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), social characteristics (help of caregiver, employment, and pension of invalidity) were collected from the patients&#x02019; files at inclusion. The INTERMED score, an observer-rated instrument that scores information in four domains: biological, psychological, social, and health care, and has been used to identify patients in need of multidisciplinary care in different neurological diseases including MS,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> was calculated at inclusion.

At the end of the inclusion visit (conducted by the evaluating neurologist not participating in the multidisciplinary team), the patient was randomized via a central Web-based randomization system. Treatment was allocated according to a computer-generated randomization list in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were then randomized in two groups depending on the treatment strategy: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) group, consisting of an IMD approach at the Piti&#x000e9;-Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re MS clinic, and (ii) a control group, consisting of successive, non-integrated interventions with different specialists and allied health professionals, at different times and sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2055217315608864">Figure 1</xref>). For patients in the IMD group, the multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic was planned at our MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion. These patients received a half-day (four to six hours) individually tailored assessment by the multidisciplinary group. The schedule allowed each required medical specialist (neurologist, rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, and psychiatrist) or allied health professional (MS nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker, and neuropsychologist) to assess the patient&#x02019;s status and needs. Depending on their needs, evaluated during the inclusion visit and re-evaluated during the multidisciplinary visit, patients were seen by different MS specialists and allied health professionals. This multidisciplinary assessment was followed by an integration of all team members&#x02019; evaluations and recommendations by the coordinating neurologist.

This overview shows that patients of both groups received multidisciplinary care, although this multidisciplinary intervention was delivered differently as scheduled by the protocol.</p><p>Median MSIS-29 score (higher score corresponding to lower QoL) of over six months decreased in the control group (&#x02212;4.89), and increased in the IMD group (+2). The difference between the two groups was significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03).

The univariate analysis (taking into account age, sex, disease form, EDSS, HAD-A score, HAD-D score, MFIS, QUALIVEEN score, INTERMED score, type of therapeutic intervention, disease duration, use of personal care aid, relapses within six months after inclusion) showed that two factors only, the HAD-D and the INTERMED score, were significantly associated with the MSIS-29 change from M0 to M6. Higher HAD-D at inclusion was predictive of lower MSIS-29 score at M6 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.046). Higher INTERMED score at inclusion was predictive of higher MSIS-29 score at M6 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). These two factors and the type of care were entered in the multivariate analysis.

Because of this complexity, many MS clinics use a multidisciplinary team approach to offer the best management of the multiple aspects of the disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, how such multidisciplinary care should be delivered has not been evaluated.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This study is to our knowledge the first to address this question using a randomized, controlled and prospective trial. Our results show that, contrary to our expectations, an integrated multidisciplinary approach is not superior to usual care regarding QoL (primary endpoint). These negative results were unexpected as the integrated approach was evaluated very positively in our previous pilot study, where patients were asked after the integrated outpatient clinic to score their satisfaction. In this pilot study, performed on 40 patients, more than 90% of them answered that they were extremely satisfied by this approach of care. These satisfaction auto-questionnaires, however, were completed and collected just after the outpatient clinic. We believe that although the present study was not blinded for the patients, this should not have influenced the outcomes. Indeed, it should have rather favored the integrated care group, as patients were often disappointed when selected for the control group. Interestingly, this lack of beneficial impact of integrated care on QoL was also evidenced in the subpopulation of progressive patients (which represents 84% of the whole population), although in this group, disability assessed by EDSS scores was reduced compared to the control group. This lack of correlation between QoL and disability contrasts with previous studies<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr18-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and is possibly explained by the fact that in our study EDSS changes were not confirmed at three or six months. Moreover, this difference in EDSS was no longer significant when missing data were excluded. Concerning the other secondary outcomes, which were not different in the two treatment groups, we noted that only depression assessed by HAD-D and INTERMED score were significantly associated with the MSIS-29 change at M6.</p><p>The INTERMED score was used at inclusion to better characterize the population studied. Among the 50 patients included in the study, the mean INTERMED score was 21. In a previous study<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> in MS analyzing 100 MS patients, mean INTERMED score was 14 (range 10&#x02013;18) for the whole MS population, but increased to 18 (range 13&#x02013;23) when the analysis was restricted to patients with more disability (defined as EDSS&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;4), this latter population corresponding to the population analyzed in our study. Although INTERMED score allows quantifying the area of patient vulnerability, further studies will be necessary to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of this score in MS.</p><p>Only a few studies have evaluated the impact of a multidisciplinary approach in chronic neurological diseases. Among these few studies, most focused on Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. A recent non-randomized study<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> comparing a multidisciplinary approach to usual care in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease did not find significant difference in disability score (American Medical Center Linear Disability Score (ALDS)) and QoL (Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQL)) scores used as primary outcomes. Contrary to our trial, referrals to the different health professional specialists in the &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; group of this Parkinson&#x02019;s study were not organized. However, the overview of the different visits showed that patients in both groups were indeed referred to different specialists, and therefore had in most cases multidisciplinary care, as in our study. In contrast, positive effects on different outcomes, including QoL, were reported in a Canadian randomized study<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. The differences between these two studies in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, which share a common design and assessed similarly ongoing care during eight months, were considered to be related to a lower number of patients and to the small size of the health care team in the latter study, as well as to large differences in the two groups concerning approach of care and settings.</p><p>Several methodological biases might have influenced our results: Clinical heterogeneity between the two groups was ruled out as, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2055217315608864">Table 1</xref>, these were well matched for disease severity (assessed by EDSS) and disease duration. In addition, the changes of secondary criteria were all correlated with changes in the MSIS-29, as expected.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Whereas we cannot totally exclude that missing data might have influenced the results, to conclude in favor of the IMD group, it should be assumed that the missing patients in the IMD group have improved, unlike missing patients in the other group. This seems unlikely.</p><p>In addition, the percentage of patients for whom referrals led to consultations was not different between the two groups, showing that, in contrast with our initial view, non-integrated care is not leading to weaker access to care.</p><p>We are aware that the size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50) of the study is limited, but the number of patients was calculated based on a previous preliminary study in which a mean improvement of 10 points over six months of the MSIS-29 scale in the IMD group and a mean worsening of six points in the control group was observed</p><p>In addition, we cannot exclude that the selection of our cohort might have influenced the results: The population included into the study is not representative of the whole MS population treated in our MS clinic, and focuses on a subpopulation of disabled patients needing multidisciplinary care and willing to participate in a trial. Furthermore, most patients in our cohort had a &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; disability, with a median EDSS score of 6; whether our results might differ in other MS cohorts, notably in patients with a more severe handicap remains an open question.</p><p>Finally, it is important to emphasize that motivational factors and barriers strongly influence individual long-term management of MS care. This was recently demonstrated by Helland et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2055217315608864" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>for MS patients applying for a stay in specialized rehabilitation centers, highlighting the need for better patient-centered communication.</p><p>In conclusion, the benefit of an IMD approach compared to usual care for disabled MS patients is not demonstrated. This result will influence our local organization. We believe that the benefit of the multi-disciplinary approach is less related to the modality of interventions (integrated or successive) than to the effective access to the resulting plan of care, which was not systematically reported in this study. Follow-up calls, notably by a dedicated MS nurse, should be organized in a systematic way, in order to assess that the patient is receiving the expected type of regular care. Further studies in which this &#x0201c;real-life&#x0201d; care is taken into account will allow us to better evaluate MS care organization.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed by Marie-Laure Tanguy and Laetitia.
