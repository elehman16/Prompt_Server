An essential element in a preventive dental program, for both the individual and the group, is a well-organized plaque control program.</p><p>Toothbrushing is the primary mechanical means for removing dental plaque, thereby assisting in the prevention of oral diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Toothbrushing is the most commonly recommended and performed oral hygiene technique all over the world. Like all other basic things, brushing technique should also be demonstrated to the masses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The most common technique used by uninstructed individuals is a horizontal scrubbing motion that engages the occlusal and buccal/lingual surfaces.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Effective plaque control can be achieved by introduction of the more advanced techniques of toothbrushing among the masses. In order to systemize the toothbrushing procedure, the techniques that have been suggested include Horizontal scrubbing, Roll technique, and Charters and Bass methods. There are no recent studies that compare toothbrushing methods. The original studies conducted were typically short-term, neither did they evaluate gingival health nor demonstrate one method as being consistently superior.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The Bass technique[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] was first described in 1954. In the past decade, it has become the method most frequently recommended method as it is easy to learn and emphasizes sulcular placement of bristles. The basic premise is to adapt the bristle tips to the gingival margin in order to reach the supragingival plaque, using controlled movement to avoid trauma and moving the brush systematically all around the teeth. It has been shown that proper use of The Bass technique three times a week will prevent the formation of subgingival plaque on buccal surfaces accessible to the toothbrush.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Health education is the channel for reaching the people and is vital to the practice of prevention. A health educated person is well aware of his own responsibilities and the steps he himself must take to receive the full benefits of prevention at all levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Importance of oral health education and motivation can be shown by giving demonstration to the patient by actually doing the things, by reviewing, by repetition, or by motivating patients. Various aids in dental health education can be classified as Audio aids, Visual aids, projected aids (films, slides, overhead projectors), non-projected aids-(black board, pictures, posters, photographs, models), and Audio-visual aids (televisions, laptops, video cassette).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>&#x0201c;ROBOTUTOR&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] is an audio-visual aid attempted to develop an electronic brushing model for demonstration of &#x0201c;The Bass method&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] of toothbrushing.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>ROBOTUTOR model image</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-16-417-g001"/></fig><p>Need to develop a brushing model-</p><p>

Twenty-five subjects believe that a clinician mode is easier to understand when compared with brushing ROBOTUTOR and Audio-Video aids. When attractiveness was compared, of 60, 26 subjects stated that Electronic model "ROBOTUTOR" was a more attractive and easy to recollect mode of brushing technique compared with clinician demonstration and audio-video mode. The results of the questionnaire showed that the demonstration by clinician is the best possible mode overall in terms of effectiveness, ease of understanding, while electronic model ROBOTUTOR was found to be more attractive and easy to recollect compared with the other modes [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. When intergroup comparison was done, the clinician demonstration mode of dental health education was found to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) than the other two modes.

Bass method and Roll method are two of the most commonly recommended techniques for toothbrushing in dental practice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Clinical reports have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Bass method. Several other studies compare the Bass method with other brushing techniques. Gibson and Wade[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] compared the effectiveness of Bass method and Roll technique in plaque removal, showing that Bass method was superior in cleaning the tooth tissue adjacent to gingival tissue of the facial and lingual aspects. Demonstration of proper brushing technique to the patient is an integral part of effective plaque removal and to prevent its accumulation on tooth surface. Patient can be educated with different modes of dental health education. Motion pictures, models, radio, newspapers, and exhibits are of distinct value and carry their message to a large numbers of people.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Electronic model &#x0201c;ROBOTUTOR&#x0201d; was found to be more attractive and a better mode compared with projected aids (Laptop) and it has got significant implications for private as well as community motivation. Large number of population can be educated with correct method of toothbrushing. Result of the present study suggests that demonstration by the clinician on one to one basis has a greater impact and reinforcement of the brushing technique can be done through ROBOTUTOR at the subsequent visits. Again, the cost for manufacturing this ROBOTUTOR amounts to about Indian Rs. 15000.00 only and the space required is about 15&#x000d7;12&#x000d7;10 inches, which is quite small and can be easily accommodated in the dental office or waiting room. This aids in the education of the accompanying person as well. The time required for demonstration of a toothbrushing technique is about 1 minute.</p><p>Other than a major advantage of mass education, human error in technique demonstration could also be avoided. However, the ROBOTUTOR model demonstrates only a single technique and is unable to reproduce all the movements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>An extremely common mode of delivery of oral hygiene messages is the personal instructions approach in the clinical settings on one-to-one basis. Although demonstration by clinician is the best, it is time consuming and not feasible for community purpose. ROBOTUTOR would thus save clinician's chair side time as well as help in effective demonstration of the brushing technique. However, further long-term clinical trials should be carried out to conclude the efficacy of ROBOTUTOR machine in plaque control program.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
