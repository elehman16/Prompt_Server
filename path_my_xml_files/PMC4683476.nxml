Recent developments have led to greater patient satisfaction and accelerated functional recovery, and shortened the duration of stay in the hospital significantly. It is a common practice to combined opioids and other adjuvant drugs along with local anesthetic agents. Many other drugs such as epinephrine, clonidine, ketamine, and neostigmine[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have also been tried alone and even in combination with opioids as an adjuvant to local anesthetic agents to prolong the duration of analgesia. Although opioids are associated with many side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, and hemodynamic instability, but they do not delay motor recovery.</p><p>In recent past, other drugs such as magnesium sulfate, dexmedetomidine, dexamethasone, and midazolam[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have been used as an adjunct in spinal anesthesia along with local anesthetic.</p><p>Magnesium sulfate acts by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels in voltage dependent fashion and can prevent the induction of central sensitization by peripheral nociceptive stimulation. The study was conducted to test magnesium sulfate in two different doses as an adjuvant to local anesthetic in spinal anesthesia for surgeries below the level of the umbilicus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Following the approval of Institutional Ethics Committee and written informed consent a prospective randomized double-blinded study was conducted from February 2005 to July 2005 in 81 cases.

All the patients were evaluated preoperatively and fully informed consent was obtained. Patients with hepatic and/or renal disease, diabetic, uncontrolled hypertension, allergic to opioids, receiving magnesium, with the use of another method of analgesia like nerve block or epidural anesthesia were excluded from the study. Premedication did not include any sedative or analgesic. H2 blocker was administered the night before and on the morning of surgery. Patients were kept fasting overnight.

</p><p>After shifting the patient in the operating room baseline values of heart rate, blood pressure (systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], and mean arterial pressure) [MAP], and SpO2 were recorded. After securing intravenous (i.v.) access all patients were preloaded with 10 ml/kg body weight of Ringer's lactate or 500 ml of Ringer's lactate whichever is high. Under strict aseptic precautions subarachnoid block was administered with the patient in sitting posture using the midline approach at L3/L4 or L4/L5 level with 25-gauge Quincke tip needle by the observer or the consultant anesthesiologist (blinded to the study drug) 3.5 cc of study drug was administered into the intrathecal space once the free flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is confirmed. The drugs used were Sensorcaine Heavy, manufactured by AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited; Magnesium Sulfate, manufactured in India by Hindustan Pharmaceuticals; Fendrop manufactured by Sun Pharmaceuticals. Patients in whom more than two attempts were taken to administer the block or in whom an approach other than midline was opted were deleted from the study. Patients were made supine once the drug was administered. No tilt of the table was allowed till 20 min after the administration of the drug at which time the level of the blockade was noted as the &#x0201c;highest level of block achieved (sensory level). The sensation was tested by pinprick method with 23-gauge i.v. needle.&#x0201d; The variables assessed were visual analog pain scale (VAS) which was explained to the patient preoperatively, pruritus, intensity of motor block, and somnolence before intrathecal injection and after intrathecal injection at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min in the 1<sup>st</sup> h, at every 30 min in next hour and then hourly afterward.

NMDA receptor antagonist plays an important role in the prevention of central sensitization of pain. Glutamate and aspartate neurotransmitters are released in response to noxious stimuli and bind to the NMDA receptors and various other excitatory amino acid receptors. NMDA receptors activation leads to calcium and sodium influx into the cell, efflux of potassium and initiation of central sensitization, and wind-up.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] NMDA channels are blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by magnesium, and it leads to a marked reduction in NMDA-induced currents.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Insufficient blood&#x02013;brain barrier penetration to achieve effective CSF concentrations limits the parental application of magnesium for antinociceptive modulation as NMDA receptor antagonist. Intrathecal magnesium could potentiate opioid spinal analgesia and avoid the potential side effects of larger doses of i.v. magnesium that may be required to observe antinociceptive modulation in humans.</p><p>The study was conducted to test magnesium in two different doses and fentanyl as an adjuvant to local anesthetic in spinal anesthesia for surgeries below the level of the umbilicus.</p><p>In our study majority of patients, the level of block achieved is T10 in all the four groups.

Two patients were excluded from the study because the surgeons decided to resect the rib hence general anesthesia was administered. Two patients were deleted from the study because the duration of surgery exceeded 180 min. One patient was deleted from NS Group during statistical analysis because the duration of analgesia in this patient was 1156 min, which is interfering with the statistical tests applied.</p><p>In our study with the use of fentanyl, magnesium sulfate 50 mg and magnesium sulfate 100 mg as adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine delay in onset of time to reach sensory block up to T10 level and motor blockade to Bromage score 3 is observed. A similar delay in onset of the spinal blockade was reported by Jabalameli and Pakzadmoghadam[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and another recent study by Kathuria <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] who also compared two different doses of magnesium sulfate as an adjunct to local anesthetic intrathecally.

The quality of block and duration of analgesia are not affected by the addition of magnesium sulfate in the two different doses as tested (50, 100 mg). However, M 100 is as effective as fentanyl. Fentanyl is an opioid and availability is license dependent. In terms of cost effectiveness and easy availability may be magnesium sulfate 100 is preferable to fentanyl as an adjuvant to local anesthetic for spinal
