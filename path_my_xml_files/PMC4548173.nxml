Green tea is consumed globally and is reported to have anti-inflammatory properties, which may be mediated through the impact on cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Recent data suggest that green tea catechins (GTCs) reduce acute UVR effects, but human trials examining their photoprotective potential are scarce.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to examine whether GTCs protect against clinical, histologic, and biochemical indicators of UVR-induced inflammation.</p><p><bold>Design:</bold> Healthy adults (aged 18&#x02013;65 y, phototypes I&#x02013;II) were randomly allocated to 1350 mg encapsulated green tea extract (540 mg GTC) with 50 mg vitamin C or placebo twice daily for 3 mo. Impact on skin erythema, dermal leukocytic infiltration, and concentrations of proinflammatory eicosanoids was assessed after solar-simulated UVR challenge, and subject compliance was determined through assay of urinary GTC metabolite epigallocatechin glucuronide.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Volunteers were assigned to the active (<italic>n</italic> = 25) or the placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 25) group. After supplementation, median (IQR) sunburn threshold (minimal erythema dose) was 28 (20&#x02013;28) and 20 (20&#x02013;28) mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> in the active and placebo groups, respectively (nonsignificant), with no difference in AUC analysis for measured erythema index after a geometric series of 10 UVR doses. Skin immunohistochemistry showed increased neutrophil and CD3<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte numbers post-UVR in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) with no statistically significant differences between groups after supplementation. Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (vasodilator) and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoicacid (chemoattractant), respectively, increased after UVR (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), with no differences between supplementation groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Oral GTC (1080 mg/d) with vitamin C over 3 mo did not significantly reduce skin erythema, leukocyte infiltration, or eicosanoid response to UVR inflammatory challenge.

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3"><sup>7</sup></xref> in sunlight is a key environmental trigger of acute adverse events, including dose-related inflammation (sunburn), photosensitivity, immunosuppression, and DNA damage, with repeated exposure leading to chronic photodamage and photocarcinogenesis. Topical sunscreens can protect by absorbing and scattering UVR but have drawbacks, including generally infrequent application outside of holiday times and inadequate application methods, with uneven spread and use at surface density considerably lower than the manufacturers&#x02019; sunscreen testing conditions (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A dietary approach to photoprotection could provide a continuous adjunctive measure, with population-level impact (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The acute response of the skin to UVR is orchestrated by cells within the epidermal and dermal layers that release mediators producing acute inflammation, which presents clinically as erythema and histologically as a dermal leukocytic infiltrate (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). UVR-induced oxidative stress stimulates expression and activity of cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>, leading to increased production of free arachidonic acid, which can be metabolized by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to a wide range of eicosanoids (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), many of which play roles in inflammation, notably the cyclooxygenase-2 product prostaglandin (PG) E<sub>2</sub>, a major mediator of UVR-induced erythema (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and the 12-lipoxygenase&#x02013;derived 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoicacid (HETE), a potent leukocyte chemoattractant (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) in the sunburn response.</p><p>There is considerable interest in the potential benefits to health of green tea, which is widely consumed in many parts of the world. In addition to a broad literature relating to their chemopreventive activities (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), green tea catechins (GTCs) have anti-inflammatory properties (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and are part of the polyphenol group, which can reduce the expression and activity of cyclooxygenase-2 and several lipoxygenase isoforms (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The green tea polyphenol (&#x02212;)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been reported to reduce cyclooxygenase-2 expression, in addition to UVB-mediated activation of nuclear transcription factor &#x003ba;B and neutrophil migration in vitro (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and oral GTCs were protective against UVR-induced skin inflammation as well as carcinogenesis in hairless mice (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In humans, topical application of GTCs before UVR reduced cutaneous erythema, leukocyte infiltration, and DNA damage induced by UVR (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), whereas oral consumption was reported to increase the clinical erythema threshold to UVR (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In a before-after pilot study, 12-wk oral GTCs led to incorporation of GTC metabolites into skin and modest protection against UVR-induced erythema, alongside reduced 12-HETE production (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The above findings indicated the requirement for a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of adequate sample size to examine in more depth the photoprotective potential of oral GTCs against acute UVR insult. We have conducted such a study of 3-mo oral GTCs with low-dose vitamin C in healthy humans, evaluating its ability to protect against UVR-induced inflammation by <italic>1</italic>) visual and objective assessment of clinical erythema after a range of UVR doses, <italic>2</italic>) histologic assessment of skin leukocytic infiltrate, and <italic>3</italic>) quantification of the major proinflammatory cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived mediators upregulated in sunburn, PGE<sub>2</sub>, and 12-HETE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Fifty healthy white adults (aged 18&#x02013;65 y), male and female, Fitzpatrick sun-reactive skin types I&#x02013;II, were recruited by open advertisement. Exclusion criteria were history of skin cancer or photosensitivity disorder, sunbed use/sunbathing in the 3 mo before the study, taking photoactive medication or nutritional supplements, consuming &#x0003e;2 cups of tea/d, or currently pregnant or breastfeeding. Ethical approval was obtained from the North Manchester Research Ethics Committee (reference 08/H1006/79). Written informed consent was obtained from the participants and the study adhered to Declaration of Helsinki principles. The study was conducted in the Photobiology Unit, Dermatology Centre, Salford Royal Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom, between November 2010 and August 2011. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive green tea extract plus vitamin C or placebo maltodextrin (1:1; block randomization with random block size between 4 and 8; StatsDirect v2.7.8, StatsDirect Ltd.). Containers containing active and placebo supplement were sequentially numbered. Subjects and investigators were blinded to the intervention, and the randomization code was held securely until completion of the study.</p><p>Green tea supplements were gelatin capsules each containing 450 mg green tea extract (180 mg GTC) (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and a further set of capsules each containing 25 mg vitamin C. Actively supplemented subjects took 3 green tea and 2 vitamin C capsules twice daily (with breakfast and evening meal; total daily dose 1080 mg GTC, 100 mg vitamin C; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) for 12 wk. Low-dose vitamin C stabilizes the green tea extract in the gut lumen and has been shown to have no impact itself on UVR erythema (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Placebo subjects took supplements comprising maltodextrin in gelatin capsules of identical appearance to those containing green tea and vitamin C. The primary outcome was change in the minimal erythema dose (MED) of UVR at 12 wk. Secondary outcomes were change in UVR-induced neutrophils and CD3<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in skin biopsy sections, as well as PGE<sub>2</sub> and 12-HETE in suction blister fluid at 12 wk. All supplements were provided by Nestec Ltd. and packaged in bottles with identical appearance by Laboratoire LPH. Compliance was assessed by counting residual capsules in dispensed containers returned by volunteers and measurement of the green tea urinary marker epigallocatechin glucuronide as described below.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Total daily amount of green tea extract constituents consumed by active group subjects</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Green tea constituent</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amount, mg</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gallic acid</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Catechin</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Epicatechin</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gallocatechin</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Epigallocatechin</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">295.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Catechin gallate</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Epicatechin gallate</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">156.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gallocatechin gallate</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Epigallocatechin gallate</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">435.6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>UVR exposure and assessment of erythema response</title><p>Exposures were performed by using a solar simulator with emission of UVB and UVA mimicking that of sunlight (emission 290&#x02013;400 nm; 5% UVB, 95% UVA; Newport Spectra-Physics Ltd).

However, limited information is available from human studies, with most data arising from experimental study of the most abundant GTC: EGCG. Skin is exposed to and requires protection from environmental UVR and itself provides an accessible organ for direct assessment of impact of in vivo supplementation in humans, facilitating noninvasive measurements, the administration of external challenges, and comparative ease and safety of tissue sampling. Our 3-mo supplementation trial was performed under controlled conditions, evaluating the impact of GTC ingestion on skin inflammatory status under basal conditions and after a reproducible acute UVR challenge to assess GTCs&#x02019; photoprotective potential.</p><p>In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, we found that oral GTC supplementation taken with low-dose vitamin C did not have a statistically significantly effect on the skin basal inflammatory status or the response to acute proinflammatory UVR challenge, including clinical and histologic sunburn outcomes, or their biochemical mediation through major proinflammatory eicosanoids produced via the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Thus, compared with placebo, oral supplementation with GTCs for 12 wk did not reduce UVR-induced inflammation in terms of the clinical erythema response, assessed both visually as the sunburn threshold (MED) and quantitatively across the UVR erythema dose-response (AUC for UVR dose vs. erythema index). Similarly, consumption of GTCs did not have a statistically significantly effect on infiltration of neutrophils or T cells after UVR challenge. Finally, GTCs did not have a statistically significantly effect on baseline or UVR-induced concentrations of PGE<sub>2</sub> and 12-HETE, which have roles in the mediation of sunburn vasodilatation and chemoattraction, respectively (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These data were obtained from volunteers demonstrated to be compliant with their supplementation.</p><p>There are several mechanisms by which GTCs might potentially suppress the sunburn response, including downregulation of cyclooxygenase and/or lipoxygenase expression as demonstrated in various cell models (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Other mechanisms include reduced production of proinflammatory and chemoattractant cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b1;, inhibition of T-cell proliferation (<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), and upregulation of antioxidant enzyme concentrations (<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These activities are supported by studies in rodent models, where green tea constituents modulated nuclear transcription factor &#x003ba;B signaling (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), attenuated UVR-induced cyclooxygenase activity (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and reduced neutrophil migration to sites of inflammation (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Topical application of GTCs was also reported to reduce UVB-induced production of nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide in a mouse model (<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In addition to the above, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase are molecular targets for other related polyphenols, with reports of reduced eicosanoid production by lipoxygenase isoforms, including 12-lipoxygenase, in vitro (<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>The above mechanistic studies and our pilot human study (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) indicated examination for the impact of oral GTC supplementation on the lipoxygenase metabolite and leukocyte chemoattractant 12-HETE, alongside cutaneous leukocyte infiltration. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in neutrophil numbers between supplementation groups or any difference in 12-HETE concentrations. Although topical application of GTCs before UVR exposure was reported to reduce UVB-induced leukocyte infiltration in animal models (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and in humans (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the current study is the first to report the impact of orally consumed GTCs on leukocyte infiltration and production of cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase metabolites in humans, as well as after a solar-simulated radiation challenge.</p><p>The UVR erythema response findings in our double-blind randomized controlled trial are in contrast to those in our previous open, uncontrolled study indicating GTCs might protect against UVR-induced erythema. This was a modest effect, evident as a reduction of the measured erythema index at the highest dose of UVR tested (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and followed supplementation with 540 mg GTC/d and 50 mg vitamin C/d (i.e., half the amount of the current study). It is important to acknowledge the limitations of open, uncontrolled studies, particularly the inability to allow for changes in outcome measures during the course of supplementation that are unrelated to consumption of the supplement. There is also the possibility of a nonlinear dose-response effect, because higher concentrations of nutritional supplementation are sometimes reported to be less effective (e.g., 200 mg vitamin E/d was more effective than 800 mg/d in enhancing T-cell responses in the elderly) (<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). However, the other published human study exploring the impact of orally consumed GTCs on sunburn, which examined for and found a suppressive effect on the visual erythema threshold (i.e., after a low-dose UVR challenge) used a higher dose of GTCs (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The participants were instructed to consume 1 L/d of a green tea beverage (1402 mg GTC with 119 mg vitamin C daily); this also contained a higher proportion of EGCG (daily: 100 mg epicatechin, 980 mg EGCG, and 238 mg epicatechin gallate) than our supplement (daily: 75 mg epicatechin, 436 mg EGCG, and 156 mg epicatechin gallate), and this may be the most biologically active GTC (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Other differences are that in our pilot study, the subject group comprised nearly all females, raising the possibility of a sex-specific effect; the BMI of the group was lower; and the challenges posed to rigorous blinding in a beverage study.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the double-blind randomized controlled design, a statistically justified sample size, and biochemical confirmation of subject compliance. We took an oral consumption approach rather than topical application, thus eliminating the possibility of a contribution of local protection from the UVR challenge by a sunscreen effect (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and with greater relevance to human nutrition. Objective measurement of sunburn erythema was made across the UVR dose series, enabling characterization of responses to threshold, moderate- and high-dose solar-simulated UVR, and the impact of GTCs on these. In view of ethical considerations and the range of samples taken in this study, there was not scope to take further skin tissue for assessment of target organ (i.e., skin) bioavailability of GTCs. Potentially, interindividual variability in the types of catechins and metabolites in skin postsupplementation, as demonstrated in our pilot study (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), may influence outcomes.</p><p>We conclude that in a compliant mixed-sex study population, the daily consumption of 1080 mg encapsulated GTC, equivalent to 5 cups of green tea, taken with 100 mg vitamin C, does not significantly affect the acute UVR-induced erythema (sunburn) response, dermal leukocytic infiltration, or the cutaneous production of proinflammatory cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites. Future studies might examine EGCG dose effect, discuss the impact on other chemokines, and explore the skin content of GTCs and their metabolites.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank research nurse Susan Bennett, University of Manchester, for assistance with procedures involving human volunteers and Andrew Healey, University of Bradford Analytical Centre, for technical support.</p><p>The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows&#x02014;MDF, AN, KAC, SM, KAM, TPD, and REBW: conducted the research and analyzed data; GW and LER: designed the research; MDF: performed randomization and statistical analyses; MDF and LER: wrote the manuscript; AN and GW: contributed to revisions of the manuscript; LER: had primary responsibility for final content; and all authors: read and approved the final manuscript.
