A large proportion (around 8% after radical prostatectomy and 2% after transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)) are left with severe disabling incontinence which adversely effects their quality of life and many are reliant on containment measures such as pads (27% and 6% respectively). Surgery is currently the only option for active management of the problem.</p><p id="Par2">The overwhelming majority of surgeries for persistent bothersome SUI involve artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) insertion. However, this is expensive, and necessitates manipulation of a pump to enable voiding.

We aim to resolve this by directly comparing the rate of incontinence at 12 months in a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT) powered on the basis that men would accept up to 15% lesser effectiveness in return for easier device operation and possible reduced adverse effects. We will recruit patients who have decided, with their clinicians, that surgery is needed. To address feasibility of recruitment, we have devised a schedule to give early indication of our ability to recruit to target but avoiding any disruptive pause if we are successful.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Scale of the problem in the UK and use of NHS resources</title><p id="Par51">Men undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer frequently report the troublesome symptom of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Prevalence estimates vary widely between 5% and 57% depending on definition, timing of assessment after surgery, and population characteristics. The rate of recovery of continence plateaus at around 12 months after surgery. This was confirmed in a recent large HTA-funded RCT of pelvic-floor muscle training (PFMT) in patients who suffered incontinence 6 weeks after radical prostatectomy. Subsequently, 40% had persistent UI at 1 year, with half of these (20%) having severe UI needing containment (incontinence pads or appliances) which then did not improve further during the second 12 months up to 24 months after the original surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">This means that of the 6000 patients currently undergoing radical prostatectomy in the UK each year, 1200 will be using additional treatments for resultant stress incontinence beyond 12 months. UI has a major impact on quality of life, including profound loss of self-esteem together with restrictions on work, social interaction and personal relationships including sexual life. The utility value associated with a person with UI is 0.72 compared to 0.93 in a comparable age-matched population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This is particularly devastating for men undergoing radical prostatectomy since they were typically without any urinary problems prior to the surgery, are fit for their age, and have a long life expectancy having generally been cured of their prostate cancer.</p><p id="Par53">Unfortunately conservative treatment with one-to-one PFMT has been shown to be ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], drug treatment is unproven, and men mostly cope by using containment products. Other treatments, such as injectables and inflatable balloons, have been reviewed, but there was insufficient evidence to support their use.</p><p id="Par54">Surgery for persistent bothersome SUI is traditionally by artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) as the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, this is invasive, expensive and involves manipulation of a pump located in the scrotum to enable voiding. Analogous to surgery for SUI in women, synthetic slings for men have recently been developed to elevate the urethra. This is thought by some as less invasive, more acceptable to some men, and less expensive, but there is no clear evidence for its comparative effectiveness against the standard AUS. Current NHS guidance states that the male synthetic sling should only be used in RCTs against the AUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Approximately 350 men were implanted with an AUS in the UK NHS during 2010 at a cost of &#x000a3;9000 per procedure; &#x000a3;3.2 million in total. The male sling was implanted in 30 men during 2010 at a cost of &#x000a3;6000 per procedure; &#x000a3;180,000 in total.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evidence for surgical management for men with urinary incontinence after prostate surgery</title><p id="Par56">There are no published RCTs comparing male slings with AUS. A Cochrane review found only one small, poor-quality RCT of surgery which suggested that implantation of artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) was better than an injectable bulking agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this RCT, the men treated with AUS were more likely to be cured (18/20, 82%) than those who had the injectable treatment (11/23, 46%, OR 5.67, 95% CI 1.28 to 25.10). All other evidence comes from case series which were recently summarised by the WHO-sponsored 4th International Consultation on Incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This reported that the median (range) cure rate after AUS was 82% (59 to 90%, 12 series) and for male sling was 63% (13 to 86%, 20 series) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A more recent review of the academic literature looked at six case series of men implanted with the AdVance&#x000ae; brand of male sling and reported a cure rate of 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More recently sub-group analysis from a large case series showed that at 3 years after sling implantation, men categorised on the basis of pad usage as having &#x02018;mild/moderate&#x02019; incontinence, had a cure/improved rate of 82% and those arbitrarily categorised as having severe incontinence had a cure/improved rate of 67% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These similar cure rates, which lie within the previously reported range for all degrees of incontinence, support our intention of not using the degree of incontinence as an eligibility criterion. Results from a further recent case series suggest that the outcome of implantation of AUS is not compromised by previous insertion of a male sling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As it is likely that some men in our trial, randomised to sling, may require subsequent repeat surgery, it is reassuring that their ultimate outcome is unlikely to be worse than those randomised to AUS.</p><p id="Par57">We have analysed long-term follow-up data from men approached for the Men After Prostate Surgery (MAPS) trial and found that around 70% of men still reported some urine leakage 4 to 6 years after a radical prostatectomy (<italic>N</italic> = 579), and 39% after a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) (<italic>N</italic> = 1413) (unpublished data). Of this cohort, 25% and 5% of men respectively were using pads, and 8% and 2% had leakage several times a day of a moderate or large amount of urine. A further 15 men had already had an AUS operation (of whom one required a second AUS operation), and six a male sling (of whom one required re-intervention by implantation of an AUS). In addition to these, a further 5% and 3% of men were considering surgery for incontinence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Evidence explaining why this research is needed now</title><p id="Par58">The most recent Cochrane review showed that the efficacy of conservative treatment with PFMT was still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the addition of other evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] did not change this conclusion. As a result, a large proportion of men (around 8% after radical prostatectomy and 2% after TURP) are left with disabling incontinence which ruins their quality of life and many have no option but to continue with containment measures (27% and 6%, respectively) (unpublished data from 4-6 year follow up of MAPS responders). Surgery is, therefore, currently the only option for active management of the problem. As such, the proposed trial will provide unique robust evidence, for patients, clinicians and healthcare policy-makers, on which to base treatment and healthcare provision decisions.</p><p id="Par59">The number of men undergoing radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer is increasing (from 2500 in 2008, to 3200 in 2010 to 5600 in 2011). This trend may continue, as localised prostate cancer case-finding using PSA testing increases, potentially leading to more men subsequently requiring surgery for prostate-cancer-treatment-related urinary incontinence. As an indication, if 50 more men required an AUS each year, this would cost the NHS an additional &#x000a3;450,000. While treatment with the male sling appears to be less expensive, the harms, further treatment and revision surgery needs to be taken into account to determine full comparative cost-effectiveness.</p><p id="Par60">Currently, the male sling is being offered to men seeking treatment with the NHS on a haphazard basis according to surgeon enthusiasm and local arrangements. Both clinicians and patients lack the evidence required to make an informed choice between the two options and NHS policy-makers lack information on cost-effectiveness to plan service provision. The MASTER trial will fulfil the research need identified by the recent Cochrane Review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] for adequately powered comparative RCTs of the surgical options for these men. The proposed trial will determine whether men can be confidently informed about whether implantation of the male sling gives equivalent effectiveness for cure of incontinence to the standard AUS. This will allow men and their clinicians to make an informed decision regarding the individual suitability of either option, taking into account other factors such as the relative need for subsequent re-intervention, the need to operate a control pump, and speedier recovery. As part of the trial design, we will take into account the different clinical characteristics of the men, such as type of prostate surgery, and identify factors which may influence comparative effectiveness, such as degree of incontinence. Affected men, clinicians and the NHS should benefit from the reliable evidence from the trial, to guide the choice of treatment and healthcare provision decisions, in terms of effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and adverse effects.</p><p id="Par61">At present the design and function of the AUS appears optimal, as, despite attempts to improve on the existing device there are no signs of significant innovations that would have to be considered prior or during this trial. Sling technology, however, is less mature and we anticipate that during the trial recruitment period, there may be a choice of implants from different manufacturers. For that reason we will not specify which brand of sling should be used. However, it should be of the sub-urethral trans-obturator type, as currently, almost all implanted slings are of this type, and the available outcome data are chiefly for this type of sling. We feel that this research is timely since a robust examination of the comparative effectiveness of this new surgical option should provide high-quality evidence to determine whether or not it should be adopted widely in the NHS.</p><p id="Par62">For a urologist to join the MASTER study, they must be uncertain regarding the best operative technique for correcting the man&#x02019;s incontinence, and hence be willing to randomise the majority of patients. All the urologists must be able to perform one or both of the two operations, and be willing to randomise between them. Urologists must consider themselves competent (beyond the learning curve) and in equipoise regarding their relative merits. If surgeons only perform one procedure, they will be teamed with a surgeon who can perform the other.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The questions which this study will address</title><p id="Par63">The aim of the trial is to determine whether the male sling is non-inferior to implantation of the AUS for men who have UI after prostate surgery (for cancer or benign disease), judged primarily on clinical effectiveness but also considering relative harms and cost-effectiveness. In order to determine whether the male sling or AUS is cost-effective for the NHS in the UK, the interventions will be compared in terms of: incontinence in men after prostate surgery; the relative harms of the interventions; costs to the patients, and to the NHS, including the need for repeat surgery in both groups; and overall patient satisfaction.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Principal objectives</title><p id="Par64">

</p><p id="Par67">In the long term there is a need to capture the consequences of both devices. We consider the primary outcome of the trial to be a non-inferiority comparison on rate of incontinence at 12 months. Our reason for this approach is that if the male sling is inferior (by at least the agreed margin) in the short term, then male slings will highly likely not be introduced throughout the NHS, irrespective of longer-term costs and consequences. However, if the difference in effectiveness is within the non-inferiority margin, the cost-effectiveness analysis, using outcomes over 24 months, will be required to decide on the relative worth of the interventions to the NHS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p id="Par68">

For the purposes of the trial we will define men with mild incontinence as those not requiring surgery. There is no clear threshold for defining moderate or severe incontinence and no clear evidence of differential benefit for either intervention according to degree of incontinence. We will, therefore, include all men whose incontinence is considered, from both the patient and surgeon perspectives, to require surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par86">Participants will be recruited from NHS secondary care urological centres throughout the UK. Discussions at a number of meetings facilitated by the relevant professional organisation, British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS), has gained consensus from urologists that they would be willing to randomise participants to either option. Participants will be referred by their oncological urologist, specialist cancer nurse or local urologist or continence advisor. The BAUS Section of Oncology and the Section of Female Neurological and Urodynamic Urology have been kept fully involved during the planning of this trial and have given the study their full support. However, the applicants have collaborations with colleagues throughout Europe, particularly in Belgium and The Netherlands and the protocol would be made available for their participation, if agreed, and separately funded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Planned interventions</title><p id="Par87">Two surgical operations for male UI, the experimental technique of synthetic male sling, and the standard technique of AUS implantation will be evaluated. Divergence from pre-specified choices will be documented with reasons. All other operative variables will be described using standardised data collection forms. The surgical options have been agreed and standardised by consensus within the research team and with the recruiting urologists.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Male synthetic sling (male sling)</title><p id="Par88">The male sling costs approximately &#x000a3;6000 per procedure (NHS tariff + device cost of &#x000a3;2000) with a typical 1-day hospital stay. It is placed under the urethra to elevate it and is held in place by passing it through the obturator foramen of the pelvic bone bilaterally. It has a passive mode of action. The aim is to stop the loss of urine on exertion and the operation is effective immediately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Artificial urinary sphincter (AUS)</title><p id="Par89">The artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) costs approximately &#x000a3;9000 per procedure (NHS tariff + device cost of &#x000a3;4500) with a typical 2-day hospital stay. It consists of an inflatable cuff placed around the urethra, a pressure regulating balloon to keep the cuff inflated, and a pump, placed in the scrotum, that the patient squeezes when they need to void. The aim is to close the urethra so that the patient is dry except when they wish to void. Once implanted the device is deactivated in the open position for a period of approximately 4 to 6 weeks to allow post-operative swelling to subside. The patient then returns to hospital for the device to be activated and to ensure that they are able to use the device correctly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Planned inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par90">

The consultant/research nurse will introduce the trial to the patients and, if interest is expressed, provide details of the trial by means of the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL). Each patient will have the opportunity to discuss the trial with the local clinical team. Patients may make a decision to participate during this consultation, at a separate appointment, at a pre-admission clinic or while at home or on admission for their operation. Men who agree to be contacted at home may receive a telephone call from the local research nurse to discuss any queries. Patients who decide to participate following telephone counselling can either send their completed documents (consent and baseline questionnaire) through the post to the local team at their treating hospital or bring it with them if they are returning to hospital for another consultation or treatment. The 24-h test pads will also need to be taken into hospital for weighing at clinic visits, on the day of operation or information about the pad weight collected by telephone prior to this date.</p><p id="Par100">Each man will be asked for his signed informed consent to be randomised and followed up after surgery by postal questionnaires and clinical review.

Randomisation will be by secure remote third-party either via computer allocation using a web application or telephone.

The investigators are specialist urologists who will be responsible for recruiting and randomising men. All will be experienced in performing both operations, or if a surgeon performs only male sling or AUS, then they will be &#x02018;paired&#x02019; with a local urologist who performs the other procedure, thereby guaranteeing that all participants will be operated on by the surgeon experienced in the operative technique to which he is randomised.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Standardisation of surgical techniques</title><p id="Par109">The surgical procedures and other operative variables have been standardised as much as possible by using agreed protocols developed by the urological grant holders (Professors Abrams, Drake, Mundy and Pickard). Any deviations from agreed protocols will be recorded. All investigators are experienced urological surgeons. Investigators, who are experienced in male sling surgery, will deliver any additional training if required. The clinical grant applicants will ensure standardisation of existing techniques and outcome measures, including the use of new devices.</p><p id="Par110">The research nurses and/or the surgeons will complete a theatre Case Report Form (CRF) at the time of surgery, to ensure a complete record of all surgical techniques and materials used, and any intra-operative difficulties or complications. The research nurses in each centre will ensure completeness and accuracy of data entry using remote data capture via a trial web-based portal at the Study Office in Aberdeen, authored and managed by the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT), the UK CRN-registered trials unit in Aberdeen.</p><p id="Par111">As this is a pragmatic trial, post-operative care will be according to local centre practice, but clinical and resource-use data will be recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Loss to follow-up (attrition bias)</title><p id="Par112">Loss to follow-up in our previous trial of conservative treatment for men with UI after prostate surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] was 5 to 10% at 1 year. However, a less optimistic estimate of 15% loss to follow-up has been used in the sample size calculations. We will take very active measures to minimise such loss, such as phoning the participants, using retention incentives and checks with their general practitioners (GPs). In addition, we will obtain consent from the participants to enable us to access centrally held NHS data; for example, via the NHS Strategic Tracing Service in England and Wales, and using Community Health Index (CHI) numbers from the Information Services Division in Scotland.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Other sources of bias (detection bias)</title><p id="Par113">After randomisation, participants will not be told of their allocation before surgery unless they specifically request this information. Blinding in theatre is not possible given that this is a surgical procedure trial with different implantation devices. After surgery, group allocation cannot be concealed from the participant or the ward staff due to the nature of the device. Outcome assessment is largely by participant self-completed questionnaire, so avoiding interviewer bias.</p><p id="Par114">Research staff will be blinded to allocation while conducting data collection for outcomes (e.g. pad test weighing), performing data entry and analysis, and by using Study Numbers only to identify participants, questionnaires, diaries and pads. Participants will be asked not to reveal information about their surgical treatment. Staff will be asked to record whether or not they knew which operation was performed before undertaking outcome assessments. All participants will be actively followed up, with analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle. All analyses will be clearly predefined to avoid bias.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par115">There is a lack of robust evidence from comparative studies on which to base the trial sample size calculation. For the primary outcome (incontinence), limited evidence from case series suggests that 20% of men would still be incontinent 12 months after AUS. For male slings, after primary implantation the percentage of men who are incontinent is thought to be 35%.</p><p id="Par116">For our chosen non-inferiority comparison at 12 months, a trial with 310 participants will allow us to be 90% sure that the lower limit of a two-sided 95% confidence interval will exclude the possibility that the AUS is more effective by a margin of 15% or more. Allowing for 15% loss to follow-up after enrolment we plan to recruit 180 participants per group into the trial. This sample size will allow the detection of a difference equivalent to 0.25 of a standard deviation (SD) at 80% power between the groups for the key secondary outcome, International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ) at 24 months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Subsequent arrangements</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Informing key people</title><p id="Par117">Following formal trial entry:</p><p id="Par118">The Study Office will:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Inform the participant&#x02019;s GP (by letter) enclosing information about MASTER and the Study Office contact details</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par119">The local research nurse/recruitment officer and/or urologist will:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par120">File the hospital copy of the consent form in the hospital notes along with information about MASTER</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par121">Inform the ward and theatre staff as appropriate of the participant&#x02019;s entry to the trial and details of the intervention allocation (theatre only)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par122">Use the MASTER Internet database to enter data regarding the participant, including data required to complete randomisation; and intra-operative and post-operative information abstracted from local medical records</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par123">Maintain and archive study documentation at the site.

An independent DMC will review confidential interim analyses of accumulating data at its discretion but at least annually. A major consideration for the DMC will be to monitor the 12-month primary outcome (i.e. the non-inferiority margin).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec54"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p id="Par204">The trial will include a formal economic evaluation assessing the costs and cost-effectiveness of the interventions compared from the perspectives of the NHS and the participants and their families. Resource-use data collected will include the cost of the intervention and the use of primary and secondary NHS services by the participants, including further referral for subsequent additional specialist management. Health service costs refer to those incurred directly by the NHS due to the surgery and subsequent appointments and procedures. Personal costs to the participants (such as costs of travelling to appointments and work/social restrictions) will also be investigated.</p><p id="Par205">Resource use will be recorded prospectively for every participant within the study. For the surgical interventions, operative details will be recorded at the time of surgery (e.g. time the surgery takes, the time spent in recovery, grade of surgeon and assistant, grade of anaesthetist). A parallel exercise will establish resources used immediately before, during and after (i.e. in recovery) the operation, e.g. other staff, consumables (surgical requisites) and capital (costs associated with using the theatre facilities, costs of using reusable equipment). Costs to the participants will be collected using a questionnaire based on one developed by the UK working party on patient costs. The use of secondary care services (e.g. length of hospital stay, outpatient appointments, and readmission) will be abstracted from patient notes or questionnaires. The use of primary care services, including medications prescribed will be collected using a patient questionnaire. Unit costs/prices will be obtained using published estimates for healthcare services and/or interventions.</p><p id="Par206">A generic instrument (the EQ-5D&#x02122;) will be used to measure health state. Trial participants will be asked to complete the EQ-5D&#x02122; at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months after their operation. This instrument will provide the quality of life weights to compute the QALYs.</p><p id="Par207">Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be computed comparing the cost of the interventions. The difference in effectiveness will be expressed in terms of the number of participants who are still incontinent at 24 months. These data will be based on responses to either of two questions relating to the loss of urine, retrieved from the participant questionnaires. Incremental cost-utility ratios will be computed comparing the interventions. The difference in utility will be expressed in terms of QALYs at 24 months. Where appropriate, the analysis of incremental costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be based on similar statistical models as those outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan above. This &#x02018;within&#x02019; trial analysis will include both deterministic and stochastic sensitivity analyses to explore statistical and other forms (e.g. around unit costs or the source of utility estimates) of uncertainty.</p><p id="Par208">An economic model which considers a longer time horizon will also be developed to provide additional information for policy-makers. In the model, the findings of the trial will be extrapolated to the participant&#x02019;s life time. The model will describe care pathways that men may follow and will include the initial surgery and any subsequent treatments. The structure of the model will be developed in collaboration with the expert panel of service users, patients, clinicians and trial collaborators. Parameter estimates for relative effectiveness up to two years, costs and utilities will be derived from the trial data. Data from the trial will be supplemented with data from other sources (e.g. Cochrane review, other future RCTs). These data will be assembled systematically and will follow guidelines for good practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par209">Outcomes in the model will be expressed in terms of an incremental cost per QALY. Parameter uncertainty will be integrated by the incorporation of probability distributions into the model and involve Monte Carlo simulation. Other forms of uncertainty, such as that associated with choices made about the structure of the model, discount rate, etc. will be addressed through sensitivity analysis. The base case and sensitivity analyses will be presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The model will also be used to identify priorities for further research by investigating the expected value of information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec55"><title>Recruitment rates and milestones</title><p id="Par210">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the projected recruitment of centres and participants, and the projected number of men to be approached.

We will make a decision about feasibility at around month 15 when 82 centre months have been accrued and approximately 43 participants randomised. We anticipate that this should include &#x02018;steady state&#x02019; data from the five selected pilot centres and initial data from up to 10 other centres more recently set up. This rule will try to statistically assess the accumulating recruitment to see if it is consistent with the required rate to recruit on time and budget to the full trial. It would take the form of &#x02018;If recruitment is at least 37 of the anticipated 43, continue unchanged to full study; if between 26 and 36, then consider modifying the design; if 25 or less, consider that the trial is not feasible&#x02019;. If the trial progressed as planned we would anticipate having 117 randomised participants by month 24, 281 patients by month 36 and the remaining 79 patients by month 42, making a total of 360 participants.</p><sec id="Sec56"><title>Extension to recruitment</title><p id="Par212">Due to the slower than anticipated recruitment, a 9-month extension has been approved.

For this reason, chief credit for the study will be given, not to the committees or central organisers, but to all those who have collaborated in the study. The results of the study will be reported first to study collaborators. The main report will be drafted by the Project Management Group and circulated to all clinical collaborators for comment. The final version will be agreed by the Trial Steering Committee before submission for publication, on behalf of all the MASTER collaborators.</p><p id="Par307">To safeguard the integrity of the main trial, reports of explanatory or satellite studies will not be submitted for publication without prior agreement from the Project Management Group.</p><p id="Par308">We intend to maintain interest in the study by publication of MASTER newsletters at intervals for participants, staff and collaborators. Once the main report has been published, a lay summary of the findings will be sent in a final MASTER newsletter to all involved in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="FPar17"><title>Risks and benefits</title><p id="Par309">The benefit to the men participating in the trial is the chance of receiving the optimum treatment for that condition, although we do not know what that treatment is. The risks are that they may have a sub-optimal operation but any operation carries a risk, and it is not known which is optimal or more risky. The benefit to participants, the NHS and society is that at the end of the trial, it should be known whether one operation is more effective and cost-effective than the other.</p></sec><sec id="FPar18"><title>Information about risks and benefits and informed consent</title><p id="Par310">Men will be informed of possible benefits and known risks of participation in the trial by means of a PIL, discussion with the local research nurses and their own consultant urologist. Patients will be having incontinence surgery anyway, and we do not know that they will run additional risks by participating in the trial. They will sign a consent form approved by the Ethics Committee. They will be consented to participating in the study with follow-up, being randomised, being contacted in the future about this and other research including electronic tracing using NHS data, and data linkage with computerised NHS data sources. Men who are not able or not willing to be randomised will not be recruited but will be asked to consent to long-term follow-up, including those who agreed to enter the non-randomised cohort while that part of MASTER was open (up to and including 27 October 2015).</p><p id="Par311">A standardised Surgical Information Sheet (SIS) will be used to provide specific clinical information for men about the two surgical options, including known complications.</p></sec><sec id="FPar19"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par312">This work is supported by a grant from the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (Project Number 11/106/01).
