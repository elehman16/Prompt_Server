In keeping with this, the addition of GIP does not affect insulin or suppress glucagon response to enteral nutrient. While these observations are at variance with the outcome of studies performed in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), they are consistent with the reported effects of concurrent administration of GLP-1 and GIP in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>The doses of GIP and GLP-1 used were based on previous studies. We have reported that GLP-1 at 1.2 pmol/kg &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> attenuates, but does not abolish, the glycemic response to enteral nutrition in critically ill patients with and without type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). While this is the first report on the effects of GIP in the critically ill, in healthy volunteers, the coinfusion of GIP at doses &#x0003e;1 pmol/kg &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is additive to the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). We confirmed that GIP concentrations reached pharmacological levels, so it appears unlikely that the negative outcome of our study reflects an insufficient dose of GIP.</p><p>The reason GIP failed to lower glucose concentrations may relate to antecedent glycemic control, as the insulinotropic effect of GIP is markedly attenuated in various conditions associated with chronic hyperglycemia, such as latent autoimmune diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, and monogenic diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Moreover, in vivo, hyperglycemia acutely reduces the expression of GIP receptors on &#x003b2;-cells, providing a plausible explanation as to why even pharmacological concentrations of GIP are not insulinotropic during chronic hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). H&#x000f8;jberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) recently reported that the insulinotropic property of GIP increased several-fold following 4 weeks of near-normal glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. These data and ours indicate that the response of the &#x003b2;-cell to pharmacological doses of GIP is acutely susceptible to the effects of antecedent glycemia. In both healthy humans and patients with pre-existing hyperglycemia and hyperglucagonemia, exogenous GIP is reportedly glucagonotropic, which would counteract any insulinotropic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, we observed a modest glucagontropic effect during fasting (T<sub>60</sub>), which is unlikely to be of clinical significance.</p><p>There are limitations to our study. We cannot exclude the possibility that GIP alone lowers glycemia in the critically ill compared with placebo. Our cohort was relatively small and heterogeneous, and the exposure to exogenous GIP was relatively short (7 h). It therefore remains possible, albeit intuitively unlikely, that an insulinotropic effect would be apparent during more prolonged GIP exposure.</p><p>In conclusion, this study indicates that the addition of GIP to exogenous GLP-1 does not yield any additional glucose-lowering effect, nor potentiate insulin secretion, in critically ill patients. The implication is that the insulinotropic capacity of GIP, unlike GLP-1, is diminished in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia, as is the case in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
