However, little is known about the efficacy of smoking cessation intervention delivered to the general population through a community-based screening program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A quasi-experimental untreated control design with pre-test and post-test was conducted with 42 subjects receiving advice from physician and nurses (the PNA group), 39 receiving an informational leaflet (the leaflet group), and 308 control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall rate of reaching the action stage was 25&#x000a0;%, 5.7&#x000a0;%, and 7.8 in the PNA group, the leaflet group, and the control group, respectively. In approximately 45&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% of all participants, the stage remained unchanged. Such an association between the intervention groups and stage changes was statistically significant (<italic>p&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;0.02). The PNA group was more likely to have the improvement of stage (forward transition toward action stage) than the control group [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.27 (1.07&#x02013;4.84)]. Deterioration (backward transition toward precontemplation) in the PNA intervention group was 37&#x000a0;% lower than that in the control group [aOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63 (0.20&#x02013;2.01)].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that smoking cessation advice from physician and nurse is conducive to smoking cessation, as shown by greater movement toward and less movement away from smoking cessation through a community-based integrated screening platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12971-016-0080-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Community</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>Smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>Transtheoretical model</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The efficacy of brief advice provided by health care professionals in smoking cessation program has been demonstrated to detect a significant increase in the rate of quitting by 66&#x000a0;% in comparison with no advice by polling data from 17 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In spite of the finding from the trials, it would be more informative if a further study is conducted to throw light on why and how it works by assessing the dynamic changes of processes in relation to smoking cessation based on the transtheoretical model (TTM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Instead of treating smoking cessation as a dichotomous status (smoking and quitting), the TTM model considers smoking cessation a complex and continuous cyclic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It describes and explains different stages of behavior change and the process of change by defining five specific stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the choice of theoretical model, setting for smoking cessation play an important role. The most common setting for delivery of smoking cessation advice was the primary care setting, followed by hospital wards, outpatient clinics, and industrial clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Intervention has been rarely designed to be delivered in a community setting and targeted at the general population. With the advent of population-based screening for cancers and chronic diseases, it has been advised that screenings may provide an opportunity for teaching smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], including self-help information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], physician referral for abnormal computed tomography findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and smoking cessation advice from physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, the smoking cessation programs have been jointly conducted with those screening programs for lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and also for cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Following the model built in Keelung Community-based Integrated Screening program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], Nantou County&#x02019;s community-based integrated screening (CIS) (see below) aimed to deliver out-reaching screen service into communities for residents aged 20&#x000a0;years or over in Nantou. It is therefore possible for using the CIS as the platform for delivering a smoking cessation intervention for the underlying population.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two intervention strategies, advice on smoking cessation from physician and nurses and a self-contained informative leaflet, on the transitions through smoking-cessation stages (including forward transition toward the action stage and the backward transition toward precontemplation) through a community-based integrated screening program. Because the smoking prevalence rates were 46.9&#x000a0;% for males and 4.6&#x000a0;% females in Taiwan, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we only included men subjects in the current analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>Subjects were selected from those who smoked and attended a community-based integrated screening program in Nantou, the central county in Taiwan, a multiple-screening model that has been described in full elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In brief, the Health Bureau of Nantou County developed a program following the Keelung community-based integrated screening program (KCIS), which is tailored for early detection of multiple diseases including five cancers (breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancers, and hepatocellular carcinoma) and three chronic diseases (type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and hypertension). The recruitment criterion was in light of self-reported smoking status obtained from the questionnaire which was administrated by screening attendees themselves at on-site screening. Because there were few female smokers (2.6&#x000a0;% of smokers), study population were limited to males only.</p><p>All participants provided individual written informed consent during the uptake of screening asked their permission to link their screening data to external data such as national mortality for evaluating the survivorship of each participant for research purpose only. The current analysis had been approved by the local ethical committee of Nantou Health Bureau. All procedures met requirements mandated by the ethical guidelines for research in Taiwan today, including no-harms to participants, informed contents, privacy consideration, no interest conflict, prudent sample size calculation, and the freedom to withdraw from study. The research project was approved by local health authority to meet any ethical requirement mandated by Taiwanese government.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design, intervention, and data-collection protocol</title><p>A quasi-experimental untreated control design with pre-test and post-test was adopted. The intervention was related to smoking cessation. Pre-test and post-testing were to measure the stage changes in smoking cessation following the transtheoretical model. The selection of intervention group and the control group is delineated as follows. Ten out of thirteen towns/villages in Nantou County were involved in the current smoking cessation study. Three were excluded due to the consideration of feasibility of local health manpower.</p><p>The smoking status was self-reported by a questionnaire. The question was &#x02018;Do you have smoking habit currently?&#x02019; the answer included (1) never smoke (2) quitted and (3) smoke currently. Because the study population were current smokers, the quitter was define as those who had quit at follow-up telephone survey.</p><p>A total of 6,372 subjects (638 in intervention group and 5,734 in the control group) attended the Nantou Community-based Integrated Screening (NT-CIS) from February to September 2003. According to screening data, 103 smokers were identified in the intervention area out of 638 participants, and the smoking rate of the intervention group was 16.14&#x000a0;%. We provided screening results for participants within 2&#x000a0;weeks after on-site screening. The participants in the intervention area were classified according to whether they came back to consult with the screening report in person. Among the male smokers, 40 smokers took screening report at health station in person and received smoking cessation advice from physician and nurses directly. This group was defined as the &#x02018;physician- and nurse-advised group&#x02019; (PNA group). Another 53 smokers who did not come back to take screening report in person, defined as &#x02018;the leaflet group&#x02019;, received smoking cessation advice, a smoking cessation informational leaflet, and their screening report by mail.</p><p>For intervention groups, PNA group received advice from physician including (1) a brief summary on smoking participant&#x02019;s age, smoking history, and chronic disease history accrued from screening questionnaire, (2) biochemical examination results from on-site screening, and (3) a formal documentation of audience on smoking cessation signed by physician. The average time to persuade participants to stop smoking through physician was 42&#x000a0;s. Participants who were introduced by the advice of smoking cessation upon recommendation by physician signature were taken by public health nurse to assess the willingness of stop smoking and the degree of addiction to smoking, and provide relevant information on smoking cessation for them. Those who failed to take the results of first stage of screening were noticed by mail with recommendation on smoking cessation and relevant information, harm of smoking, and benefit of smoking cessation on health together with the results of the first stage of screening.</p><p>In the control group, there were 5,734 participants and 1,065 smokers. The smoking rate of the control group was 18.57&#x000a0;%. We chose 390 male smokers (approximately four times the number of study subjects in the intervention groups) from the control group by simple random sampling. This group, defined as &#x02018;the control group&#x02019;, was still invited to undertake the routine screening but none of any formal smoking cessation advice either from physician or nurse directly or from the mailed leaflet was provided.</p><p>Public health nurses followed all three groups (namely PNA, leaflet, and control groups) by telephone from October to December 2003, approximately 2 to 8&#x000a0;months after screening, to interview them in order to glean information on smoking cessation stage.

Baseline variables from the questionnaire included age (&#x02264;50, 51&#x02013;64 or &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years), smoking commencement age (&#x0003c;20, &#x02265;20&#x000a0;years), time of first cigarette in the morning (&#x0003c;30 or &#x02265;30&#x000a0;min after waking), smoking cessation advice from others in the previous 6&#x000a0;months (yes/no), and personal disease history (hypertension, diabetes).</p><p>The primary outcome variable was the change in smoking cessation stage, as measured by the response to two questions: &#x02018;are you a current smoker?&#x02019; and &#x02018;have you ever seriously considered stopping smoking, and if so, when do you plan to stop?&#x02019; Possible responses to the first question were &#x02018;yes&#x02019; and &#x02018;no&#x02019;. Responses to the second question included &#x02018;never&#x02019;, &#x02018;yes, but not sure when I will quit&#x02019;, &#x02018;yes, and I intend to quit in the next 6&#x000a0;months&#x02019;, &#x02018;yes, and I intend to quit within one month&#x02019;, and &#x02018;I have quit smoking&#x02019; (this response was in the follow-up questionnaire only). Following the transtheoretical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the smoking cessation stages at baseline were divided into three categories: precontemplation (smokers who have never considered quitting), contemplation (smokers who have considered quitting), preparation (smokers who have considered quitting and intended to quit in the next 6&#x000a0;months and this month). The smoking-cessation stage at follow-up was categorized into one of four stages, precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, and action (smokers who had quit at follow-up).</p><p>The outcome variable was the change in smoking cessation stage, which was classified in one of three categories at follow-up based on a comparison with the stage at baseline: &#x02018;improvement&#x02019;, &#x02018;deterioration&#x02019;, and &#x02018;no change&#x02019;. Improvements included the change from precontemplation at baseline to contemplation, preparation, or action at follow-up; the change from contemplation at baseline to preparation or action at follow-up; and the change from preparation at baseline to action at follow-up. Deterioration included the change from contemplation at baseline to precontemplation at follow-up and the change from preparation at baseline to precontemplation or contemplation at follow-up. &#x02018;No change&#x02019; referred to smokers whose stage at follow-up was the same as that at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) were used to describe the distribution of demographic and smoking-related control variables. We used chi-square and <italic>t</italic>-tests to examine differences between baseline information and intervention. The Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to examine differences between categories when cell numbers are small. To assess the effects of intervention on the changes in smoking-cessation stages given the low number of participants, we defined three categories of stage change: improvement, deterioration, and no change, as mentioned above. We used frequency and percentage to show distribution of smoking cessation stage at follow-up survey by stage at baseline and three groups. Then, we used the chi-square test to examine the relationships among the three categories of smoking cessation stage change and related factors, which included age, smoking commencement age, time of first cigarette in the morning after waking, cessation advice from others, and intervention group. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to estimate the intervention effect after adjustment for other significant variables. A significance level of 5&#x000a0;% was set for statistical significance. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Descriptive results at baseline</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the frequencies of sociodemographic characteristics, smoking-related behaviour, and history of chronic disease at baseline among male smokers.

The strategy provided with only leaflet (the leaflet group) for participants could not have such benefit. Of the smoking-related factors, taking advice from others was conducive to regression to a stage farther from the action stage, whereas its effect on movement toward the action stage was small. Other smoking-related factors such as age of smoking commencement and time of first cigarette after waking in the morning did not statistically influence improvement or deterioration in smoking cessation stage.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Effects of physician and nurse advice on the change in smoking cessation stage</title><p>Our major intervention program was based on advice from physician and nurses, as this is often regarded as a potentially efficient approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Our main finding was consistent with the results from systematic review that concluded that physician advice and a good booster from nurse&#x02019;s consultation and advice for smokers to quit will increase the rate of smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>However, as seen in previous studies, most physicians have not routinely asked about their patients&#x02019; smoking status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and most smokers did not receive advice to quit from their physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, a large proportion of primary care physicians did not follow recommendations to promote smoking cessation among their patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The barriers to offering smoking prevention counselling included lack of training in smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], lack of patient educational materials, and lack of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. On average, smokers were less likely to have received advice to quit if they were single (compared with divorced, widowed, or separated), had higher levels of education, were lighter smokers, had no previous quit attempts, and had physicians who smoked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is timely to provide an easier and quicker reminder method for physician to give smoking cessation on smoking clients during screening process. Our study designed a simple smoking cessation advice form as a reminder to the physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Effects of informative leaflet distribution on smoking cessation stage</title><p>We did not see a benefit of the intervention that entailed distributing the self-contained informational leaflet in our study, which was consistent with result from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Among current smokers who underwent low-dose fast spiral chest CT for lung cancer screening, those who received standard written self-help materials or a written list of internet resources for smoking cessation showed no statistically significant change in the 7-day point prevalence quit rates or advancement in motivational readiness to stop smoking compared with the control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>The cyclic smoking cessation process using a transtheoretical model</title><p>The proposed analysis method for our data is unique because we focused not only on stage changes from precontemplation to action but also on changes in the reverse direction, e.g., from preparation to precontemplation. Shedding light on these cyclic processes is informative for understanding the factors that may account for stage changes indicating improvement, i.e., movement toward action, and deterioration, i.e., movement away from action. Identifying both promoters and inhibitors of smoking cessation gives clues for designing an effective intervention program. Analysis of these cyclic processes has not been considered in previous screening-based intervention studies addressing changes in smoking cessation stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In our finding, in addition to forward transition, the deterioration rates in the control group, i.e., movement from preparation to contemplation or to precontemplation, were considerably higher than those in the PNA group (75.1&#x000a0;% versus 0&#x000a0;%). The deterioration rate from contemplation to precontemplation was only slightly higher in the control than in the PNA group (52.9&#x000a0;% versus 44.4&#x000a0;%), suggesting that smokers in the contemplation stage at baseline had the same chance of regressing to precontemplation regardless of the intervention group or the control group.</p><p>Our study found that those who had received cessation advice from others were more likely to show deterioration than were those who had not received such advice. Few studies have been conducted to address why advice from others showed an adverse effect for smoking cessation. It is possible that advice from others in our study may contain information that decrease the negative outcome expectations of smoking and the positive outcome expectations of quitting. It requires a further study to clarify this cause.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Limitations and suggestions</title><p>There are pros and cons of the current study. Strength of the current study are that the intervention program in a community setting is relatively inexpensive and accessible to community residents. The weaknesses resulting from the expediency of this community-based study is a lacking of randomized controlled study design and is limited to the allocation of participants to two interventions using other areas without intervention program as the control group. However, as we have considered several confounding factors, particularly smoking behaviours the results are supposed to be credible and comparable to that if the randomized controlled trial design is adopted. As participants were not randomly assigned to the intervention groups (PNA and informational leaflet) the group-assignment of participants in our study to the PNA group or the leaflet group was highly affected by depended on whether the participants came back in person to receive the first-stage screening report. Such an assignment may introduce bias, e.g. participants who returned to take the screening in person and were assigned to the PNA group may be more motivated to stop smoking compared to participants who did not return and were assigned to the leaflet group. However, we believe this concern may not be serious due to the fact that there were lacking of statistical significance differences across intervention groups with respect to baseline characteristics. Admittedly, we have no information about the maintenance of stage changes. The small sample size of some groups may limit the results, particularly in regard to deterioration in stage changes. As far as statistical power is concerned, although the optimal ratio of case to control group in term of cost and effect- size related to statistical power is 1 to 4, the ratio of case to the control group increased to 1 to 9 in the current study may increase cost but may not mitigate statistical power.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A community-based smoking cessation intervention with a transtheoretical underpinning demonstrated that advice on smoking cessation from physicians and nurses is effective in smoking cessation, as evidenced by improvement in the stage of smoking cessation and a reduction in regression toward precontemplation.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12971_2016_80_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Implementation procedure and data collection.
