PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S ribosomal DNA genes together with Fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) combined with flow cytometric analysis were performed at that time. In recent years however, the rapid development of sequencing techniques including the application of high-throughput methodology enables the analysis of hundreds of samples from different origins to conduct genetic audits of faecal material to a much greater depth than previously possible. Based on this, amplification of the interspace regions (IS-regions) was performed with the high-throughput bacterial profiling technique IS-pro (IS-diagnostics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). This technique combines bacterial species differentiation by the length of the 16S-23S rRNA interspace region with instant taxonomic classification by phylum-specific fluorescent labeling of PCR-primers. The 16S-23S rRNA IS region is variable in size and sequence, making it well suitable for analysis of complex communities. The procedure consists of two multiplex PCRs, a combination of which provides very broad coverage for <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia</italic> (AFFV), <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>. For detailed information on the design of the used primers we refer to our previous publication.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Amplifications were carried out on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Each PCR mixture, with a final volume of 25 &#x003bc;l, contained 10 &#x003bc;l of buffered DNA, 1x superTaq buffer (Applied Biosystems), 200 &#x003bc;M deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.04% BSA, 1 U of superTaq (Applied Biosystems), and 0.13 &#x003bc;M of each of the 5 primers.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Data analysis</title><p>After pre-processing, which consisted of baseline correction and noise-filtering of data using a standardized &#x02018;rolling ball-algorithm&#x02019; (IS-pro software suite, IS-diagnostics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), each sample was represented by a microbial profile, consisting of color-labeled peaks. Each peak was characterized by a specific IS fragment (measured in number of nucleotides) and a color related to a specific phylum group. The intensity of peaks reflected the quantity of PCR product (measured in relative fluorescence units (RFU)). Each peak was designated as an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and its corresponding intensity as abundance. Intensity values were log2 transformed in order to compact the range of variation in peak heights, to reduce the dominance of abundant peaks and to include less abundant species of the microbiota in downstream analyses. The cutoff level was set to &#x0003c;6 logRFU.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This transformation results in improved consistency of the estimated correlation coefficient, lower impact of inter-run variation, and improved detection of less prominent species. This conversion was used in all downstream analyses, such as calculating within-sample and between-sample microbial diversity. A clustered heat map was constructed by generating a correlation matrix based on cosine correlations of all log2 transformed profile data followed by clustering with the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA).[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Diversity analysis and discriminative features selection</title><p>Diversity was calculated using the Shannon index,[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] representing diversity per time point, and differences in this index were tested with Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Dissimilarities between samples, or between-sample diversity, were calculated using the cosine distance measure between each pair of samples&#x02019; profiles.

Follow-up ended at the age of six years. Our data suggest that, regardless of intervention or atopic disease status, children develop a stable, converging gut microbiota during their first years of life. Age was the major driver of microbiota composition, overriding the differences based on intervention or development of atopic disease and the gut microbiome development is suggested to continue between 2 and 6 years of age.</p><p>In line with this finding,intestinal microbiota development is currently thought to stabilize by the end of the first year of life and the composition considered to resemble the adult gastrointestinal tract by the age of 2 to 2.5 years.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Koenig <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] showed that the qualitative measures of diversity responded to time, but the quantitative measures (such as abundance) responded to life events (illnesses, dietary changes, antibiotic treatment). Yatsunenko <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] described an adult-like configuration within a three-year period after birth and showed some differences in clustering between very young children and adults. Results of Ringel-Kulka <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] extend this difference (by describing significant differences in diversity between the group of 3&#x02013;4 years old children and adults) and indicate that the microbiota has not yet reached the climax of bacterial diversity at the age of 4 years. The authors suggest that the evolvement into adult-like microbiota continues beyond 3 years of age. Our data support the last suggestion as the gut microbiome development seemed to continue between 2 and 6 years of age, though a specific time point for microbiome stabilization could not be indicated.</p><p>The presence of probiotic strains in stool samples was confirmed during supplementation. The fact that <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> was substantially absent in the placebo group during the intervention period is not surprising as the <italic>Lactococcus</italic> genus is not considered a commensal in infants. There was however a significantly higher presence and abundance of <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> at the age of two years (T7) in the placebo group compared to the probiotic group (9/45 versus 1/37) as we specifically analysed the presence of this strain being part of the supplied probiotic product. This difference can be caused by the introduction of solid food and the variability of the children&#x02019;s diet at this age, because <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> is a well-known ingredient of buttermilk and cheese. When analysing the prevalence of <italic>Lc</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> at the age of two years in more detail, there was a tendency towards a higher prevalence in the atopic children within the placebo group (7/45) when compared to the non-atopic ones (2/45). This difference was however not significant after correction for multiple testing.</p><p>At the age of two weeks (T2) the diversity of Bacteroidetes was significantly higher in the placebo group compared to the probiotic group, a finding also described by Enomoto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] at the age of four months. This could suggest that probiotics suppress the acquisition of genera belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. Hypothetically, this could cause relevant disturbances on gut microbial patterns over time and have effects on clinical outcomes, since lower diversity of the phylum Bacteroidetes has been related to increased risk of asthma and atopic sensitization.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] However, clinical results of the present study showed significantly lower eczema during the first 3 months of life in the intervention group compared with placebo, which does not point towards a predisposing role for the development of asthma and atopy in our population. Moreover, the difference demonstrated here seems to be without long-term consequences as microbiota composition of placebo and probiotic children showed no significant differences anymore during follow-up.</p><p>In this study no evident long-term consequences of probiotic supplementation on microbiota composition were found, as the abundance of probiotic strains decreased after the intervention and effects on diversity and abundance disappeared afterwards. Our results are in line with those described by Nylund <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] who showed that <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG supplementation during the first 6 months of life, in children with and without eczema, had only minor long-term effect on the microbiota composition. Enomoto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also demonstrated limited changes in the composition of faecal microbiota after bifidobacteria supplementation during the first six months of life to healthy infants.</p><p>The exact in vivo mechanism of action of probiotics in shaping the immune response still needs to be determined and a number of unanswered questions remain regarding how probiotics mediate their clinical effects. The intestinal microbiome may contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases due to its substantial effect on mucosal immunity. A probiotic may have a direct interaction with the ecosystem within the gut lumen by providing enzymatic activities that cause metabolic effects, it can interact with the gut lumen mucus and epithelium, and may be signaling the host to other organs beyond the gut.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>The design of the present study allowed us also to study potential differences in gut microbiota development in children who did and did not develop atopy. Variations in early gut colonization have been associated with the development of atopic disease. Results have, however, been highly variable across studies. Wang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] examined overall patterns of faecal microbial colonization in healthy and atopic infants and found that infants who developed eczema had significantly lower faecal bacterial diversity at 1 week of age. Others have confirmed that reduced gut microbial diversity in early life was associated with an increased risk of eczema[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and multiple differences in specific bacterial groups result in microbiota profiles that are significantly distinct between healthy and eczematous infants.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Johansson <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the kinetics of colonization postnatally seemed to differ generally in non-allergic children compared to allergic children, with a delayed colonization in early infancy in the allergic group. At 12 months of age however, the groups of children were similar in the frequencies of the different species investigated. Bisgaard <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] described a population of high-risk infants comparable to the present study and showed an association between reduced bacterial diversity of the infant&#x02019;s intestinal microbiota with increased risk of allergic sensitization, allergic rhinitis and peripheral blood eosinophilia, but not asthma or atopic dermatitis, in the first 6 years of life.</p><p>In contrast to the above findings, in our study, abundance and diversity were the same over time in atopic and non-atopic children though small differences were seen. This is in accordance with a prospective study from 3 European birth cohorts that also found no differences in gut microbiota among infants developing or not developing atopic eczema and food allergy.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>Differences in findings between all these studies, including ours, may reflect differences in methods used for investigating the faecal microbiota or even differences in defining atopy. Our study does endorse the importance of the gut microbiota composition in early life, because of the beneficial clinical effect of probiotics on eczema,[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but besides effects on gut microbiota composition during the intervention, no long lasting differences could be identified. In this respect, recent data point towards a major role for short chain fatty acids production, especially butyrate, in regulation of development of mucosal regulatory T cells. Therefore, next to the 16S-23S rRNA gene analysis, as performed in this study, microbial metagenomics (whole genome shotgun sequencing) could further expand the understanding of gut microbiota development and composition and microbial metabolomics may reveal mechanisms by which gut microbiota interacts with the human host.[<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137681.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, supplementation with a probiotic mixture consisting of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>bifidum</italic> W23, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> W52 and <italic>Lc</italic>. <italic>Lactis</italic> W58 to children at high-risk for atopic disease had only minor effects on gut microbiota composition.
