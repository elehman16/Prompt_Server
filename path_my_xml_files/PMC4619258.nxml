Longitudinal data have shown that adolescent adiposity and fat distribution tracks into adulthood, as 50&#x02013;80% of obese adults have been shown to be also obese as adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CVDs are associated with alterations in blood lipids, such as elevated triglycerides (TG), low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and alterations in lipoprotein subclasses [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition to dyslipidemia; hypertension, low cardiovascular fitness, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are also known modifiable risk factors that are associated with risk for CVDs [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, it has becoming increasingly clear that low cardiovascular fitness may exacerbate CVD mortality risk, and that increasing peak cardiovascular fitness to &#x0003e; 5 peak metabolic equivalents (MET) can reduce and perhaps eliminate mortality rate associated with dyslipidemia, obesity, TDM, and hypertension [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, it is important to better understand how exercise interventions affect risk factors associated with cardiometabolic diseases, especially in the adolescent and young adult population.</p><p>Despite the well-established benefits of routine physical activity for improving cardiometabolic health, it remains difficult for health professionals to get individuals to adhere to current physical activity guidelines of at least 30 min per day of moderate intensity exercise 5 days per week or vigorous exercise for 20 min per day 3 days a week [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, given that &#x02018;lack of time&#x02019; is the most commonly cited barrier to exercise adherence, more recent studies have focused on identifying a more time-efficient mode of exercise training. Low-volume, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) (consisting of 30 second all out sprints separated by recovery intervals) is a mode of training that requires very little time, yet in many studies shows similar improvements in reducing cardiometabolic risk factors as traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MIT) programs despite only requiring 10&#x02013;20% of the time commitment [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Given these findings, HIIT may be an ideal mode of training in adolescents and young adults who often struggle to find the time to exercise as they transition from participation in youth and team sports and embark on their college education or become working professionals.</p><p>A growing body of evidence has demonstrated comparable or superior improvements in cardiometabolic health outcomes using HIIT as compared to MIT [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For example, HIIT interventions have shown similar improvements in skeletal muscle metabolic adaptations, cardiovascular fitness, vascular function, and body composition as compared to a much higher volume of MIT [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, Trapp et al. compared 15 weeks of HIIT versus MIT and found a significant decrease in subcutaneous fat and increase in fat-free mass in the HIIT group whereas no change in subcutaneous fat or fat-free mass occurred in the MIT group [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, several recent studies that did not include a MIT comparison group have demonstrated the ability of HIIT to reduce whole body and abdominal fat mass while increasing fat-free mass [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, based on these observations HIIT may provide a more optimal exercise stimulus to promote fat loss while preserving fat free mass during weight loss.</p><p>To date, there are limited data on the benefits of HIIT on glycemic control. A few studies have shown improvements in insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, or 24-hr glucose concentrations using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], however only two of these studies included a direct comparison with a MIT exercise group [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Of these two studies, one found improvements in both the HIIT and MIT groups over time [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while the other only found an improvement in the HIIT group over time with no change in the MIT group [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, several studies that did not include a MIT group using sprint interval training and other modes of HIIT have demonstrated an improvement in post-prandial glucose metabolism and glucose tolerance acutely, however the chronic effects of this mode of exercise on glucose regulation is less understood [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, these data demonstrate the benefits of HIIT but the relative health benefits between HIIT and MIT are less clear. If comparable, HIIT may be a &#x02018;time efficient&#x02019; mode of exercise training that may be ideal for adolescents or young adults who struggle with time management or other obstacles to adhering to current exercise recommendations.</p><p>Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of six weeks of HIIT vs MIT for improving body composition, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, blood lipids, and cardiovascular fitness in a cohort of sedentary overweight young men (age 17&#x02013;22 years old). We hypothesized that HIIT would result in similar improvements in body composition, cardiovascular fitness, blood lipids, and insulin sensitivity as compared to the MIT group, despite requiring only one hour of activity per week compared to five hours per week for the MIT group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 28 sedentary overweight or obese (BMI 25&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) men between the ages of 17&#x02013;22 years.

Readings were taken after 12 hours of fasting between 7:00&#x02013;9:00 AM.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Oral glucose tolerance test and insulin sensitivity</title><p>Whole body insulin sensitivity (S<sub>I</sub>) was assessed using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on an in-patient basis in the Clinical Research Unit of UAB&#x02019;s Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCTS) after an overnight fast. The final OGTT was performed at least 24 hrs following the last exercise session for each group. Prior to testing, a flexible intravenous catheter was placed in the antecubital space of the arm. Two baseline blood samples were taken over a 20-min period to determine basal glucose and insulin. At time 0 each subject consumed a 75-g oral glucose load within 5 min. Blood samples were collected at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after glucose ingestion for measurement of plasma glucose and plasma insulin. Blood was immediately centrifuged, separated for serum, and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. Assays were performed in the CCTS Metabolism Core. Serum glucose assays were performed on an automated glucose analyzer (Sirrus analyzer; Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX), and serum insulin was measured using an immunofluorescent method with an AIA-600 II analyzer (TOSOH Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA) per manufacturers' instructions. Whole body insulin sensitivity (S<sub>I</sub>) was calculated from OGTT data using the Matsuda index [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A second measure of insulin sensitivity was calculated using the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. QUICKI was calculated as 1/[log glucose (mg/dL) + log insulin (&#x003bc;U/ml)].</p><p>Insulin resistance (IR) was assessed using the Homeostasis Model of Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). HOMA-IR was calculated as [fasting insulin (&#x003bc;U/ml) x fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/22.5.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Resting energy expenditure</title><p>Resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. Subjects remained awake in a quiet, softly lit, well ventilated room in which temperature was maintained between 22 and 24&#x000b0;C. Subjects lay supine on a comfortable bed and oxygen uptake was measured using a ventilated hood system. After resting for 15 minutes, oxygen uptake was measured for 30 minutes with a computerized, open-circuit indirect calorimetry system (Delta Trac II, Sensor Medics, Yorba, CA, USA). The last 20 minutes of steady state data were used for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Lipoprotein Analysis</title><p>Fasting blood samples were collected via antecubital venipuncture into K<sub>2</sub>EDTA-containing vacutainers. Tubes were kept on ice (no more than 20 minutes) until centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C. A volume of 0.5 mL of plasma was stored in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes at -80&#x000b0;C until shipped to LipoScience for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) for lipoprotein profile analysis. Samples were shipped per LipoScience instructions (overnight on dry ice) and analyzed via LipoScience&#x02019;s proton NMR lipoprotein analysis methodology based on deconvoluting methyl proton signals centered at 0.8 ppm [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. NMR spectrum analysis provides estimates of lipoprotein particle size (nm) and concentration (nM or &#x003bc;M). Specifically: small, medium, and large HDL; small and large LDL; IDL; small and medium VLDL; and combined large VLDL and chylomicron particles. Because participants were fasting, the contribution of chylomicrons to this latter category should be minimal.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Additional Blood Analyses</title><p>Laboratory analyses were conducted in the Core Laboratory of the CRU, Nutrition Obesity Research Center, and Diabetes Research Center.

All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Differences between groups at baseline were assessed using either a two-sample t-test for continuous variables or a chi-square test for the categorical variable race. As a validity check to confirm expected metabolic improvements of being in an exercise study with two active treatments, the overall pre-post differences were tested using a paired t-test. The primary analysis assessed the treatment effect on the change over time using an ANCOVA model with the baseline outcome value and proportion of scheduled workouts completed (18 for HIIT, 30 for MIT) as covariates. Subjects with missing values for follow-up were excluded from the primary analysis (i.e., a complete-case analysis), as this study was designed as a small efficacy study and the effect of either treatment arm is dependent on active participation in the study. As a sensitivity analysis, an intention to treat analysis (ITT) was conducted in which the data were analyzed as randomized using the full information restricted maximum likelihood in a repeated measures model with Kenward-Roger correction for degrees of freedom when testing the treatment-by-time interaction. The validity check for expected pre-post differences was verified by examination of the main effect of time in this model. No clear violations of the normality assumption were observed. No corrections were made for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec020"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-eight participants enrolled in the study.

The primary findings from this study were that young, previously sedentary overweight or obese men randomly assigned to six weeks of MIT had a significantly greater improvement in cardiovascular fitness as compared to the HIIT group, but otherwise displayed no significant difference between groups. Combined, after being randomized to HIIT or MIT, the participants displayed: 1) improved insulin sensitivity, 2) reduced blood lipids, 3) decreased percent body fat, and 4) improved cardiovascular fitness. Overall, these observations suggest that a relatively short duration of either HIIT or MIT training may improve cardiometabolic risk factors in previously sedentary overweight young men, consistent with established cardiometabolic benefits of exercise versus inactivity. However, it is important to note that in the absence of a no-exercise control group we cannot exclude the possibility that these improvements were due to other changes in diet or lifestyle that may be occurring in sedentary young men who have transitioned to a desire to improve their health and fitness.</p><p>There have been multiple studies that have shown the ability of HIIT to improve overall cardiovascular fitness [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Some studies have found a greater improvement in VO<sub>2peak</sub> in HIIT as compared to MIT [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; whereas others have found no difference in VO<sub>2peak</sub> improvement between HIIT and MIT [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similar to these studies we also demonstrate that a short duration of HIIT can lead to significant improvements in VO<sub>2peak</sub>. However, contrary to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] we found a greater VO<sub>2peak</sub> improvement in our MIT group (11.1%) as compared to our HIIT group (2.8%). Improvements in VO<sub>2peak</sub> have been reported in the ranges of 4&#x02013;13% after 2&#x02013;10 weeks of HIIT training in previously sedentary individuals [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These differences between studies may be due to differences in exercise intensity and interval duration. Generally, it has been shown that low-volume, all-out-sprint interval training (20 minutes, ~ 250% VO<sub>2peak</sub>) as used in this study yields no significant differences between HIIT and MIT [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], whereas lower intensity intervals performed for longer durations (40&#x02013;60 minutes, between 80&#x02013;100% VO<sub>2peak</sub>) consistently yield greater improvements in HIIT compared to MIT [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Importantly, while there are varying results between studies, improving overall cardiovascular fitness is critical because low fitness is known to be the strongest predictor for adverse cardiometabolic health outcomes and all-cause mortality [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the VO<sub>2peak</sub> improvements in the MIT and HIIT groups in this study are sufficient to translate into a clinically significant reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality risk [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>It is critical to recognize early abnormalities of glucose and insulin metabolism in order to prevent progression of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities associated with hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance. Exercise training has long been recognized as a means to improve glucose homeostasis via both a short-term, insulin-independent mechanism and a long-term, insulin-dependent mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the effect of exercise intensity for improving insulin sensitivity is less understood. For example, two different studies by the same research group have shown that total exercise duration may be more important when assessing insulin sensitivity within 24 hours after the last exercise bout [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], whereas moderate intensity exercise and vigorous intensity exercise may have similar benefits for improving long-term (&#x0003e;24 hrs) insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The present study assessed insulin sensitivity at least 48-hrs after the last exercise session because we wanted to examine the training effect of exercise, as opposed to the effect of acute muscle contractions, on glucose regulation. We found no significant difference between HIIT and MIT, but did demonstrate an overall 17.6% increase in insulin sensitivity from baseline to post-exercise training in all participants. Thus, it appears that both low-volume HIIT and continuous MIT may provide health benefits that lead to improved glucose tolerance for as long as 48-hrs following the last exercise bout. To date, several studies have shown improvements in glucose homeostasis following HIIT [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, because the only two studies to include a MIT exercise group for comparison yielded different results [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], it is difficult to confidently make conclusions on the impact of HIIT compared to MIT on glucose regulation [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Future, well-powered randomized controlled trials should be conducted to address these gaps in the literature.</p><p>Several recent studies have shown improvements in body composition in both men and women following HIIT [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Specifically, a significant increase in fat-free mass and decease in fat-mass has been shown in recreationally active men and women [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and a significant decrease in whole body and abdominal fat mass was shown in overweight women [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, these results have not been corroborated in all studies as no change in body composition has been observed following HIIT in several other studies [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The present study found no differences in changes in body composition between HIIT and MIT, but there was a significant decrease in body fat % from baseline to post-exercise training in all participants. These data suggest that performing relatively little HIIT training as compared to MIT may yield similar improvements in body composition in overweight young men. While variable results have been reported, it cannot be ignored that HIIT requires 20% of the time commitment as MIT and may therefore be a more time-efficient approach for achieving the beneficial effects of exercise on body composition. However, more long term studies comparing HIIT and MIT on body composition measures are warranted before we can confidently prescribe HIIT as an alternative to MIT for improving body composition and long term weight maintenance.</p><p>No change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure was observed in the primary analysis of this study. However, the ITT analysis showed a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure in the MIT compared to the HIIT group. Blood pressure was assessed on average at least 48hrs following the last exercise bout, thus the lack of a decrease was likely due to the timing as exercise has been shown to transiently lower blood pressure for up to 24hrs post-exercise [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Indeed, Whyte et al. used a similar protocol as our study and found a significant reduction in blood pressure at 24hrs, but not 72hrs following HIIT [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The majority of studies that have demonstrated an improvement in blood pressure following chronic exercise training have assessed blood pressure within 24 hrs of completion of the last exercise bout, thus we chose to assess blood pressure at 48hrs in order to assess more chronic adaptations following exercise because the acute responses have been well documented. We found no significant differences for changes in blood lipid concentrations between HIIT and MIT; however we did find an overall significant decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides, medium VLDL, and medium HDL from baseline to post-exercise training. There have been several studies examining the effect of HIIT on serum lipids [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These studies have generally assessed total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides. There have been a few reports of an increase in HDL-C following at least 8 weeks of HIIT with no improvements in the MIT groups [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; however no other changes in blood lipids were observed. We did not find any improvements in HDL-C in this study, but we did see improvements in total cholesterol, triglycerides, medium VLDL particle concentration, and medium HDL particle concentration before and after training in HIIT and MIT combined. More recently it has become evident that lipoprotein subclasses may be more clinically meaningful compared to traditional assessment of serum lipids [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For example, different sizes and densities of HDL particles have been differentially associated with CVDs in population studies and CVD mechanisms in ex-vivo studies [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Specifically, large HDL particles are associated with a reduction in CVD whereas medium and small HDL particles may be linked to increased risk of CVD. Additionally, small and medium LDL particles appear to be stronger predictors of CVDs compared to larger LDL particles [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Given these data, although we did not see a significant change in HDL-C or LDL-C, the decrease in both medium- VLDL and HDL particles and a trend for a decrease in small- HDL particles (P = 0.09) suggests an improved blood lipid profile that favors a reduction in CVD risk.</p><p>Strengths of this study included state of the art measures of cardiovascular fitness, body composition, insulin sensitivity, and robust measures of lipoproteins, and supervised exercise training in a clinical setting. A primary limitation in this study was the lack of a no-exercise control group. Thus, we are unable to determine causality in our interpretation of the observed exercise-induced improvements in health parameters. To estimate the effects of MIT and HIIT against a no-exercise control, future randomized controlled studies should be performed for longer durations and include all three groups. However, the purpose of this study was to conduct a head to head comparison of MIT vs HIIT at intensities we hypothesized would result in similar effects, while also having a markedly different time commitment.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that HIIT and MIT are both associated with improvements in cardiometabolic health in sedentary, overweight, young men. Similar to many previous investigations, HIIT requires substantially less time commitment compared to continuous MIT, but elicits many of the same improvement in overall health. The only significant difference between groups was a greater improvement in cardiovascular fitness in MIT as compared to HIIT, thus when comparing our HIIT protocol to the MIT protocol used it may be more favorable to utilize MIT when trying to improve overall cardiovascular fitness. While it is premature to conclusively recommend HIIT as an alternative mode of exercise training, the lower time commitment needed to perform HIIT may be more appealing and help to improve exercise adherence. Additionally, the use of HIIT in populations other than athletes or young, healthy individuals is a common concern when considering HIIT as an alternative exercise treatment. However, several recent studies in patients with metabolic syndrome and coronary artery disease have shown that HIIT can be successfully implemented without complications [<xref rid="pone.0138853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138853.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We also found that HIIT was well tolerated in overweight/obese and sedentary men. Thus, we believe that HIIT may be an ideal mode of training alone or as a compliment to MIT or resistance training. Future research should be conducted to refine training duration and intensity in order to identify optimal doses to target specific health benefits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138853.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>Consort 2015 Checklist Document.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138853.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138853.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>HIIT MAX Institutional Review Board Approval Document.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138853.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Supported by an unrestricted gift from the non-profit Coca Cola Foundation and NIH grants UL1RR025777, P30DK56336, and T32DK062710.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0138853.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
