Patients were evaluated daily for VAP. In the suspicion of a clinical diagnosis of VAP, tracheal aspirates with a sterile sputum trap for semi-quantitative cultures or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were collected for bacteriological culture. Blood cultures were also obtained. The presentation of VAP with clinical signs of septic shock (needing inotropes) was documented.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Administration of antibiotics</title><p>On isolation of strains of multiresistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (including carbapenems), patients were randomly assigned to colistin monotherapy or combination therapy. The dosage of colistin sulfomethate sodium (Colistin; Norma, Athens, Greece), administered intravenously, was 3 MU three times daily, adjusted for creatinine clearance according to formulas.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Colistin (in the same dose as previously) was combined with ampicillin/sulbactam 6 (4 + 2) gr four times daily. Ampicillin/sulbactam was reduced in the half when the estimated creatinine clearance was below 20 ml/min.</p><p>Nearly all patients initiated antimicrobial treatment empirically when VAP was clinically diagnosed. However, the treatment was modified (i.e., previous empiric antibiotic regimen administered until then for Gram-negative bacteria were discontinued) when the pathogens were cultured, and their susceptibilities were identified, according to our protocol. Seven patients overall &#x02013; three to A, four to B groups &#x02013; were receiving colistin in the initial empirical antimicrobial scheme but &#x0003c;72 h, usually in combination with imipenem, when susceptibilities were available. In these patients, colistin was continued, and ampicillin/sulbactam was started as appropriate (Group B). No patient was receiving ampicillin/sulbactam as empiric therapy.</p><p>Participants were excluded from the study if empirical antimicrobial treatment against Gram-negative bacteria was longer than 72 h. Participants were randomized and included in the study if colistin was in the initial empirical antimicrobial scheme for VAP. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of VAP but without microbiological documentation, as well as polymicrobial VAP were excluded from the study.</p><p>Day 0 (D0) was considered the ICU day of initiating the study treatment. The therapy was scheduled to continue for at least 10 days; however, the exact length of treatment was decided by agreement among the physicians of the department. If the physician in charge of the patient considered imperative to change or to add treatment (i.e., because of the isolation of a new microorganism other than <italic>A. baumanni</italic> in the face of a new sepsis), this case was included in the study, if there was clear evidence of the course of the therapy.</p><p>When monotherapy with colistin was considered unsuccessful after 4 days, ampicillin/sulbactam was added; again, when this scheme was considered unsuccessful, the physician in charge was free to modify treatment. Similarly, the combination therapy (Group B) could change after the 4<sup>th</sup> day, considering this case as unsuccessful treatment.

The decision of the clinical response was made by the physician in charge of the patient; however, when there was doubt, the decision was taken by agreement among the physicians of the department. Tracheal secretions were evaluated before extubation or at the end of antimicrobial therapy, if the patient was still intubated, to assess <italic>A. baumannii</italic> eradication (microbiological cure). Treatment was considered as a failure if the patient died during deteriorating clinical findings of VAP or septic shock or if the physician in charge of the patient changed therapy after deteriorating clinical findings; however, if the death occurred within 48 h of the initiation of therapy, the case was not considered as true antibiotic failure and was not included in the study.</p><p>Accordingly, VAP-related mortality was defined as death that occurred during the treatment period, when the signs of pneumonia remained; death due to septic shock was considered when the cause could not be attributed to other causes than VAP. Overall mortality was assessed at 28 days of VAP onset.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Definitions</title><p>The clinical prerequisite for the diagnosis of VAP was the radiographic appearance of a new and persistent pulmonary infiltrate and at least two of the following criteria: temperature of &#x0003e;38.0&#x000b0;C or &#x0003c;35.5&#x000b0;C, leukocytosis (leukocyte count &#x0003e;12,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) or leukopenia (leukocyte count &#x0003c;4000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) or 10% premature leukocytes/mm<sup>3</sup>, and purulent bronchial secretions. Microbiological documentation of VAP required bacterial growth of &#x0003e;10<sup>4</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/ml from a diagnostic BAL or &#x0003e;10<sup>5</sup> CFUs/mL from endotracheal aspirates. Endotracheal aspirates were required to have &#x0003e;25 neutrophils present on Gram's stain, with ten epithelial cells or fewer per high-power field to be accepted for culture of potential pathogens. Only episodes of VAP caused by <italic>A. baumannii</italic> alone were considered. Pneumonia was considered to be ventilator associated when onset occurred 48 h after the initiation of mechanical ventilation (MV) and was judged not to have been incubating before the initiation of MV.</p><p>Treatment period for VAP was defined as the period where patients received treatment for VAP (treatment could be the same during the whole period of treatment or different regimes could be used according to the attending physician's decision. This period is not the same in different patients [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]).</p><p>Blood examinations (white blood cell and platelet counts and biochemistry for renal and liver function) were closely monitored. CRP on D0 was defined as the CRP value before the initiation of the study treatment, whereas CRP on D5 was defined as the CRP value on the 4<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;5<sup>th</sup> of treatment. When the patient died before 4<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;5<sup>th</sup> day, D5 was considered as the last value available. The value of creatinine of the last day of colistin administration (in alive or succumbed patients) was compared to creatinine at treatment initiation with colistin. Any decline in renal function that resulted in the need for renal replacement therapy (continuous venovenous hemofiltration [CVVH]) was also recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Quantitative variables were expressed as mean value &#x000b1; standard deviation. In comparing the two groups, continuous parameters were compared using Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test) and categorical parameters were compared using Fisher's exact test. The associations between response outcome (or survival outcome) and treatment or other confounding parameters were tested using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Associations were expressed in terms of unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The first of VAP was considered in analysis for each patient. The scale parameters APACHE II and SOFA were also transformed to categorical ones, by splitting in the median value, and sepsis parameter was recorded in two groups: No septic shock/Yes septic shock. The probability of being alive in the two treatments was compared using survival curve (Kaplan&#x02013;Meier) analysis and the log-rank test.

Twenty-four patients were excluded from the study either because they were still requiring antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria for infections other than VAP or because they had received empirical antibiotic treatment for VAP more than 72 h when results from tracheal aspirates or BAL were available or, due to multimicrobial VAP (more than one Gram-negative pathogen was isolated), or due to favorable clinical response to the initial empirical treatment (that was not colistin) according to the attending physician. Eleven other patients that were initially included in the study were excluded in the course of the study because they died &#x0003c;48 h (2 patients) following recruitment, or due to the presence of other infections necessitating additional antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, or due to unclear clinical status, i.e., improvement or deterioration [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><p>Clinical data of participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Moreover, in meta-analysis of Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., combination antibiotic therapy improved survival and clinical response of high-risk, life-threatening infections (not only VAP), particularly those associated with septic shock (as in our study).

It is likely that the addition of ampicillin-sulbactam after the initial treatment failure for VAP in Group A obscured any significant difference.
