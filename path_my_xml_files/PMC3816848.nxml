It affects 30&#x02013;50% of patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and is associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms. It compromises the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs by altering rates of absorption and can also alter glycemia control. The withdrawal of the prokinetic cisapride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) has compromised therapeutic options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Interestingly, dietary modifications have been suggested to potentially represent an alternative to drugs for diabetic gastroparesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Our objective was to evaluate a novel soy germ pasta containing biologically active isoflavone aglycons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) for effects on gastric emptying in T2D patients with gastroparesis.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study enrolled 10 adults (5 male and 5 female; mean &#x000b1; SEM 62.7 &#x000b1; 2.3 years of age; BMI 28.8 &#x000b1; 1.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; HbA<sub>1c</sub> 64 mmol/mol) with T2D and delayed gastric emptying (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> range 134&#x02013;253 min; normal range &#x0003c;120 min). None had major complications of diabetes and all were maintained on a standard diabetes diet for &#x0003e;6 months and throughout the study. Prior use of medications that affect gastric emptying, soy-based products, or supplements and a history of gastrointestinal or liver disease were exclusion criteria. The study was conducted with informed consent and approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the University of Perugia School of Medicine.</p><p>Patients were randomized to two groups. One group (<italic>n</italic> = 5) consumed one serving per day of soy germ&#x02013;enriched pasta (80 g) followed by conventional pasta for 8 weeks, with a 4-week washout between. The other group (<italic>n</italic> = 5) consumed these pastas in reverse sequence. The two pastas were indistinguishable. The composition of the soy germ pasta (Aliveris S.r.l., Perugia, Italy), which contained 2% soy germ, delivering 31&#x02013;33 mg isoflavones per serving, is described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). At baseline, blood was collected after fasting and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after a standard meal for measurement of plasma glucose and serum insulin by standard methods. The next day, gastric emptying time was measured using the [<sup>13</sup>C]octanoic acid breath test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These tests were repeated after 8, 12, and 20 weeks, and the severity of symptoms of gastroparesis was also assessed using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Methods and data analysis are described in more detail in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1615/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Compliance to soy germ pasta was confirmed by an elevated mean plasma isoflavone concentration of 68 &#x000b1; 9 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and for conventional pasta from counting of returned packages.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows individual <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values for gastric emptying measured at baseline and after consuming both pastas. No period, sequence, or washout effects were observed. The inclusion of soy isoflavone&#x02013;enriched pasta to the standard American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet led to a significant acceleration in mean (&#x000b1;SEM) <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> in the 10 patients when compared with baseline values (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 161.2 &#x000b1; 17.5 vs. 112.6 &#x000b1; 11.2 min, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009; <italic>P</italic> = 0.109 for the analysis limited to pairwise comparison of data from the end of each period). The regression coefficient for individual <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values before and after soy germ pasta (0.478 [95% CI 0.134&#x02013;0.822]; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.562; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.013) lies well below unity, indicating a substantial reduction of the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). These findings are consistent with results from the crossover analysis, indicating that soy germ pasta improves gastric emptying time irrespective of the order in which it was given. By contrast, there was no significant difference in the group mean <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values when conventional pasta lacking isoflavones was consumed (153.6 &#x000b1; 24.2 vs. 156.2 &#x000b1; 27.4 min, <italic>P</italic> = 0.76).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Relationship between gastric emptying time (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) in 10 patients with documented diabetic gastroparesis measured at baseline and after consuming soy germ pasta containing isoflavone aglycons and conventional pasta lacking isoflavones.

The corresponding values for conventional pasta were 7 (0&#x02013;21) and 6 (0&#x02013;11) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.289), respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s3"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The major findings of this pilot study of T2D patients with gastroparesis were that the inclusion of an isoflavone-enriched soy germ pasta on the background of an ADA diet led to a significant acceleration in the rate of gastric emptying, whereas conventional pasta lacking isoflavones had no effect.</p><p>The gastric emptying time measured on baseline conditions (either before or after the washout period) was longer (<italic>P</italic> = 0.073) than the upper limit of normal (120 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and consistent with delayed gastric emptying, even though the patients reported only mild symptomatology.</p><p>Concerns that accelerating gastric emptying could potentially lead to increased glycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) were not supported from measurements of plasma glucose or insulin concentrations in response to a standard meal after normalization of the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> by soy germ pasta. This is presumably because these patients adhered to an ADA maintenance diet, were not taking drugs, and were all in good glycemic control.</p><p>Although not the primary objective of our study, and not surprising given the relatively low baseline GCSI scores and small sample size, we found only a minor improvement in the severity of upper gastrointestinal symptoms after an improvement in <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>. A larger study of patients with more severe symptoms would better address the effectiveness of soy germ pasta on symptomatology.</p><p>We speculate that isoflavones, when in contact with gastric mucosa, influence prostaglandin synthesis to modulate motility. Gene expression data from gastric mucosal biopsies of healthy adults has shown that soy germ pasta significantly alters the expression of many genes involved in gastric function. <italic>PTDGS</italic>, a gene encoding prostaglandin D2 synthase, the enzyme responsible for prostaglandin F2&#x003b1; synthesis, was upregulated fivefold by soy germ pasta (S.A., K.D.R.S., C.C., 2012, unpublished data).</p><p>In conclusion, pasta enriched with biologically active isoflavone aglycons improved gastric emptying time in T2D patients, warranting consideration of this dietary intervention in the management of diabetic gastroparesis, especially given that there is currently no effective pharmacologic therapy.</p></sec>
