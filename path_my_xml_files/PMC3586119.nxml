In analyses across both study parts, Epogen&#x000ae; was exploratorily compared with Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae;.</p><p>A dense-sampling 48-hour pharmacokinetic profile was recorded at steady state after 11 doses of 100 IU epoetin alfa per kg of bodyweight. The hemoglobin response over 4 weeks of study medication administration was analyzed as the primary efficacy surrogate parameter using an ANCOVA model with the baseline value as co-variate.</p><p>The per-protocol population comprised a total of 268 subjects, 76 in part A (equally randomized to HX575 or Epogen&#x000ae;) and 192 in part B (equally randomized to HX575, HX575-TT, or Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae;). Pairs of study arms were compared in terms of the ratio of the mean epoetin alfa area under the curve (AUC) and the ratio of the mean hemoglobin area under the effect curve (AUEC).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Bioequivalence was shown in all pair-wise comparisons with the 90% confidence intervals of the AUC ratios falling within the standard bioequivalence limits of 80&#x02013;125%. Moreover, an equivalent pharmacodynamic response was achieved with all compared epoetin alfa products, as confirmed by the hemoglobin AUEC ratio&#x02019;s 90% CI falling within the predefined acceptance margins of 96.8&#x02013;103.2%. Thus, bioequivalence and equivalent potency was demonstrated for HX575 and Epogen&#x000ae; in part A of the study, as well as for HX575, HX575-TT and Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae; in part B of the study. Pair-wise comparison across study parts indicated similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of Epogen&#x000ae; and Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae;.</p><p>All compared epoetin alfa products were well tolerated and had a similar safety profile. No subject developed anti-erythropoietin antibodies upon administration of study medication.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results show, for the first time in a prospective randomized clinical study, equivalent bioavailability at steady state and similar potency of the US-marketed Epogen&#x000ae; and the European-marketed Binocrit&#x000ae;. Differences in the formulation between the epoetin alfa products had no apparent clinical impact. The high degree of similarity between Epogen&#x000ae; and Erypo&#x000ae;/ Eprex&#x000ae; provides justification for linking and comparing results from clinical studies that were conducted using either US- or European-marketed epoetin alfa products.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Adis Data Information BV 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypoxia and anemia induce the production of endogenous erythropoietin in the kidneys of healthy individuals, which, in turn, stimulates erythropoiesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] The molecular biology of erythropoietin preventing the programmed cell death of erythrocytic progenitors was reviewed by Jelkmann.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Erythropoiesis stimulating agents, such as epoetin alfa, are indicated for the correction of anemia in patients with chronic renal failure who have an impaired production of endogenous erythropoietin, and in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia. In addition, epoetin alfa reduces the need for blood transfusions in patients scheduled to undergo surgery, and can also be used for patients at risk for perioperative transfusions with anticipated significant blood loss.</p><p>Epoetin alfa products have been used in clinical practice for more than two decades. Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae; (Janssen-Cilag, a subsidiary of Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA), was the first epoetin alfa that received regulatory approval in Europe in 1988.

The goals of this large, two-part, phase I study were to provide bridging data for an extension of the HX575 marketing authorization, and to establish the clinical equivalence of HX575 from two different sources, following the transfer of the production technology from the drug substance manufacturer Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH, Laupheim, Germany, to an additional, already-approved Sandoz-internal site at Lek, Ljubljana, Slovenia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This randomized, parallel-group study was conducted at Nuvisan GmbH (formerly AAIPharma Deutschland GmbH &#x00026; Co.

Healthy males were chosen for the study population for methodologic considerations, such as the absence of a risk of pregnancy and the lower metabolic variability due to the absence of a menstrual cycle. Regarding the Caucasian disposition, there is much evidence to suggest that two formulations that were bioequivalent in one study population will also be bioequivalent in other populations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Subjects had to be physically and mentally healthy as confirmed by an interview, medical history, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram.</p><p>Other inclusion criteria were hemoglobin concentrations between 13.0 and 15.5 g/dL, and percentage of reticulocytes &#x02264;3.0% at screening. Iron parameters had to be normal or with only minor deviations, with iron deficiency defined as ferritin concentrations below 10.0 ng/mL.</p><p>Subjects were not eligible for enrollment if their medical history or examination showed evidence of acute or chronic hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, or other abnormalities that might influence the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the active agent under investigation. Further exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to drugs, presence of atopic eczema, or allergic bronchial asthma; evidence of cardiovascular disorders, particularly hypertension (supine blood pressure &#x0003e;145/90 mmHg at baseline); or increased numbers of erythrocytes, or platelets, if judged by the investigator to be clinically relevant.</p><p>Abuse of alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco was an exclusion criterion, and smoking was limited to a maximum of ten cigarettes per day. Regular use of any medication within 4 weeks, as well as systemic androgen application within 2 months prior to the first dose of study drug, was prohibited. Moreover, the single use of any medication including over-the-counter medications was prohibited, unless expressively permitted, within 2 weeks prior to the first study drug administration.</p><p>All subjects had to sign an informed consent form before the first invasive screening examination was performed.

Dense sampling was performed on day 24 at &#x02212;30, &#x02212;20, &#x02212;10 minutes before dosing, just before dosing, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after dosing, and on days 25 (16 hours and 24 hours after dosing) and 26 (i.e. 48 hours after day 24 dosing but prior to day 26 dosing).</p><p>Blood sampling (2.7 mL) for the analysis of pharmacodynamic parameters was scheduled on day 1 (&#x02212;30,&#x02212;20, &#x02212;10 minutes, and just before first dose), and on days 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26 (i.e. 48 hours after day 24 dosing), and on day 29 (i.e. 120 hours after day 24 dosing). For determination of transferrin, transferrin receptor, ferritin, and serum iron concentrations, venous blood samples (4.9 mL) were collected at baseline and on days 12, 19, and 26; in addition, ferritin and transferrin concentrations were also assessed at screening and at the follow-up visit.</p><p>Blood serum samples of 4.9 mL were screened for anti-erythropoietin antibodies taken on day 1 (before first dose), day 15, day 29, and at follow-up.</p><p>Blood serum samples for the assessment of potential anti-erythropoietin antibodies where shipped to the sponsor&#x02019;s bioanalytical laboratory (Hexal AG, Oberhaching, Germany). All other laboratory assessments were performed by the clinical laboratory at the study site.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pharmacokinetic Analyses and Evaluations</title><p>Epoetin alfa serum concentrations were quantitatively determined by means of a sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique (Quantikine&#x000ae; IVD&#x000ae;, R &#x00026; D Systems GmbH, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany), which did not discriminate between endogenous erythropoietin and recombinant epoetin alfa. The procedure was validated according to current guidelines for method validation and the applied regulations. The calibration range was from 2.5 to 200.0 mIU/mL; the defined lower limit of quantification was 2.62 mIU/mL. Samples with expected high levels where diluted with a dilutant provided with the kit; no further sample work-up was necessary. The inter-day accuracy and precision data were calculated from 578 sets of quality control samples in 288 runs. The accuracy (expressed as bias) ranged between &#x02212;4.3% and 2.0%; the precision (expressed as coefficient of variation [CV]) ranged between 4.5% and 5.5%. During the validation process, it was also confirmed that the assay detected the different epoetin alfa products with similar accuracy.</p><p>Two samples each from ten subjects were analyzed as incurred samples to demonstrate the reproducibility of the used method. The evaluation of the data resulted in a mean ratio of 0.974 with ratio limits of 0.942 and 1.01. The lower limit of agreement was calculated with 0.903, the higher one with 1.05. All investigated samples lay within the acceptable limits of agreement. The acceptance ranges for both of the ratio limits, as well as the limits of agreement, were met.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic endpoints were calculated by non-compartmental analyses based on the determined epoetin concentrations and actual measured sampling times. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoint was the epoetin area under the 48-hour serum concentration-time curve on day 24 (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,D24</sub>) at steady state, which was a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic assessment starting on study day 24. Two epoetin alfa products were considered bioequivalent if the ratio&#x02019;s 90% CI fell within the standard acceptance limits of 80&#x02013;125%. Secondary exploratory endpoints were maximal concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and time to C<sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>). The mean of the four pre-dose pharmacokinetic samples at day 24 was the baseline value for the calculation of the AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,D24</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Pharmacodynamic Assays and Evaluations</title><p>The time course of hemoglobin concentration was evaluated as the primary surrogate marker for efficacy. The pharmacodynamic action was determined as the area under the total effect curve (AUEC) during 12 dosage intervals in 4 weeks, which were calculated by linear trapezoidal integration. Equivalence of two study medications was assumed if the hemoglobin AUEC ratio&#x02019;s 90% CI fell within predefined acceptance limits of 96.8&#x02013;103.2%.</p><p>The rationale for the hemoglobin AUEC acceptance limits was based on previous study results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] It was anticipated that the hemoglobin concentration would increase by approximately 3 g/dL within 4 weeks of treatment. A difference of &#x000b1;1 g/dL was considered acceptable because under clinical conditions of tightly monitored hemoglobin concentrations, no dose adjustment is required if the hemoglobin concentration is within 1 g/dL of the target. Also, in clinical studies a threshold of &#x000b1;1.0 g hemoglobin/dL has been used as the greatest clinically acceptable difference to demonstrate equivalence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</p><p>The secondary pharmacodynamic parameters of red blood cells, haematocrit, and absolute and relative reticulocytes concentrations were evaluated exploratorily without predefined equivalence ranges, using the standard acceptance limits of 80&#x02013;125% for the 90% CI of the AUEC ratios.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Screening for Anti-Erythropoietin Antibodies</title><p>Blood samples were screened for anti-erythropoietin antibodies using a validated radio-immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. In case of a positive RIP assay result, the sample was analyzed for neutralizing anti-erythropoietin antibodies (NAB) using a validated <italic>in vitro</italic> bioassay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Adverse events were spontaneously reported by the subjects or solicited by non-leading questions of the investigator. Vital signs were assessed at every study visit. Physical examinations and ECG evaluations were performed at screening and at the end-of-study visit. Standard laboratory evaluations were performed at the first and the last study visit. The investigator decided whether an abnormality represented an adverse event.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Both study parts were analyzed separately by using identical statistical methods. All evaluations were carried out as predefined in a statistical analysis plan. Statistical analysis of the clinical data was performed by Metronomia Clinical Research GmbH, Munich, Germany. All pharmacokinetic endpoints were derived using appropriate pharmacokinetic software (PCModfit, version 3.0). All statistical calculations were performed using SAS&#x000ae; software (version 9.1.3). Adverse events were coded using MedDRA (version 11.0). Previous and concomitant medications were coded according to the WHO Drug Dictionary (version 2008).</p><p>The two primary endpoints for confirmatory analyses were (i) the epoetin AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,D24</sub>, which was a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic assessment over 48 hours starting on day 24; and (ii) the absolute hemoglobin response assessed as AUEC over 4 weeks. Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints (C<sub>max</sub> and t<sub>max</sub> of epoetin), and secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints (hemoglobin, maximal effect [E<sub>max</sub>], and time to E<sub>max</sub> [t<sub>max,E</sub>]) and other hematological parameters, such as hematocrit, reticulocyte, and erythrocyte counts, were analyzed.</p><p>The sample size and power considerations were based on the expectation of an inter-individual CV of about 3.8% for the log-transformed AUEC of hemoglobin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] The 90% CI of the AUEC ratio was to be included by a range of 96.8&#x02013;103.2%, provided the true ratio was within 99% and 101%. Pair-wise comparisons were performed in a predefined hierarchical order. In part A, 37 subjects per treatment group had to complete the study according to protocol (i.e. to be included in the per-protocol set) in order to have a power of 80% and to determine the relative pharmacodynamic efficiency in terms of the AUEC ratio with an adequate precision (i.e. in an analogous way to a bioequivalence study). In part B, 63 evaluable subjects per treatment group was sufficient to have a power of 95% for the primary comparison between HX575-TT and HX575, and a power of approximately 90% to test HX575-TT versus Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae;. The comparison between both reference epoetin alfa products (Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae; and Epogen&#x000ae;) was performed exploratorily.</p><p>Based on results from a previous study with HX575,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] a CV of 20&#x02013;25% for the primary pharmacokinetic endpoint AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,D24</sub> was expected. The corresponding sample size necessary to confirm bioequivalence between any pair of study medication tested in this study within the standard acceptance limits of 80&#x02013;125% and with a power of at least 80%, amounted to at least 27 evaluable subjects. Therefore, the sample size determined for the comparison of the primary pharmacodynamic endpoint was also sufficient for a proper pharmacokinetic bioequivalence assessment.</p><p>The mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, range and median, were calculated for each parameter. The geometric mean and its coefficient of variation were also determined for concentration-related parameters. For AUEC, E<sub>max</sub>, AUC, and C<sub>max</sub>, the parametric point estimators for the ratio and the shortest 90% CI were calculated using the least square means and the root of residual mean squares from the ANOVA of log-transformed data with subsequent exponential transformation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]</p><p>The primary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses were based on the per-protocol set, which excluded major protocol violators. The decision on the exclusion of individual subjects from the per-protocol set was taken at the blind data review meeting. In order to investigate the robustness of the results with regard to the primary pharmacodynamic endpoint, the analyses were also performed on all study completers (data not shown).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</p><p>ANOVA were to be performed on all endpoints except t<sub>max</sub>. In case of substantial differences between treatment groups in a key baseline value, such as the hemoglobin level, an analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) was performed, including, besides the factor treatment, this baseline value as co-variate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study Population</title><p>A total of 307 healthy adult males were enrolled and randomized &#x02014; 87 in part A and 220 in part B.

For instance, subtle structural differences in protein conformations can be detected between Epogen&#x000ae; and Eprex&#x000ae; by means of biophysical analyses,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] but these do not translate into clinically relevant differences. The regulatory point of view towards biosimilar recognizes the fact that some differences between similar biologic medicinal products from different manufacturers can be expected, which is considered acceptable if comparable efficacy and safety profiles can be demonstrated.</p><p>HX575 was developed by Sandoz and first approved in Europe as a biosimilar product (using the innovator epoetin alfa product Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae; as reference product) following the demonstration of similar quality, safety, and efficacy profiles in 2007. Clinical studies compared the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of different strengths and administration routes of HX575 and Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae; in healthy volunteers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] The efficacy and safety of HX575 in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease was assessed in comparison with Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae;,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and further safety data were provided in a comparative study in patients experiencing chemotherapy-induced anemia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p><p>The present two-part study provides supportive bridging data for a further extension of the HX575 marketing authorization and compared HX575 from two different manufacturing sites. The second study part had a larger study population allowing for two confirmatory pair-wise comparisons with sufficient statistical power. Both study parts evaluated the following two primary endpoints as surrogates for efficacy of epoetin alfa in sequential pair-wise comparisons between study arms in a statistically confirmatory manner: (i) the bioavailability in terms of the epoetin alfa AUC; and (ii) potency in terms of the hemoglobin AUEC. An additional exploratory assessment compared the two reference epoetin alfa products Epogen&#x000ae; and Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae;.</p><p>The differences between the study arms in baseline concentrations of endogenous erythropoietin were negligible and had virtually no effect on the results in terms of AUC and C<sub>max</sub>. In contrast, the observed hemoglobin baseline differences between the study arms in study part A had a substantial effect on the AUECs and would have reduced the statistical power to demonstrate pharmacodynamic equivalence for HX575 and Epogen&#x000ae; based on the AUEC ratio. Therefore, the use of the ANCOVA with the baseline hemoglobin value as co-variate was considered as the only valid analysis of the pharmacodynamic endpoints.</p><p>Both study parts were well powered to provide results with sufficient overall statistical significance and, in conclusion, all study objectives were met. For all comparisons in both study parts and also across both study parts, bioequivalence at steady state was established using standard acceptance limits for the epoetin AUC ratios, and equivalent pharmacodynamic responses were demonstrated based on very narrow predefined acceptance limits for the hemoglobin AUEC ratios. The results of the secondary hematologic parameters were in line with the confirmatory results, showing similarity for all pair-wise comparisons, although no formal acceptance criteria were predefined.</p><p>Immunogenicity of biologics is routinely monitored in developmental clinical studies, but it was not expected to see any signs of immunogenicity of the tested epoetin alfa products in this 4-week study comprising 12 intravenous injections. Reports of anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure red-cell aplasia (PRCA) have generally been associated with extended periods of subcutaneous administration of ESAs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] The mean time to onset of epoetin-associated PRCA from initiation of epoetin treatment has been reported to be 9.3 months (range 0.3&#x02013;84.3 months). To date, no cases of PRCA have been reported in patients who received only intravenous treatment with ESAs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]</p><p>It can be assumed that the positive RIP results in two subjects were probably due to unspecific binding in this sensitive screening assay. Neither of them had neutralizing antibodies that would have affected the biologic response to study medication; both subjects completed the study and were included in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses. There were no records of any prior administration of ESAs for therapeutic reasons or during a previous clinical study in these two subjects. The frequency of detectable anti-erythropoietin antibodies in the general population has been suggested to be &#x0003c;0.2%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and there are only a few reports in the literature of neutralizing anti-erythropoietin antibodies in patients who have never been treated with recombinant ESAs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</p><p>In summary, study part A confirmatorily showed bioequivalence and pharmacodynamic equivalence of HX575 and the US-marketed Epogen&#x000ae;, study part B sequentially demonstrated equivalence of HX575-TT and HX575, of HX575-TT and Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae;, and the comparison across study parts demonstrated equivalence of HX575-TT and Epogen&#x000ae;.</p><p>Thus, the biosimilar epoetin alfa product Binocrit&#x000ae;, both from the original and from the additional production site (i.e. HX575 and HX575-TT), are bioequivalent with both epoetin alfa products Epogen&#x000ae; and Erypo&#x000ae;/Eprex&#x000ae;.

The use of different stabilizers in US-marketed versus European-marketed epoetin alfa products does not affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, which are in line with previous findings.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] The observed high similarity of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of all compared products shows that therapeutic proteins do not necessarily have to be identical to have comparable clinical safety and efficacy profiles. These findings can also be seen in line with the regulatory agency&#x02019;s position in Europe that minor structural differences in the active substance between a biosimilar and the reference product may be acceptable when satisfactorily justified.</p><p>The observed high degree of bioequivalence and pharmacodynamic equivalence allows linking and comparing data from clinical studies that were conducted using either US- or European-marketed epoetin alfa products. Since the clinical bioavailability and pharmacodynamic potency of all three compared epoetin alfa products are similar, despite different formulations used in Europe and the US, clinical study data produced with a product sourced in Europe could be used to support a marketing authorization in another geographical/regulatory area.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was sponsored by Hexal AG (Industriestr. 25, 83607 Holzkirchen, Germany).
