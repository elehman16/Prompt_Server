We performed a double-blind, two-part, dose-escalation study, in subjects with ALS, assessing safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and functional effects of ozanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A. In Part 1, 40 subjects were randomized (3&#x02236;1) to receive single dose intravenous ozanezumab (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo. In Part 2, 36 subjects were randomized (3&#x02236;1) to receive two repeat doses of intravenous ozanezumab (0.5, 2.5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo, approximately 4 weeks apart. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (adverse events [AEs], vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests). Secondary endpoints included PK, immunogenicity, functional endpoints (clinical and electrophysiological), and biomarker parameters. Overall, ozanezumab treatment (0.01&#x02013;15 mg/kg) was well tolerated. The overall incidence of AEs in the repeat dose 2.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg ozanezumab groups was higher than in the repeat dose placebo group and repeat dose 0.5 mg/kg ozanezumab group. The majority were considered not related to study drug by the investigators. Six serious AEs were reported in three subjects receiving ozanezumab; none were considered related to study drug. No study drug-related patterns were identified for ECG, laboratory, or vital signs parameters. One subject (repeat dose 15 mg/kg ozanezumab) showed a weak, positive anti-ozanezumab-antibody result. PK results were generally consistent with monoclonal antibody treatments. No apparent treatment effects were observed for functional endpoints or muscle biomarkers. Immunohistochemical staining showed dose-dependent co-localization of ozanezumab with Nogo-A in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, single and repeat dose ozanezumab treatment was well tolerated and demonstrated co-localization at the site of action. These findings support future studies with ozanezumab in ALS.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">NCT00875446</ext-link> GSK-ClinicalStudyRegister.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gsk--clinicalstudyregister.com/study/111330#ps">GSK ID 111330</ext-link>

It is anticipated that blockade of Nogo-A may inhibit neurite retraction and potentially slow the axonal degeneration pattern in lower motor neurons that begins at the neuromuscular junction.<xref rid="pone.0097803-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> This may enhance motor neurone-muscle coupling, leading to functional improvement and survival benefits in patients with ALS.</p><p>Ozanezumab (GSK1223249: GlaxoSmithKline) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A, which is currently being investigated for the treatment of ALS. Ozanezumab has two possible modes of action: preventing binding of Nogo-A to the Nogo-A receptor and/or Nogo-A down-regulation by antibody-induced internalization of cell surface Nogo-A.<xref rid="pone.0097803-Weinmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>
</p><p>Given that the anticipated mechanism of action of ozanezumab is via Nogo-A, which is not appreciably expressed in skeletal muscle under physiological conditions but is overexpressed in ALS, it was felt that conduct of a study in healthy subjects would not adequately reveal the potential risks or effects of treatment. Therefore, the first-in-human, Phase I/IIa study presented here was performed in subjects with ALS to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and functional and biomarker effects of ozanezumab.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and repeat dose-escalation, two-part study in subjects with ALS, conducted at 11 sites in France, Italy, the UK, and the USA, between May 2009 and September 2011. Screening took place within 28 days of the first dose of investigational product. In Part 1, escalating single doses (SD) of ozanezumab (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, or 15 mg/kg administered intravenously [IV]), were evaluated in five sequential subject cohorts (8 subjects per cohort, randomized 3&#x02236;1 to receive ozanezumab or placebo). Part 2 was also of a sequential dose-escalating design: 36 subjects across three cohorts (12 subjects per cohort) were randomized (3&#x02236;1) to receive two repeat doses (RD) of ozanezumab (0.5, 2.5, or 15 mg/kg administered IV) or placebo, approximately 4 weeks apart. IV infusions were given over 60 minutes except for the 0.01 mg/kg dose, which was given over 11.2 minutes. Key safety data were reviewed by a blinded Dose Escalation Committee (comprising GlaxoSmithKline staff and an external expert neurologist who was experienced in ALS) before proceeding to the next dosing cohort. To ensure tolerability before proceeding, the first four subjects in all cohorts of Part 1 and the first cohort of Part 2 received treatment on consecutive days, so that only one subject was randomized and dosed within any 24-hour period. Dosing of all other subjects was not staggered. The follow-up period was at least 12 weeks for all subjects. Subjects in Part 2 were followed-up for 16 weeks and subjects receiving 15 mg/kg ozanezumab were followed-up for immunogenicity for 16&#x02013;20 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study protocol, protocol amendments, and informed consent were approved by a national, regional or investigational center ethics committee or an institutional review board (IRB), at each of the participating sites: Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Ile-de-France VI, H&#x000f4;pital La Piti&#x000e9;-Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re, Paris, France; Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione, Azienda Ospedaliera, Universitaria Integrata di Verona, Italy; Guy's Research Ethics Committee, St. Thomas Hospital, London, UK; Carolinas Healthcare System IRB, North Carolina; Wake Forest University Health Sciences, IRB, North Carolina; Johns Hopkins Medicine IRBs, Maryland; Western IRB, Washington; IRB, Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York; and IRB for the Protection of Human Subjects, SUNY Upstate Medical University, New York, USA.

None resulted in withdrawal from the study. Most common AEs (reported in &#x02265;4 subjects across all cohorts) were back pain, bronchitis, fall, headache and procedural pain at biopsy site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097803-t002">Table 2</xref>). AEs in the cardiac disorders category were reported in four subjects. One of these, sinus tachycardia of mild intensity, was considered possibly related to investigational product (RD 2.5 mg/kg ozanezumab). Other events, not considered related to study drug, included ventricular extrasystoles (SD 5 mg/kg ozanezumab), which resolved after 2 hours, with the subject remaining asymptomatic with no findings of clinical concern on Holter monitoring; second degree atrioventricular block (RD 2.5 mg/kg ozanezumab); and cardiac arrest and cardio-respiratory arrest, as described under SAEs below.</p><p>Six SAEs were reported in three subjects receiving ozanezumab, all considered by the investigators as unrelated to study medication. One subject (SD 15 mg/kg ozanezumab) suffered a head injury after an accidental fall, which led to hospitalization and ultimately resolved. The second subject (SD 5 mg/kg ozanezumab) experienced excess bronchial secretions resulting in hospitalization, and later died from respiratory failure, 17 weeks after the dosing. The third subject (RD 2.5 mg/kg ozanezumab) was hospitalized for abdominal pain, for which the etiology remained elusive; this subject later died from cardiac arrest and cardio-respiratory arrest 10.5 weeks after the second dose.</p><p>The events common to ALS showed no patterns of reporting to suggest an adverse drug effect on the underlying condition. The most frequently reported event common to ALS was weakness, occurring in 8/19 (42%) and 19/57 (33%) subjects in the placebo and ozanezumab groups, respectively.</p><p>Analysis of ECG data showed that the proportion of subjects with QTcB or QTcF values in the lowest category of potential clinical importance (absolute QTc &#x0003e;450 msec and up to 480 msec or QTc change from baseline &#x0003e;30 msec and up to 60 msec) was slightly greater in the ozanezumab RD 15 mg/kg dose group compared with the other RD groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097803.s004">Table S4</xref>). An absolute QTc value &#x0003e;500 msec (or &#x0003e;480 msec) or a QTc change from baseline &#x0003e;60 msec was not observed in any subject at any point. Evaluation of these data demonstrated no clear patterns indicative of a treatment effect on ECG parameters.</p><p>Vital signs showed no notable differences between ozanezumab groups and placebo. No clinically significant safety laboratory findings were reported by the investigator. However, there were findings of potential clinical importance (PCI). Three subjects experienced elevations in liver function tests; one subject (SD placebo) had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value approximately 2&#x000d7; the upper limit of normal (ULN), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]; &#x0003c;2&#x000d7; ULN) and elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT; approximately 3&#x000d7; ULN), on Day 22. A second subject (SD 5 mg/kg ozanezumab) had elevated total bilirubin (approximately 2&#x000d7; ULN) on Day 50, and a third subject (RD 2.5 mg/kg ozanezumab) had an elevated ALT value (approximately 3&#x000d7; ULN), accompanied by elevations of AST (&#x0003c;2&#x000d7; ULN) and GGT (approximately 3&#x000d7; ULN). Seven subjects had elevated glucose levels of PCI, all of whom received ozanezumab; these elevations occurred at least 1 week after dosing in five of these subjects. Isolated cases of hyperglycemia were seen in patients who received ozanezumab. The findings were based on random blood glucose samples. None of the elevated glucose values were considered clinically significant by the investigator and were not reported as AEs. There was no apparent dose-response. Mild hematological abnormalities occurred in four subjects receiving ozanezumab. However, these were not considered clinically significant. Elevated creatine kinase levels were observed in a number of subjects across all treatment groups but this is a common finding in patients with ALS and was not considered clinically relevant. Urinalysis findings raised no safety concerns. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097803.s008">Results S1</xref> for additional details of laboratory findings.</p><p>Changes in heart rate were reported for a small number of subjects but none were considered clinically significant.

A number of compounds targeting different aspects of ALS pathogenesis are currently being investigated. This was the first study in humans of ozanezumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting Nogo-A.</p><p>Generally the baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups, however, as the inclusion criteria permitted a history of muscle weakness of up to 60 months; 8/76 (11%) patients reported having muscle weakness for 36 months or longer. This could have caused a bias towards long-term survivors and since the patient cohorts were small, the mean disease duration varied considerably between these cohorts.</p><p>Ozanezumab was generally well tolerated at single doses of 0.01&#x02013;15 mg/kg and two repeat doses of 0.5&#x02013;15 mg/kg, with no adverse drug effects on the underlying condition.</p><p>Although there was no clear relationship between reported AEs and increasing doses of ozanezumab, the overall incidence of AEs was numerically higher in the two higher dose RD cohorts compared with placebo and the lowest dose RD cohort. Despite the higher incidence of AEs in the RD cohorts, proportions of mild, moderate and severe AEs were comparable. SAEs and deaths were not attributed to the study drug, though one cardiac non-serious AE (mild sinus tachycardia) was considered possibly related. There were no clinically significant safety laboratory findings and no clear patterns indicative of a treatment effect on ECG parameters or vital signs.</p><p>Following IV infusion, the plasma PK characteristics of ozanezumab were generally consistent with those of a humanized immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody. One observation of note was the approximate 2-fold difference between SD and RD (first dose) ozanezumab 15 mg/kg in average C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values. Examination of the individual data suggested no overlap in values between the two cohorts. However, detailed investigations of drug substance, subject demographics, individual dosing records, and the PK plasma sample assay methodology revealed no explanation for this difference. Consequently, the difference appeared to be genuine, and possibly attributed to between-cohort variability.</p><p>This study was not statistically powered to detect changes in functional (clinical and electrophysiological) endpoints. Despite this, and despite subjects receiving only one or two doses each, a trend was observed for clinical endpoints such as ALSFRS-R, SVC, and MMT, which possibly suggested a response in the highest dose cohorts. Trends observed should be interpreted with great caution given the small sample size, and other studies will be required to confirm and further investigate these trends. The relationship between ozanezumab administration and pharmacological signal on protein or RNA requires further investigation; the current study may have been too short to detect such responses. In future studies, optimum time points, treatment times, and analysis methods will need to be established.</p><p>IHC staining of muscle biopsies suggested that there were dose-dependent changes in ozanezumab quantification and detection and that ozanezumab distributed and co-localized with Nogo-A at the site of action in skeletal muscle. Following the full distribution of ozanezumab to muscle tissue and peak co-localization approximately 1 week after dosing, the percentage of co-localisation appeared to be related to levels of ozanezumab, suggesting a possible relationship with exposure.</p><p>Overall, ozanezumab was well tolerated and PK parameters were generally consistent with those of humanized monoclonal antibodies. The trends observed on functional endpoints in the present study, along with the co-localization of ozanezumab in skeletal muscle, are encouraging; these observations, along with the lack of emerging safety signals, support future studies of ozanezumab in this devastating disease, and a Phase II study of efficacy and safety of ozanezumab (NCT01753076) is currently underway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097803.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
