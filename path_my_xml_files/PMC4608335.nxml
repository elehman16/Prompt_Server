Combination therapy as an alternative method, may decreases these limitations. Therefore, this study aimed to compare midazolam with midazolam-promethazine regarding induction, maintenance, and recovery characteristics following pediatric procedural sedation and analgesia. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Children under 7 years old who needed sedation for being CT scanned were included in this double-blind randomized clinical trial. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: one only received midazolam (0.5 mg/kg), while the other group received a combination of midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and promethazine (1.25 mg/kg). University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) was used to assess sedation induction. In addition to demographic data, the child&#x02019;s vital signs were evaluated before prescribing the drugs and after inducing sedation (reaching UMSS level 2). The primary outcomes in the present study were onset of action after administration and duration of the drugs&#x02019; effect. </p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>107 patients were included in the study. Mean onset of action was 55.4&#x000b1;20.3 minutes for midazolam and 32.5&#x000b1;11.1 minutes for midazolam-promethazine combination (p&#x0003c;0.001). But duration of effect was not different between the 2 groups (p=0.36). 8 (7.5%) patients were unresponsive to the medication, all 8 of which were in the midazolam treated group (p=0.006). Also in 18 (16.8%) cases a rescue dose was prescribed, 14 (25.9%) were in the midazolam group and 4 (7.5%) were in the midazolam-promethazine group (p=0.02). Comparing systolic (p=0.20) and diastolic (p=0.34) blood pressure, heart rate (p=0.16), respiratory rate (p=0.17) and arterial oxygen saturation level (p=0.91) showed no significant difference between the 2 groups after intervention. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Based on the findings of this study, it seems that using a combination of midazolam and promethazine not only speeds up the sedation induction, but also decreases unresponsiveness to the treatment and the need for a rescue dose.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Promethazine</kwd><kwd>midazolam</kwd><kwd>anti-anxiety agents</kwd><kwd>conscious sedation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction:</title><p>Procedural sedation and analgesia are constantly used procedures range from pain-free interventions such as imaging, to painful intervention like fracture reduction, wounds care, bone marrow aspiration, and placing a central venous catheter (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Sedating the patients, allows them to bear these unpleasant procedures while their cardiorespiratory function remains constant. These measures lead to increased quality of care, patients&#x02019; satisfaction, reduced pain and anxiety, and earlier diagnosis and treatment (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Pediatric imaging is one of the most indication of procedural sedation and analgesia. In the pediatric patient, performing CT scan is stressful and leads to increased mental stress, absence of cooperation with the staff, restlessness, and anxiety in the patient. These reactions not only interfere with the treatments but also lead to changes in physiologic parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and etc. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Selecting the precise medication is very important in these situations. Using a suitable sedative, results in a decrease in the rescue dose and increases the safety of the procedure (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Most of these medications can be prescribed through various routes and selecting the best drug varies based on the procedure, level of pain, optimum depth of sedation, and the patient&#x02019;s condition (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although there are lots of drugs that induce conscious sedation, but their side effects have limited their clinical use (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Some studies have suggested using combination therapy as they show increased effectiveness, decreased loading dose, and therefore decreased side effects (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Midazolam has been used as a sedative in children for a long time. This short-acting benzodiazepine acts as a sedative, amnesic and stress reliever. It is preferred to long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). But using oral midazolam alone, shows a high rate of failure in sedation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Promethazine is another agent that is used for sedating children (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It is a common antiemetic that has been used as a safe and effective drug with a low rate of side effects and failure. Therefore using it combined with midazolam, may decreases midazolam&#x02019;s limitations, but to date no study has been done to compare the sedative effect of midazolam alone with midazolam-promethazine, in children undergoing CT scan. For these reasons, this study aimed to compare midazolam with midazolam-promethazine regarding induction, maintenance, and recovery characteristics following pediatric procedural sedation and analgesia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>

</p><p>Healthy children under 7 years old who needed sedation for undergoing CT scan were included based on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA I and II) scale. Exclusion criteria included allergy to midazolam or promethazine, gastritis, any serious systemic disease, severe systemic reaction, severe cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, head trauma, eye trauma, central nervous system disease, contraindications to sedation, receiving sedative-hypnotic drugs in the last 48 hours. Sampling was consecutive.

</p><p>Patients were enrolled consecutively and randomly divided into 2 groups: one only received midazolam (a dose of 0.5 mg/kg weight), while the other group received midazolam (a dose of 0.5 mg/kg weight) plus promethazine (a dose of 1.25 mg/kg weight). Block randomization was executed using a computer software. The drugs were obtained from Rotexmedica Company (Germany). To ensure that the patients remained unaware of the treatment assignment, an hour before CT scan, oral promethazine was prescribed for the combination group while the other group drank a sugar syrup. 20 minutes before the CT scan, both groups received midazolam. All the drugs were mixed with fruit juice. In case of vomiting in the initial 15 minutes after receiving midazolam, this drug would be prescribed again with the same dose. The data were gathered by another researcher for ensuring blindness to therapy. The drugs were administrated when the level of arterial saturated oxygen was above 95% and in case of any drop in the oxygen saturation, oxygen therapy would be started. If the patient didn&#x02019;t respond to treatment, a rescue dose (50% of the initial midazolam dose) would be used.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparing demographic and clinical factors of the patients before intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

<bold><italic>Variables:</italic></bold>
</p><p>Level of sedation was assessed every 10 minutes since receiving midazolam based on University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS). This scale has 5 levels which is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">panel 1</xref>. In addition to demographic data (age, sex, weight), the child&#x02019;s vital signs (respiratory rate, heart rate and level of arterial saturated oxygen) were evaluated before prescribing the drugs and after inducing sedation (reaching UMSS level 2). Finally, any side effect related to the prescribed drugs would be recorded.</p><p>
<bold>Outcomes:</bold>
</p><p>The primary outcomes in the present study were onset of action after administration and duration of the drugs&#x02019; effect. To evaluate the onset of action, the time interval between midazolam prescription and sedation induction (reaching UMSS level 2) was calculated. For evaluating the duration of effect, the time interval between sedation induction and complete awareness (reaching UMSS level 0) was recorded. Secondary outcomes included incidence of the drugs&#x02019; side effects, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation level, needing a rescue dose and no response to the treatment (not reaching UMSS level 2).</p><p>
<bold>Statistical analysis:</bold>
</p><p>The data were entered in SPSS 21.0. Quantitative data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and qualitative data were shown as frequency and percentage. To compare the 2 groups regarding demographic and clinical factors before intervention chi square test (for nominal qualitative variables) and Mann-Whitney U test (for quantitative and ordinal variables) were used. Also, the 2 groups were compared regarding onset and duration of effect, using Mann-Whitney U test. Since the children&#x02019;s vital signs before intervention was significantly different in the 2 groups, non-parametric analysis of covariance was used to compare these factors in the groups. In all the analyses p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered the significance level.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparing clinical factors of the patients after intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Midazolam</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Midazolam+ Promethazine</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TFN1">*</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SBP (mm Hg)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">93.2 (7.5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">94.8 (4.7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.20</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DBP (mm Hg)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.4 (6.7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.0 (5.4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.34<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TFN2">#</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Heart rate (per min)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">111.5 (10.5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">108.6 (10.8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Respiratory rate (per min)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.9 (2.4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.6 (1.7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.17<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TFN2">#</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Oxygen saturation (%) </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.9 (0.8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.9 (0.7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.91</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TFN1"><label>*,</label><p> based on Mann-Whitney U test; </p></fn><fn id="TFN2"><label>#,</label><p> based on non-parametric analysis of covariance adjusted for pretreatment values.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p> 107 children were included in the study (54 patients in the midazolam group and 53 in the midazolam-promethazine group).

In addition, the frequency of not responding to treatment and needing a rescue dose is higher in the midazolam treated group. Yet, both treatments have similar effects on nausea and vomiting, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation level. Therefore, it seems that using a combination of midazolam and promethazine not only speeds up the sedation induction, but also decreases unresponsiveness to the treatment and the need for a rescue dose.</p><p>In line with this study, Cengiz et al. showed that the onset of action in a combination of midazolam and diphenhydramine is shorter than midazolam alone, while their duration of effect in no different (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Also, Jain et al. expressed the same results regarding onset of action comparing midazolam-ketamine combination with midazolam (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In addition, Parkinson et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and Crean (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) demonstrated in their respective studies that promethazine combined with chloral hydrate has a better sedative effect on children compared to midazolam alone. Houpt et al. showed that using chloral hydrate (dose: 25 mg/kg) combined with promethazine, is no different to using a 50 mg/kg chloral hydrate regarding sedation level and hemodynamic factors (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, 2 cases of nausea were seen in the midazolam group despite this drug having an antiemetic properties, which might be due to its bitter taste. In the combination group no nausea and vomiting was seen. Since promethazine had been received earlier in this group, the anti-histaminic and anti-cholinergic effects of promethazine might have controlled the nausea (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>The combination treatment using midazolam plus promethazine in children under 7 years old lead to a significant decrease in midazolam&#x02019;s failure and improved its effectiveness as expected. Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that exerts its effect by affecting GABA receptors and resulting in chloride ion influx to the neuron (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), while promethazine acts on histamine and cholinergic receptors of medullary&#x000a0;reticular formation to show its sedative effects (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Based on the findings of this study we can conclude that promethazine amplifies the effects of midazolam by affecting medulla and pons and leads to a decrease in its failure rate.</p><p>Little sample size and short follow-up time are of the limitations of this study. Therefore it is recommended to increase sample size and follow-up time in future studies.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Onset of action (A) and duration of effect (B) of midazolam and midazolam-Promethazine in sedation of the children. *, shows significant difference at p&#x0003c;0.001</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="emerg-3-109-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The findings of this study showed that mean onset of action for midazolam is significantly longer compared to midazolam-promethazine combination, while their duration of effect is no different.
