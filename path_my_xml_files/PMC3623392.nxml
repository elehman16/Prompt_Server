Primary endpoints were PAT modifications induced by vardenafil 10&#x02009;mg on demand. Secondary endpoints were the improvement in intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) as measured by the stopwatch technique and variations in anxiety scores at Stai-X1 for state-anxiety and Stai-X2 for trait-anxiety. At baseline, men with LL-PE showed higher RHI variation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), Stai-X1 and Stai X2 scores (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, resp.), and prolactin levels (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared with controls.

Vardenafil was an effective treatment in men with LL-PE; improvements of IELT may be due to increased NO production which is able to reduce adrenergic overactivity and anxiety levels.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Lifelong premature ejaculation (LL-PE) is defined as a &#x0201c;male sexual dysfunction&#x0201d; characterized by ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs before or within about one minute of vaginal penetration and the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations and negative personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration, and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The organs involved in the emission phase comprise the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck. The organs participating in the expulsion phase include the bladder neck and urethra, as well as the pelvic striated muscles. The central ejaculatory neural circuit comprises spinal and cerebral areas that form a highly interconnected network. The sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic spinal centers, under the influence of sensory genital and cerebral stimuli integrated and processed at the spinal cord level, act in synergy to command physiologic events occurring during ejaculation. A wide number of neurotransmitters, including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine, oxytocin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adrenaline, acetylcholine, and nitric oxide (NO), have been shown to be involved in the regulation of ejaculation. Since 1984, the nonselective alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine was demonstrated to be able to improve premature ejaculation in humans [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Subsequent animal studies demonstrated that the effect of selective alpha blockade is obtained by inhibiting the contractile response of the rat seminal vesicle to electrical nerve stimulation [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Further evidence indicates that the contractility of the human seminal vesicle is under the control of the NO-cGMP pathway, thus giving a rationale for the use of NO donors in the pharmacotherapy of PE [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. </p><p>The baseline pulse amplitude at fingertip level is highly dependent on digital blood flow and sympathetic tone, as is evidenced by a marked reduction in digital pulse amplitude after the administration of phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor agent [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Measurement of peripheral vasodilator response with a fingertip pulse amplitude tonometry (PAT) device is emerging as a useful method for assessing vascular function [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In response to hyperemic flow, digital pulse amplitude increases, a response that has been shown to depend in part on NO synthesis [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Augmentation of pulse amplitude in the finger with hyperemia is a complex response to ischemia and reflects both changes in digital flow and digital microvessels dilation and is blunted by the presence of increased sympathetic tone. </p><p>In this study, we investigated the pulse amplitude hyperemic response within the first 60 seconds in men with lifelong PE without vascular risk factors as a possible marker of sympathetic overtone and compared it with age-matched normal subjects. Then, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, we investigated the effects of vardenafil fixed dose on reactive hyperemia index (RHI) variations and on intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). </p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Inclusion Criteria</title><p>Vardenafil na&#x000ef;ve men aged 18&#x02013;40 years were included if they met the ESSM definition of LL-PE, as a &#x0201c;persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, upon, or shortly after penetration and before the subject wishes it.&#x0201d; Patients were included if they had a score of &#x02265;11 of the premature ejaculation diagnostic tool, a 5-item questionnaire (scored from 0 to 4 according to progressive severity of ejaculatory dysfunction) to identify men who may have a problem with ejaculating too soon during sexual activity [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They were entered into a 4-week run-in period, during which a diary of all sexual activity was filled. Subjects who reported at least one intercourse episode per week and IELT &#x02264;1 minute at stopwatch in 90% of intercourse attempts during the run-in period were enrolled and randomized to receive vardenafil or placebo for 8 weeks in the double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). IELT was defined as the time elapsed between penetration and ejaculation, and an ejaculation occurred before penetration was assigned an IELT of 0&#x02009;min. Patients had to remain in a stable, single-partner relationship and have at least one sexual intercourse episode per week throughout the treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Patients were excluded if they always experienced ejaculation prior to penetration or had IELT &#x02265;1 minute in 90% of intercourse attempts. Patients were further excluded if they had a history of ED (score of &#x0003c;22 on erectile function domain of the IIEF) or other ejaculatory dysfunctions to limit the possibility of a response to vardenafil as a result of treating comorbid moderate-to-severe ED. The erectile function domain of IIEF is a 5-item questionnaire (IIEF5) that investigates the presence of erectile disturbances (scored from 1 to 5 for each item) according to the capacity to obtain and maintain an erection successful for sexual intercourse along with the evaluation of confidence and satisfaction with sexual life [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Patients were also excluded if they used condoms or masturbated before sexual intercourse for purposes of decreasing penile sensitivity or used any other treatment for PE. Patients were excluded if they had a history of vascular disease including stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or life-threatening arrhythmias within the past 6 months or were using organic nitrates or cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Moreover, screening for hyperthyroidism (TSH, FT3, and FT4), hypogonadism (total testosterone), prolactin disorders (PRL), and prostate smears for detecting acute or subacute prostatitis were carried out before the study entry. PRL and T were measured with chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA, Architect System) (Abbott Laboratories, IL, USA), with detection limits of 0.05&#x02009;U/L 0.07&#x02009;U/L and 0.6&#x02009;ng/mL and 0.28&#x02009;nmol/L, respectively; intra- and interassay coefficients of variation for our laboratory were 3.5 and 4.2% at 5.8&#x02009;ng/mL (PRL) and 2.3 and 3.8% at 13.7&#x02009;nmol/L (T). Serum concentrations of TSH, FT3, and FT4 were determined by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA, Architect System) (Abbott Laboratories, IL, USA), with limits of detection of 0.0025&#x02009;mIU/L, 1.536&#x02009;pmol/L, and 5.148&#x02009;pmol/L, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Procedures</title><p>Couples were instructed to attempt sexual intercourse four or more times during the 4-week baseline period and six or more times per month during the 8-week treatment period (minimum of 24&#x02009;h between doses of medication) and to record IELT for the first event after each dose in the event log by the stopwatch technique. Patients were randomly assigned within each stratum 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to receive placebo or fixed-dose phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE5-i) vardenafil (10&#x02009;mg) and were given 15 doses of study medication (one dose was one tablet; tablets in all groups were identical in appearance since the active principle was encapsulated) each four weeks; one dose was to be taken 30&#x02009;min before anticipated sexual intercourse, and no more than one dose was allowed to be taken in a single day. Ejaculation-delaying techniques and behavioral therapy were to be avoided. Also, couples were instructed not to use condoms or topical anesthetic cream, not to pause during intercourse, or to have interrupted intromission. Furthermore, they were requested not to increase their intercourse frequency, and if intercourse took place more than once in a single session, only the first intercourse IELT was measured. Patients agreed not to change the type of treatment during the study period. Treatment efficacy was assessed at 8 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Psychological Evaluation</title><p>In order to identify anxiety in the psychological context of the examined subjects, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test, a self-administered questionnaire, was used [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It consists of two different scales (STAI-X1 and STAI-X2) of 20 items each, with multiple choice answers (never, sometimes, often, and always). Stai-X1 is directed at investigating the state anxiety and gives a transitory estimation of the emotional state, which varies in intensity and fluctuates in time as a function of the stressors impinging on the individual at the moment of starting the procedure. Stai-X2 is directed at relatively stable individual differences in subjects who become anxious in different circumstances [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Psychometric tests were performed to identify the presence of state anxiety (Stai-Xl) and trait anxiety (Stai-X2) before and after each treatment. The threshold scores for STAI questionnaires were chosen according to previously published methods [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (normal range = 28&#x02013;44 and 28&#x02013;48 for the X1 and X2 form, resp.). </p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Main Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate differences in RHI responses between men with LL-PE and controls and to evaluate differences in RHI responses after vardenafil or placebo in men with LL-PE. In addition, differences between anxiety scores at baseline and after different treatments were evaluated. Secondary endpoint was IELT at week 8. IELT was defined as the mean duration of intercourse attempts since the last clinic visit (past 4 weeks) for which intravaginal ejaculation was reported; ejaculation occurring before penetration was assigned an IELT of 0 minutes. During the screening visit, participants and partners received instructions on the IELT measurement technique, in which partners were to activate the supplied stopwatch on vaginal penetration during sexual intercourse and to stop the stopwatch on either intravaginal ejaculation or withdrawal without ejaculation. The time noted on the stopwatch at this point was recorded as the duration of sexual intercourse until ejaculation or withdrawal. This technique has been validated elsewhere [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Determination of Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (PAT)</title><p>Each patient underwent peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), a newly developed proprietary technology for noninvasively measuring the magnitude and dynamics of arterial tone changes in peripheral arterial beds. Digital pulse amplitude was measured, with a PAT device (Endo-PAT2000, Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel), in the fasting state in the supine position and both hands on the same level in a comfortable, thermoneutral environment, comprising a pneumatic plethysmograph that applies uniform pressure to the surface of the distal finger (fingers II, III, or IV) of each hand (same finger on both hands), allowing measurement of pulse volume changes in the finger. Baseline pulse amplitude was measured from each fingertip for 5&#x02009;min. Arterial flow was interrupted for 5&#x02009;min by a cuff placed on a proximal forearm at whichever occlusion pressure would be higher: 200&#x02009;mmHg or 60&#x02009;mmHg plus systolic blood pressure. Pulse amplitude was recorded electronically in both fingers and analyzed by a computerized, automated algorithm (owned by Itamar Medical) that provided the average pulse amplitude for each 30-second interval after forearm cuff deflation up to 4&#x02009;min. The hyperemic response (called the PAT ratio) was expressed as the natural logarithm of the ratio of after deflation to baseline pulse amplitude in the hyperemic finger divided by the same ratio in the contralateral finger that served as control and expressed in percentage [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>2.7. Statistics</title><p>We tested for differences between treatment groups by using ANCOVA. For each 30-second interval, PAT response to hyperemia is calculated as the natural logarithm transformation of PAT ratio at 90- to 120-second postdeflation time period as follows: ln[(Xh90&#x02212;120/Xh120&#x02013;150)/(Xc90&#x02212;120/Xc120&#x02013;150)]; for our study, the PAT ratio was modified, and calculated at 30- to 60-second postdeflation time period as follows: ln[(Xh30&#x02212;60/Xh60&#x02013;90)/(Xc30&#x02212;60/Xc60&#x02013;90)] with h denoting hyperemic finger, X being the pulse amplitude, and with c denoting the control finger. A multiple regression analysis was performed for STAI-X1 and STAI-X2 against the variation of PAT ratio. A <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05 &#x000b1; SD was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the computer statistical package SPSS/10.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and SAS/6.4 (SAS Institute Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>All patients were seen with their partners and interviewed about their sexual activity and patient's ejaculation function. In total, 20 patients completed the whole randomized trial study. No patient was lost at followup. There were no statistical differences in patients' characteristics at baseline at the time of randomization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) excepting for PEDT scores and prolactin levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). </p><p>At baseline, no differences in RHI values were found between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>) when calculated as the natural logarithm transformation of PAT ratio at 90- to 120-second after deflation; when we calculate the differences in RHI, as the natural logarithm transformation of PAT ratio at 30- to 60-second after deflation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>), a significant difference in the variation of RHI was found as suggested by delta_RHI calculation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>).</p><p>All patients underwent PAT evaluation either after one tablet assumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or after 8-week on-demand treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

At the end of treatment, IELT time increased from 0.6 &#x000b1; 0.3 to 4.5 &#x000b1; 1.1 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, data not shown) and from 0.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 to 0.9 &#x000b1; 1.0 (ns), respectively. At the time of followup, patients who crossed over from placebo to vardenafil reported significant improvements in IELT (from 0.9 &#x000b1; 1.0 to 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.9&#x02009;min, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, data not shown), while on the other arm, a significant reduction in IELT was found compared with the end of study (from 4.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.1 to 3.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, data not shown); however, this latter IELT was still superior to baseline (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, data not shown).

Discussion</title><p>As far as we are aware, this is the first controlled study providing a possible explanation regarding the possible action of vardenafil on ejaculatory latency time. At baseline, different PAT responses were found between men with lifelong PE and controls. The finding that men with LL-PE have late vasodilator response at PAT hyperemic response is very new. In fact, when we evaluate mean RHI scores, no difference between groups was found. Indeed, a deeper evaluation of PAT response within the first 60 seconds after induced shear-stress represents a new possible application of this technique. At the outset, we demonstrate a positive relationship between PAT hyperemic response obtained within 60 seconds after vardenafil, treatment period and anxiety levels; remarkably, no PAT response to vardenafil was found in healthy controls. Interestingly, IELT improved in men treated with vardenafil while no changes were found after placebo, as previously reported in a larger study by our group [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Sympathetic activation causes attenuation of the PAT signal, indicative of vasoconstriction, coupled with pulse rate acceleration in addition to the typical changes reported by oximetry [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This technique is widely used for the diagnostic approach to sleep apneas, by giving additional information on changes of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone during sleep. Based on this knowledge, we applied this technique to men with LL-PE in order to identify differences in the autonomic control of peripheral vessels and to correlate them with the presence of anxiety. PAT software employs algorithms based on weighting two features of the PAT signal, each of which indicates sympathetic surge: amplitude attenuation (reflecting vasoconstriction) and pulse rate increase (comparable to heart rate increase) [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The results presented in this paper, even if obtained in a small population, are consistent with the presence of sympathetic overtone as one of the possible causes of PE in this subset of young men. The significant modification of RHI (expressed as delta RHI) implies that vardenafil treatment was able to improve vasodilatation through a nitric-oxide-(NO) mediated pathway. Given the improvements in ejaculatory function that have meaning for men with PE and their partners, the paucity of side-effects, and the fast onset of action, vardenafil may be offered as a treatment option in many men in which PE is associated with substantial psychological effects&#x02014;for example, interpersonal distress, decreased self-confidence, and relationship difficulties that play a major role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Indeed, psychological causes of PE, that is, increased performance anxiety, are well-known causes of PE and are usually treated with psychosexual therapies [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a real possibility for the motivated couple that the combination of pharmacotherapy with a PDE5-i and behavioral techniques may yield greater improvements in IELT.</p><p>The thoracolumbar sympathetic and the sacral parasympathetic and somatic spinal ejaculatory center (Onuf's nucleus) play a pivotal role in ejaculation because they integrate peripheral and central signals and send coordinated outputs to pelviperineal anatomic structures that allow a normal ejaculatory process to occur [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. PDE5i may exert their influence both centrally and peripherally. The NO/cGMP pathway seems to play a role in sexual behavior via a central effect [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Some authors have demonstrated that NO decreases central sympathetic output to the periphery via a cGMP-dependent mechanism or through interactions with other neurotransmitters. Specifically, a decrease of sympathetic tone by NO activity in the MPOA is related to inhibition of ejaculation [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, PDE5i may increase sexual arousal by acting in the central nervous system, in part mediated by the activation of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Many lines of evidence support the presence and activity of the NO/cGMP and NO/cAMP signaling pathways in the vas deferens (VD), smooth muscles, prostate, and urethra. Thus, those pathways may be responsible for the peripheral effect of PDE5i in the relaxation of penile corporal smooth muscles and could also affect smooth muscle in the VD, seminal vesicles (SVs), prostate, and urethra. A recent study demonstrated that the phasic contractile activity induced by means of electrical field stimulation of the SV tissue was most effectively inhibited by the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram and the PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil and vardenafil [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These observations were consistent with the findings from the studies mentioned earlier, indicating that PDE5 inhibitors can abolish the contractility of isolated human SV. Overall, these findings are in agreement with both central and peripheral actions of vardenafil on sexual behavior and on ejaculation. </p><p>The hormonal control of ejaculation and the pathophysiology of PE are still not fully understood. Corona et al. reported that testosterone, PRL, and TSH, significantly and independently contribute to the reported IELT variation in a large population of males complaining of sexual dysfunction [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In particular, low PRL and high testosterone levels were associated with a higher risk of PE, even after adjusting for confounding factors that include age, body mass index, medicaments, and smoking habit. Prolactin levels have also been found to be positively correlated with reported ejaculatory latency (from severe premature ejaculation to anejaculation), after excluding men with pathological hyperprolactinaemia and adjusting for SSRI use [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It must be emphasized that these associations were found in a population of patients without the specific use of the stopwatch method for the quantification of IELT, as it is evaluated in the present study where PRL levels were higher in LL-PE group, but within the normal range. Additionally, we can speculate that higher PRL levels might be the result, not the cause, of the loss of ejaculatory control in our study population because of the presence of an elevated anxiety trait. </p><p>There is suggestive evidence that men with PE are more likely to endorse questionnaire items indicating anxiety. Given that PE may be psychogenic, at least in part, and possibly related to anxiety, while part of its definition is feelings of lack of ejaculatory control, bother, and distress; there is considerable room for a placebo effect in all studies on the management of PE. In the present study, we observed an inconsistent placebo effect probably due to the design that considered an extension crossover period of time. We firstly demonstrated that PAT hyperemic response was strongest in the 30- to 60-second interval after fingertip flow was restored. The logarithmic transformation of the PAT ratio and selection of the 30- to 60-second time interval increased the overall association with the presence of a baseline constricted arterial tone, suggesting that this may be the optimal method for assessing the presence of sympathetic overactivity. The selected time period includes the portion of hyperemic response that has been previously shown to depend in part on NO production. Further studies in larger populations are needed to validate the possibility that the PAT hyperemic response is decreased in men with LL-PE and to validate the use of PAT as a diagnostic tool to identify possible responders to PDE5-I in the clinical setting.</p><p>In conclusion, fixed-dose vardenafil 10&#x02009;mg is a safe and effective treatment in the absence of ED in young men with LL-PE and high anxiety scores. Vardenafil effects on IELT and PAT responses are encouraging; even if this is a pilot study, this represents indirect evidence that neurobiological patterns of PE still need to be investigated. Further larger population controlled studies to confirm the beneficial effects of vardenafil are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors declare that
