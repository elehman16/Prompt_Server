Oral amiodarone in addition to delayed onset of action needs either admission or frequent outpatient visits to monitor the patient. Taking into consideration the rapid onset of action of intravenous amiodarone,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] we postulated that a loading dose of IV amiodarone in the operative room may reduce the risk of development of postoperative AF. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of parenteral intraoperative loading dose of amiodarone as prophylaxis against AF after valvular heart surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included adult patients of either gender with sinus rhythm (SR), scheduled for elective isolated valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The protocol was approved by the institutional ethical committee, and informed consent was signed by all the patients.</p><p>All the patients had their baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluated. Patients were excluded if they were allergic to amiodarone, had used amiodarone within 4 months of enrollment or had a history of amiodarone toxicity. Patients receiving class I, III or IV antiarrhythmic therapy, patients with untreated thyroid disease, elevation of liver enzyme concentrations to four times the upper limit of normal, pregnant patients, patients with resting heart rate &#x0003c;50 beats/minute, uncontrolled heart failure or in NYHA (New York Heart Association functional classification system) class VI were also excluded from the study.</p><p>This study was carried out on 97 patients. All the patients underwent the routine preoperative workup. The baseline ECG was evaluated for rhythm pattern. A prospective, randomized (sealed envelope indicates the group of assignment), double-blind design was used. An independent anesthesiologist, who did not participate in the study or data collection, read the number contained in the envelope and made group assignments.</p><p>Patients were randomized in two groups and received either a loading dose of amiodarone (3 mg/kg) or a similar volume of normal saline as a placebo. Infusion sets were identical, covered, and encoded group I (amiodarone group) or II (placebo group) by blinded anesthetist and a nurse not participating in the study or data collection.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Anesthesia technique</title><p>All the patients were premedicated with intramuscular injection of morphine 0.1 mg/kg and promethazine 0.5 mg/kg, 1 hour before induction.</p><p>In the operation theater, patients were monitored using ECG, pulse oxymetry and noninvasive blood pressure. After establishing intravenous cannulae and arterial line, anesthesia was provided according to a fixed protocol. General anesthesia was induced with the following drugs intravenously: 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg of fentanyl, 0.02 mg/kg of midazolam, 5 mg/kg of thiopentone and tracheal intubation was achieved with 0.1 mg/kg of pancuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with incremental doses of fentanyl, midazolam, isoflurane and pancruniuom. The right internal jugular vein was cannulated with double or triple lumen central venous catheter. Ventilation was adjusted to maintain the PaCO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 40 mmHg. Frequent assessment of the blood gases and electrolyte state of the patient was done.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Operative technique</title><p>All operations were performed through median sternotomy. Heparin was administered in a loading dose of 300 units/kg to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of 480 seconds or more.</p><p>CPB was established in a standard way; the ascending aorta was cannulated for arterial input and venous return was achieved with either a single two-stage venous cannula or bicaval cannulation. Myocardial protection was achieved with intermittent cold crystalloid cardioplegia administered every 20 minutes via antegrade, retrograde or both routes.</p><p>After release of aortic cross-clamp, the initial rhythm was noted. Internal cardioversion was done using 10&#x02013;40 J for AF, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Pacing was used for patients with atrioventricular block. Inotropes (dobutamine&#x000b1;adrenaline) were used to maintain hemodynamic performance if hypotension was encountered. After protamine sulfate, 1 mg/100 units heparin was given to neutralize the effect of heparin and bring ACT to normal range, then aorta was decannulated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Postoperative management</title><p>On return to cardiac surgical intensive care unit (ICU), all the patients were continuously monitored. Mean arterial blood pressure was kept between 60 and 90 mm Hg and the heart rate between 60 and 100 beats/minute. Electrolytes were kept within the normal range. Weaning from mechanical ventilation was started when appropriate.</p><p>All the patients had continuous display of the ECG in the ICU and continuous monitoring in the step-down unit up to the 5th postoperative day.</p><p>Twelve-lead electrocardiography was done daily starting from the day of operation to the 5th postoperative day, and on demand to document any rhythm disturbance then at discharge. No specific protocol for AF treatment was specified and the treatment was done as directed by the attendant physician.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study protocol</title><p>In amiodarone group, 3 mg/kg total dose diluted in 100 ml of normal saline was started prior to making skin incision and administrated through venous line over a period of 30 minutes. In the control group, the same volume of normal saline was infused in a similar fashion. If bradycardia, heart rate &#x0003c;60 beats/minute, or hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg was noted, the infusion was temporarily discontinued, and preload was optimized to treat hypotension. Inotropic support was initiated if required to achieve hemodynamic stability. When hemodynamic stability was reestablished, reinfusion of the drug was completed. The surgical team and anesthesia team were not aware of patients&#x02019; allocations to either group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Primary end point</title><p>The primary end point of this study was occurrence of AF during the first 5 days after surgery. For the purpose of the study, AF was defined as any episode of new onset AF of more than 5 minutes duration, regardless of the effect on the hemodynamic status or the need for medication. ECG was continuously observed using the cardiac monitor and any episode of arrhythmia was recorded with single-lead print out or 12-lead ECG whenever possible.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Secondary end points</title><p>The number of AF episodes, the duration of the longest episode, and the total duration of AF (number of hours of AF during the first five postoperative days) were recorded. The ventricular response rate on the subsequent postoperative day of occurrence of AF was also recorded. Moreover, the number of patients who had symptoms of AF in the form of palpitation, anxiety or chest discomfort was reported. Finally, morbidity, adverse events potentially attributable to amiodarone, and the length of postoperative hospital stay were also recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical presentation was conducted using means&#x000b1;SD and student's <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables.

These studies tried to solve three important issues: postoperative AF prevention, safety of prophylactic therapy, and effect of prevention of postoperative AF on adverse outcomes associated with it.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>This study represents another trial aiming at finding out if a single perioperative (pre-CPB) loading dose of amiodarone could decrease the incidence of postoperative new-onset AF, in a group of patients undergoing valvular surgery with non-compromised cardiac function. Our findings confirm the same. This easy regime allowed more patients to be treated; on the contrary, other studies had appreciable numbers of drug discontinuation.</p><p>Benefit of amiodarone in restoring SR was concluded in previous studies on Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) patients, which used more or less different protocols for giving amiodarone. Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] used loading dose of 150 mg and maintenance dose of 0.4 mg/kg/hour for 3 days before and 5 days after operation. Roshanali <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] used 800 mg of oral amiodarone, 1 day before surgery and then amiodarone was administered intraoperatively in a 500-mg bolus for 1 hour. Thereafter, the administration of amiodarone was continued as a total maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg weight over 24 hours on the first postoperative day, which was followed from day 2 through day 5 with 800 mg oral dose daily. Zebis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] used 300 mg amiodarone administered intravenously over 20 minutes followed by 600 mg amiodarone orally twice a day for the first five postoperative days. Hohnloser <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] used amiodarone after surgery in a loading bolus of 300 mg for 2 hours followed by 1200 mg every 24 hours for 2 days and 900 mg every 24 hours for the next 2 days.</p><p>Contrary to these results, a recently published study by Beaulieu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] using intravenous loading dose of 300 mg of amiodarone in the operating room, followed by infusion of 15 mg/kg/24 hours for 2 days did not reduce the burden of post valvular surgery AF. There was a trend in reduction of AF incidence during medication but this trend was reversed after infusion stoppage, and amiodarone group showed higher incidence of AF. However, this is not unexpected for small trials, and the readers cannot be convinced unless greater precision is provided from a much larger trial, or at least a meta-analysis of all relevant trials to date.</p><p>Several meta-analyses have shown amiodarone to be effective in reducing the incidence of AF and its complications after CABG alone or after combined CABG and valvular surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Beta blockers are strong negative risk factors for the development of postoperative AF, especially when patients take beta blockers prior to surgery. Beta blockers were continued in both groups and did not affect the accuracy of the results because of no significant difference in the drug usage between groups.</p><p>Selveraj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] evaluated the effect of intraoperative single-dose intravenous amiodarone to convert AF into SR in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery. 75% of the patients in the amiodarone group and 47.4% in the control group reverted to SR after cardioversion. However, in our study, we examined amiodarone prophylactic effect in prevention of new-onset postoperative AF.</p><p>Intravenous amiodarone was found to be well tolerated and did not increase the risk of postoperative complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] This finding was confirmed by the present study as well.</p><p>Despite having different mechanisms, magnesium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] administration and statin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] therapy are also important in prevention of postoperative AF. However, none of our patients used these drugs.</p><p>The small size of the study population, non measurement of amiodarone level in the blood and lack of holter monitoring are the limitations of this study. Due to the absence of standardized protocol for management of postoperative AF, data which depend upon AF response to treatment (length of stay, duration of AF, etc.) contain an undefined amount of noise. Also, with the small sample size, it may be difficult to statistically account for a multivariate analysis of other risk factors of postoperative AF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Amiodarone prophylaxis in a single intraoperative dose was significantly effective in prevention of new-onset postoperative AF after valvular heart surgery. This amiodarone dose is well tolerated and not associated with postoperative complications. Future research is still required to develop evidence-based practice standards for the most effective regimen of amiodarone for prevention of postoperative AF.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
