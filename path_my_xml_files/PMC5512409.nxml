The highest malignant transformation rate of OSMF of about 7.6% was reported from India as documented in International Agency for Research on Cancer monograph on OSMF.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The etiology of OSMF is multifactorial. Areca nut chewing is considered the most important etiologic factor,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] but other factors such as nutritional deficiency, altered salivary constituents, collagen disorders, and genetic susceptibility are also involved in the etiopathogenesis of OSMF.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The constituents of areca nut including arecoline and tanin interfere with normal collagen metabolism by increasing the synthesis of collagen and decreasing its breakdown. This results in increased collagen deposition and thus resulting in fibrosis of oral tissues.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Various treatment modalities including drug therapy, surgical therapy, and physiotherapy have been proposed till date for the management of OSMF. Various drugs with antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity have been used in the management of OSMF but with unpredictable results and incomplete remission. No single drug has been reported to be effective in treatment of OSMF. Hence, a combination of drugs has been used in the treatment of OSMF.</p><p>Colchicine is an alkaloid chemically known as colchicinum-N-(5,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>9-Tetrahydro-1,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>10-tetramethoxy-9- oxobenzo[alpha]heptalen-7-yl)acetamide.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Various studies have established the role of colchicine as an antifibrotic agent by inhibiting collagen synthesis and increasing collagenolytic activity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It has been used in reducing fibrosis in liver and kidney diseases.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Besides, it also has some anti-inflammatory properties. This anti-inflammatory property is related to drug's effect on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocyte chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesiveness, and also its effect on prostaglandin E, which suppresses the leukocyte function.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Very few studies have reported the use of colchicine in OSMF.</p><p>The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of oral colchicine with intralesional injection of hyaluronidase or injection triamcinolone acetonide in patients with Grade II OSMF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included thirty patients of clinically diagnosed Grade II OSMF who attended the OPD of Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Patients were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. Approval from Institute's Research Ethical Committee was taken.</p><p>A detailed case history including their habits was taken, and clinical examination was done. Clinical diagnosis was based on reduced mouth opening, burning sensation in mouth, blanching of mucosa, presence of vesicles or ulceration in oral cavity.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Burning sensation</title><p>Burning sensation in buccal mucosa was recorded before the start of treatment as a baseline.

Various treatment modalities had been proposed for OSMF but with unpredictable results.</p><p>In this study, male preponderance was seen (90% males). This is in accordance with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A maximum number of patients in our study (25 out of 30) were young adults. This is similar to a study by Maher <italic>et al</italic>., in which 70% were below 30 years of age.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] All the patients had a habit of gutka chewing which brings to light the lack of awareness and easy availability of these products.</p><p>The specific etiology of OSMF is still not clear, but various mechanisms for explaining the etiopathogenesis of OSMF have been suggested.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] There is excessive secretion of collagen and increased proliferation of fibroblasts along with inhibition of collagenase and fibrinolytic system. The cellular macromolecule damage caused by an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other reactive metabolic intermediates from betel quid also play a crucial role in the etiopathogenesis of OSMF. Besides, effects of fibrogenic cytokines and inflammatory factors secreted by activated macrophages and T lymphocytes are also important in the etiopathogenesis of OSMF. Upregulation of various cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta and connective tissue growth factor which are main triggers for increased collagen production and downregulation of bone morphogenic protein 7 which is a negative modulator of fibrosis have been reported in OSMF.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In later stages, collagen deposits increase in the submucous tissue involving blood vessels, salivary glands, and muscle leading to vascular occlusion and thus the symptoms.</p><p>Colchicine has been shown to inhibit collagen synthesis. It has been reported that colchicine inhibited procollagen secretion and its conversion to collagen and thus specifically inhibited collagen synthesis.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It disrupts the microtubule formation and inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Colchicine also exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by its destabilizing action on microtubules. It blunts the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;)-induced activation of macrophages and diminishes the number of TNF-&#x003b1; receptors on the surface of macrophages and endothelial cells. It also interrupts the mast cell degranulation process, thus preventing the release of inflammatory mediators.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The correlation of TNF-&#x003b1; levels with the severity of OSMF has been recognized.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>There is an excessive amount of ROS production in OSMF which leads to cellular macromolecule damage. Colchicine has been shown to inhibit ROS production which is necessary for inflammasome activation by its microtubule disrupting effect.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Among the various treatment methods, use of steroids and use of hyaluronidase have shown to improve the symptoms in OSMF. Steroids act as immunosuppressive agents by opposing the action of soluble factors released by sensitized lymphocytes. Steroids have also been used in OSMF due to their anti-inflammatory action.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] They prevent fibrosis by decreasing the proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen deposition.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Triamcinolone is preferred due to its high potency, duration of action, and decreased systemic absorption.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acid and lowers the viscosity of intercellular cement substances. It also decreases collagen formation.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Kakar <italic>et al</italic>., patients receiving hyaluronidase alone showed a quicker improvement in symptoms, whereas combination with dexamethasone gave better long-term results.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In a study by Borle and Borle,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] improvement in burning sensation of about 89.9% was seen with a combination of injection triamcinolone and injection hyaluronidase.</p><p>In this study also, amelioration of symptoms was seen in patients in both the groups. On 6-month follow&#x02013;up, less number of patients in Group B, in which triamcinolone injection with oral colchicine was used, showed a decrease in burning sensation as compared to patients in Group A, in which oral colchicine was used along with injection hyaluronidase.</p><p>Blanching of mucosa was decreased more in patients in Group B than in Group A.</p><p>On comparison of increase in mouth opening between both the groups, more increase in mouth opening was seen in patients in Group A than in Group B patients. This is in accordance with the randomized, double-blind trial conducted by Alora Veedu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The rapid breakdown of collagen by hyaluronidase and decreased collagen formation due to its action on hyaluronic acid gives a better result in improvement in mouth opening.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The improvement in mouth opening achieved more in Group A, i.e., in patients with injection hyaluronidase with oral colchicine is in accordance with the study by Krishnamoorthy and Khan.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] A significant improvement in burning sensation and mouth opening was seen in patients on oral colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily along with intralesional hyaluronidase 1500 IU was also seen in their study similar to this study.</p><p>Colchicine, with its anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic action, has been used in reducing fibrosis in liver and renal diseases. The use of colchicine in OSMF has been reported by very few studies till date. At a minimal dose of colchicine of 0.5 mg orally, no side effects were noticed. The combination of colchicine with hyaluronidase is beneficial due to the different mechanisms of action of both drugs which leads to additive effect. Besides, addition of colchicine with other drug gives the advantage of low dose of colchicine used and thus decreased toxicity.</p><p>The study had certain limitations. The first being that only patients with Grade II OSMF were evaluated. Most patients in Stage I are reluctant for treatment since they are mostly asymptomatic and thus unwilling to bear the cost and pain of injections. Patients in Grade III have mostly associated ulcerations and other mucosal diseases. Second, histological assessment of change could not be done in this study as patients with Grade II OSMF were unwilling to undergo surgical procedure of biopsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Use of injection hyaluronidase with oral colchicine gave better results in terms of increase in mouth opening and improvement in burning sensation without notable side effects.
