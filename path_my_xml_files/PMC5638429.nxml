However, the improvement in function could have occurred first, which led to the reduction in FABs. Without serial measurement of both the proposed mediator and outcome, it is not possible to know the order in which the change occurred. To establish how changes in factors are related over time, at least 3 measurements should be taken over different time points.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Typically in intervention studies, measures are only taken preintervention and postintervention, which only gives information on whether a change takes place or not, providing limited information about how a factor changes over time as a result of the intervention.</p><p>The Back In Action study<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> compared a psychological intervention with treatment as usual in 240 patients with LBP. The intervention centered on addressing patient&#x02019;s FABs and helping to improve their functioning. Measures of psychological factors and function were taken at baseline and at 4 follow-up points (2-, 6-, 12-, and 24-mo follow-up). The intervention was successful in reducing disability across all time points compared with the control group, with statistically significant differences observed between the 2 groups.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The authors of the original study hypothesized that the proposed intervention led to a reduction in FABs and disability compared with usual care, but acknowledged that the results were not able to identify which part(s) of the intervention were most effective.</p><p>A mediation analysis therefore provides an ideal opportunity to test this potential treatment mechanism and determine whether reductions in fear had a significant influence within the pathway leading to improved disability outcomes in this trial. Latent growth modeling is a technique that allows the inclusion of multiple time points, thereby providing a more accurate estimate of change.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The aim of the analyses reported in this paper was to test whether change in patients&#x02019; FABs mediated the relationship between their allocation to the active intervention and the change seen in disability in comparison with controls.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Back In Action Intervention: Conceptual Model</title><p>The intervention used in the study was based on approaches described by Balderson et al,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> which includes assessing and addressing patients&#x02019; FABs, anxiety, and activity limitations, performing a clinical assessment to rule out red flags indicating the need for prompt medical intervention, and providing treatment recommendations in line with goals set by the patient. The intervention included 4 visits with a physiotherapist or psychologist to identify and address fears about pain, discuss activity and exercise goals, and develop an action plan to try and resume normal activities. Exercises provided were relevant to the patient&#x02019;s action plan and progress was reviewed at the end of treatment. In addition to these visits, patients also received a book on back pain self-management (Moore et al 1999, cited in Von Korff et al<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and a 40-minute video on back pain (Patient Education Media Inc. 1996, cited in Von Korff et al<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The control group received treatment as usual, which was heterogenous including medications, physiotherapy, and a wide variety of other interventions.

A higher score suggests increased FABs. This version of the TSK has not been widely tested in terms of its psychometric properties, and in the present study was found to have a Cronbach &#x003b1; value of 0.66, suggesting questionable internal consistency and also potentially weakened associations between this measure and measures of other variables in the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><sec><title>Latent Growth Modelling</title><p>Latent growth modelling allows the examination of variables across time, both within and between participants.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> LGMs consist of an intercept latent factor and a slope latent factor.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The intercept factor represents the starting point for the trajectory of a factor (its baseline status), whereas the slope represents the change in the trajectory of that factor over time. The use of the term &#x0201c;trajectory&#x0201d; in this context refers to the path each individual&#x02019;s FABs and disability scores take over the measured time points. To correctly specify a LGM, factor loadings must be given to represent the intercept (usually all a value of 1, as this is the point at which each individual starts) and the slope factors (see below). LGMs can incorporate models where change is not linear and where assessment intervals are not equally spaced, provided that all participants have been assessed at the same time points.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> It is also possible to allow the model to estimate certain factor loadings when the trajectory of a measure is not clear.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> It should be noted that the factor loadings chosen are arbitrary and not reflective of actual score change on the measures included in the model.</p><p>Although in the present analysis it is the slope that is the factor of interest, the intercept is also important as where a person starts in an intervention will have an impact on their scores at subsequent points. Therefore, in this LGM, covariance between the intercept and slope factors was also included, as this gives an indication of whether people who start at a lower or higher score for the mediator or outcome change at lower or higher rates. To perform the analysis, 3 steps were carried out, which are outlined below.</p></sec><sec><title>Step 1: Investigate the Shape of the Observed Growth Trajectory (Change) for the Mediator and Outcome Variables</title><p>Change over time in both the mediator and outcome variables were estimated from the observed data, to ensure that the factor scores for the slope factor represented the observed trajectory and provided adequate fit to the data.

Nonresponse bias analysis indicated that there were differences in baseline levels of pain intensity, FABs, disability, and pain duration between responders and nonresponders in the 2 treatment groups. FABs and disability scores in the treatment group were higher at baseline for those responding to earlier follow-up points and lower at baseline for those responding to later follow-up points.

The factor scores were therefore estimated based on the observed trajectories, taking into account the unequal measurement points.

We assessed whether change in the potential mediator was related to change in the outcome variable. The model fit statistics indicated that the model provided fair fit to the data overall. Modification indices showed that allowing covariation between the error terms for the TSK and RMDQ 12-month follow-up scores and between the error terms for the TSK and RMDQ 2-month follow-up scores slightly improved model fit (&#x003c7;<sub>49</sub><sup>2</sup>=154.88, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic>=3.16, CFI=0.94, RMSEA=0.10 [95% CI, 0.08-0.11], SRMR=0.05). As it is likely that each of the measurement points are related to each other, and that this may be reflected in related error variance,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> we decided that allowing these covariances made theoretical sense. Further modifications did not seem to be theoretically plausible and therefore no further changes to the model were made.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> gives the results of the means, covariances, and variances between the intercept and slope of each variable. The mean change in both TSK and RMDQ indicated a small, statistically significant decrease over time in both variables. The within-domain covariance, relating to the intercept and slope of the same construct,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> showed a positive estimate between TSK intercept and slope and a negative estimate between RMDQ intercept and slope. This suggested that people who scored highly on the TSK at baseline had a higher rate of decrease in scores than those who scored lower, whereas for the RMDQ, people who scored higher at baseline had a lower rate of decrease in scores. However, both of these estimates were very small and did not reach statistical significance. The between-domain covariances gave much higher, statistically significant values. The high value between the TSK and RMDQ slope factors suggested that as TSK scores change the RMDQ scores also change (an important prerequisite for mediation). The high value between the 2 intercepts suggested that people who scored highly on the TSK are likely to also score highly on the RMDQ.

Modification indices indicated that allowing covariation between the error terms for TSK and RMDQ scores at 12-month follow-up, TSK score at 12-month follow-up and RMDQ score at 2-month follow-up, and TSK and RMDQ scores at 2-month follow-up would result in a better fitting model (&#x003c7;<sub>54</sub><sup>2</sup>=172.17, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic>=3.19, CFI=0.94, RMSEA=0.10 [95% CI, 0.08-0.11], SRMR=0.04). The covariation between TSK score at 12-month follow-up and RMDQ score at 2-month follow-up is less intuitive than covariances between the variables at the same time points, but could reflect a relationship between early change in disability and later change in FABs.</p><p>In the present analysis, the values of interest are the regression coefficients between treatment allocation and the slopes for the mediator and outcome.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Allocation to the intervention group significantly predicted the rate of change for both the TSK and RMDQ measures (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).

We sought to test the study&#x02019;s hypothesis that change in FABs explained the reduction in disability scores seen in the intervention arm of the trial (ie, that change in FABs was a mediator of the relationship between treatment allocation and disability improvement). The results of the analyses showed that there were associations between the intervention and change in FABs, and between change in FABs and change in disability. There was a significant mediating effect of change in FABs on the relationship between allocation to the active treatment and change in disability. This suggested that targeting FABs in an intervention for chronic LBP patients would be beneficial. However, the final mediation model provided a poor fit to the data. This means that the model as currently hypothesized does not fully explain how the treatment worked for this particular patient population, as there is key information missing. The study hypothesis, that allocation to the activation intervention arm was associated with a reduction in FABs and that this reduction was associated with a reduction in disability outcome, was therefore partially supported, but suggests that other mediating factors must be considered.</p><p>The Back In Action trial was a complex intervention, involving several sessions with a multidisciplinary team and several different components. Although several of these sessions did focus on reducing FABs, much of the intervention actually focused on goal setting and on plans to achieve those goals. These are likely to be highly variable depending on the individual patient, and could depend on factors such as self-efficacy or internal control, or the patient&#x02019;s relationship with their therapist. A systematic review also found pain catastrophizing to be a potential mediator of treatment effect in interventions with a psychological component in noninflammatory MSK pain,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> although there has been some recent debate around this with robust mediation analysis finding contradictory results.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Clearly further investigation of this factor is warranted. Both pain catastrophizing and FABs are key components of the Fear-Avoidance Model,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> which has been used extensively to explain the development of pain and disability in patients with MSK pain. However, although strong evidence exists for the predictive value of each of these model components,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> studies investigating the causal nature of these relationships have suggested that the model does not work in the hypothesized order.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> This model was not tested in full as part of the present study, but the results add to the evidence base for FABs being potential mediators of treatment outcome, even though the exact pathways through which this factor contributes has not been fully clarified as yet.</p><p>It could also be that the population included in the intervention did not score particularly highly on the FABs measure used, which would have limited the intervention&#x02019;s ability to impact on patient scores. However, little information is available on an acceptable cut-off for a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; TSK score. Previous studies using the Swedish and Dutch versions of the 17-item TSK have recommended a cut-off of 37 for &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; fear.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> In this study, the trial authors scored the 10-item TSK in a way that made it comparable with the 17-item version. If these cut-offs are applied to the present study, it would appear that both the treatment and control groups have high fear at baseline (mean score over 37), and whereas in the treatment group this score decreases (below 37 at each follow-up point), in the control group the scores at each follow-up point remain above this cut-off.</p><sec><title>Comparison With Previous Literature</title><p>This analysis adds to a currently small evidence base for treatment mediators of LBP interventions, and is the first study, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, that has used latent growth modelling for analyzing mediators in a LBP intervention study. Guidelines from previous LGM studies in other areas of health psychology were followed.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> A recent study also claimed to use Cheong and colleagues&#x02019; technique to carry out their mediation analysis on a RCT data from an intervention to prevent child behavioral problems,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> but although this study utilized LGMs they obtained their mediating effect using the Baron and Kenny<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> approach rather than using the product of coefficients approach used in the present study. The latter approach is recommended in the wider mediation literature<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> suggesting that it might represent stronger evidence of a mediated effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential Limitations</title><p>The technique of latent growth modelling used to carry out this analysis proved a useful, if complex, technique for mediation analysis. It offers the potential to address a key problem within current mediation studies, temporal sequencing, which is not currently adequately addressed.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, it must be acknowledged that latent growth modelling is a correlational technique and therefore it cannot be established whether the effect is in the hypothesized direction. The use of LGMs alone, as this study shows, cannot address temporal sequencing without including an adequate number of time points that will capture change when it occurs. In the present study, even though the Back In Action study collected data across 5 time points, it did not collect any data while the intervention was taking place. This limits the assessment of treatment-mediated effects as it is likely that the follow-up scores show a more diluted effect of the intervention than at the time of participants receiving it. The analyses presented here showed that change in both FABs and disability happens early on, but it is still not possible to see when these variables changed and crucially, <italic>which</italic> changed first. One way of potentially addressing this issue would have been to look at the intercept of the mediating variable and the slope of the outcome, rather than the slopes of both variables (to see whether baseline levels of FABs predict change in disability),<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> but that would have been illogical in this analysis as the hypothesis was around change in the mediator and the outcome. Looking at change in the mediator at an earlier stage than change in the outcome is another option, but again not possible in this analysis as the first follow-up point was 2 months posttreatment, at which any change that was expected to happen in both the mediator and outcome variables would have already occurred. However, such analysis is possible using LGMs provided that there are enough time points to allow examination of early and later change. This again stresses the need for assessment points during treatment. This would of course need to be balanced with the consideration of response burden for participants and the potential for increased dropout this additional burden may cause.</p><p>The final mediation model was also found to be a poor fit to the data, suggesting other factors might be responsible for the treatment effect. We acknowledge that only testing a single potential mediator is limiting, and that other factors measured in the original study such as depression and anxiety could also be important potential mediators. However, these factors (and others, such as those mentioned earlier) were not considered as mediating factors in the original study, so they were not tested. It could be that the addition of other factors would have improved the fit of the model.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for Clinical Practice and Research</title><p>Clinically, the findings from this study suggest that FABs play a role in the explanation of treatment outcome when a treatment specifically targets this factor. Future treatments should perhaps include only patients who are found to be highly fear avoidant, or tailor treatment to focus FAB reduction on patients who are most severe. However, this analysis represents only 1 study and more research is needed to support these findings, preferably research that accounts for the limitations discussed above. Few additional variables that could have played a key role in the success of this intervention (such as self-efficacy) were measured, and the role of other factors in this intervention are therefore unclear. Another concern is that the measure of FABs available in this dataset has not been validated previously, and its internal consistency in this dataset was questionable. A stronger measure of FABs, to ensure more confidence that this construct is indeed a mediator of outcome, is required in future studies.</p><p>To improve the delivery of future interventions, it would also be helpful to see which aspect of the intervention led to a change in FABs. For example, if this was after the first session, when fear of pain was explicitly discussed, it could be that this session was the one that was important in changing FABs. Measurements taken during the treatment period would give much more information on key variables that the intervention aimed to change, so that future interventions can be tailored to only include sessions found to impact on factors of importance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The reduction of FABs through a multidisciplinary intervention was found to be a significant mediating factor for the reduction of disability in chronic LBP patients in the Back In Action Trial. This study therefore supports the role of training clinicians in being able to target FABs as part of their overall skillset. One key issue still not resolved by this study is that of temporality. Future studies of treatment mediation need to address temporal relationships by including measures of key mediators and outcomes during the treatment period, to more confidently ascertain when reductions in fear tend to occur and thereby inform clinicians about when FABs should be targeted within a course of treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>The views expressed in this publication are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR, or the Department of Health.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>This paper presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Program Grants for Applied Research Program (grant reference no.
