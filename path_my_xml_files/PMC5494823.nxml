ART has the ability not only to improve health outcomes for the individual, but also in the prevention of ongoing HIV transmission through reducing viral load (VL). The push towards universal access to ART is reflected in the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) &#x0201c;90-90-90&#x0201d; goals, which aim to get 90% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) aware of their status, 90% of those diagnosed linked to care and receiving HIV treatment, and 90% of those receiving treatment virally suppressed by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) consolidated guidelines recommend all PLHIV be started on ART immediately upon diagnosis, regardless of CD4 cell count or disease stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, significant challenges in getting PLHIV linked to HIV care and on ART remain, including in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the region most affected by the HIV epidemic. It is estimated that only 53% of those eligible for ART in SSA were receiving it in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several systematic reviews of studies in SSA demonstrate low rates of linkage to care after HIV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with up to two-thirds of patients lost to follow up before initiation of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, strategies to facilitate linkage into HIV care in SSA are needed, especially as the number of people eligible for ART grows as countries implement &#x0201c;test and treat&#x0201d; recommendations throughout the region.</p><p id="Par24">In Uganda, it is estimated that only 65% of the 1.46 million PLHIV were aware of their status in 2015, of which only 51% were receiving ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, the number of people eligible for ART is expected to increase, as the revised 2016 Ugandan Ministry of Health (MOH) national treatment guidelines, which take effect in 2017, promote expansion of ART to all PLHIV, and put forth a number of strategies to increase the number of people aware of their HIV status and on treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Home-based HIV counseling and testing (HBHCT) is one such approach, where HIV counseling and testing teams travel door-to-door and offer HIV testing services. HBHCT is especially important in the era of expanded access to ART and &#x0201c;treatment as prevention,&#x0201d; since HBHCT, compared to other modalities of testing, identifies HIV infections at an earlier disease stage and reaches more people who have never had an HIV test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, HBHCT may be the most cost-effective testing strategy per person tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and per new HIV infection identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, though HBHCT is being widely implemented throughout SSA, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] very few studies have examined linkage to care and treatment for individuals who test HIV positive at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The most common linkage-to-care approach with HBHCT, paper-based referral to care sometimes with follow-up home visits, has not been rigorously evaluated, and a number of HBHCT-specific barriers may limit its effectiveness. A systematic review on linkage to care in developing countries identified the following as the most commonly cited barriers: psychosocial factors (fear of being seen at the clinic, fear of disclosing, not feeling sick), structural and economic barriers (transportation costs, distance to the clinic), and health system factors (drug stock-out) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Research evidence in Uganda has similarly documented these barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], with pervasive HIV stigma, especially in rural areas, a particularly prominent barrier to care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Such barriers may limit implementation of HBHCT; while HBHCT minimizes stigma and structural barriers of HIV testing (e.g., transportation) by bringing the test directly to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], such barriers may remain an issue for linkage to care, as testing occurs away from the health facility and in a community setting, where fear of stigma may be elevated. Moreover, there is less structure in place for tracking patients testing positive in HBHCT, which is often done once without any follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In Uganda, HBHCT has been shown to be highly acceptable; 94% of individuals offered testing in a district-wide HBHCT study accepted testing and received their results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, only 10.5% of those who tested HIV positive were linked to ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In another study, only 58% of those who tested positive in HBHCT were linked to care within 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In HBHCT studies across SSA, linkage ranges from 42% to 97% within 1-12&#x000a0;months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Low rates of linkage to HIV care during HBHCT highlights the need for interventions aimed to improve access to HIV care and treatment for individuals testing HIV positive in the home. The literature on HBHCT programs suggests that those with two follow-up home visits with counseling have better linkage compared to those with one or no follow-up home visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This finding is supported by recent trials in South Africa and Uganda, which found lay counselor facilitation and follow-up visits increased linkage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Based on evidence of the strong influence of HIV stigma, linkage to care interventions should be optimized in the context of rural HBHCT if they are to effectively reduce HIV stigma while addressing other barriers to care. A review of interventions to reduce HIV stigma found those providing social support to PLHIV were effective at reducing stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and emotional support through support groups has been shown to reduce internalized stigma among HIV-positive women in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. While no intervention studies have further linked reductions in stigma to subsequent improvements in linkage to care, a randomized trial in Uganda showed that counseling and social support via home visits doubled the likelihood of linkage to care for newly-diagnosed PLHIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Other data similarly suggests that social support may increase care linkage and retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], as well as reciprocal relationships between social support and HIV stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus, providing PLHIV social support soon after diagnosis may protect them from internalizing HIV stigma and buffer the effects of enacted HIV stigma, which in turn may improve linkage to HIV care.</p><p id="Par27">This paper describes the protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial (CRCT) to test an enhanced linkage to care intervention during HBHCT in rural Uganda. Our Providing Access To HIV care (Providing Access to HIV Care (PATH)/ <italic>Ekkub</italic>o) intervention enhances a similar strategy tested by Coates, Wanyenze, Bangsberg, and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] that was found to reduce time to HIV care and treatment among patients receiving opt-out HIV testing in health facilities in Uganda. The intervention facilitated linkage by: providing orientation to the HIV care system, counseling to help clients identify and reduce barriers to engagement in care, and assistance disclosing and identifying a treatment supporter. The PATH/Ekkubo intervention described in this paper enhances the original intervention in order to increase its impact on multiple outcomes, including HIV viral suppression, and adapts the intervention to address barriers specific to HBHCT by providing additional counseling with increased emphasis on HIV stigma reduction through increased social support. We test this intervention in a CRCT, with randomization at the level of the village rather than at individual level, to avoid potential contamination since village residents interact with one another regularly in our study setting.

Health services, including HIV care and treatment, are provided free at government health facilities. In line with WHO recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the Ugandan MOH 2016 guidelines, now expand access to lifelong ART to all adolescents and adults living with HIV immediately upon diagnosis regardless of CD4 count, in contrast to their previous eligibility threshold of CD4&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;500 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Our study began before these new guidelines were nationally disseminated and implemented. Under the currently implemented MOH protocol, at the first clinic visit, a CD4 test is done and patients are started on co-trimoxazole. Once CD4 results are available (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;weeks), those eligible for ART receive pre-treatment counseling and are given an appointment to come back 1 week later to initiate ART. HIV care and treatment, as well as peer support groups for PLHIV, are available at all district hospitals and level III health centers. As the 2016 policy for the expansion of lifelong ART is rolled out during 2017 all HIV-positive individuals will become eligible for ART regardless of their CD4 count. Throughout Uganda, a cadre of lay workers, constituting the Village Health Team (VHT), support community health-related activities and serve as liaisons between the community and the health facilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par32">The trial design is a matched-pair two-arm, cluster-randomized design with clusters being villages. One arm is the PATH/Ekkubo intervention arm and the other is a standard-of-care (control) arm. Villages are randomized to study arms. We will include 40 villages with approximately 600 participants across all clusters (villages). We will conduct structured interviews at baseline (pre-intervention), and at six and 12-month follow-up. Similarly, blood draws for HIV viral load and CD4 testing will be done at baseline and at 12-month follow-up.

Within each district we will pair match the 40 clusters (villages) by population size and proximity to major and regional roads, since the latter may facilitate access to health services because of greater availability of transportation. Using computer generated random numbers, we will randomly assign one village to be in the intervention arm and the other to the standard-of-care arm. Since village residents interact with one another regularly, we chose to randomize at the level of the village instead of randomizing individuals to study condition to avoid potential contamination. We will ensure that villages assigned to different study conditions are not within 4&#x000a0;km (1&#x000a0;h. by foot) of each other.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Procedures</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Community mobilization for HBHCT</title><p id="Par35">Following the Ugandan MOH guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], this study provides village-wide HBHCT across the study villages. HBHCT and study recruitment is being conducted over approximately 46&#x000a0;months, beginning in November 2015 and ongoing through August 2019. The HBHCT teams will work in two villages at a time (one village from each study arm), and proceed to the next two villages upon completion, and so on. Prior to beginning recruitment in a village, members of our research team will meet with political, religious, and other village leaders, and identify VHT members to will serve as &#x0201c;mobilizers;&#x0201d; together VHTs and community leaders will inform the residents about HBHCT and the upcoming study. Using existing lists of households and maps of homesteads within the village, VHT mobilizers will visit all households in the village and seek permission for the HBHCT team to visit. For the households who agree to have the team visit, the VHT will set an appointment for this visit. The VHT will accompany the team to the household on the scheduled visit day, introduce the team and then leave to allow the recruitment, informed consent, data collection, and HIV testing to occur. The teams will set appointments to re-visit households in which household members were absent. The HBHCT teams consist of a study interviewer, a laboratory technician, and an HIV counselor who were all previously trained in general research procedures. Additionally they were trained in the study protocol and procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Eligibility, recruitment, and informed consent procedures</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>HBHCT and brief baseline questionnaire</title><p id="Par36">After the team is introduced by the VHT during the HBHCT visit, the interviewer will verbally screen household members for eligibility for HIV testing and study participation using a brief questionnaire.

Individuals who don&#x02019;t normally sleep in the house will be excluded because they may live outside of the study area). We will obtain written informed consent for conducting the baseline interview and HIV testing.

Only one person per household will be included in the intervention trial to ensure independence in the data. Using computerized random selection, we will randomly select one of the eligible HIV-positive household members for inclusion in the intervention trial. For ethical reasons the same follow-up support (intervention or control) will be offered to other newly diagnosed or HIV-positive household members not in care as will be provided to the household member included in the intervention study.

According to the protocol, counseling consists of pre-test counseling and giving results with post-test counseling. Pre-test counseling includes: reviewing the test process, discussing the understanding of potential test results, and assessing risk for HIV infection. Rapid tests will be used which provide results in approximately 15&#x000a0;min. In the measures section we provide details on the HIV testing algorithm. When the results are ready, the counselor will provide the test results to the individual (or couple if applicable). The information provided will depend on whether the test is positive or negative. If the result is negative, the counselor will discuss HIV prevention (condom use, ways to reduce risk) and encourage future testing. If the result is positive the counselor will provide supportive counselling, discuss disclosure (if applicable), emphasize the importance of partner testing (if applicable), discuss HIV care and treatment available at the nearest health facilities and the laboratory technician will take a blood sample for CD4 and HIV VL testing. After the counselor tells the client his/her HIV test results, for those who are newly diagnosed, counselors will provide linkage to care following either the standard-of-care (paper-based referrals) or the PATH/Ekkubo intervention protocol, as detailed in the following sections. Control counselors will be trained to deliver standard-of-care linkage only, and will work only in villages allocated to the control arm. The intervention counselors will be trained in the PATH/Ekkubo intervention protocol over a four-day training and will work only in intervention villages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Description of the study arms</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Control arm: Standard-of-care linkage&#x000a0;(see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)</title><sec id="FPar4"><title>During HBHCT</title><p id="Par40">In villages randomized to the standard-of-care arm, the control counselor will provide information on HIV care and treatment and provide the client with a referral to HIV care and a list of health facilities, including location and HIV clinic hours, in their area that provide free HIV care.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Linkage to care in the control arm: Standard-of-Care</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Baseline HBHCT visit<break/>10&#x000a0;min</td><td>Provide information on HIV care and treatment available including HIV clinic locations and hours and provide referral to care</td></tr><tr><td>Two-Week CD4 results home visit<break/>15&#x000a0;min</td><td>Provide CD4 results and a paper-based referral to care.

Due to logistical differences between outpatient opt-out testing and HBHCT, we have made adjustments to include additional counselling sessions, to encourage and facilitate disclosure and seeking social support to address HIV-related stigma to increase the intervention&#x02019;s effect on multiple outcomes--beyond those examined in the previous trial. The development of stigma-reduction elements of the intervention were guided by the HIV Stigma Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The overall goal of the PATH/Ekkubo intervention is to identify and reduce barriers to HIV care through multiple follow-up counseling sessions following HBHCT. The intervention content includes up to six sessions delivered over a 10-week period. The core components and session schedule are described in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The first session begins after post-test HIV counseling during the initial HBHCT home visit and subsequent sessions are at 2 weeks and 6 weeks post HBHCT with optional sessions at 8 and 10&#x000a0;weeks for those who have not linked to care by 6 weeks; in addition there is a booster counseling session at the clinic when the client first presents to the HIV clinic. The components of the intervention include: linkage to care and referral, provision of CD4 results during the two-week visit, orientation to the HIV care system and the assessment of potential for adverse effects related to HIV diagnosis and linkage to care (e.g., intimate partner violence). The counselor assesses needs and barriers to linkage (e.g., coping skills, social support, HIV-related stigma, and additional barriers), provides counseling and referrals to overcome identified barriers, and provides additional help planning for disclosure, seeking social support, and dealing with HIV-related stigma. Finally, the session ends with the elicitation of the client&#x02019;s intention to seek HIV care. Each subsequent session includes reassessment of linkage status and barriers to care and counseling to overcome barriers, building on the counseling provided in the previous sessions. If at any point during the intervention period the client has linked to HIV care, the counselor aims to reinforce engagement in care and assess/reduce barriers to continued engagement.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Intervention arm: Enhanced Linkage to Care</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Intervention session core components</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Session 1, Baseline home visit<break/>

If the result is positive and the participant has provided informed consent for enrollment in either the intervention trial or the CD4 and VL monitoring only group, the health worker will take blood for CD4 and HIV VL testing. Follow-up interviews will be conducted at six and 12-months follow-up for participants enrolled in the intervention trial, using a computer-based structured questionnaire (&#x0003c;60&#x000a0;min duration). The data collection schedule, procedures, and instruments will be identical in both study arms and follow-up interviewers will be blinded to study arm assignment. A brief, 12-month questionnaire will be administered with participants in the CD4 and VL only group. For both intervention trial and CD4 and VL groups, we and will also take a blood sample for CD4 and HIV VL testing at 12&#x000a0;months, which will be returned to all participants during a 14-month home visit. Additionally, study staff will abstract data regarding attendance at the HIV clinic, CD4 count, and treatment regimen from medical records at each of the participating clinics as a secondary data source for some of the study outcomes.

Following WHO recommendations to assure HIV testing quality in high prevalence settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and the Ugandan MOH recommended assays, the rapid HIV testing algorithm we will be using in the study is as follows: Determine HIV-1/2 Assay (Alere/ Abbott Laboratories, Chiba, Japan) as the first test in the algorithm. If Determine is non-reactive, an HIV-negative result will be reported. For those found reactive with Determine, a second test, HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK (Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Medford, NY, USA) will be performed. If reactive with STAT-PAK, results will be reported as HIV positive. If reactive with Determine and non-reactive with STAT-PAK, both the Determine and STAT-PAK tests will be repeated. If both the repeat Determine and repeat STAT-PAK are reactive, an HIV-positive result will be reported. If both the repeat Determine and repeat STAT-PAK are non-reactive, an HIV-negative result will be reported. If the repeat Determine is reactive and the repeat STAT-PAK result is non-reactive, the sample will be tested using Uni-Gold HIV (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland). If Uni-Gold is reactive, an inconclusive result will be reported and the participant will be re-tested in 14&#x000a0;days. If Uni-Gold is non-reactive, an HIV negative result will be reported. For quality control purposes, a venous blood sample will be taken with every 10th participant who tests HIV negative.

Costs will be assessed in three categories: (i) direct costs of HBHCT &#x00026; linkage activities, (ii) HIV care costs incurred as a consequence of HBHCT &#x00026; linkage activities, and (iii) time-costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by individuals receiving the intervention. For the direct costs of HBHCT and linkage activities, data on personnel time and consumables will be extracted from staff activity logs, and data on training costs, transportation, and management/administrative overheads will be collected from program records. For the costs of additional HIV care and laboratory services incurred as a consequence of the intervention, costing will be undertaken at HIV clinics to establish unit costs for clinic visits, ART and other medicines, and routine laboratory tests. The number and timing of HIV-related services received by study participants will be collected from clinic records. Wages and other input prices will be based on public sector values to ensure that results are applicable to routine program settings. During the 12-month follow-up interviews we will include questions to determine costs incurred by study participants in relation to receipt of the intervention and HIV care (including time costs, travel costs, and any out-of-pocket payments related to HIV care).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Monitoring intervention fidelity</title><p id="Par75">Counselors will use electronic intervention protocols programmed on tablets to guide them in completing the components of each intervention session.

Attrition in the two arms will be compared. Multiple imputation technique will be implemented and sensitivity analysis will be conducted.</p><p id="Par77">To assess the primary outcome (the proportion of participants who are virally suppressed at 12-months) and secondary outcomes (linkage to care, time to care, receipt of opportunistic infection prophylaxis, and initiation of ART among those eligible for ART at baseline), linear mixed models and nonlinear mixed models will be applied. Information criterion such as Akaike information criterion or Bayesian information criterion will be used for model selection.</p><p id="Par78">In evaluating the intervention effectiveness mechanisms, and mediators and moderators, we will use structural equation modeling to estimate the causal effects using growth mixture modeling to account for the longitudinal and clustered data. To assess an existence of moderators of an intervention effect, covariates such as disclosure, social support, HIV stigma, adherence, distance from the clinic, CD4 count, having other HIV-positive household members, number and duration of intervention sessions received, village-level stigma towards PLHIV, etc. will be included. A nonlinear mixed model will be fitted independently for each covariate plus the treatment variable and an interaction term between the covariate and the treatment.</p><p id="Par79">To examine the natural history of stages in the HIV care continuum, we will use the control group to identify barriers to and facilitators of linkage to care and treatment, retention, and viral suppression, potential predictors include: sociodemographics, HIV stigma, disclosure, etc. Stepwise forward selection method from both logistic regression model and general linear model will be used to identify potential significant predictors for our analyses. Predictors that are selected from the stepwise method will be included in our mixed models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sample size justification and power analysis</title><p id="Par80">The sampling scheme is stratified clustering with matched-pair sampling. Within each area, we pair matched clusters (villages) by distance to the HIV clinic and randomly assigned one village to be in the intervention arm. We have ensured that villages assigned to different study conditions are not within 4&#x000a0;km (1&#x000a0;h by foot) of each other to avoid possible discussions between different arms of participants.</p><p id="Par81">We have powered the study to detect differences between the intervention and the standard-of-care for the primary outcome of HIV viral suppression (&#x0003c; 20 copies/ml) as well as intermediate outcomes: linkage to care and time to care, and, among those eligible for ART: time to and receipt of ART. Using census data, HBHCT acceptance rates from our own and other prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], HIV prevalence and prior knowledge of HIV status in this area from the recent prevalence survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and estimating a 92% acceptance rate for enrollment of eligible participants into the study we calculated that the average cluster size (number of newly-diagnosed PLHIV per village who enroll in the study) will be 14 (range 8 to 37). In calculating the necessary clusters, type I error rate, desired power of tests, measure of effectiveness between the intervention and control group, cluster size, and coefficient of variation (k) or intraclass correlation coefficient are needed. We estimated viral suppression at 12-month follow-up among those eligible for ART at baseline to be 55% in the standard-of-care arm and 75% in the intervention arm. This estimate takes into account 12-month viral suppression success rates from SSA public sector ART programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] and our own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and others&#x02019; data on intermediate outcomes of linkage to care and ART initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. With a type I error rate of 0.05 (two sided), average cluster size of 14, power of 80%, 12% difference in outcomes, and coefficient of variation of 0.24, we need 40 clusters after accounting for a 18% attrition rate for the follow-up. We expect that the 40 clusters will yield approximately 600 PLHIV participants across the two study arms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par82">Approval of all study procedures has been obtained from the institutional review boards at San Diego State University and Makerere School of Public Health. Study approval has also been received from the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology. We will obtain written informed consent for participation in HIV testing and the brief baseline questionnaire interview. For individuals who want HIV testing, but do not want to participate in the brief questionnaire interview, verbal informed consent with a waiver for written consent will be obtained. Separate consent forms will be used to obtain written informed consent for all participants enrolled in the intervention trial or CD4 and VL Only arm.</p><p id="Par83">We expect that the overall risk:benefit ratio will be favorable to patients participating in the study, and the risks related to HBHCT are not greater than the risks associated with the standard-of-care health system procedures related to home-based health services, which is commonplace in this rural Ugandan setting. Among the main risks of the study, are minimal physical risks associated with fingerstick and venous blood draws (bruising, bleeding, discomfort, lightheadedness, and potential infection), which are not greater than the risks incurred from normal medical blood testing procedures. We will minimize these risks by hiring qualified staff who also have experience in phlebotomy and finger stick blood collection to perform these procedures.</p><p id="Par84">There is also the potential for breaches in confidentiality related to collected data (detailed contact information of patients, interviewer-administered computerized questionnaires, data extracted from medical records, HIV results, CD4 and VL test results). To reduce the potential for recorded data to identify the participant, we will (a) use unique identifiers (random 6 digit study identification (ID) numbers) instead of medical ID/record numbers or participant names to identify all data; (b) store of the list that links the participants&#x02019; names to their unique identifiers in a locked, secure location; (c) store participant contact details in a locked cabinet separate from the list that links participant names to study ID numbers and it will not contain the unique study ID number, (d) use encryption protocols and password protection for all data collected and/or stored electronically and encryption procedures to securely transfer data, and (e) train all study staff in the importance of and procedures for protecting participants&#x02019; confidentiality.</p><p id="Par85">Participants in our study may experience discomfort while discussing sensitive information during interviewer-administered computerized questionnaires (e.g., domestic violence) and intervention counseling sessions (e.g., barriers to attending HIV care). These risks will be mitigated through clearly informing patients of their right to refuse to answer any question or engage in any discussion that makes them uncomfortable and providing adequate training to counselors and interviewers in navigating sensitive discussions. For participants receiving the intervention, the possibility of experiencing an unforeseen unintended negative consequence from participating in the intervention (e.g., negative reactions to their disclosure of HIV status). This risk will be mitigated by training counselors delivering the intervention to conduct counseling sessions only in private settings and to use judgement in which strategies are appropriate for participants based on their personal circumstances. Finally, there is potential for public disclosure of the HIV test result. However, HIV test results, like all other data, will only be identified by a randomly generated study ID number. We discuss ethical concerns and protections for participant confidentiality further in the discussion section.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par86">We hypothesize that compared to individuals receiving standard-of-care, or paper-based referrals, individuals receiving the PATH/Ekkubo intervention will be more likely to be virally suppressed 12&#x000a0;months after HBHCT, and demonstrate shorter time to HIV care and ART initiation among those eligible. Individuals receiving the PATH intervention will receive multiple follow-up counseling sessions aimed to address barriers to HIV care. This study will indicate whether enhanced linkage to care counseling found effective in improving linkage to HIV care during facility-based HIV testing in an urban population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] can similarly improve linkage to HIV care, and subsequently reduce VL, when integrated into HBHCT in a rural setting. This study will also provide further information on the cost-effectiveness of this approach compared to providing standard-of-care paper-based referrals during HBHCT.</p><p id="Par87">The evaluation of this intervention has the ability to advance science and improve public health service delivery in several ways. To date, few randomized controlled trials have assessed interventions to improve linkage to care in the context of HBHCT, leaving a gap in our understanding of the best approaches to promote linkage to HIV care and treatment in HBHCT in SSA countries. For those in the intervention arm, it is anticipated that this study will help patients reduce barriers to accessing HIV care by providing strategies and resources to overcome stigma and other barriers, as well as the requisite knowledge, motivation, and self-efficacy needed to do so. If found effective, our study will provide information on the mechanisms through which our intervention influenced linkage behavior, which will be useful in the development of future interventions. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis based on prior research, that social support will have a protective effect against enacted and internalized stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and additionally test the subsequent effects on linkage to care, receipt of HIV treatment, and viral suppression. In addition, by treating the control-arm as a natural history control, our study will further contribute to the scientific literature on barriers to and facilitators of linkage to care and treatment and HIV viral suppression. This data, together with our findings on costing, have the potential to inform the integration of cost-effective avenues for follow-up and the delivery of support for HBHCT in Uganda and similar settings.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Confidentiality and ethical considerations</title><p id="Par88">Conducting a CRCT in the setting of HBHCT has unique ethical challenges surrounding confidentiality of participants&#x02019; HIV status. Given the nature of our intervention, which includes multiple home visits for PLHIV, efforts to minimize the risk of participants being identified as HIV positive in their community or families through participation in our study are paramount. In addition to commonly employed safeguards to protect participant confidentiality, such as the use of unique identifiers linked to personally identifying information and the careful storage and transfer of sensitive data (as described previously), we describe here issues of confidentiality and ethics specific to conducting research with PLHIV during HBHCT, which may also be relevant to other community-based trials that involve PLHIV, and how we&#x02019;ve aimed to address them.</p><p id="Par89">With research involving PLHIV, there is always small risk of public disclosure. In our study, home visits from counselors could increase risk of public disclosure. While we think it is unlikely that visits from counselors in it of itself would signal one&#x02019;s HIV-positive status to others in the community, as visits from counselors and various health workers are common in Uganda for a variety of healthcare reasons (e.g., family planning, postnatal care, malaria care, immunizations), we will minimize this risk in several ways. Firstly, when counselors do home visits to HIV-positive participants for the intervention trial, they will also visit other homes nearby.</p><p id="Par90">Secondly, only those who have tested HIV positive and are enrolled in the intervention trial will know that the intervention trial is about linkage to HIV care. Participants in the baseline interview and HIV testing and those who only want HIV testing will not be informed about the intervention trial and thus will not know that those who are positive and in the intervention trial will be getting home visits. The baseline assessment itself will be framed more broadly as a survey on health care access and will include questions on other health service uptake beyond HIV (e.g., family planning) to mask the study&#x02019;s purpose. Masking the purpose of the study requires that we consent participants for the intervention trial after they have learned they are HIV positive.</p><p id="Par91">In addition to potential breaches in confidentiality among community members, counselor visits also have the risk of family members or others overhearing discussions in which sensitive information is being addressed. Training counselors to ensure privacy during home visits, as well as training counselors to use their judgment in rescheduling a home visit if privacy is compromised will minimize this risk.</p><p id="Par92">Although this risk is considered to be low, some strategies that patients elect to implement in order to engage in HIV care may potentially have unintended negative consequences on the study participant or others. To minimize this risk, counselors will be trained to respect patients&#x02019; decisions and their comfort levels with HIV care linkage strategies and goals, emphasizing the decision to engage in HIV care, disclose one&#x02019;s HIV status to others, and seek social support will be a personal one of the patient. When assessing linkage behavior, all components of a patient&#x02019;s physical health, mental health, and social situation will be considered when discussing linkage strategies, including the threat of domestic violence. A variety HIV care linkage strategies will be discussed with each participant to minimize the possibility that a particular plan to access care may place a patient in any danger. Participants will choose the one least likely to cause negative consequences. Counselors will screen for the threat of domestic violence when deciding on a disclosure plan and linkage strategies during the first counseling session, and will conduct a brief risk assessment for domestic violence at every subsequent meeting with participants. Should participants require additional support, counselors will refer participants to relevant staff at the clinic or hospital, who will be equipped to provide appropriate referrals as necessary to study participants for additional counseling, substance abuse issues, domestic abuse, and the threat of violence when these issues arise. Participants who disclose potential abuse (both men and women) will be immediately referred to community and/or onsite services equipped to manage situations of domestic abuse when available or to higher levels when unavailable. Immediate access to crisis intervention and emergency health services, including referrals for safe shelter, are available through the hospital as needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par93">Among the study&#x02019;s limitations is the threat for contamination between intervention and control villages. However, randomizing at the level of the village and having villages assigned to different study arms not geographically close to one another should minimize this threat. We will monitor potential contamination by asking all study participants what kind of linkage counseling they received and from whom. Interviewers conducting the follow-up assessments will be blinded to study condition, however, un-blinding is possible if participants discuss the intervention with the interviewer. We will monitor this by debriefing interviewers. In addition to individual-level data, we will collect clinic-level data; cross-classification may occur if participants seek HIV care at a clinic other than the one nearest to them. However, our data analysis approach can accommodate cross-classification. Finally, in order for participants to be eligible for participation, they must be willing to accept home visits, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. However, we judge this to be only slightly more than in any study which tracks participants via home visits, and from prior studies, we have found that very few patients decline to participate due to the possibility of being visited at home.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par94">If the PATH/Ekkubo intervention is found effective, the anticipated public health benefits include improving individual health by reducing the time in which participants are linked to care. Timely linkage to care improves treatment outcomes and reduces mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Participation in our study in itself regardless of study condition provides individuals the opportunity to learn their HIV status, and receive diagnosis and treatment for HIV that would have otherwise gone unnoticed and untreated. Moreover, through ART&#x02019;s effect on VL, increasing the number of PLHIV who are in HIV care and receiving ART will have a secondary outcome of the prevention of ongoing HIV transmission to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Our study will further add to the scientific literature on the potential population-level health benefits of behavioral interventions, by assessing population-level VL as a study outcome.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AACTG</term><def><p id="Par5">Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AIDS</term><def><p id="Par6">Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p id="Par7">Antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARVs</term><def><p id="Par8">Antiretroviral medications</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUDIT</term><def><p id="Par9">Alcohol use disorders identification test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRCT</term><def><p id="Par10">Cluster randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBHCT</term><def><p id="Par11">Home-based HIV counseling and testing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par12">Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ID</term><def><p id="Par13">Identification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOH</term><def><p id="Par14">Ministry of health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PATH Study</term><def><p id="Par15">Providing access to HIV care study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PLHIV</term><def><p id="Par16">People living with HIV</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSA</term><def><p id="Par17">Sub-Saharan Africa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TB</term><def><p id="Par18">Tuberculosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UVRI</term><def><p id="Par19">Uganda Virus Research Institute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VHT</term><def><p id="Par20">Village health team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VL</term><def><p id="Par21">Viral load</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par22">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the contributions of Butambala, Mpigi, Mityana, and Gomba Health Districts and the participating health clinics in the implementation of this study and thank them for their support.
