While effective antibiotic treatment is essential treatment for sepsis, resistance to antibiotics is increasing. Adjuvant therapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin, therefore offer an important additional strategy. Three Cochrane systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials in nearly 6,000 patients suggest that non-specific, polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin is safe and reduces sepsis by about 15% when used as prophylaxis but does not reduce mortality in this situation. When intravenous immunoglobulin is used in the acute treatment of neonatal sepsis, however, there is a suggestion that it may reduce mortality by 45%. However, the existing trials of treatment were small and lacked long-term follow-up data.</p><p>This study will assess reliably whether treatment of neonatal sepsis with intravenous immunoglobulin reduces mortality and adverse neuro-developmental outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>A randomised, placebo controlled, double blind trial. Babies with suspected or proven neonatal sepsis will be randomised to receive intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or placebo.</p><p>Eligibility criteria</p><p>Babies must be receiving antibiotics and have proven or suspected serious infection AND have at least one of the following: birthweight less than 1500 g OR evidence of infection in blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid or usually sterile body fluid OR be receiving respiratory support via an endotracheal tube AND there is substantial uncertainty that intravenous immunoglobulin is indicated.</p><p>Exclusion criteria</p><p>Babies are excluded if intravenous immunoglobulin has already been given OR intravenous immunoglobulin is thought to be needed OR contra-indicated.</p><p>Trial treatment</p><p>Babies will be given either 10 ml/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin or identical placebo solution over 4&#x02013;6 hours, repeated 48 hours later.</p><p>Primary outcome</p><p>Mortality or major disability at two years, corrected for gestational age.</p><p>Data collection</p><p>Data will be collected at discharge from hospital and at 2 years of age (corrected for gestation) using a parental questionnaire and a health status questionnaire completed during a face-to-face follow-up appointment with the child's paediatrician.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISCRTN94984750.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>This protocol is for a large, simple-in-design, double blind, placebo controlled, pragmatic, multicentre randomised trial.</p><sec><title>Hypothesis to be tested</title><p>That, in infants receiving antibiotics for clinical sepsis, the addition of non-specific, polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin IgG (IVIG) therapy reduces mortality and major morbidity compared with antibiotics alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Background</title><p>Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity and has been implicated in the causation of perinatal brain damage and cerebral palsy, both in term and preterm infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy, increasing numbers of bacteria are resistant to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Effective adjunctive strategies are therefore needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Incidence, potential impact on mortality and problems in diagnosis</title><p>In a prospective study in seven Australian neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), Isaacs and colleagues reported an annual incidence of sepsis of 6.6 per 1000 live births, of which 75% were late onset (more than 48 hours after birth). Overall hospital mortality for sepsis was 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In a cohort of 54 UK neonatal units in 1998, 204 (5%) of 3,963 consecutive admissions to neonatal units had a positive blood culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Of these, 16 (8%) died. Of 3,759 (95%) babies with negative blood cultures, 95 babies died (2.5%). For very low birthweight (VLBW) infants with positive blood cultures, mortality was 14%. In a North American cohort, mortality in VLBW infants with septicaemia was 21% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, these figures may underestimate the true incidence of neonatal sepsis. Blood cultures may often be negative if less than 1 ml of blood is sampled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, while sepsis was the primary cause of death in most infants under 1000 g at autopsy, it was clinically undiagnosed in 61% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Sepsis-specific mortality rates should therefore be interpreted with caution, as the diagnosis may often be inaccurate. More reliable evidence would be provided by randomised comparisons of the effects of specific interventions on mortality from all causes.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential impact of sepsis on the perinatal brain</title><p>Recent evidence suggests that sepsis is also important in the pathogenesis of neuro-developmental impairment of perinatal origin. In a case-control study of 424 births, Grether and Nelson found an association between maternal infection in labour and cerebral palsy in infants with birthweight of at least 2500 g (OR 9.3, 95% CI 3.7, 23.0).</p><p>In another case-control study of 96 term infants, levels of cytokines in neonatal blood spots were consistently higher in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 3 years of age than in controls, suggesting that an inflammatory response may be important in the aetiology of cerebral impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In preterm infants, sepsis is also associated with subsequent adverse neuro-developmental outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Dammann and Leviton have suggested that infection remote from the preterm brain may predispose to cerebral white matter damage with disruption of oligodendroglial myelination and disordered migration of precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The damage could result partly from inadequate endogenous protection from developmentally regulated factors such as oligotrophins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As antenatal and postnatal sepsis may predispose to neuro-developmental impairment and disability in term and preterm infants, these are essential measures of outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible adjunctive treatments</title><sec><title>Immunoglobulin</title><p>Newborn infants, particularly those who are very low birthweight or preterm, are deficient in IgG, which binds to cell surface receptors, provides opsonic activity, activates fixation of complement, promotes antibody dependent cytotoxicity, improves neutrophil chemiluminescence and phagocytosis and can improve neutropenia by enhancing the release of stored neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is therefore a theoretically attractive strategy, with multiple mechanisms of action. Its potential clinical relevance is confirmed by recent evidence from randomised controlled trials (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Pentoxifylline</title><p>In animal models of sepsis, pentoxifylline, a methylxanthine deriviative, inhibits production of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), preserves micro-vascular blood flow, prevents circulatory failure and intestinal vaso-constriction and improves survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is well tolerated and decreases TNF production in adults and preterm infants with sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pentoxifylline recruited 140 preterm infants with clinical sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Among the 107 with positive blood cultures, pentoxifylline was associated with an 86% reduction in risk of mortality (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03, 0.76). Outcomes for the 33 infants not included in the analyses are not available. Pentoxifylline may be a promising therapy in neonatal sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytokines</title><p>Other adjunctive strategies for prophylaxis or treatment of neonatal sepsis are also attractive, such as use of the recombinant cytokines Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) or Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) to prevent neutropenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, no systematic reviews of RCTs of these agents are yet available. In four RCTs of G-CSF therapy which recruited 125 infants with neonatal sepsis, there was a trend to reduced mortality which was not statistically significant (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.2,1.8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Two recent RCTs of GM-CSF prophylaxis in a total of 339 high risk infants showed no reduction in sepsis or mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, these findings do not rule out a moderate benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Blood products other than immunoglobulin</title><p>White cell (granulocyte) transfusions are also a logical approach. Although preliminary clinical evidence is encouraging, there are potential risks from transmission of infection (e.g. HIV or hepatitis) or from graft-versus-host disease, and the technology is not widely available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Exchange transfusion with fresh whole adult blood appeared effective in one RCT of 22 septicaemic infants, but may also transmit infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In another RCT, in 776 infants of less than 32 weeks' gestation, there was no evidence that prophylactic fresh frozen plasma reduced the risks of mortality from all causes or of disability in survivors at 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Overall, therefore, the evidence suggests that IVIG therapy is one of the most promising strategies in neonatal sepsis and should be assessed in a definitive RCT.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Non-specific versus specific immunoglobulin</title><p>This trial will use non-specific, polyclonal IVIG (normal human IgG immunoglobulin) produced from plasma from non-UK donors. It was decided that specific IVIG would not be used and that there was no necessity to characterise the specific antibacterial profile of the non-specific IVIG for the following reasons:</p><p>1) Previous RCTs of non-specific, polyclonal IVIG in neonates and adults did not characterise any specific aspects of antibacterial function in the products used. There is therefore no reference laboratory data against which to judge the possible antibacterial efficacy of polyclonal IVIG.</p><p>2) As the mechanism of action of IVIG is likely to be multifactorial, the precise aspects of antibacterial function which should be assessed are speculative.</p><p>3) Despite the production of monoclonal antibodies with demonstrable in vitro and in vivo antibacterial function in laboratory studies, they have not been associated with reductions in mortality in RCTs. There is therefore no evidence that laboratory studies which attempt to characterise specific aspects of antibacterial function in IVIG products would be more predictive of clinical efficacy than the existing clinical evidence from RCTs in support of non-specific, polyclonal IVIG therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results of previous randomised controlled trials</title><p>A Cochrane systematic review of the prophylactic use of non-specific IVIG in 15 RCTs with a total of 5,054 preterm or low birthweight infants has demonstrated that prophylactic, non-specific IVIG reduced sepsis (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74, 0.98) and was safe, with no major adverse effects, but did not demonstrate a definite reduction in mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75, 1.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>A Cochrane systematic review of reports of RCTs of IVIG therapy for proven or suspected neonatal sepsis identified nine studies that reported outcomes for 318 infants with suspected infection and 262 infants with proven infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. IVIG therapy appeared to be safe and was associated with approximately 40% reduction in the risk of mortality for both suspected and proven infection (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). However, the confidence intervals were wide and the studies included in the analyses were small and not of high methodological quality. Problems identified by the reviewers were lack of allocation concealment, lack of blinding of outcome assessment and high levels of post-randomisation exclusions in some of the trials.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mortality in trials of IVIG for suspected infection in neonates</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Study</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Exptl n/N</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Ctrl n/N</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Relative Risk (95% CI Fixed)</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>Weight</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Christensen 1991</td><td align="center">0/11</td><td align="center">0/11</td><td align="center">not estimable</td><td align="right">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Erdem 1993</td><td align="center">6/20</td><td align="center">9/24</td><td align="center">0.80 [0.34, 1.86]</td><td align="right">22.0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Haque 1988</td><td align="center">1/30</td><td align="center">6/30</td><td align="center">0.17 [0.02, 1.30]</td><td align="right">16.1%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Samatha 1997</td><td align="center">5/30</td><td align="center">8/30</td><td align="center">0.62 [0.23, 1.69]</td><td align="right">21.5%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Shenoi 1999</td><td align="center">7/25</td><td align="center">7/25</td><td align="center">1.00 [0.41, 2.43]</td><td align="right">18.8%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sidiropoulos 1981</td><td align="center">4/41</td><td align="center">8/41</td><td align="center">0.50 [0.16, 1.53]</td><td align="right">21.5%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Total</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>23/157</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>38/161</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>0.63 [0.40, 1.00]</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>100%</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Review: IVIG in neonatal infection</p><p>Comparison: IVIG vs placebo or no intervention for suspected infection</p><p>Outcome: Mortality from any cause</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Mortality in trials of IVIG for proven infection in neonates</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Study</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Exptl n/N</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Ctrl n/N</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Relative Risk (95% CI Fixed)</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>Weight</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Chen 1996</td><td align="center">2/28</td><td align="center">1/28</td><td align="center">2.00 [0.19, 20.82]</td><td align="right">3.8%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Erdem 1993</td><td align="center">5/15</td><td align="center">7/16</td><td align="center">0.76 [0.31, 1.89]</td><td align="right">25.4%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Haque 1988</td><td align="center">1/21</td><td align="center">4/23</td><td align="center">0.27 [0.03, 2.26]</td><td align="right">14.3%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mancilla-Ramirez 1992</td><td align="center">2/19</td><td align="center">2/18</td><td align="center">0.95 [0.15, 6.03]</td><td align="right">7.7%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Samatha 1997</td><td align="center">0/12</td><td align="center">4/16</td><td align="center">0.15 [0.01, 2.46]</td><td align="right">14.6%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sidiropoulos 1981</td><td align="center">2/20</td><td align="center">4/15</td><td align="center">0.38 [0.08, 1.78]</td><td align="right">17.2%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Weisman 1992</td><td align="center">2/14</td><td align="center">5/17</td><td align="center">0.49 [0.11, 2.13]</td><td align="right">17.0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Total</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>14/129</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>27/133</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>0.55 [0.31, 0.98]</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>100%</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Review: IVIG in neonatal infection</p><p>Comparison: IVIG vs placebo or no intervention for proven infection</p><p>Outcome: Mortality from any cause</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The reviewers concluded that: <italic>"The reduced mortality following treatment with IVIG for subsequently proven infection, the imprecise estimate of the effect size (number needed to treat 11, 95% CI 5.6, 100) and the borderline statistical significance for the outcome of mortality in neonates with suspected infection justify further research.

The odds ratio for mortality in treated versus control infants was 0.173 (95% CI 0.03, 0.75). These authors reached a conclusion which many would consider premature, namely that "<italic>IVIG should be considered as part of the routine therapy of neonatal sepsis</italic>". However, it remains true that, among all the interventions currently reviewed in the Cochrane Library, IVIG therapy in neonatal sepsis is associated with one of the largest reductions in the odds of death. A further RCT of IVIG in neonatal sepsis in Brazilian neonatal units is being conducted. One of the applicants (K Haque) is an investigator of this trial.

However, IVIG produced to modern standards of quality control is one of the safest blood products available. There have been no reports of transmission of viruses or prions by the IVIG to be used in this study.</p><p>Methods of production including ethanol fractionation, and the use of the pH4/pepsin virus inactivation procedure, in addition to the use of plasma originating from non-UK donors have reduced the risk of transmission of infection to an absolute minimum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>In particular, for prion disease, leucocytes represent the main source of infectivity in Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. Owing to the physico-chemical characteristics of the abnormal prion protein, the process of partitioning and filtration during fractionation further reduces the risk of transmission in IVIG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This theoretical risk must be considered in the context of the significantly increased risk of mortality and morbidity in infants eligible for the study.</p><p>As a further safeguard, fractionation pools of IVIG are tested with PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for known blood borne viruses.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety: No evidence of haemolysis related to T activation of red cells</title><p>Bacteria such as Clostridia can strip neuraminic acid residues from the red cell membrane, exposing the T antigen (T activation). Adult plasma contains anti-T antibodies, so transfusing newborn infants whose red cells are T activated with whole blood, unwashed red cells or unselected plasma may lead to polyagglutination and haemolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. However, anti-T antibodies are predominantly IgM immunoglobulins a fraction which is removed from the IVIG used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. T activation is not a contra-indication to its use in neonatal sepsis.</p><p>Although neonatal haemolysis has been noted in association with IVIG, it was not clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The UK Committee on Safety of Medicines has received no reports of neonatal haemolysis or other adverse reactions in association with IVIG over a 30 year period until the present (personal communication, September 1999).</p></sec><sec><title>Current practice</title><p>IVIG is not currently widely used for prophylaxis or treatment of neonatal sepsis in UK NICUs. In 1997, a postal survey of all paediatricians who were members of the British Association of Perinatal Medicine was undertaken into practice in the investigation and treatment of neonatal sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Of the 181 (66%) who responded, only 13 (7%) used IVIG routinely as adjuvant therapy alongside antibiotics.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>There is good preliminary evidence that IVIG therapy may reduce mortality in severe neonatal sepsis. However, there is no information on longer term quality of survival, the number of babies included in the existing systematic reviews is small and the effect size seems larger than would be anticipated. As a consequence a reliable multicentre trial is needed to provide definitive evidence that IVIG therapy for severe neonatal sepsis is or is not of benefit, with mortality or major morbidity as the outcome. IVIG is not yet widely used as routine therapy. There remains, therefore, a window of opportunity to perform such a trial before an intervention which has been inadequately assessed begins to be incorporated into routine practice.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Trial Eligibility</title><p>Hospitals will be eligible for entry if they can provide neonatal intensive or special care, can achieve satisfactory rates of follow up at two years and would be able to institute the routine use of adjuvant IVIG for babies with sepsis if the trial demonstrates evidence of benefit.</p><p>Babies are eligible if:</p><p>1.

The ORACLE study recruited over 11,000 infants in 161 centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Experience from that trial suggests that it is helpful if nurses and doctors understand the study background, see clinical research as an integral part of neonatal care contributing to future quality of care, and if a named nurse is appointed and trained as a local Trial Co-ordinator. If those caring for the baby are well informed about the study, they can discuss it without transmitting anxiety. Indeed, parents are likely to feel less anxious if given the opportunity to discuss the options for their baby's treatment in the context of the study with knowledgeable staff.</p><p>The named nursing and medical representative in each unit will therefore receive opportunities for training, regular information and support to enable them to orientate and update new and established nursing and medical staff. The protocol, printed materials and relevant new research will be widely available and staff will be kept informed by newsletters, personal visits and the study website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/INIS"/>.</p><p>Many babies receive antibiotics for sepsis during their stay in a neonatal unit. Some babies may be given antibiotics more for prophylaxis than for treatment of suspected sepsis. The threshold for considering entry into INIS must be that there is a clinical suspicion that this baby has sepsis. Once an infant is considered eligible, it is important that enrolment takes place as soon as practically possible.</p><p>All parents should routinely be given an information leaflet about INIS by the nursing staff when their baby is admitted to the neonatal unit. This will include details of their local medical and nursing contact with whom they can discuss the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. If their baby becomes eligible they will be asked for consent to participate in the study, and later follow up, by the most appropriate member of staff available, in person or by telephone. If they consent in person a copy of the signed consent form will be given to the parent(s). If telephone consent is considered necessary and appropriate by the recruiting clinician, a 'Telephone Consent' form will be completed. This form should then be read and signed by the parent(s) at their next visit to the hospital. Once this has happened, a copy of the consent form will be given to the parent(s).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment Allocation</title><p>The practical arrangements for random allocation to trial groups will be as simple as possible, based on that used in the ORACLE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].

The overall score for the modified PARCA will give a measure of verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities. The parents' questionnaire also includes questions about temperament, which may give an early indication of behavioural and attentional difficulties, and also includes questions about respiratory function, hearing, vision, hospital admissions, relevant diagnoses and current function in a number of domains, allowing categorisation of disability as major or non-major.</p><p>Experience of other trials in this area at the NPEU, Oxford and elsewhere, suggests that it is possible to determine early neonatal events for all babies recruited.

This is independent of the trial organisers and meets at least once per year. During the period of recruitment to the trial, interim analyses are supplied, in strict confidence, to the DMEC, together with any other analyses the DMEC may request. In the light of interim data, and other evidence from relevant studies (including updated overviews of the relevant randomised controlled trials), the DMEC will inform the Trial Steering Committee, if in their view: i) there is proof beyond reasonable doubt that the data indicate that any part of the protocol under investigation is either clearly indicated or contra-indicated, either for all infants or for a particular subgroup of trial participants, or ii) it is evident that no clear outcome will be obtained. Decision to inform the Trial Steering Committee in either of these circumstances will in part be based on statistical considerations.</p><p>Appropriate criteria for proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be specified precisely. A difference of at least 3 standard deviations in the interim analysis of a major endpoint may be needed to justify halting, or modifying, such a study prematurely.

This contrasts with the systematic reviews of RCTs of antibiotics in threatened preterm birth which led to the ORACLE study, as these showed no evidence of a difference in neonatal mortality. This preliminary evidence that IVIG may reduce mortality may further enhance the appeal of the study.</p><p>The estimate of the incidence of the outcome (the event rate) for the trial is imprecise, particularly as the threshold at which clinicians will enter patients cannot be estimated. If clinicians enter babies where the likelihood of serious sepsis is lower then the event rate will also be lower. If clinicians restrict entry to only those babies who are very sick, then the event rate will be high. Either of these two scenarios is reasonable because it will define a population to which the trial result can be generalised. However, it does mean that until the trial has recruited sufficient numbers of babies it will not be possible to determine the optimum trial sample size with any certainty. As a consequence the trial sample size currently represents the minimum size desirable. Assuming the trial recruits for three years, the maximum number of babies which can be recruited during this time will be recruited and it is possible that this number may exceed 5,000. During recruitment to the trial the accumulating data will be seen by an independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee at least once per year (see above) and they will advise the Trial Steering Committee whether the trial has answered the clinical question being addressed. If not, the trial will continue to recruit until 5,000 babies have been recruited, or until funding is exhausted.</p></sec><sec><title>Publication Policy</title><p>To safeguard the scientific integrity of the trial, data from this study should not be presented in public or submitted for publication without requesting consent from the Trial Steering Committee (see Organisation below). The success of the trial depends on the collaboration of a large number of doctors and nurses. For this reason, chief credit for the results will be given not to the committees or central organisers but to all who have collaborated in the study. Acknowledgement will include all members of the trial committees, the data co-ordinating centre, trial staff, and local co-ordinators at all collaborating centres. Authorship at the head of the paper will take the form; "The INIS Study Collaborative Group". This is the preferred option, as it avoids giving undue prominence to any individuals. All contributors to the study will be listed at the end of the report, with their contribution to the study identified.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Organisation</title><p>The protocol received Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (MREC) approval from the Anglia and Oxford MREC on 16 October 2000 (Reference number: 00/05/53).
