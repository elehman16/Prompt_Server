The key advantage of cryopreserving supernumerary embryos is to maximize the chance of a live birth from a single cycle of ovarian stimulation while limiting the risk of multiple birth. The increasing use of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) as a means of minimizing iatrogenic multiples in IVF has re-focused attention on embryo cryopreservation as a means of maintaining cumulative birth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C29">Tiitinen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C28">Thurin <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C34">Veleva <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C35">&#x000a0;2009</xref>). However, critical to the acceptance of eSET is the ability to access robust cryopreservation methods with reliably high rates of embryo survival and subsequent live birth.</p><p>Conventionally, embryos are considered to have survived freezing and thawing when at least 50% of blastomeres remain intact (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C20">Lassalle <italic>et al.,</italic> 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C22">Mohr <italic>et al.,</italic> 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C27">Testart <italic>et al.,</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C33">Van Steirteghem <italic>et al.,</italic> 1987</xref>). However, blastomere loss is associated with reduced developmental potential of the embryos <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C1">Archer <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>), and reduced rates of implantation and pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C31">Van den Abbeel <italic>et al.,</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C7">Burns <italic>et al.,</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C9">Edgar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C14">Guerif <italic>et al.,</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C11">El-Toukhy <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C23">Pal <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004</xref>) as well as reduced rates of live birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C31">Van den Abbeel <italic>et al.,</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C14">Guerif <italic>et al.,</italic> 2002</xref>). Retrospective analyses of large data sets suggest that frozen embryos surviving with all blastomeres intact have an implantation potential similar to that of fresh embryos at the same developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C9">Edgar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>). Typically, only about 50% of embryos survive freezing without loss of blastomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C21">Mandelbaum <italic>et al.,</italic> 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C9">Edgar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C1">Archer <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C18">Kattera and Chen<italic>,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C2">Balaban <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>). Thus, there is a clear and urgent need to improve methods of cryopreservation that increase the proportion of embryos surviving freezing with all blastomeres intact.</p><p>Pronucleate and cleavage stage embryos are frozen almost universally in a medium containing 1,2-propanediol (PrOH; &#x0223c;1.5 M) and sucrose (0.1 M), according to protocols based on the method developed 26 years ago for mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C25">Renard and Babinet, 1984</xref>) and modified for human embryos a year later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C20">Lassalle <italic>et al.,</italic> 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C20">Lassalle <italic>et al.</italic> (1985)</xref> froze embryos in solutions with or without 0.1 M sucrose, but had insufficient evidence to comment on the value of adding sucrose. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C26">Testart <italic>et al.</italic> (1986)</xref> froze embryos in medium with sucrose (0.1 M) and reported high pregnancy rates, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C21">Mandelbaum <italic>et al</italic>.

Raising the concentration of sucrose in the freezing medium 2- and 3-fold from 0.1 M increased oocyte survival from 31 to 60% and 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C12">Fabbri <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>). Similarly, the survival of biopsied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C17">Jericho <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C37">Zheng <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>) and non-biopsied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C10">Edgar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>) embryos was improved significantly after freezing in a medium containing 0.2 M sucrose.</p><p>The aim of this pragmatic RCT was to compare the survival of supernumerary pronucleate and cleavage stage embryos frozen in a solution of PrOH with either the conventional concentration (0.1 M) or an elevated concentration (0.3 M) of sucrose. The primary end-point was the proportion of couples with at least 50% of embryos fully intact after thawing. Cumulative live birth after the transfer of embryos in the oocyte collection cycle and in one or more thawing cycles was a secondary end-point.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants and study design</title><p>The study was a two arm, parallel group, pragmatic RCT. Couples were recruited from one major teaching hospital in the northeast of Scotland. All couples attending the Assisted Reproduction Unit (ARU), University of Aberdeen, for IVF or ICSI treatment between September 2003 and December 2006 were considered for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were (i) women with no supernumerary embryos for freezing in two previous treatment cycles, (ii) women &#x02265;38 years of age with one previous cycle without freezing, (iii) couples using donor gametes and (iv) couples recruited to any other ongoing clinical trial. The trial was approved by the Grampian Research Ethics Committee and the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority of the UK. Written informed consent was obtained from all couples who participated.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Stimulation, oocyte collection, fertilization and embryo culture</title><p>Standard protocols for ovarian stimulation in IVF were followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C3">Bhattacharya <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C15">Haggarty <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>). Follicles were aspirated transvaginally under ultrasound guidance at 36&#x02013;38 h post hCG injection. Oocyte&#x02013;cumulus complexes (OCCs) were handled on heated stages in medium (Medicult Universal Medium until May 2005, thereafter Cook's Fertilization Medium) warmed to 37&#x000b0;C. For IVF the OCCs were mixed with sperm 40&#x02013;41 h post hCG. For ICSI the cumulus cells were removed enzymatically and sperm injected at 40&#x02013;42 h post hCG.</p><p>Oocytes were examined for the presence of pronuclei and polar bodies 18&#x02013;20 h post insemination (p.i.). Normally fertilized eggs with two pronuclei and two polar bodies were either cultured under oil in 30 &#x000b5;l drops of medium (Medicult Universal Medium until May 2005, Cook's Cleavage Medium thereafter) at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 5&#x02013;6% CO<sub>2</sub> in air, or frozen immediately. The cultured embryos were examined microscopically &#x0223c;3 h before transfer on Day 2 or Day 3 p.i.; the final selection for transfer and freezing was made just before embryo transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Freezing and thawing</title><p>Freezing and thawing protocols were identical for embryos in the control (conventional concentration of sucrose) and intervention (increased concentration of sucrose) groups, but the freezing and thawing solutions differed. Medicult freezing solution no. 10264010 (1.5 M PrOH + 0.1 M sucrose) and thawing solution no 10984010 (0.2 M sucrose) were used for control embryos and freezing solution no. 10485010 (1.4 M PrOH + 0.3 M sucrose) and thawing solution no 10494010 (0.3 M sucrose) for intervention embryos.</p><p>Embryos were prepared for freezing at room temperature (&#x0223c;22&#x000b0;C). They were washed briefly (1&#x02013;2 min) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with human serum albumin (HSA) and synthetic serum replacement (PBS + HSA + SSR: control embryos) or PBS + HSA + alpha- and beta-globulins (PBS + HSA + G: intervention embryos), and then transferred into a similar buffer + PrOH for 12 min and finally into the freezing medium (buffer + PrOH + sucrose) for 5&#x02013;10 min before cooling. Embryos were frozen singly in sealed straws. Cooling commenced at 2&#x000b0;C per minute to &#x02212;7&#x000b0;C, the sample was seeded, and 10 min later cooling was resumed at 0.3&#x000b0;C per minute to &#x02212;30&#x000b0;C and then at 10&#x000b0;C per minute to &#x02212;150&#x000b0;C before the straws were transferred into liquid nitrogen for storage at &#x02212;196&#x000b0;C.</p><p>For thawing, the straw was held in air at room temperature for 40 s and then immersed in water at 25&#x000b0;C until the ice disappeared. Embryos were transferred sequentially at 5 min intervals at room temperature through aliquots of buffer containing sucrose (control: PBS + HSA + SSR + 0.2 M sucrose; intervention: PBS + HSA + G + 0.3 M sucrose) and decreasing concentrations of PrOH (control: 1.0 M, 0.5 M; intervention: 0.9 M, 0.4 M) and finally into buffer without sucrose. The morphology of the embryo was recorded and then it was cultured under oil in a 30 &#x000b5;l drop of medium (Medicult Universal or Cook's Cleavage Medium) at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 5&#x02013;6% CO<sub>2</sub> in air until transfer.</p><p>Embryos were frozen after the fresh embryo transfer on Day 2 or Day 3 p.i., except for couples in which the woman was at risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). In the latter cases, no embryos were transferred in the fresh cycle and instead, all embryos were frozen at the pronucleate stage on Day 1 and/or after cleavage on Day 2. Embryos were thawed on the day before the intended transfer and then cultured overnight (pronucleate and Day 2 embryos), or thawed and cultured for up to 6 h on the day of transfer (Day 2 and Day 3 embryos). Unless the couple wished otherwise, embryos were thawed until two survived for transfer with at least one being fully intact. When embryos failed to resume mitosis during overnight culture, additional embryos were thawed for immediate transfer. Embryos were transferred in either a natural or a stimulated cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Embryo scoring</title><p>Only those embryos with an appropriate number of evenly cleaved blastomeres for the day p.i. (2&#x02013;6 blastomeres on Day 2; 4&#x02013;8 + on Day 3) and &#x02264;25% of fragmented cytoplasm were considered suitable for freezing. As a measure of embryo quality at the time of freezing, we categorized the embryos as having the optimal number of cells for the day p.i. (4 cells on Day 2; 8 cells on Day 3), fewer cells than optimal (2&#x02013;3 cells on Day 2; 4&#x02013;7 cells on Day 3), or more cells than optimal. Embryos frozen on Day 1 had both pronuclei still visible. Thawed embryos were scored immediately after thawing and before transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomization and outcomes</title><p>Couples were randomized after embryos had been selected for fresh transfer and freezing. Consenting couples with at least two embryos for freezing were randomized to control or intervention by the embryologist performing cryopreservation, who opened sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. The allocation sequence was generated independently of the study team using simple randomization. Couples were told which treatment they had received only if they asked for the information. The embryologist freezing and thawing the embryos was aware of the treatment in order to select the correct solutions, but when circumstances allowed, a second embryologist scored post-thaw survival.</p><p>The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of couples with &#x02265;50% of embryos surviving freezing and thawing with all the blastomeres intact. The secondary outcomes included cumulative live birth, stillbirth, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Cumulative live birth per couple was defined as the birth of one or more live babies from the fresh and all frozen cycles arising from a single oocyte retrieval. Clinical pregnancies were identified by the presence of at least one gestational sac with a fetal heart beat at ultrasound scan 5 weeks after embryo transfer. The outcome of all thawing cycles up to November 2009 have been analysed, including the cycles in which embryos were thawed for transfer and also those in which the couple did not wish to have embryos transferred, but consented to have them thawed and their morphology assessed before they were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In order to detect a difference of 25% (i.e. 50&#x02013;75%) in the proportion of couples with at least 50% of their embryos fully intact after thawing with 90% power at 5% significance, 85 couples were required in each randomized arm.

The secondary outcome was cumulative live birth following a fresh and one or more frozen cycles, i.e. the proportion of couples randomized with at least one live birth. OHSS patients who did not have a transfer in the fresh cycle were included in the analysis. All couples randomized were included in the analysis following an intention to treat approach.

The present study suffered a slight loss of power because only 137 of the anticipated 170 couples had their embryos thawed. Nonetheless, the results presented provide the strongest evidence to date that the concentration of sucrose in the freezing medium is critical for blastomere survival. In future studies, a greater allowance should be made for the high proportion of couples who fail to return for embryo thawing.</p><p>Data from retrospective studies suggest that the transfer of embryos that survive freezing with all blastomeres intact increases the likelihood of live birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C31">Van den Abbeel <italic>et al.,</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C14">Guerif <italic>et al.,</italic> 2002</xref>). It was hypothesized that increasing the proportion of intervention couples with at least 50% of thawed embryos intact would result in higher cumulative live birth rates. Since the present study was not powered for the secondary outcome of cumulative live birth, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that one solution is superior to the other. However, the data suggest that the true effect of freezing embryos in a medium containing 0.3 M sucrose is unlikely to be greater than a 1.13-fold increase in the rate of live birth compared with control, while treatment using 0.3 M sucrose could potentially reduce the live birth rate considerably. So, while we must be cautious in our interpretation because of the small sample size, our results suggest that freezing embryos in a medium containing 0.3 M sucrose is unlikely to have any beneficial effect on clinical outcome and may in fact be detrimental when compared with our standard practice of freezing in a medium containing 0.1 M sucrose. A retrospective comparison of clinical data led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C6">Borini <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> to question the clinical efficiency of freezing human oocytes in solutions similar to those in the intervention arm of this study, despite a significant increase in oocyte survival and high rates of fertilization. Thus evidence is accumulating to suggest that it is unwise to rely on surrogate end-points, such as embryo survival, when assessing changes in cryopreservation strategy. Future cryopreservation studies should be adequately powered to detect clinically worthwhile differences in cumulative live birth.</p><p>It is possible that the live birth rate after frozen embryo transfer was influenced by the clinical strategy of thawing sufficient embryos to obtain the number required for transfer, with at least one embryo fully intact. In a pragmatic trial where the intention is to mirror normal clinical practice, it is inevitable that there will be conflict with sound experimental design. However, it seems unlikely that the outcome in this study was biased since the live birth rate after frozen transfer amongst control couples was almost double that of the intervention couples. The embryo selection policy would have been expected to minimize differences between the two groups.</p><p>Similarly, the excess of frozen embryo transfers in natural cycles in the control arm of the trial (57 versus 48%), could have potentially influenced the clinical outcome. Transfer in natural or stimulated cycles was carried out entirely according to clinical protocols and thus this disparity occurred purely by chance. To the best of our knowledge, there is no conclusive evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C13">Ghobara and Vanderkerchove, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C16">Hill <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>) to suggest that transfer in a natural cycle is more favourable than transfer in a stimulated cycle. The incidence of live birth after frozen embryo transfer in the control group was double that in the intervention arm (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DER147TB3">III</xref>) and thus, although this relatively small imbalance could either reduce or increase the difference between live birth rate in the two arms, it is very unlikely that it would result in the intervention treatment being superior to control.</p><p>The requirement to use commercially available freezing and thawing solutions made it impossible to change the concentration of sucrose in the freezing medium without introducing confounding factors. The slight reduction in PrOH concentration in the intervention group (from 1.5 to 1.4 M) plainly had no deleterious effect on embryo survival. The protein content of the two freezing media also differed, but&#x02014;since others have associated sucrose concentration with oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C12">Fabbri <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>) and embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C17">Jericho <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C37">Zheng <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C10">Edgar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>) survival&#x02014;it seems likely that the increased survival reported here in the intervention arm can be attributed to the elevated sucrose. The inclusion of similar concentrations of sucrose in both freezing and diluent solutions in the intervention arm may not be optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C17">Jericho <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C4">Bianchi <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C10">Edgar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>), but nonetheless embryo survival was plainly superior to that of controls.</p><p>Only 31% of the couples approached (201/652; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DER147F1">1</xref>), took part in the trial but it is unlikely that this introduced bias in our study population. Not unexpectedly, 40% of couples declined to take part in research that might directly affect the outcome of their treatment. Subsequently almost 50% (192/393) of those who gave informed consent were excluded, mainly because they did not meet the inclusion criterion of having at least two embryos suitable for freezing&#x02014;a proportion similar to that among all couples having treatment in the ARU. A potential weakness of the trial concerns the lower proportion of couples returning for frozen embryo transfer in the 0.3 M sucrose group. There is no reason to believe that the freezing solution influenced a couple's decision to return, especially because similar levels of live birth occurred in the fresh cycle and couples were blinded to treatment allocation unless they asked for the information. Although it is likely that this difference has occurred by chance, there is a small possibility that bias has been introduced. However, the difference in embryo survival is so striking that it is unlikely that any bias introduced by the differential return rate would change the overall result.</p><p>Recently many clinics have begun to vitrify embryos as an alternative to freezing, mainly because of the higher rates of survival obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C24">Rama Raju <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C2">Balaban <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>). However the clinical superiority of vitrification over freezing has not been demonstrated in RCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C19">Kolibianakis <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>). Vitrification has risks associated with the use of unsealed containers and the storage of ultra-small samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C5">Bielanski and Vajta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C36">Wood, 2011</xref>) and it is too early to be certain that it carries no risks for any children born. The low rates of embryo survival so often reported after freezing in solutions containing PrOH and 0.1 M sucrose are overcome by increasing the concentration of sucrose as demonstrated here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C17">Jericho <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C10">Edgar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>). Although we were unable to show an improvement in clinical outcome after transfer of embryos frozen in 0.3 M sucrose, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER147C10">Edgar <italic>et al</italic>. (2009)</xref> reported that freezing in a medium containing 0.2 M sucrose increased the rate of implantation per embryo thawed and thus the efficiency of the freezing programme. It is plain that the outcome of freezing can be improved and it would be prudent to retain an open mind as to the superiority of any cryopreservation approach until randomized controlled trials with live birth as a primary outcome are reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This trial shows that increasing the concentration of sucrose from 0.1 to 0.3 M in the freezing medium improves survival in early stage human embryos and significantly increases the likelihood of a couple having at least one fully intact frozen-thawed embryo for transfer. It provides no evidence that the increased embryo survival translates into increased cumulative birth rates for the couples and has highlighted the need for robust clinical outcomes in laboratory trials.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Authors&#x02019; roles</title><p>M.J.W. contributed to the conception and design of the trial and interpretation of the results, wrote the first draft of the article, and critically reviewed and approved the final version; J.M. analysed and interpreted the results, contributed to writing the article, and critically reviewed and approved the final version; K.H. was involved in initial statistical analysis and interpretation of data, critical review of the manuscript and approval of the final version.
