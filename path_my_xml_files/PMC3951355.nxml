Some distraction interventions are already used by healthcare professionals to help patients cope with unpleasant procedures. The present study is novel because it a) builds on evidence that natural scenery is beneficial for patients, and b) uses a Virtual Reality (VR) representation of nature to distract participants. Extending previous work that has investigated pain and anxiety during treatment, c) we also consider the longer term effects in terms of more positive memories of the treatment, building on a cognitive theory of memory (Elaborated Intrusions). Participants (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;69) took part in a simulated dental experience and were randomly assigned to one of three VR conditions (active vs. passive vs. control). In addition, participants were distinguished into high and low dentally anxious according to a median split resulting in a 3&#x000d7;2 between-subjects design. VR distraction in a simulated dental context affected memories a week later. The VR distraction had effects not only on concurrent experiences, such as perceived control, but longitudinally upon the vividness of memories after the dental experience had ended. Participants with higher dental anxiety (for whom the dental procedures were presumably more aversive) showed a greater reduction in memory vividness than lower dental-anxiety participants. This study thus suggests that VR distractions can be considered as a relevant intervention for cycles of care in which people&#x02019;s previous experiences affect their behaviour for future events.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study is supported by internal funding from Plymouth University.

Medical (e.g. analgesic) interventions to reduce pain during treatments are frequently used but can be expensive and may have their own side-effects. Simple, non-invasive alternatives, such as &#x0201c;distraction therapy&#x0201d; are therefore desirable. The use of virtual reality (VR) as a distraction tool is receiving growing attention in medical contexts.</p><p>Distraction is thought to help patients cope with pain and other aversive experiences and is often combined with relaxation or pleasant imagery <xref rid="pone.0091276-McCaul1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, although the psychological mechanisms underlying its effects are not well understood <xref rid="pone.0091276-Mahrer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. VR distraction during aversive experiences can improve coping with pain <xref rid="pone.0091276-Dahlquist1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, lower experienced level of itching for chronic puritis patients <xref rid="pone.0091276-Leibovici1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and reduce the perceived duration of procedures <xref rid="pone.0091276-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A recent systematic review of eleven studies looked at the effectiveness of virtual reality distraction on pain reduction <xref rid="pone.0091276-Malloy1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. They concluded that more sophisticated VR techniques, capable of completely immersing the individual were associated with greater pain relief. According to Gold and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0091276-Gold1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> VR provides a powerful means of modifying affect, because of its immersive nature.</p><p>Most previous work has considered the effects of VR distraction on pain and anxiety during treatment. Distraction may also have lasting effects in terms of more positive memories of the treatment, leading to a greater willingness to return for treatment. The aim of the current study was to study both immediate and more long-term effects of VR distraction in a simulated dental context. We chose a simulated rather than real treatment for ethical reasons, as we wanted to include participants high in dental anxiety, for whom a simulated treatment would be stressful already.</p><p>Dentistry has received relatively little attention from VR researchers, yet it is one of the most common healthcare encounters. Dental anxiety is very common <xref rid="pone.0091276-Oosterink1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and anxious patients are less likely to keep their appointments <xref rid="pone.0091276-Kleinknecht1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, take longer to treat and feel less satisfied with their treatment <xref rid="pone.0091276-Locker1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and make their dentists feel anxious too <xref rid="pone.0091276-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Armfield and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0091276-Armfield1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> described a vicious cycle of dental anxiety. This suggests that people with high dental fear delay dental treatment, which can lead to more extensive dental problems and symptomatic visiting patterns which in turn maintain or exacerbate existing dental fear. Memories and expectations thus play a crucial role in sustaining dental anxiety. Although we focus on dental treatment, experiences and expectancies are very important in determining future uptake of treatment in a range of medical contexts, e.g., unpleasant bowel examinations <xref rid="pone.0091276-Redelmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>VR distraction during dental treatment may improve the treatment experience and, by doing so, help break the cycle of negative experiences leading to negative memories and expectations about future treatment. The Elaborated Intrusion theory <xref rid="pone.0091276-Kavanagh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> argues that unconscious cognitive activity triggered by cues in the world, mind or body can lead to apparently spontaneous intrusive thoughts, and that salience of the intrusion can lead to the thought being elaborated, through the construction of mental imagery. Heightened emotion and arousal during a dental examination will increase the likelihood of recollections of the event being triggered uncontrollably by situational cues <xref rid="pone.0091276-Brewin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, as a whiff of antiseptic might trigger thoughts about dental treatment. Attempts at suppressing these intrusive thoughts tend to be counterproductive <xref rid="pone.0091276-Wegner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and once triggered, intrusive thoughts tend to be elaborated <xref rid="pone.0091276-Kavanagh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. For example, an intrusive thought about going to the dentist might lead to the patient imagining how uncomfortable the next visit is going to be and experiencing some of the negative sensations and emotions they associate with dental treatment. Interfering with the processing of negative stimuli during treatment, through VR distraction, would counteract the effects of heightened emotion and arousal and so reduce the likelihood of intrusive thoughts and negative elaborations following treatment. Additionally, it would be desirable to identify if VR distraction is a suitable technique for patients with all levels of dental anxiety or whether specific patients would be most likely to benefit. We therefore included level of dental anxiety as a moderating variable.</p><p>There have been a few studies of VR in a dental context. A case study showed that VR distraction is more effective in offering pain control than watching a video or a standard care situation without distraction <xref rid="pone.0091276-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. One study investigated the effects of using an A/V eyeglass system displaying an instructional video <xref rid="pone.0091276-Frere1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Adult patients scheduled for dental prophylaxis were distracted during half of their treatment. Patients reported less anxiety and discomfort when using the equipment. In another study, patients undergoing periodontal scaling and root planning procedures were presented with either a control situation (only wearing the headgear), a video (i.e. the animation movie Cars) and a VR environment (of a botanical garden in Second Life) <xref rid="pone.0091276-Furman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Both distracters, relative to the control condition, resulted in less pain and discomfort and lower blood pressure and pulse rate, but the VR environment was better on all indicators compared to the movie. This difference can possibly be explained by looking at the level of interactivity VR distraction offers compared to passively watching a video.</p><p>Dahlquist and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0091276-Dahlquist1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> tested the role of interactivity more directly, by assessing pain tolerance and pain threshold in children using the cold pressor task. In a within-subjects design, the children played a computer game, Finding Nemo, and watched a video of someone else playing the exact same computer game. Both types of distraction reduced pain threshold, but pain tolerance was almost twice as long during interactive distraction relative to passive distraction. The authors suggested that the interactive distraction involved two additional sensory attentional pathways and that the game required problem-solving, providing an active cognitive processing component.</p><p>The current study used a VR environment of a coastal nature area to distract participants during simulated dental treatment. This environment was chosen as previous research demonstrated the beneficial effects of nature <xref rid="pone.0091276-Beukeboom1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091276-Dijkstra1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, in particular coastal environments <xref rid="pone.0091276-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091276-Volker1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We investigated whether offering such distraction improved the dental experience both immediately and a week later. We also investigated active versus passive use of the same VR environment and the role of pre-existing dental anxiety. One of the concerns with VR distraction is that it might affect patient-clinician communication. Therefore we tested whether the VR interfered with this by recording compliance with the dentist&#x02019;s requests.</p><p>In terms of overall experience, first we hypothesized that providing VR distraction during simulated dental treatment would result in lower time perception compared to no VR distraction, based on previous research suggesting that the use of VR can affect time perception <xref rid="pone.0091276-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Second, in accordance with EI theory, we proposed that offering VR distraction results in less vivid memories and less intrusive thoughts a week later.</p><p>The second set of hypotheses focussed on the comparison of active and passive VR. We predicted that the active VR group would experience a higher level of control (manipulation check) and a higher level of presence. Third, we predicted that the effects for the overall experience both immediately and after a week would be stronger for the active VR group compared to the passive VR group.</p><p>The third set of hypotheses proposed that pre-existing dental anxiety would moderate these effects. We hypothesized that the effects for the dental experience, the VR experience, and the follow-up effects, would be more pronounced for participants higher in dental anxiety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Faculty of Science and Technology ethics review board, Plymouth University.

The passive group was a yoked control group; participants in this group watched a recording of the VR walk that the previous participant in the active condition generated. A total number of 22 walks were generated by the active participants and each of these walks was shown to a participant in the passive group. Taken together, both VR groups were thus shown the exact same content.

Although such a set-up allows for conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of VR distraction, it does not provide an answer to the question if it is the presence of the VR environment or the exclusion of the medical environment that accounts for the effect. In the current study we chose to include a black-screen control group to add this perspective and to be able to attribute the effects to the presence of a VR environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants completed an online dental anxiety questionnaire when they enrolled in the study, at least 24 hours prior to the experimental session.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Setting</title><p>A simulated dental waiting and treatment area was created, using cues usually present in those areas.

The VR distraction had effects not only on concurrent experiences, but also longitudinally upon the vividness of memories after the dental experience had ended. Participants higher in dental anxiety (for whom the procedures were presumably more aversive) showed a greater reduction in memory vividness than lower dental-anxiety participants. This is an important extension because it helps us understand the cognitive processes by which VR distraction can work.</p><p>Dental anxiety is associated with the tendency to experience negative or threatening thoughts concerning treatment <xref rid="pone.0091276-DeJongh1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and this may prevent patients arranging and attending dental appointments. Our findings suggest that VR distraction has the potential to influence people&#x02019;s memories of a potentially anxiety-inducing medical event. Our results are promising for real dental procedures in suggesting that VR distraction during dental treatment has the potential to interrupt the cycle of dental anxiety <xref rid="pone.0091276-Armfield1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, by blocking the development of vivid memories.</p><p>It is important to note that the current study took place in a simulated environment. We chose a simulated rather than real treatment for ethical reasons, as we wanted to include participants high in dental anxiety, for whom a simulated treatment would be stressful already. And whilst we do find differential effects for participants high and low in dental anxiety, there were no differences on the physiological measures between these two groups. This does mean that we are currently unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of VR distraction during real dental treatment. As with any experimental study, there always is the worry about demand characteristics. We do however find a moderating effect on dental anxiety, and do not think it likely that people with higher or lower dental anxiety would differ in their desire to comply with an experimenter. Next, we collected the measure of vividness of memories one week later. If demand characteristics really were at play in this study, we would expect a lot of participants to still remember all the details and what we would possibly want them to answer. Also, we would presume that demand characteristics would play a greater role in within-subject designs where participants are exposed to all conditions, while the current study employed a between-subjects design.</p><p>Frere and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0091276-Frere1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> suggest that the use of VR equipment will be particularly useful for long procedures or treatment of patients who have to have repeated procedures. In order to realize cost-effective VR distraction interventions, it would be desirable to identify those patients that will most benefit from this. Our findings suggest that anxious patients, rather than being resistant to distraction interventions, would be most likely to benefit from VR. Interestingly, participants with more dental anxiety were also more interested to use VR during real dental treatment than those with lower levels of dental anxiety, and especially participants with a higher level of dental anxiety felt more presence in the VR if they could actively control it than if they were passively watching a recording. These results are in line with the ideas about how anxiety influences attention <xref rid="pone.0091276-Derakshan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and suggest that VR distraction, or possibly any distraction intervention, could be particularly suitable for this high anxiety group. We recognise that no real-time recordings of anxiety were gathered during the simulated treatment, primarily to avoid the participant having to disengage with the immersive scenario, and thus we are unable to comment on the temporal patterns in anxiety during VR distraction. Future research could monitor how anxiety might be affected at different stages during treatment.</p><p>Previous research found that interactive VR was better than passive VR in children experiencing experimentally induced pain <xref rid="pone.0091276-Dahlquist1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091276-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our participants in the active group experienced a higher level of control and presence, and participants in the passive VR group were more compliant than active and control participants, yet active versus passive VR had no effects on immediate outcomes or a week later. More research is needed to decide whether this is because we used a calming natural environment that people simply walked around in (rather than an interactive game), or whether this was due to our simulated context or adult sample. Most research in the domain of VR distraction made use of existing video games as the distractor, e.g. <xref rid="pone.0091276-Dahlquist1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091276-Schneider2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, or games developed for the purpose of using it as a VR distractor <xref rid="pone.0091276-Hoffman2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091276-Schmitt1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Both types of games have proven to be effective distractors, but it is unclear whether gaming elements, such as providing a goal, are required for a VR distraction intervention to be effective.</p><p>A variety of other imagery and stimuli has been used to distract patients in previous research including natural contexts such as forests <xref rid="pone.0091276-Mhlberger1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and a botanical garden <xref rid="pone.0091276-Furman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Research on restorative environments suggests that certain environments are capable of relaxing people, especially natural environments <xref rid="pone.0091276-Hartig1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Hence we would call for more research that addresses the content of VR interventions to help us understand which specific elements are successful.</p><p>The cognitive effects were measured at one-week follow-up, following the Elaborated Intrusions paradigm. One might argue that a one-week follow up assessment of memories does not reflect the amount of time that is usually present between dental appointments. While it is not the most common situation, a variety of treatments do require patients to return a week later for the next part of their treatment, for example when crowns or dentures are needed. Also, the current study only offered a first test of this elaborated intrusions account, so it did seem prudent to test the effect at one week follow-up first before investing in studies with a more longitudinal character. Arguably, the week immediately following such an experience is crucial for consolidating and processing any relevant memories.</p><p>One of the claims that is often made for the usage of VR as a distraction technique is that wearing a HMD effectively excludes the surrounding medical environment. For example, the appearance of the nurse who cleans patient&#x02019;s wounds may be a strong enough cue to create anxiety <xref rid="pone.0091276-Hoffman2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The overhead light and the dental instruments may induce anxiety in a similar way even in a simulated context. In the current study we chose to include a black-screen control group to add this perspective and to be able to attribute the effects to the presence of a VR environment. However, further research is needed to decide if it is the presence of the VR environment or the exclusion of the medical environment that accounts for the effect.</p><p>Taken together, the current study provides evidence that a VR distraction intervention can not only impact the experience of a simulated aversive event, it can also reduce the vividness of memories of such an event a week later. This study thus suggests that VR distractions can be considered as a relevant intervention for cycles of care in which people&#x02019;s previous experiences affect their behaviour for future events. If a dental patient for example has a more positive experience of a treatment due to the VR distraction intervention, that patient might have less vivid memories and as a consequence might be less likely to postpone a future dental visit.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Kimberley Schenke for her assistance in data collection and Prof. R.J.
