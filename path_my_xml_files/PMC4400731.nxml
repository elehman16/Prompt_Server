suturing following childbirth. For those women whose perineal wound dehisces, the
management will vary according to individual practitioner's preferences.
For most women, the wound will be managed expectantly (healing by secondary
intention), whereas others may be offered resuturing. However, there is limited
scientific evidence and no clear guidelines to inform best practice. PREVIEW is a
two-part study aiming to identify the best management strategy for dehisced
perineal wounds, in terms of clinical effectiveness and women's
preferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The main part of this study is a pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial
designed to provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of resuturing versus
expectant management for dehisced perineal wounds following childbirth and to feed
into the design and feasibility of a larger definitive trial. 144 participants
will be randomly allocated to either intervention. The primary outcome is the
proportion of women with a healed perineal wound at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks from
the trial entry. Secondary outcomes include perineal pain, breast feeding rates,
dyspareunia and women's satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the
wound healing at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post randomisation. Information
will be collected using validated questionnaires. The second part of this study
will be to conduct semistructured interviews with 12 study participants, aiming to
capture information relating to their physical and psychological experiences
following perineal wound dehiscence, assess the acceptability of the research plan
and ensure that all outcomes relevant to women are included in the definitive
trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination</title><p>The results of this study will inform a definitive randomised controlled trial
that will provide conclusive evidence of what is the best management of perineal
wound dehiscence. This will potentially lead to significant improvements in
perineal care and will help to reduce the short- and long-term morbidity
experienced by women.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trials registration</title><p>PREVIEW is registered with the International Standard Research for Clinical Trials

more than 350&#x02008;000 women in the UK per year needing stitches to facilitate healing
of a spontaneous tear or episiotomy.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Given that
the postpartum management of perineal trauma including the prevention of wound infection
and assessing wound healing are core components of routine maternity care,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> there is limited research evidence available on
the management and consequences of wound dehiscence. Furthermore, the available evidence
is based on retrospective audit or case reviews and tends to include small numbers of
participants hence is subject to bias. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of
women reporting perineal infections and dehiscence in the community is increasing;
however, systems to track these complications following hospital discharge are lacking.
It is vital that a true estimate of the problem is established using standardised
definitions of wound infection and at the same time determine best practice when
treating dehisced perineal wounds. It is apparent that perineal wound dehiscence both
locally and worldwide has not been a high priority either in practice or in research,
and therefore, management is not based on robust evidence. Due to the lack of
evidence-based guidelines, clinical practice varies widely between individual
practitioners and institutions.</p><p>Perineal wound dehiscence, which is commonly reported to be associated with
infection,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> may lead to major physical, psychological and
social problems if left untreated. Although maternal mortality associated with perineal
trauma is extremely rare in developed countries, an infected perineal wound is a
potential route for systemic infection whereby sepsis and septic shock may ensue.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Indeed sepsis has for the first time been
identified as the leading cause of maternal mortality in the UK. The Centre for Maternal
and Child Enquiries recently published their eighth Report on Confidential Enquiries
into Maternal Deaths.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The report revealed that
during the 2006&#x02013;2008 triennium, sepsis resulted in 26 direct maternal deaths with
three further deaths classified as &#x02018;Late Direct Deaths&#x02019; (occurring more
than 6&#x02005;weeks after delivery). Seven women died of sepsis following a vaginal
delivery, including one woman with an infected perineum following a second-degree tear.
The report clearly illustrates how healthy women with an uncomplicated pregnancy and
delivery can become critically ill and die in a very short time.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>Moreover, morbidity associated with perineal wound dehiscence can and does pose a
serious threat to the general well-being and quality of life of the new mother. Maternal
morbidity centres around persistent pain and discomfort at the perineal wound site,
urinary retention, defecation problems, dyspareunia and psychological and psychosexual
issues from embarrassment and altered body image.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, the relationship with her newborn
baby may become affected, and she may find difficulty in breast feeding due to the
distress caused by her perineal problems.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>Perineal wound infection and dehiscence is a burden on NHS resources, as quite often
women who suffer this consequence of childbirth, have to undergo corrective surgery,
perineal refashioning and excision of excessive scar tissue or other procedures
associated with the management of perineal dysfunction.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p><p>Members of our collaborative team conducted double iteration Delphi surveys in the UK
and Brazil to identify childbirth-related perineal trauma outcomes deemed to be
important by women.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These surveys consistently
demonstrated that the highest ranked outcome was fear of perineal wound infection and
delay in wound healing. Indeed, an outcome that appears to be prioritised by women
across different backgrounds and cultures.</p><sec><title>Rationale for PREVIEW</title><p>This study addresses an area of clinical research that has been extremely neglected
and has the potential of making a significant impact on women's health and
well-being. For those who suffer from dehisced perineal wounds, it can take up to
16&#x02005;weeks to heal if treated expectantly and can leave the new mother feeling
very traumatised. Some of these women may even request that the mode of delivery for
subsequent pregnancies will be via caesarean section to avoid further perineal
damage.</p><p>Currently, lack of established professionally agreed standards leave clinicians in
equipoise as to what is the best management for dehisced perineal wounds following
childbirth, hence supporting the need for a clinical trial to answer this question.
As both a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) and a feasibility study, this
research will test out many of the procedures that will be used to inform the design
of a definitive trial. Although this is a pilot trial, the sample size is reasonably
high (n=144), and in the absence of definitive trials, will contribute to the
development of evidence-based best practice guidelines by policymakers, clinicians,
patients and the public to develop, and to systematic reviews.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>PREVIEW is a pilot and feasibility RCT comparing resuturing versus expectant
management for the treatment of dehisced perineal wounds following childbirth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>PREVIEW flowchart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001458fig1"/></fig><p>The study will provide researchers with a unique opportunity to identify and prepare
for the challenges and uncertainties of evaluating the clinical interventions within
a larger RCT. Conducting this study will assess the acceptability of the study
interventions to women, test the study protocol and facilitate a formal sample size
calculation for the definitive study. Ultimately, it will enhance the scientific
rigour and value of the full-scale study.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The pilot and feasibility RCT will be conducted in several maternity centres in the
UK in order to assess likely recruitment rates and acceptability across different
sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population, eligibility criteria</title><p>Women, who had a primary repair of a second-degree perineal tear or episiotomy,
identified with a dehisced wound within 2&#x02005;weeks following childbirth, in any
of the recruiting sites.</p><p>For the purpose of the study, wound dehiscence is defined as separation of both the
skin and muscle layers.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>No valid written consent to participate in the study</p></list-item><list-item><p>poor pregnancy outcome (women experiencing a pregnancy loss in current

their community midwife, hospital midwife or obstetrician and they will be allowed
time to ensure that they understand the information and clarify any queries they
have. Women who subsequently do not wish to participate in the PREVIEW study will be
managed in accordance with local hospital guidelines. Women will be enrolled into the
study by a midwife or doctor who is fully aware of Good Clinical Practice guidance. A
valid written consent will be obtained from women who wish to participate. The
PREVIEW Study integrated web- or telephone-based randomisation, and its treatment
allocation service was developed by the Bristol Randomisation Trials Collaboration.
The allocation ratio will be 1:1, and randomisation will be in blocks, stratified by
study centre. The study participants will be assigned to either resuturing of the
dehisced perineal wound preferably within 48&#x02005;h of randomisation or expectant
management (allowing the wound to heal by secondary intention). With the
woman's agreement, a letter will be sent to her general practitioner
confirming trial entry.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Secondary resuturing is being compared with expectancy (healing by secondary
intention). Both interventions will be undertaken following trial standardised
procedures (not submitted but available from the trial team).</p><p>To ensure the standardisation of secondary resuturing, the trial team have provided
recommendations for both the methods and materials to be used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>). These recommendations are based on clinical expertise
and knowledge and will be continually reviewed if new evidence becomes available.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Methods and materials for resuturing</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Methods</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standard surgical procedures for secondary suturing should be followed,

assessors, care providers or participants themselves. Assessment of perineal wounds
following treatment allocation, at the agreed time periods, will be undertaken by
independent practitioners (ie, not part of the research team); however, it will not
be possible to blind participating women, operators and assessors due to the nature
of the intervention. Women allocated to the control arm will receive expectant
management (current standard intervention), with no additional concomitant care or
interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Standardised PREVIEW questionnaires are based on those used and tested by members of
the research team in other childbirth-related perineal trauma studies.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Participating women for the RCT will be
reviewed at 2 and 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks. The independent assessor will complete a
perineal assessment questionnaire at each visit. For the secondary outcomes, all
participating women in the RCT will be asked to complete a prepaid postal
questionnaire at 6&#x02005;weeks, 3 and 6&#x02005;months following trial entry,
respectively.</p><p>Data will be scanned into a bespoke database by the Market Research Group at
Bournemouth University. By anonymising records and changing treatment allocation to a
numeric code, the completed database will be supplied to the research team for
analysis, carried out under the supervision of the trial statistician. In this way,
analysis will be blinded.</p><p>In addition to the pilot RCT, a sample of women (n=12) who are participating
in the RCT will be selected to represent age, parity, ethnicity and intervention.
Indepth semistructured interviews will be conducted with written consent to capture
information relating to their physical and psychological experiences following
perineal wound dehiscence at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks following birth. The interviews
will be taped, with permission, and transcribed.</p></sec><sec><title>Study outcome measures</title><sec><title>Primary outcomes</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Proportion of women with a healed wound at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks following

withdrawn. A record of the number of withdrawals will be kept and if applicable their
reason for withdrawal.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical issues</title><sec><title>Sample size for the RCT</title><p>The current literature does not support a robust formal sample size calculation
for the primary outcome of interest. One of the purposes of this pilot study is to
collect data to inform a sample size calculation for a full-scale RCT. Three
aspects of informing this calculation are to estimate (1) the recruitment rate,
(2) attrition rate and (3) the proportion of women whose wound had healed at
6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks (the primary outcome). Hence, in estimating the sample
size of this pilot study, we attempted to ensure a sufficient degree of precision
of these estimates (precision defined as twice the SE).</p><p>A retrospective study at the host research site has identified that there were 117
women referred to the perineal care clinic with a dehisced perineal wound during a
4-year period (30 women/year). Hence, we estimate that there will be around 45
eligible women for recruitment per participating centre. Assuming that 45 women
will be eligible per centre, with a take up rate of 80% and an attrition rate of
20% in four participating centres, we expect to recruit 144 women and 116 (58 in
each arm) of these to complete the pilot study. This would allow for the
recruitment rate in each site to be estimated with precision of &#x000b1;12% (based
on n=45), and overall recruitment rate to be estimated with precision
&#x000b1;6% (based on n=180). Loss to follow-up would be estimated with
precision &#x000b1;7% (based on n=144), and healing at
6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks (assumed to be around 50% from the retrospective study
mentioned above) would be estimated to &#x000b1;13% in each trial arm (based on
n=58 per arm). Although the sample size is quite large for a pilot study,
we feel that this is necessary in order for recruitment to start bedding down in
each of multiple sites.</p><p>Estimating effect size is not a specific aim of this pilot, but nevertheless, it
is still worth considering precision and power issues given the sample size of
116. Assuming that healing in the secondary intention group will be 50% at
6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks and that realistic percentages in the secondary resuturing
group will be between 10% and 90%, the effect size for the primary outcome will be
estimated with a precision of between &#x000b1;15% and &#x000b1;18%. This will be
fed into deliberations regarding plausible effect sizes to be used for future
sample size calculations. It is worth noting that with this sample size, the study
will have 90% power to detect an increase in healing from 50% to 80% (assuming a
5% two-sided significance level).</p><p>As the definitive trial is likely to require many centres in order to meet sample
size requirements, we may use this pilot to identify additional sites and also
test out study procedures in those sites. Thus, the actual sample size might be
larger than described here.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis for the RCT</title><p>Recruitment and attrition rates (overall and at each site) and proportion with
healed wound at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks will be calculated, and precision of these
estimates expressed using 95% CIs. A series of sample size calculations for a
definitive RCT will be performed incorporating these interval estimates.</p><p>A statistical analysis plan for a full-scale RCT will be developed from and tested
upon the data from this pilot study. We will test out the practicalities of
ensuring that the person analysing the data is blinded to group allocation.</p><p>Primary analysis will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis to limit the
possibility of bias associated with women not receiving the intervention they were
allocated. Strategies will be developed to ensure that data on primary outcome are
as complete as possible (eg, reminder letters and phone calls).</p><p>Comparisons will be made between the interventions (secondary repair vs expectant
management). Baseline characteristics of the comparative groups will be summarised
using standard descriptive statistics. The primary outcome is the proportion of
wounds healed at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks; this will be compared between the two
groups using a logistic regression model that incorporates study site as a
variable (since randomisation was stratified by site). Precision of estimates of
effect size (ORs) will be summarised using 95% CIs. The analysis plan for other
outcomes will also be developed taking into account the type and distribution of
data (eg, logistic regression, multiple regression). If the amount of missing data
seems problematic (eg, over 20%), we will assess the robustness of the results by
data imputation in tandem with best- and worst-case sensitivity analyses. In
addition to looking at each time point separately, we will also test a repeated
measures approach to analysis to try and gain insight to whether effect sizes are
changing over the course of follow-up (ie, looking at the interaction between
intervention group and time). It is anticipated that this will be implemented
using a multilevel (mixed) model for binomial or continuous responses as
appropriate.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These models have the
added advantage that they permit analysis of unbalanced repeated measures data,
thus avoiding exclusion of participants with incomplete data. No additional a
priori adjustment of covariates or subgroup analysis will be performed; these
issues will be explored further in supplementary analysis as part of the
development of the statistical analysis plan for the larger trial. No interim
analyses are planned.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p>Thematic analysis will be conducted using appropriate software such as N-Vivo. A
sample of transcripts will be coded and analysed independently by two researchers
and the emerging themes discussed to ensure reliability. While providing the
researchers with an opportunity to research women's subjective experiences,
the interviews will also offer valuable qualitative insight to aid understanding
of the findings generated from the RCT.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Additionally, this phase will provide a
window of opportunity to view women's unique experiences of an aspect of
childbirth, which would otherwise not be known and can facilitate improvement in
practice.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>In relation to the pilot RCT, capturing qualitative data on women's views
of the impact of perineal wound infection on their well-being, will help to ensure
that the definitive trial captures outcome areas that are relevant to women
themselves. Likewise, it may help us to understand any barriers to participation
before embarking on a full-scale evaluation.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

comparative data. The DMEC will consist of a minimum of three members and will
include a statistician and a clinician with expertise in the field of perineal care.
The role of the DMEC will be to monitor trial data and make recommendations to the
TSC on whether there are any safety reasons why the trial should not continue,
including monitoring evidence for treatment harm, for example, serious adverse events
(SAE).</p><p>The safety, rights and well-being of the trial participants are paramount. The DMEC
will consider whether any interim analysis is necessary, will consider data from any
analysis and considers requests for its release and will then advise the TSC.</p><p>A standardised operating procedure for the DMEC has been developed specifically for
the PREVIEW Study based on MRC guidance, the template produced by the DAMOCLES Study
Group and the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline, for Good Clinical Practice.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref>
</p><p>In accordance with NIHR Good Clinical Practice,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> safety reporting guidance for a non-clinical trial of an
investigational medicinal product including SAE has been made available for all
recruiting sites. The guidance includes definitions of SAE; who the SAE should be
reported to, when and how to report the SAE and what information will be need for the
Research Ethics Committee, a copy of the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) SAE
reporting form is also provided. Data regarding adverse events, other unintended
effects of the trial interventions or protocol violations will be conveyed to the
DMEC as and when necessary.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This pilot RCT addresses an area of clinical research that has been extremely neglected
and has the potential of making a significant impact on women's health and
well-being. The evidence gained from the study will inform a definitive RCT that will
provide robust evidence of what is the best management of perineal wound dehiscence and
hence be used by policymakers, clinicians, patients and the public to develop
evidence-based best practice guidelines. This will potentially lead to significant
improvements in perineal care and will help to reduce the short- and long-term morbidity
experienced by women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Roger Beech, Reader in Health Services Research/Director, Keele University

Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The sponsor organisation will guarantee that there are
appropriate arrangements in place: to initiate, manage and monitor the research; to
finance the study and to report the outcomes of the research. The Chief Investigator
(CI) and the trial steering committee have a contractual obligation to inform both
the NIHR and RIA of any publications, which result from the research study. This
relates to all publications generated from the research, including the scientific and
lay press, abstracts and conference proceedings. The award holders also have a
contractual obligation to submit an end of project report to the NIHR and RIA
outlining the outcomes of PREVIEW. The report will detail a comprehensive overview of
the work undertaken, summarise the research findings, any variation to the work
outlined in the proposal or the research team and describe the next steps to patient
benefit and the dissemination strategy. Additionally, the Research Investigators
under the conditions of NHS Participant Identification Centre Agreements have a
