A single dose, cross-over bioequivalence study was performed with two different formulations of venlafaxine 150 mg extended-release capsules in which the contents of capsule were mixed with applesauce and administered to healthy subjects under fed condition. A total of 24 healthy adult male subjects participated in this randomized, single-dose, non-blinded, two-way crossover study conducted at a single centre and 23 subjects completed the study as per the study protocol. After an overnight fast of 10 h, a high-fat and high-calorie breakfast was served 30 min before dosing. The subjects then received a single dose of either formulation administered with apple sauce followed by 240 ml of water as per randomized schedule in each period separated by a washout period of 7 days. A series of blood samples were collected upto 72 h for estimation of venlafaxine and its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine. The quantification of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine was done by LC-MS/MS method and pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis by WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 5.2 and SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9.1.3. The results of the study demonstrated bioequivalence of two formulations as the 90% confidence interval for the intra-individual mean ratio of log-transformed C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> of the test to the reference formulation were found within the defined bioequivalence range of 80.00%-125.00%. Both the formulations were well tolerated. This alternative mode of administration may provide benefits to patients who have difficulty in swallowing the capsule as a whole.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Applesauce</kwd><kwd>area under curve</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>confidence interval</kwd><kwd>maximum plasma concentration</kwd><kwd>venlafaxine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Venlafaxine, a bicyclic phenylethylamine derivative was first introduced in 1993 and its extended-release formulation was approved in 1997, by US FDA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]. Venlafaxine and its active metabolite, O-demethylvenlafaxine (ODV) have unique pharmacological effect, which has a dual mechanism of action, a potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine at central nervous system nerve terminals and lacks significant affinity for muscarinic cholinergic, adrenergic and histaminergic receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>].</p><p>Venlafaxine is indicated in the treatment of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia) and panic disorder. The safety and efficacy of venlafaxine and ODV for the treatment of depression and anxiety have been well established in published clinical trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>].</p><p>After oral administration, at least 92% of a single dose of venlafaxine is absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of venlafaxine is 45%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]. Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and ODV in plasma are attained within 3 days of oral multiple dose therapy. Venlafaxine and ODV exhibited linear kinetics over the dose range of 75 to 450 mg/ day. Venlafaxine is extensively metabolized in the liver to active metabolite ODV and also to other metabolites. Metabolism of venlafaxine occurs primarily via O-demethylation, which is mediated by CYP2D6 (cytochrome P-450 isozyme), and, to a lesser extent, by N-demethylation, which is mediated by CYP3A4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]. When equal daily doses of venlafaxine were administered as either an immediate release tablet or the extended-release capsule, the exposure to both venlafaxine and ODV was similar for the two treatments, and the fluctuation in plasma concentrations was slightly lower with the venlafaxine extended-release (ER) capsule. Venlafaxine extended-release, therefore, provides a slower rate of absorption, but the same extent of absorption compared with the immediate release tablet. Food did not affect the bioavailability of venlafaxine or its active metabolite, ODV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. Time of administration (AM vs. PM) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine and ODV from the 75 mg venlafaxine extended-release capsule[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. The T<sub>max</sub> with venlafaxine extended-release capsule is achieved at 5.5 h for venlafaxine and 9.0 h for ODV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]. Renal elimination of venlafaxine and its metabolites is the primary route of excretion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] with about 5% of an administered dose excreted in the urine as unchanged drug[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]. The steady-state half-lives of venlafaxine and ODV are approximately 5 h and 11 h, respectively[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>].</p><p>Venlafaxine ER capsules are to be administered orally swallowing the capsule as a whole without crushing, dividing or chewing with food. Alternatively, for patients who have difficulty swallowing the capsule as a whole, the capsule may be opened and the entire contents be sprinkled on a spoonful of applesauce, swallowed immediately without chewing followed by a glass of water to ensure complete swallowing of the pellets.</p><p>This study was designed to assess bioavailability between test and reference formulation when the contents of venlafaxine 150 mg ER capsules were sprinkled over applesauce and administered to healthy subjects. Since administration of venlafaxine after a meal can decrease the nausea associated with this drug[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] , this study was carried out under fed condition as recommended by the Office of Generic Drugs (OGD)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>], USA.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects:</title><p>The present bioequivalence study was conducted in 24 healthy adult male subjects aged between 18-45 years (both inclusive) with body mass index (BMI) of 18-27 (both inclusive) kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

None of the volunteers had history of an allergy to any component of the medication. All the participated subjects gave informed written consent prior to commencement of the study. Subjects did not receive any medication during two weeks period prior to the start of the study. The subjects were instructed during screening not to take any prescription and OTC medications subsequently until the completion of the study. All the subjects abstained from any xanthine-containing food or beverages or alcoholic products for 48 h prior to dosing and throughout the sampling schedule during each period.

The test product was venlafaxine hydrochloride 150 mg ER capsule of Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India which was compared with Effexor XR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (containing venlafaxine 150 mg) of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, USA (reference product). All subjects fasted for 10 h before breakfast and 4 h after study drug administration. A high-calorie, high-fat breakfast (approximately 949 kcal) was served to each subject 30 min before dosing. The test and reference capsules were administered as per SAS generated randomization schedule in each period. A wash out period of 7 days was kept between the two dosing to avoid any carry over effect. A series of blood samples were collected upto 72.0 h for estimation of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC for both venlafaxine and its active metabolite ODV. However, bioequivalence was proved based on the data of primary analyte venlafaxine as specified in the protocol.</p><p>To minimize bias in the study, the following precautions were taken during study execution: a) the treatments were given as per randomization schedule, b) volunteer number was assigned on first come first basis after fulfilling the study requirements, c) a cross over design was chosen in which each volunteer received both the treatments, d) analysts were blinded to the randomization code of the subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Inclusion criteria for subjects:</title><p>Subjects who met all of the following criteria were included in the study: (1) Sex: male (2) Age: 18-45 years.

Alternatively, it may be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the entire contents on a spoonful of applesauce[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]. To provide such similar method of administration for test formulation, it is necessary to show both test and reference formulations are bioequivalent when administered with applesauce.</p><p>Although several studies have been published about venlafaxine pharmacokinetics, none of the published studies focused on the proof of bioequivalence between two products under similar administration method.</p><p>This present research work was planned and conducted as a non-blinded, randomized, single dose two-period, two-treatment, crossover bioequivalence study under fed conditions in healthy male subjects. Only male volunteers were enrolled to have a homogeneous population group. Prior consent was obtained from all subjects who participated in the study.</p><p>A total of 24 subjects were enrolled in the study out of which 23 subjects completed the study as per protocol. One volunteer was medically withdrawn from the study due to adverse event. Blood sampling was done up to 72.0 h after dosing which was adequate for profiling of pharmacokinetic parameters as evident from AUC. Wash out period of seven days between the two periods was sufficient for this study since there was no carryover effect observed in any subject. Plasma concentrations of venlafaxine and ODV were determined by a validated LC-MS/MS method in accordance with GLP requirements. As per regulatory requirement, only venlafaxine was taken for bioequivalence assessment.</p><p>The mean&#x000b1;SD values of C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> for test and reference formulations were comparable. The T<sub>max</sub> were compared for test and reference using non-parametric-Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for venlafaxine.

The results of the present study clearly revealed that the two formulations are comparable with respect to the rate and extent of absorption when the capsule contents are administered by sprinkling over applesauce in healthy subjects under fed condition according to USFDA requirement. Further, both the formulations were well tolerated on single dose administration.</p><p>Since the generic formulation (test) of Torrent is bioequivalent with the innovator formulation (Effexor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 150 mg, reference) of Wyeth pharmaceuticals, USA, when administered with applesauce. Hence both the formulations can be interchanged without compromising therapeutic efficacy and safety. This alternative mode of administration will help to those populations who can not swallow the capsule as a whole.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was conducted at Torrent Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Jain, <italic>et al</italic>.: Bioequivalence of Two Brands of Venlafaxine Formulation</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2012 Apr 15</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
