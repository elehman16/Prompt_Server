group therapy consisting of cooking and physical activities for elderly people with mild
dementia on their cognitive and physical function, as well as on their psychological
symptoms. [Subjects] The subjects of this study were 12 older adults with mild dementia (3
males, 9 females; 76.75 &#x000b1; 3.61&#x02005;years) who voluntarily consented to participate in the
study. [Methods] In total, 12 subjects received experience-based group therapy for 2 hours
per session once per week, totaling 10 sessions. Cognitive function was evaluated using
the Mini Mental State Examination-Korean (MMSE-K), and physical function was evaluated
using the Geriatric Physical health condition measurement Tool (GPT). The Geriatric
Depression Scale Korean Version (GDS-K) and Geriatric Quality of Life-Dementia (GQOL-D)
were used to measure psychological symptoms. [Results] There were significant differences
between the MMSE-K, GPT, GDS-K, and GQOL-D scores of before and after group therapy.
[Conclusion] In conclusion, it is regarded that cognitive function, physical function, and
psychological health improved through experience-based group therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Dementia</kwd><kwd>Elderly people</kwd><kwd>Experience-based group therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Dementia is a chronic and degenerative disease. Thus, increased rates of dementia are a
problem for the aging population around the world. Dementia is exhibited through cognitive
disorders, mood changes, and behavioral problems. Moreover, persons with dementia lose the
ability to perform independent functions in daily life and have difficulty participating in
social activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The signs and symptoms of mild dementia may appear as mild problems with memory and less
initiative; difficulty with attention and comprehension; depression; and mild to moderate
impairment in Activities of Daily Living (ADL)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical performance abilities are significantly associated with
quality of life in mild and moderate dementia<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, depression can lead to adverse health outcomes, such as
weakening from physical inactivity, functional decline, and decreased quality of life<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, depression is the greatest risk
factor for increasing cognitive dysfunction in persons with mild dementia<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cooking is a familiar activity for elderly people through past experience&#x02014;selecting
different cooking materials, tasting dishes, and cleaning&#x02014;and it is an integrated process in
the cognitive, physical, socio-emotional areas<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study that conducted cooking activities with subjects with
dementia for 12 sessions reported statistically significant improvements in cognition and
depression as measured by the MMSE-K and GDS<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise is useful for improving the cardiovascular and motor
functions of normal older adult populations<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, physical exercise can be specifically helpful for
enhancing the independent recovery of cognitive and behavioral functions of patients with
dementia<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous research on group therapy has shown that cognitive therapy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and
horticultural therapy<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> improved the
cognitive function of elderly people with dementia, music therapy increased the cognitive
function of elderly people with dementia and decreased their depressive symptoms<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and art therapy had statistically significant effects on the quality
of life of mild Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease patients, but it did not have a significant effect on
their cognitive function<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The research
results are inconsistent. In addition, elderly people with dementia find it difficult to
learn something new due to cognitive function disorder, as well as to concentrate on one
thing for a long time because their feelings and behaviors change rapidly and frequently.
Therefore, recollecting what is familiar and what has already been learned may prevent
memory damage and have a positive influence on emotional aspects<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. When elderly people with dementia recollect what they
learned in the past rather than performing a new intervention method, their stress from
learning is lower and they have no burden in performing the task, and may feel pleasure.
Therefore, a positive effect can be expected<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this study investigated the effects of group therapy
consisting of cooking and physical activities for elderly people with mild dementia on their
cognitive and physical function, as well as on their psychological symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 12 older adults (3 males, 9 females; 76.75 &#x000b1; 3.61&#x02005;years)
who were patients with mild dementia. The number of those with a lack of schooling was nine
(75%), and the number of those who lived alone was eight (67%). Subjects were capable of
independent gait, independent living, and communicating at a level where they could
participate in a survey and understand the purpose of this study. This study conformed to
the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the Ethics
Review Committee and the approval number is SMU-2014-09-002. The place of experiment was a
cognitive activity room in the Y community health center.</p><p>Cognitive performance was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE; score,
0&#x02013;30), which has been used worldwide to examine the severity of cognitive performance. The
Mini Mental State Examination-Korean (MMSE-K), as presented by Gwon and Park<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, is a translation of the MMSE into Korean,
and it can evaluate diverse areas of cognitive functions within the short time period of 5
to 10 minutes. To evaluate the physical function of the subjects, the Geriatric Physical
health condition measurement Tool (GPT) was used. The GPT is a 3-point scale tool comprised
of 20 questions which measure abilities related to personal hygiene, social activity,
digestive system, sex life, and bladder and bowel management and higher scores indicate
better function<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Gi and Lee<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> standardized the Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS) into the Geriatric Depression Scale Korean Version (GDS-K) with
sufficient consideration of the characteristics of Korean elderly people. The GDS-K can
simply measure elderly people&#x02019;s depression levels and reflects their thoughts, emotions,
cognition, and physical and social aspects through which the overall phenomenon of
depression may be easily known. GDS-K is a Yes/No 1-point scale tool with 30 questions and
the more severe the depression, the higher the score. The Geriatric Quality of Life-Dementia
(GQOL-D) was devised by the Korean Association for Geriatric Psychiatry to enable elderly
people with dementia to freely report their quality of life, as perceived by themselves<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. It consists of 15 questions: 13 questions
that measure physical health, psychological health, level of independence, social
relationships, and environment and religion, and two questions that measure health and
overall degree of satisfaction with life. The total score ranges from 15 to 60 points, and
higher scores indicate a better quality of life.</p><p>The group therapy program was composed of a warming-up activity lasting 10 minutes, a
cooking activity lasting 10 minutes, a physical activity lasting 40 minutes, and a cooling
down activity lasting 10 minutes. For the cooking activity, subjects were interviewed in
advance regarding the dishes they knew how to cook. At each session, they introduced the
dishes they could cook well and everyone cooked them together. The kinds of dishes included
buckwheat pancakes, rice balls, Korean pancakes, fruit salad, and sweet potato salad.
Physical activities consisted of activities the subjects had performed when they were young.
To induce pleasure during the activity, music and games were used. Physical activities
comprised balloon volleyball, playing yut, Tuho, beanbag throwing, bowling, and dice play.
The program was conducted for 2 hours per session once per week, for a total of 10
sessions.</p><p>For the data analysis of this study, SPSS version 20.0 was used to perform statistical
processing. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine the significance of
differences in cognitive and physical functions, as well as psychological symptoms (MMSE-K,
GPT, GDS-K, and GQOL-D), before and after group therapy. The significance level was chosen
as &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The MMSE-K, GPT, GDS-K, and GQOL-D scores before and after group therapy are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of intervention on cognitive and physical functions, as well as on

individuals who are living longer, the higher incidence of dementia in older persons, the
high cost of supervised care, and the extensive use of medical resources<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Communities can often provide a safe,
structured activity program for older persons with dementia, and this study investigated the
effects of experience-based group therapy for elderly people with mild dementia in public
health centers, a local community base.</p><p>Our results show that scores in all tests were improved by the group therapy. Among them,
there were significant increases in the MMSE-K, GPT, and GQOL-D scores, and there was a
significant decrease in the GDS-K score. Because the GDS-K score is high when depression is
severe, a decrease in its score denotes a functional improvement. Both GPT and GQOL-D have
60 points as their full score. The GPT score increased by an average of 0.75 points, and the
GQOL-D score increased by an average of 9.75 points. These results suggest that GPT
sub-items, such as social activity, digestive system, sex life, and bladder and bowel
management, were not considered relevant by the respondents. Most subjects lived alone, did
not cook almost at all, and had no regular meetings. The program of cooking and physical
activity once per week improved the participants&#x02019; quality of life. MMSE-K and GDS-K perfect
scores are 30 points. The MMSE-K score increased by an average of 1.17 points, and the GDS-K
score improved by an average of 5.08 points. The reason the MMSE-K score increased is
because while group therapy did not provide a program to enhance the subjects&#x02019; cognitive
function, it did require their cognitive ability to perform cooking and physical activities.
The reason the GDS-K score increased more than the MMSE-K score was that the subjects&#x02019;
self-confidence was improved by the activities they experienced, weekly meetings, pleasant
cooking, and physical activity decreased their depression.</p><p>Morgan-Brown<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested an intervention
with cooking activities gave subjects more interaction with their environment and they did
more activities for themselves. In a study that considered cooking activities based on
experience, like the present study, the scores of depression symptoms were significantly
improved in the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), while cognitive function
showed no significant improvement in the MMSE total score<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study that conduncted cognitive activied combined with physical
exercise for dementia subjects for 36 sessions also reported that there were improvements in
cognition and depression according to the 7-Minute Screening and GDS<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vibroacoustic therapy and frequent visits by family
members are effective at decreasing depression in elderly nursing home residents with
dementia<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study had some limitations. First, there was no control group with which to
compare group therapy. It is a difficult task to recruit more than 20 elderly people with
mild dementia. Therefore, a study of two local communities where the bias is well controlled
is desirable. Second, the scope of the tools used to assess the physical function of the
elderly people with dementia was wide. Sex life and bladder and bowel management are topics
that are difficult to deal with in group therapy. Future research should use an evaluation
tool focusing on sub-items of physical functions. In this study, experience-based group
therapy improved subjects&#x02019; MMSE-K, GPT, GDS-K, and GQOL-D scores. The present study
demonstrated the beneficial effects of experience-based cooking and physical activity on
cognitive and physical functions, as well as on psychological symptoms. Prospective research
and well-controlled groups are needed to confirm these findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Semyung University Research Grant of 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">American Psychiatric
