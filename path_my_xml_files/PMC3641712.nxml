Iron deficiency in the absence of anemia (1) is common in patients with IPAH; (2) is associated with inappropriately raised levels of hepcidin, the key regulator of iron homeostasis; and (3) correlates with disease severity and worse clinical outcomes. Oral iron absorption may be impeded by reduced absorption due to elevated hepcidin levels. The safety and benefits of parenteral iron replacement in IPAH are unknown. Supplementation of Iron in Pulmonary Hypertension (SIPHON) is a Phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial of iron in IPAH. At least 60 patients will be randomized to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject) or saline placebo with a crossover point after 12 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome will be the change in resting pulmonary vascular resistance from baseline at 12 weeks, measured by cardiac catheterization. Secondary measures include resting and exercise hemodynamics and exercise performance from serial bicycle incremental and endurance cardiopulmonary exercise tests. Other secondary measurements include serum iron indices, 6-Minute Walk Distance, WHO functional class, quality of life score, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and cardiac anatomy and function from cardiac magnetic resonance. We propose that intravenous iron replacement will improve hemodynamics and clinical outcomes in IPAH. If the data supports a potentially useful therapeutic effect and suggest this drug is safe, the study will be used to power a Phase III study to address efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exercise capacity</kwd><kwd>ferric carboxymaltose</kwd><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>pulmonary arterial hypertension</kwd><kwd>pulmonary vascular resistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Intracellular iron and body iron stores are tightly regulated, and iron deficiency, with or without anemia, plays an important role in chronic disease modulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] There is increasing evidence that iron homeostasis is important in pulmonary hypertension with data from three centers showing iron deficiency is (1) common in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), and (2) associated with reduced exercise capacity and increased mortality.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>True iron status can be difficult to ascertain in chronic diseases such as IPAH using standard laboratory techniques due to the presence of inflammation.

Using several modalities to assess the response to Ferinject, the study also aims to provide insight into the mechanism of action. We, and others, previously showed that iron deficiency is associated with worse outcomes in IPAH, including exercise capacity, functional class, and mortality. The null hypothesis in our study is that intravenous Ferinject is not associated with an improvement in outcomes, which, if true, would suggest that iron deficiency may simply be a an epiphenomenon in IPAH, perhaps as a result of inflammation.</p><p>We previously reviewed the mechanisms through which iron may act as a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary arterial hypertension,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] but here we discuss these mechanisms in relation to trial design. One of the principal conduits through which iron replacement may act is the regulation of pulmonary vascular tone. One of us (Peter A. Robbins) showed a critical role for iron status in the modulation of pulmonary artery pressure in response to hypoxia. Iron chelation in man using desferrioxamine mimics the rise in pulmonary arterial pressure on acute hypoxic exposure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Furthermore, the administration of intravenous iron sucrose is sufficient to attenuate the rise in pulmonary arterial pressure on exposure to acute hypoxia and during acclimatization to altitude.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] On the other hand, a recent publication showed that desferrioxamine inhibits pulmonary vascular remodeling in response to chronic hypoxia in rats, with a commensurate reduction in right ventricular systolic pressure and mass.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] This may be due to a decrease in iron-dependent reactive oxygen species production and signaling.</p><p>The mechanism by which iron interacts with hypoxia is not fully understood, although its critical role in facilitating hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) breakdown through oxygen-sensitive prolyl hydroxylation is a likely candidate; thus an iron-deficient state is akin to a pseudo-hypoxic environment. For this reason, pulmonary vascular resistance was chosen as the primary outcome measure to gain an insight into mechanism as well as efficacy. The apparently paradoxical results of studies examining the role of iron in acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and experimental hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] further highlights the importance of studying central hemodynamics as well as exercise and quality of life end-points.</p><p>Iron may affect physiological function outside the pulmonary circulation, and indeed a lack of direct effect on the pulmonary vascular resistance would not negate the further use or study of iron replacement in pulmonary hypertension, if other endpoints showed promise. Iron is critical to the synthesis of hemoglobin and myoglobin, both of which impact on oxygen delivery and intracellular oxygen storage. While patients with overt anemia (hemoglobin &#x0003c; 10 g/dl) have been excluded from the study, some patients with IPAH run high hemoglobin levels, often due to hypoxia, and thus may be relatively anemic. Nonetheless, two studies in heart failure have shown that both anemic and nonanemic patients benefit from intravenous iron replacement therapy, with improved exercise capacity, indicating a role for iron replacement beyond hemoglobin synthesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Three exercise end-points have been selected: 6-Minute-Walk Test was included as a standard comparator in pulmonary hypertension trials; incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing was also included to provide data on peak capacity and prognostic markers; and endurance exercise testing at 80% of the peak work rate from the incremental test was included as a novel end-point. In other diseases, in particular chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it has shown promise as a sensitive marker for change since small changes in peak oxygen consumption will result in large changes in endurance time; however, the measurement suffers from high variability. In order to maximize exercise data, the study was designed as a crossover.</p><p>Iron replacement may also affect cardiac function, either indirectly by reducing right ventricular afterload, or directly through effects on myocardial oxygen metabolism or regulation of the right ventricular hypertrophic response.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In addition to cardiac catheterization at rest and on exercise (at 40% peak VO<sub>2</sub> estimated to coincide with peak stroke volume), cardiac function will be assessed using cardiac magnetic resonance and plasma biomarkers, including NT-proBNP.</p><p>The landmark study of intravenous Ferinject in congestive cardiac failure, FAIR-HF, used the self-reported patient global self-assessment as a primary end-point with exercise capacity as measured by 6-Minute-Walk Distance as secondary end-point.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Both measures were considered to be too variable to provide a robust measure as a primary end-point with the sample size planned for this study; nonetheless, we included both these measures as well as a pulmonary hypertension-specific quality of life tool, CAMPHOR.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>The investigators in FAIR-HF chose to titrate the dose of Ferinject to a calculated iron deficit according to the Ganzoni formula. Iron was administered to achieve this dose in 200 mg doses every week, unless iron saturation was achieved (ferritin 800 ng/mL or ferritin 500 ng/mL when transferrin saturations &#x0003e; 50% or hemoglobin &#x0003e; 16 g/dL). Following the &#x0201c;correction phase,&#x0201d; 200 mg Ferinject was administered every four weeks in the maintenance phase, starting at Week 8 or Week 12, depending on the duration of the correction phase. The doses of Ferinject ultimately prescribed in FAIR-HF were not reported, but following a very similar protocol in FERRIC-HF,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] 1269 &#x000b1; 297 and 1583 &#x000b1; 366 mg was administered to patients with hemoglobin &#x0003e; 12.5 g/dl and &#x0003c; 12.5 g/dl, respectively. Since Ferinject is licensed at doses up to 1,000 mg or 15 mg/kg (whichever is the smaller) in a single infusion, we chose to simplify the protocol to a single dose of 1,000 mg, or 15 mg/kg (if &#x0003c; 66.7 kg). We included a 12/24-week washout period to examine the kinetics of iron redepletion to gain some understanding of timing for repeat infusion. Patients often travel long distances to their nearest pulmonary hypertension expert center and thus there is need to reduce visits.</p><p>We have chosen to limit the study to patients with IPAH. This is based, first, on the fact that data on the prevalence of iron deficiency is only available in this subgroup. In addition, we have excluded other forms of PAH since other factors may be at play. Specifically, in connective tissue disease, gastrointestinal bleeding may be a significant factor in iron deficiency and patients may need to be treated according to a different clinical algorithm. Patients with congenital heart disease are often extremely hypoxaemic and tend to run high hemoglobin levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] While oral iron replacement has been shown to be associated with improvements in exercise capacity,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] there is the safety issue of a single dose of 1000mg Ferinject in this group, since hemoglobin levels may rise dramatically, resulting in marked erythrocytosis and possible hyperviscosity. Further studies in these patient groups will need to be undertaken.</p><p>Reduced iron absorption and decreased iron bioavailability is a physiological response to infection and inflammation. It is conceivable that this is a protective mechanism in IPAH as well as in the context of acute infection. Furthermore, iron overload is known to impair cardiac function. Although safety data will be collected, should this study show efficacy, there will be a need for a larger study to monitor adverse outcomes in addition to other efficacy end-points suited to larger studies, such as morbidity and mortality.</p><p>This is a biomarker-driven study. The biomarker of interest is circulating sTfR. As the assay is not available at all centres, patients must meet one of the following criteria: sTfR levels &#x0003e; 28.1 nmol/l or ferritin &#x0003c; 37 &#x003bc;g/l or iron &#x0003c; 10.3 &#x003bc;mol/l or transferrin saturations &#x0003c; 16.4%. A planned analysis of sTfR levels after recruitment of the 20th, 40th and 60th patients permits inclusion of more patients to achieve 60 patients with sTfR &#x0003e; 28.1 nmol/l. The design also permits a planned exploratory analysis on the effect of iron replacement in only patients with sTfR &#x0003e; 28.1 nmol/l and &#x0003e; 25 nmol/l, as two thresholds associated with poor clinical outcome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>There is a need for further therapy in PAH. There is an additional, desirable requirement that it is cost effective and convenient. By comparison with other new treatments in design, Ferinject would represent good value, with the added convenience that it can be administered quickly by intravenous injection as soon as iron studies become available. Although sTfR remains the gold standard for the diagnosis, this study also uses commonly available assays which in most centers can be turned around in a few hours. Our study will also address the likely need for reinfusion at 12 weeks, the standard follow-up interval for patients with IPAH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, this study of intravenous Ferinject is ambitious in its design. We are attempting to address mechanism of action as well as efficacy and safety. In drawing up a crossover design, we intend to increase the power to detect changes in important secondary end-points, in particular relating to exercise function and cardiac structural changes with magnetic resonance scanning. In the event that the primary end-point is not met, but there are important changes in these other end-points, we anticipate that these will provide proof-of-concept for further study. We also anticipate that the results of the study will power therapeutic strategies designed to improve iron homeostasis in idiopathic and potentially other subsets of pulmonary hypertension.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This work was sponsored by the Imperial College Academic Health Science Centre and funded by the British Heart Foundation.
