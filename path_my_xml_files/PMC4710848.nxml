There are now 600 million adults who are obese [body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>] worldwide. Obesity is causally linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> and early mortality. Lifestyle strategies for weight loss are based on calorie restriction, alongside increasing EE via exercise, but these efforts are difficult to sustain in the long term. Currently licensed drugs, generally aimed at either reducing intestinal fat absorption (such as intestinal lipase inhibitors) or inhibiting appetite (such as phentermine), have limited weight loss efficacy on their own. Anti&#x02010;obesity agents which elevate EE by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system have produced dangerous side effects, particularly cardiovascular morbidity <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. There is a great unmet need for drugs that can safely inhibit appetite and increase EE.</p><p id="dom12585-para-0006">One possible solution is a pharmacological agent that acts as a co&#x02010;agonist of both glucagon&#x02010;like peptide&#x02010;1 (GLP&#x02010;1) and glucagon receptors, harnessing the anorectic and glucose&#x02010;lowering effects of the former with increased EE via the latter <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. Glucagon infusion acutely increases EE in humans <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, but the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. Rodents can increase their EE via activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), which consumes fuel for thermogenesis using uncoupling protein&#x02010;1 (UCP&#x02010;1), and do so in response to both cold exposure and caloric excess <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. UCP&#x02010;1&#x02010;positive BAT deposits that can be activated by a variety of stimuli, most potently cold exposure, have been recently described in adult humans, particularly in the supraclavicular neck region <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>.</p><p id="dom12585-para-0007">Isolated brown fat cells from rats have been shown to respond thermogenically to glucagon <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> and glucagon administration to rodents increases BAT mass and activity <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>.

Subjects fasted and drank only water from 22:00 hours the night before each study visit. They ate the same meals the day before every study visit, abstained from alcohol, caffeine and avoided strenuous exercise for 24 h before each visit. Each visit was separated by at least 3 days. On arrival, peripheral venous cannulae were inserted in both forearms (one for infusion and one for blood sampling). Volunteers were blinded to the contents of the i.v. infusions. RMR was measured at the start and end of each thermal imaging visit using an indirect calorimeter (Gas Exchange Monitor; GEM Nutrition). At the start of each study visit the calorimeter was calibrated with &#x02018;zero&#x02019; (0.00% O<sub>2</sub> and 0.00% CO<sub>2</sub>) and &#x02018;span&#x02019; (20.00% O<sub>2</sub> and 1.00% CO<sub>2</sub>) gases (BOC, Guildford, UK). Human glucagon was purchased from Novo Nordisk (UK); 1 mg was diluted into 50 ml Gelofusine and the flow rate through the Alaris&#x000ae; syringe pump was adjusted to a maintenance i.v. delivery rate of 50 ng/kg/min. This dose was chosen based on previous work in our department to produce an acute rise in EE comparable with other studies examining the effects of cold exposure on EE and BAT activity <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>. To ensure plateau plasma levels were quickly attained when glucagon was delivered, infusions were ramped at 4&#x000d7; maintenance rate (MR) for the first 5 min, 2 &#x000d7; MR for the next 5 min and 1 &#x000d7; MR for the remainder of the 55&#x02010;min infusion. The Polar Products cooling vest used in this experiment has been previously confirmed to successfully induce cold&#x02010;activated BAT without needing to change the ambient temperature of the experimental room <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>.

We found that glucagon and cold exposure induced a similar acute rise in EE in humans, but in this setting only cold exposure, and not glucagon, induced the activity of supraclavicular BAT in adult humans measured using either <sup>18</sup>F&#x02010;FDG&#x02010;PET/CT or thermal imaging. We also found that, although cold exposure was capable of increasing sympathetic activation (as determined by steady&#x02010;state norepinephrine levels), glucagon infusion did not significantly alter circulating norepinephrine levels. These findings support the conclusion that, whilst acute cold exposure and acute glucagon infusion produce a very similar rise in RMR, the effector mechanisms through which EE is elevated are different. These findings are of importance to drug development based on glucagon receptor agonism, as the dose of glucagon used in the present study increased EE significantly without sympathetic system activation, thus potentially avoiding the deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system that have been encountered with some weight&#x02010;loss medications.</p><p id="dom12585-para-0029">In 2009, metabolically active BAT in adult humans was described in detail <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. This has led to a resurgence of interest in the utility of BAT as a tantalizing target for safely increasing EE to aid weight loss. Enhanced BAT activity may also induce favourable effects on glucose homeostasis and circulating lipids <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>. Exposure to cold temperatures is the most potent stimulator of BAT metabolic activity, which has been correlated with the associated rise in EE that occurs in the cold [although not so in this particular study (Figure S6)]. More recently, the concept of repeated cold exposure as a means of recruiting or upregulating BAT for therapeutic purposes has also been reported <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, although the feasibility of such an approach in a clinical setting remains to be seen. The effector mechanism for cold&#x02010;induced thermogenesis is the sympathetic nervous system, which richly innervates BAT, via the &#x003b2;3 adrenoceptor. In line with this, patients with catecholamine&#x02010;secreting tumours have evidence of increased BAT activity, which abates once the tumour is removed, and thyrotoxic patients show a similar upregulation of BAT activity, as thyroid hormone potentiates &#x003b2;&#x02010;adrenergic signalling <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>. Conversely, a study very similar to the present study described the effects of non&#x02010;selective &#x003b2;&#x02010;adrenergic stimulation by isoprenaline in healthy young men on BAT activity. Vosselman et al. <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> found that, although isoprenaline infusion increased EE to the same extent as cold exposure, it did not significantly activate BAT, indicating that other tissues are responsible for generalized &#x003b2;&#x02010;adrenergic thermogenesis. Indeed, early preclinical trials of &#x003b2;3 agonists as anti&#x02010;obesity agents did not progress because of poor efficacy <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>. A more recent study, using newer and more highly specific &#x003b2;3 agonists (licensed for other conditions), however, suggests that pharmacological manipulation of BAT remains a viable option. Cypess et al. <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> described significant BAT activation in response to a single dose of the selective &#x003b2; agonist mirabegron, associated with a 200 kcal/day rise in EE, although this was not reported against the degree of measured cold&#x02010;induced BAT activity in the cohort. More recently, Broeders et al. <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> described the effect of bile acids on human BAT activation, reporting a small but significant rise in BAT SUV<sub>max</sub>, from 1.0 &#x000b1; 0.4 to 1.6 &#x000b1; 0.4, compared with 7.2 &#x000b1; 5.4 in acute cold exposure. They therefore concluded that the maximum achievable BAT activation in these subjects far exceeded the effects of chenodeoxycholic acid, but that more potent bile acid BAT activators may have traction as anti&#x02010;obesity drugs.</p><p id="dom12585-para-0030">
<sup>18</sup>F&#x02010;FDG&#x02010;PET/CT, the imaging method chosen for all of these BAT studies, is the currently accepted &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; method for measuring BAT volume and activity. In rodent studies, thermographic measurement of BAT activity has been validated against biochemical markers of BAT thermogenesis, such as UCP&#x02010;1 upregulation <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. In human studies, Jang et al. <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> reported that a temperature difference between the neck and sternum of 0.9 &#x000b0;C had a positive predictive value of 85% for the presence of supraclavicular BAT, Symonds et al. <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> recorded rises of 0.5 &#x000b0;C in supraclavicular temperature in children after mild cold exposure, and Boon et al. <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> reported a 0.4 &#x000b0;C cold&#x02010;induced supraclavicular skin temperature rise, which positively correlated with <sup>18</sup>F&#x02010;FDG&#x02010;PET/CT quantification of underlying BAT. In the present study all eight subjects who had BAT activation after cold exposure as determined by <sup>18</sup>F&#x02010;FDG&#x02010;PET/CT also showed a rise in neck temperature, as determined by thermal imaging during cold exposure, although the correlation between PET&#x02010;quantified BAT mass and cold&#x02010;induced neck temperature rise was not significant in the present cohort (data not shown). We also observed that the rise in neck temperature occurs within the first 10 min after cold exposure and remains elevated for the duration of the exposure. By contrast, the subjects with an absence of cold&#x02010;activated BAT activity on their PET/CT scan displayed no change or a fall in neck temperature under cold conditions. In all cases, both saline and glucagon infusions (in a warm room) produced no rise in neck temperature on thermal imaging, supporting the conclusion that glucagon produces at best only a very modest effect on BAT activity in this experimental setting.</p><p id="dom12585-para-0031">To further check the validity of our thermal findings, we manually overlaid all thermal images on the corresponding PET/CT images. In all eight BAT&#x02010;positive subjects, the 10% hottest pixels from the thermal image (that were used for our data analysis) consistently formed a contiguous cluster overlying the largest depot of BAT defined on that subject's corresponding PET/CT. Furthermore, when we analysed the temperature change in the pixels that overlaid BAT on the corresponding PET/CT, the same temperature rise was found as produced by the (blinded) whole ROI analysis, confirming that analysis of the entire ROI accurately reflected skin temperature changes directly overlying a confirmed BAT depot. In the three BAT&#x02010;negative subjects, the 10% hottest pixels were more sparsely distributed across the entire ROI. These findings support the use of thermal imaging to investigate BAT activity by directly measuring the output of the uncoupling process, namely heat. Development of such novel methods for quantifying and measuring the function of human BAT is important, as the restoration or upregulation of BAT activity in humans may provide a non&#x02010;surgical means of treating obesity. Indeed, although <sup>18</sup>F&#x02010;FDG PET/CT is still generally regarded as the gold standard for measuring BAT activity, the technique is expensive, exposes research participants to ionizing radiation and may not be the best measure of BAT metabolism as circulating glucose is used as a substrate for BAT thermogenesis only after internal fatty acid stores and then circulating free fatty acids have been used. Ouellet et al. have reported on the utility of using other PET tracers, such as <sup>11</sup>C&#x02010;acetate (to determine tissue oxidative activity) and the fatty acid <sup>18</sup>F&#x02010;fluoro&#x02010;thiaheptadecanoic acid (<sup>18</sup>FTHA) to measure non&#x02010;esterified fatty acid uptake in human BAT <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>. Others have focused on other methods of imaging without the need for exposure to ionising radiation, such as fat&#x02010;fraction MRI to quantify BAT mass coupled with functional MRI to investigate BAT activation, measuring blood flow as a marker of thermogenesis <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>.</p><p id="dom12585-para-0032">The present work has important therapeutic implications. Modern estimates suggest that BAT activity could account for 5% of the basal metabolic rate in humans <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, although its maximum inducible potential remains unknown. Two previous studies have reported on the addition of chronic glucagon receptor agonism to the antidiabetic properties of GLP&#x02010;1 receptor agonism in diet&#x02010;induced obese mice <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. Co&#x02010;agonism of glucagon and GLP&#x02010;1 receptors induced superior body weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis than the GLP&#x02010;1 receptor agonist alone, and caused a significant rise in EE. These findings have led to intense interest in the concept of balanced co&#x02010;agonism of both the glucagon and GLP&#x02010;1 receptors to achieve superior weight loss as a result of the additional EE effects of glucagon receptor activation. We confirmed the applicability of this finding to humans, showing that glucagon acutely increases EE in humans <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, and the present study builds on our understanding of the mechanism by which it does so.</p><p id="dom12585-para-0033">The dose of glucagon used in the present experiment was based on our previous knowledge of the dose required to significantly increase EE in humans. We have previously shown that a dose of 50 ng/kg/min (i.e. 14 pmol/kg/min) i.v. glucagon over 45 min increased resting EE significantly: by a mean of 146.99 kcal/day in healthy overweight individuals <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. This dose, administered over 55 min in the present study (notably on a leaner and younger cohort) produced a 206.8 &#x000b1; 29.6 kcal/day rise in EE. In another recent publication, we showed that a dose of 2.8 pmol/kg/min i.v. glucagon over 130 min (i.e. a fifth of the dose used in the present study but over twice the time) produced a non&#x02010;significant rise in EE of 66.8 kcal/day in overweight volunteers (n = 13) <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. The plateau plasma levels measured in this experiment following glucagon infusion (&#x0223c;300 pM) are also consistent with those previous reports, although higher than those typically expected when fasting (&#x0223c;50 pM); however, this would not be unexpected in the setting of a pharmacological (weight&#x02010;loss) agent containing a glucagon agonist element. Notably, we have chosen to present our EE data in units of kcal/day, thereby extrapolating our acute measurement of EE rise with glucagon to the 24&#x02010;h period. Whilst there is strong animal data that chronic GLP&#x02010;1 receptor and glucagon&#x02010;receptor co&#x02010;agonism produces long&#x02010;lasting weight loss effects and increased EE, the effects of chronic glucagon receptor agonism in humans are not known. Thus, whilst a 24&#x02010;h extrapolated value for the EE effects of glucagon infusion may not necessarily be reflective of what would happen with prolonged glucagon agonism over that period (or longer), it gives a sense of the potential therapeutic effect of this strategy.</p><p id="dom12585-para-0034">We powered the present study to detect a significant difference between the effects of cold exposure and glucagon using <sup>18</sup>F&#x02010;FDG PET/CT in confirmed BAT&#x02010;positive volunteers. With the data presented in this study, we can confidently state that, for the same rise in EE, glucagon has less effect on BAT than cold, although it is not possible to exclude a small effect of glucagon on human BAT activity with this study. Furthermore, although BAT activity was measured on PET/CT during the 55 min i.v. infusion of glucagon when plasma levels had reached a plateau, cold exposure was initiated 1 h before the scan, which may also have militated against detecting an effect of glucagon on BAT activity. To reduce the contribution of cold&#x02010;activated BAT on the placebo or glucagon study days, we maintained the scanner room temperature at 23 &#x000b0;C throughout the study. Indeed, it would be interesting to further investigate the interplay between constitutive BAT activity (as occurs in mild cold stress) and its responsiveness to glucagon, which was not answerable with this particular study. As we wished to limit radiation exposure to women of childbearing potential, the data presented are for young, healthy males only. Nevertheless, our findings imply the existence of an as&#x02010;yet unidentified, and potentially targetable, glucagon&#x02010;driven pathway to enhanced EE. Other mechanisms by which glucagon may be exerting its thermic effects have still to be explored in humans in greater detail. Futile substrate cycling induced by non&#x02010;physiological glucagon receptor activation provides a means to increasing the metabolic rate through stimulation of energy&#x02010;consuming cyclical metabolic pathways, with no net change in product formation, in the liver and other tissues. Tracer studies have indicated a significant effect on glucose cycling in response to glucagon infusion, an effect that occurs predominantly at low insulin levels and is abolished with high&#x02010;dose insulin infusion. The contribution of this to whole&#x02010;body EE remains to be adequately explored <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>, <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>. Glucagon also has well described positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the myocardium, although the small contribution of the heart to total RMR could not account for the rise in EE that we have measured after glucagon infusion <xref rid="dom12585-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>. Finally, we have not excluded a small element of BAT activation in humans in response to glucagon administration, and the effects of chronic glucagon receptor activation on BAT mass and function in humans also remain unknown. In line with animal data, this may include upregulation of classical BAT deposits versus the possibility that chronic glucagon receptor agonism may promote WAT transdifferentiation to a more brown&#x02010;like phenotype. The present study has highlighted these important areas for future research into the hormonal upregulation of human EE as a safe therapeutic option for obesity.</p></sec><sec id="dom12585-sec-0022"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p id="dom12585-para-0037">The authors have nothing to disclose.</p><p id="dom12585-para-0038">V.S., C.I.&#x02010;E., E.R., R.G., S.R.B., T.T. and W.S.D. designed the experiment; V.
