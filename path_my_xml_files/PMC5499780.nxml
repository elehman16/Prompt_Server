Lenvatinib, a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), represents a therapeutic option, in combination with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus, for the treatment of metastatic RCC (mRCC).</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>The objective of this article is to review the evidence about the treatment of mRCC with combination of lenvatinib plus everolimus.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence review</title><p>Phase I studies supported clinical activity of lenvatinib in mRCC. A randomized, Phase II, open-label, multicenter trial demonstrated the clinical efficacy of combination treatment with lenvatinib plus everolimus in patients with progressive mRCC after prior therapy with TKI. Median progression-free survival was improved by 9 months with the combination therapy compared to the single-agent everolimus, with an overall response rate of 43% for the experimental regimen. Lenvatinib plus everolimus appeared to be slightly less toxic than single-agent lenvatinib and more toxic than single-agent everolimus; grade 3&#x02013;4 adverse events occurred in 71% of patients. Currently, lenvatinib plus everolimus has US Food and Drug Administration approval for its use in mRCC after failure of previous treatment with TKI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combination therapy with lenvatinib plus everolimus might be a promising choice for second-line treatment of mRCC patients. Based on the results of the Phase II trial, it is possible to speculate that the combination therapy could be appropriate for patients with high disease burden or strongly symptomatic patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>lenvatinib</kwd><kwd>everolimus</kwd><kwd>evidence-based review</kwd><kwd>renal cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>RCC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 2%&#x02013;3% of all cancer, and its incidence has increased by ~2% worldwide over the two last decades.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The most common histotype is represented by clear cell RCC (ccRCC), accounting for 70%&#x02013;85% of sporadic RCC; less frequent variants include papillary (7%&#x02013;15%) and chromophobe RCC (5%&#x02013;10%).<xref rid="b2-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> RCC is often diagnosed incidentally when undergoing abdominal imaging for other reasons,<xref rid="b3-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and it occurs as metastatic disease at diagnosis in about one third of patients.<xref rid="b4-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Usually, surgery is the initial treatment for both local and locally advanced disease; however, for most patients with advanced tumor, systemic therapy is needed.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b5-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Recent advances in the understanding of tumor biology and of pathogenetic mechanisms have led to the development of new drugs for the management of metastatic disease, including new targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors.<xref rid="b6-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>TKIs are small molecules that inhibit key pathways involved in RCC cell growth and proliferation, cellular metabolism, and angiogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and mTOR pathways. Until recently, four TKIs were available for the treatment of metastatic RCC (mRCC): sunitinib, which targets VEGF and PDGF receptors (VEGFR and PDGFR, respectively), c-KIT, and FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT-3);<xref rid="b7-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> pazopanib, a selective inhibitor of VEGFRs, PDGFR, and c-KIT;<xref rid="b8-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> axitinib, which inhibits VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3;<xref rid="b9-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and sorafenib, a multi-inhibitor of Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase, BRAF, VEGFR-2, PDGFR, FLT-3, and c-KIT.<xref rid="b10-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> According to current European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines, sunitinib and pazopanib are recommended for the first-line treatment of recurrent, metastatic, or inoperable RCC with good&#x02013;intermediate prognosis; axitinib and sorafenib are approved for their use after failure of first-line therapy. Interferon-&#x003b1; plus bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody, represent another option for the management of mRCC with good&#x02013;intermediate prognostic features in first-line setting. Among mTOR inhibitors, temsirolimus and everolimus have shown activity in mRCC: temsirolimus is recommended for the first-line therapy of poor prognosis ccRCC or non-ccRCC, whereas everolimus is a treatment option for second and subsequent lines.<xref rid="b2-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Until recently, the standard treatment for advanced ccRCC after first-line TKI failure was represented by axitinib or everolimus; sorafenib was reserved only for selected cases. Two new molecules, cabozantinib and nivolumab, have shown superiority over everolimus in terms of overall survival (OS) and response rate (RR) in second-line setting for mRCC in two comparative head-to-head Phase III trials.<xref rid="b11-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Based on these results, cabozantinib and nivolumab are preferred choices over everolimus in second-line therapy.<xref rid="b2-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b13-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Lenvatinib (E7080, Lenvima<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Eisai, Hatfield, UK) is a multitarget kinase inhibitor firstly approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicine Agency (EMA) as monotherapy for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, and more recently approved by FDA, in combination with everolimus, for the treatment of advanced RCC following one prior antiangiogenic therapy. This review discusses the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus for the treatment of advanced RCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of action</title><p>Two pivotal molecular events are involved in the pathogenesis of ccRCC: the loss of function of von Hippel&#x02013;Lindau (VHL) gene that acts as a tumor-suppressor gene and the consequent overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). The protein encoded by VHL gene is responsible for HIF expression downregulation by degrading HIF-1&#x003b1; subunit. The reduced activity of VHL gene results in constitutively activated hypoxic response even in the absence of a hypoxic signal,<xref rid="b14-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> leading to the transcription of HIF-responsive genes, such as VEGF, PDGF, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#x003b2;).<xref rid="b15-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This event is crucial in RCC carcinogenesis; overexpressed growth factors induce pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions.<xref rid="b16-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>The second critical pathway involved in the development and growth of RCC is regulated by mTOR protein. The mTOR signaling pathway is known to be responsible for anchorage-independent cellular expansion, increased proliferative potential and evasion from apoptosis, and increased cell motility and metastasis.<xref rid="b17-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Moreover, the activation of mTOR induced by overexpressed growth factors (ie, VEGF and PDGF) promotes HIF expression,<xref rid="b18-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> triggering a positive feedback loop between VHL/HIF and mTOR signaling.<xref rid="b20-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It is evident that the two pathways are closely connected and cross-talking, hence the attempt of combining both TKI and the mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of mRCC.</p><p>In the past, randomized trials have been conducted trying to combine VEGF and mTOR inhibitors, with poor results on efficacy outcomes and increased drug toxicity. Combinations of temsirolimus plus bevacizumab, temsirolimus plus sorafenib, and everolimus plus bevacizumab were also investigated, with disappointing results.<xref rid="b21-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Lenvatinib is a novel potent multitarget TKI that performs its action through the inhibition of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-&#x003b2;, RET, c-KIT, and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1&#x02013;4, the latter deemed as responsible for resistance to VEGF inhibitors in RCC.<xref rid="b24-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Preclinical data on the effect of the combination of lenvatinib with everolimus have been reported. Matsumi et al investigated the mechanisms of these drugs used in combination in human RCC xenograft mouse models: everolimus demonstrated antiproliferative effects, whereas lenvatinib showed antiangiogenic properties. In this study, tumor angiogenesis was evaluated by microvessel density (MVD) of the tumor; whereas lenvatinib monotherapy consistently reduces MVD in A-498 xenografts, everolimus monotherapy did not. In the same xenograft model, enhanced antitumor activity resulted from the combination of the two drugs, suggesting the synergistic effect of the two different mechanisms of action.</p><p>It is evident that targeting tumor cell growth and angiogenesis through the combination of lenvatinib plus everolimus can result in enhanced antitumor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-tcrm-13-799">Figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="b26-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>A strong rationale to combine two molecules with different mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-tcrm-13-799">Figure 1</xref>), the good tolerability profile of everolimus in mRCC patients and the availability of preclinical data that showed the synergistic antitumor effect of these two drugs, all together are elements that justify the choice to further develop the combination of everolimus (instead of other agents) with lenvatinib in the clinical setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Lenvatinib is orally administered.

Twenty-seven patients affected by different histological types of solid tumors, refractory to conventional therapies or for which there was no available effective therapy, were treated with oral lenvatinib in a 2-week-on/1-week-off cycle, starting from a dose of 0.5 mg bid, to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD was determined to be 13 mg bid, and observed dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) included grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase increase and grade 3 platelet count decrease, according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Twenty-one patients (84%) demonstrated stable disease (SD) as their best response to treatment, and one patient affected by metastatic colon cancer showed partial response (PR).<xref rid="b27-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>A subsequent non-randomized, open-label, Phase I, dose&#x02013;escalation study supported clinical activity of lenvatinib in mRCC. Eighty-two patients affected by different histological types of solid tumors were enrolled. Lenvatinib was given on a continuous once-daily administration schedule. One cycle of treatment consisted of 28 days, and dose escalation was allowed after each cycle, starting from a dose of 0.2 mg per day. The MTD was determined to be 25 mg per day, and the most common adverse events (AEs) of any CTCAE version 4.0 grade included diarrhea (45%), hypertension (40%), nausea (37%), stomatitis (32%), proteinuria (26%), and vomiting (23%). Grade 3 hypertension and grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 11% and 7% of the overall population, respectively. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was documented in 2% of patients. Seven patients (9%) showed PR and 38 patients (46%) displayed SD as their best response. Among the population affected by mRCC (n=9 [11%]), four patients achieved a PR. In this cohort, the reported median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 447 days (95% CI 279.0&#x02013;559.0), and the extent of tumor reduction ranged from 5% (with lenvatinib 3.3 mg) to 55% (with lenvatinib 25 mg).<xref rid="b28-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>The combination of lenvatinib plus everolimus for the treatment of mRCC progressed after VEGF-targeted therapy was first tested in a Phase Ib trial.

Dose escalation was admitted after a 28-day treatment cycle without DLTs.

PFS was the primary endpoint, while toxicity, objective RR, and OS were secondary endpoints. One hundred and fifty-three patients with advanced ccRCC who progressed after one prior VEGF-targeted therapy were randomized 1:1:1 to receive single-agent lenvatinib (24 mg daily), single-agent everolimus (10 mg daily), or the combination (lenvatinib 18 mg plus everolimus 5 mg daily) in 28-day continuous cycles.

The trial was designed to have 70% power to detect a 50% improvement (HR 0.67) in PFS at a one-sided alpha level of 0.15 of the combination of the two drugs or single-agent lenvatinib compared to single-agent everolimus, assuming an mPFS of 5 months for everolimus and 7.5 months for each lenvatinib-containing arm. The mPFS was improved by 9 months with the combination therapy compared to everolimus, with an HR significantly lower than preestablished (14.6 vs 5.5 months; HR: 0.40; 95% CI 0.24&#x02013;0.68; <italic>P</italic>=0.0005).<xref rid="b35-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The independent radiologic assessment confirmed benefit in terms of PFS, strengthening the positive result.<xref rid="b37-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Moreover, outcome results of the control arm with single-agent everolimus were consistent with those obtained in previous studies investigating everolimus in second-line setting for mRCC after failure of previous TKIs, in terms of PFS, ORR, and OS.<xref rid="b11-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b39-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Regarding secondary endpoints, ORR was broadly larger for the combination regimen (43% vs 27% for single-agent lenvatinib and 6% for single-agent everolimus); OS also improved by the association of the two drugs, even if the result was not significant at primary data cutoff. Of note, patients enrolled in the study had overall characteristics similar to real life population, with a considerable portion of poor-risk patients (39% according to the Memorial Sloan&#x02013;Kettering Cancer Center risk status).<xref rid="b35-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Despite promising results on efficacy outcomes, the combination treatment appeared more toxic than single-agent everolimus, despite being no more toxic than single-agent lenvatinib, with a not-negligible incidence of grade 3&#x02013;4 AEs (71%) and one reported case of fatal drugrelated event in the combination arm, suggesting the need for optimization in the monitoring and treatment of AEs. The different toxicity profile of lenvatinib between the two arms may be due to the full dose administered in the single-agent arm (24 mg) versus the reduced dose of the combination arm (18 mg). Of note, no unexpected treatment-related AEs were observed.<xref rid="b35-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Based on all these findings, with the limits of a Phase II open-label study, it is acceptable to consider these results as very relevant for their possible application in clinical practice.<xref rid="b13-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Moreover, the results of this randomized study clearly suggest that maintaining the suppression of VEGF pathway (&#x0201c;VEGF pressure&#x0201d;) could represent a good therapeutic strategy after failure of first-line TKI treatment; in addition, the simultaneous blockade of the mTOR pathway seems to be definitely more efficient.<xref rid="b40-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The value of the &#x0201c;VEGF pressure&#x0201d; theory is further supported by the results of the METEOR study, a randomized Phase III trial in which cabozantinib, a novel TKI, obtained a better PFS than those of everolimus in mRCC patients who progressed after &#x02265;1 prior TKIs (7.4 vs 3.8 months; HR: 0.51, 95% CI 0.41&#x02013;0.62; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).<xref rid="b11-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Indeed, this cited trial currently represents the first and only controlled study with a direct comparison between the treatment sequence &#x0201c;TKI-mTOR inhibitor&#x0201d; and a &#x0201c;TKI-TKI strategy&#x0201d;, the latter coming out as the winner.</p><p>Recently, the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab was approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of mRCC in second-line setting. The pivotal trial CheckMate-025 showed an mOS improvement for patients who received nivolumab compared to those treated with everolimus (25.0 vs 19.6 months; HR: 0.75, 98.5% CI 0.57&#x02013;0.93; <italic>P</italic>=0.002) with no significant difference in terms of mPFS (4.6 months for nivolumab vs 4.4 months for everolimus; HR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.75&#x02013;1.03; <italic>P</italic>=0.11). This interesting finding has aroused hopes and has opened a new landscape for the treatment of mRCC, but on the other hand risking to obscure the value of a proven targeted therapy strategy, valuable at least for that fraction of patients primary refractory to immunotherapy (35% in CheckMate-025 study).<xref rid="b12-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> One of the next challenges will be identification of adequate predictive factors that could help the clinician to choose the best therapy/strategy (ie, TKI-TKI-nivolumab sequence vs TKI-nivolumab-TKI sequence vs TKI-TKI-TKI/mTOR inhibitor sequence vs TKI-TKI+mTOR-nivolumab sequence) for each patient. Until then, the high ORR obtained with lenvatinib plus everolimus combination (43%) could suggest that patients with high disease burden or strongly symptomatic patients may be those most likely to benefit from this option.</p><p>Currently, a randomized, Phase III, three-arm trial is ongoing to compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus everolimus or of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus sunitinib in first-line setting.<xref rid="b41-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The combination of lenvatinib plus everolimus is also being investigated in treatment-naive advanced non-ccRCC, in an ongoing Phase II trial.<xref rid="b42-tcrm-13-799" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combination therapy with lenvatinib plus everolimus is a promising choice for the treatment of mRCC patients who progress after first-line TKI treatment. It has been approved by the US FDA in this setting. Currently, use of either nivolumab or cabo zantinib represents the new standard treatment in second-line setting; axitinib, everolimus, and sorafenib are still alternative options for selected patients. Despite a not-negligible toxicity, lenvatinib plus everolimus showed improvement in PFS and high ORR; based on these findings, the combination therapy could be appropriate for patients with high disease burden or strongly symptomatic patients. Eventually, a Phase III study is needed to validate the encouraging results of the Phase II trial.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The

Activated VEGFR and FGFR on endothelial cell trigger the MAPK/ERK pathway that promotes angiogenesis. On cancer cell, activated RTKs (ie, VEGFR, PDGFR-&#x003b2;, RET, c-KIT, and FGFR) mediate cell proliferation through the MAPK/ERK pathway; the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway leads to cell survival, growth, and motility. Everolimus inhibits mTOR signaling. HIF is degraded by VHL in normoxic condition; in the presence of hypoxia, or when overexpressed, it promotes angiogenesis through the synthesis of growth factors. Dashed arrows indicate crosslinks between different signaling pathways: RAS activates PI3K, whereas mTOR promotes HIF expression.</p><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
