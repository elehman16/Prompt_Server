stability exercises and the effect of stability exercise on the shoulder pain of
middle-aged women. [Subjects] Twenty-two middle-aged female subjects were randomly divided
into two groups: a shoulder stability exercise group (Experimental group, n=11) and a
control group (n=11). [Methods] Subjects in the experimental group performed a shoulder
stability exercise, which was designed to correct abnormal location of the scapula, for 40
minutes per day, three times per week, over a period of four weeks. Range of motion,
muscle strength, and grasping power were measured to determine the effect of the shoulder
stability exercise. The measured parameters were evaluated before and after four weeks of
exercise. [Results] Following intervention, range of motion, muscle strength, and grasping
power showed greater improvements in the experimental group than in the control group.
[Conclusion] The results of this study show that shoulder stability exercise can improve
the shoulder function of middle-aged women, and prevent damage to the shoulder joint. We
consider this exercise would be useful in clinical rehabilitation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Middle-aged women</kwd><kwd>Shoulder dysfunction</kwd><kwd>Shoulder stability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Shoulder pain and dysfunction are related to location of the scapula at rest, and abnormal
movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, abnormal location of the
scapula, instability of movement relative to the shoulder joint, rotator cuff rupture, and
impingement syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Scapula damage syndrome is
caused by movement in the easiest direction in abnormal movement, and can cause pain with
repetitive stress in that specific direction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, an abnormal location of the scapula caused by abnormal
muscle action around the shoulder joint can lead to limitation of scapulothoracic joint
movement. Eventually, this causes stress to the joint capsule of the scapulohumeral joint
causing impingement syndrome and instability in the shoulder girdle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therapeutic interventions for shoulder pain uses hyperthermia, cryotherapy, ultrasound,
massage, TENS, injection, and acupuncture. Most of these interventions can relieve pain but
are inefficient at preventing recurrence of pain and maintenance of normal function.
Therefore, in the present study, shoulder joint stabilization exercise was prescribed for
patients with shoulder pain. Stability of the shoulder joint is important, however,
stability and muscle strengthening is more important because the shoulder is very mobile.
Among the muscles that act to maintain shoulder stability, the serratus anterior is
important for maintaining scapulohumeral rhythm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. When elevating the upper limb, it helps upward rotation and
posterior tilt /retroversion of the scapula and holds the scapula to the thoracic cage to
prevent winging scapula<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>During full range of motion (ROM) movement of the shoulder joint, the strength of the
rotator cuff simultaneous activity of the scapular and the scapulohumeral condition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>,
instability of the scapula, and abnormal movement are the main cause of impingement
syndrome. Preventing impingement syndrome and restoration of mobility and stability are
important, and the trapezius and the serratus anterior play important role<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Weakness of the lower trapezius has negative effects on scapular movement, increasing
shoulder joint weakness, and can be a cause of worsening of the lower trapezius is the main
muscle maintining appropriate posture and alignment of the shoulder joint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The serratus anterior also works to provide stability of the scapula. It maintains the
appropriate location of the scapula together with the lower trapezius<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Excessive activation of the upper trapezius decreases a
subject's ability to control the lower trapezius and the serratus anterior, and may be a
cause of shoulder pain.</p><p>This study prescribed stability exercise for normal location of the scapula and muscle
balance in order to determine its effect on ROM and strength, and to provide basic
information for rehabilitation of patients with shoulder pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 22 middle-aged females with shoulder pain, who voluntarily agreed to participate
in the shoulder stability exercise were included in this study. The subjects were randomly
divided into an experimental group and a control group. Range of motion, muscle strength,
and grasping power were tested. The side exhibiting the least pain was called the superior
side, and the side exhibiting the greatest pain was called the inferior side; measurements
were performed on both sides. The stability exercise for the shoulder was performed three
times per week, 40 minutes per performance, for a total of four weeks. General
characteristics of the subjects in the experimental group were: a mean age of 44.0&#x02005;years, a
mean height of 161.45&#x02005;cm, and a mean weight of 60.36&#x02005;kg; subjects in the control group
46.36&#x02005;years, mean height 161.36&#x02005;cm, mean weight of 60.64&#x02005;kg. There were no significant
differences between the groups. The present study was approved by Sahmyook University
Institutional Review Board. All participants were given an explanation of the objective of
the study and its requirements, and all those who participated provided their written
informed consent.</p><p>Stability exercises for the shoulder joint were designed to correct abnormal location of
the scapula. In order to strengthen the serratus anterior, a push-up exercise was performed,
with maintenance of scapular protraction for 5&#x02013;10 seconds in a closed-chain motion. For the
first 1&#x02013;2 weeks, knee push-ups were performed, then the standard push-up was performed in
order to achieve a gradual increase of exercise intensity. However, those who were not able
to perform the standard push-up exercise received assistance in order to relieve the load by
placement of a cushion under the knees and to prevent spinal curvature.</p><p>The exercise for strengthening of the lower trapezius minimized the muscle activity of the
upper trapezius, and, at the same time, maximized the muscle activity of the lower trapezius
by performance of the modified prone cobra, as suggested by Arlotta<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the first 1&#x02013;2 weeks, prone row was performed, and,
then modified prone cobra was performed in order to achieve a gradual increase in exercise
intensity.</p><p>The Codman exercise was performed for orderly improvement of flexion, abduction, extension,
and adduction around the cone when a circle is drawn on the scapulohumeral joint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a 3&#x02005;kg weight was added in order to
provide pulling capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise
was performed as if drawing a circle using clockwise rotation and anticlockwise rotation.
Trapezius exercise causes rotation and abduction of the scapula aiming to create sufficient
movement in the middle and lower fibers of the trapezius. Subjects received a thorough
explanation on how to perform the same scapular motion for both sides in order to provide
help with scapular rhythm; the exercise is performed like the motion of a wall clock.</p><p>For stretching of the pectoralis minor, subjects stood beside a doorframe and performed
pectoralis minor self-stretching<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
During this exercise, the subjects' bodies were examined carefully to determine whether it
was inclined or rotating. The position of the hand was changed in order to stretch the whole
of the pectoralis muscle.</p><p>Holding the arm out in a line is a closed-chain exercise involving the elbow, which helps
to stabilize the upper limb and body. For those who were not able to perform this action, a
cushion was placed under their knees in order to decrease weight bearing which was gradually
moved down to the feet in order to achieve a gradual increase in exercise intensity.
Finally, subjects performed exercise involving reciprocal back and forth travel of the arms
and legs. This exercise improves control of the abdominal muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to avoid any effect on other parts of the head and body, measurement of ROM of
shoulder flexion and abduction was performed by the measurer while subjects were sitting in
a neutral position. A Dual Inclinometry (J Tech, Dualer IQ<sup>TM</sup> Digital
Inclinometer) device was used for measurement of the subject's active performance without
pain. In this study, the action was repeated three times, followed by measurement of
shoulder joint flexion, and the mean value was used.</p><p>A digital manual muscle tester (model 01163, Lafayette, USA, 2003) was used for measurement
of the muscle strength of the upper limb. Muscle strength was measured in a neutral sitting
position without movement of the neck or body, with the shoulder in abduction of 90&#x000b0;. The
strength of shoulder abduction was measured three times, with a resting period of 30 seconds
between each measurement and the mean value was used.</p><p>A grasping power meter (digital grasping power meter, DHS-176, Gilwoo Detect company, USA)
was used for the measurement of the grasping power of the middle finger. The subject
maintained a neutral position while sitting on a chair with a backrest, with the arm in a
natural position, and the second joint of the middle finger was held at a right angle and
was pulled forcefully. Measurements were performed three times, and the mean value was
recorded.</p><p>The SPSS 17.0 program was used for statistical analyses. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to
determine the distribution of the general properties and outcome measures of the subjects.
The paired t test was used to compare the pretest and posttest results of range of motion,
muscle strength, and grasping power within each group, and the independent t test was
performed to compare the two groups before and after training. A p value &#x0003c;0.05 was
considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the experimental group, superior side flexion ROM was 160.27&#x000b0; before training, and

elevation/depression, protraction and retraction, upward rotation and downward rotation of
the scapula and flexion, abduction and external rotation exercise of the shoulder joint with
open-chain stabilization exercise and push-up on the floor and wall with closed-chain
stabilization exercise, static strengthening, and functional activity. According to
Dewhurst<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, in patients with
impingement syndrome, changes in functional ability of the muscles can aggravate the
illness, and the factors affecting the subacromial space are a shortened pectoralis muscle,
levator scapulae, thoracic vertebra kyphosis and bad posture. They proprsed strengthening of
the suprasupinatus, and the compressive pressure of the scapulohumeral joint, as a remedy,
and noted that stability and mobility of the infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis,
which is a rotator cuff muscle, and the interaction of the serratus anterior, upper
trapezius, and lower trapezius are required for effective adaption of scapular rotation.</p><p>McClure et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a progressive
exercise program for a period of six weeks, in which subjects performed resistive muscle
strengthening, stretching, and posture exercise and received education in the performance of
a home exercise program. After the intervention, the subjects range of motion of internal
rotation, external rotation, and abduction showed significant increases (p&#x0003c;0.001), Ginn
et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup> compared an exercise group and a
control group, in a study using exercises for the rotator cuff of the shoulder joint muscle,
which is critical for shoulder joint stability, and evaluated function, stretching of
shortened muscles, and strengthening of weakened muscles. Reeducation for the scapulohumeral
rhythm was also conducted during performance of the upper limb exercise. Subjects in the
exercise group showed a significant increase (p&#x0003c;0.001) in ROM, ROM showed an increase of
22&#x000b0; (p=0.006) without pain, and flexion showed an increase of 11&#x000b0; (p=0.04). Lombardi et
al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, who conducted a study of
subjects who performed progressive resistance exercise for flexion, extension, internal
rotation, and external rotation two times a week for a period of two months, reported a
significant increase in the subjects' range of motion of abduction and extension (p=0.001,
p=0.022). In our present study, a significant increase was observed in the range of motion
of subjects in the experimental and control groups who performed stability exercise for the
shoulder (p&#x0003c;0.05). The range of motion showed a significant increase (p&#x0003c;0.05) after
participation in the exercise program, which was in agreement with results reported in
previous research.</p><p>Wang et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup> instructed patients in
performance of muscle strengthening and stretching, and reported a significant increase of
muscle strength in horizontal abduction, internal rotation, and external rotation
(p&#x0003c;0.01). Ba&#x0015f;kurt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted
stretching, strengthening exercise, and scapular stabilization exercise for patients with
shoulder joint syndrome. Their experimental subjects showed a significant increase
(p&#x0003c;0.005) in muscle strength. Our present study compared subjects in an experimental
group and a control group who performed stability exercises for the shoulder. Our
experimental subjects showed a significant increase in muscle strength (p&#x0003c;0.05), compared
with before performance of the stability exercise, in agreement with results reported in
previous research. This result indicates that interaction and combination of forces around
the shoulder joint work effectively in the performance of stability exercise, effectively
improving muscle strength.</p><p>Sporrong et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that the
grasping power test is very useful in the clinical evaluation of patients with shoulder
joint pain. In our present study, one patient could not perform 180 degrees of shoulder
joint. Therefore, grasping power was measured in a relaxed position, in which both arms were
placed naturally beside the body. Subjects in the exercise and control groups who performed
stability exercise for the shoulder showed a significant increase (p&#x0003c;0.05) in grasping
power, compared with before performance of the stability exercise.</p><p>The results of our present research indicate there are significant effects of shoulder
stability exercise with regard to increase of range of motion, muscle strength, and grasping
power. This research provides useful data on shoulder joint damage and prevention of damage
to the shoulder joint for practitioners in clinical rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Kisner</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname> Colby</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name></person-group>: Therapeutic exercise.
