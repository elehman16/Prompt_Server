However, VKAs have a narrow therapeutic window, numerous drug and food interactions, and require routine monitoring and dose adjustments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Heparins require parenteral administration, which can be difficult when chronic use is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Dabigatran etexilate is an oral pro-drug, which is rapidly converted to dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Dabigatran has predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic properties, is predominantly excreted renally and has a half-life of 12&#x02013;17 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It does not require anticoagulation monitoring or multiple dose adjustments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Dabigatran etexilate has a similar safety and efficacy profile to enoxaparin sodium for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after knee or hip replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily shows superiority to warfarin in moderate to high risk patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) in reducing the risk of stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) and systemic embolism and intracranial haemorrhage, without an increase in major bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Drugs may induce QT prolongation, which can result in adverse cardiac events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The QT interval indirectly represents ventricular depolarization and subsequent re-polarization; prolonged QT intervals can increase the risk of cardiac pro-arrhythmias such as <italic>torsade de pointes</italic>, which may result in sudden death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, there are no previously published evaluations of the effect of dabigatran on cardiac repolarization that are considered compliant with regulatory standards [International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E14 Guidance] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In pre-clinical studies, supratherapeutic dabigatran [up to 3 mg/kg intravenously; nearly 100 times the median effective dose (ED<sub>50</sub>)] had no influence on cardiovascular parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In isolated guinea pig papillary muscles, no noteworthy changes in QT interval were observed with dabigatran stimulation [concentrations up to 10 &#x003bc;mol/L, approximately 2,000-fold the inhibition constant (K<sub>i</sub>) for thrombin], indicating a lack of effect on cardiac ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As blockade of the human <italic>Ether-&#x000e0;-go-go</italic>-Related Gene (hERG)-mediated potassium current is the most common mechanism of drug-induced prolongation of the myocardial action potential and QT-interval prolongation, data showing that dabigatran did not modify the hERG-mediated potassium current in human embryonic kidney cells agree with the previously mentioned pre-clinical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that dabigatran does not prolong QT intervals in pre-clinical evaluations.</p><p>Studies to evaluate the effects of drugs on cardiac repolarization and the QT interval are designed to detect modest changes on the ECG. Consequently, they are generally randomized, conducted in healthy subjects, and include a placebo and an active positive-control group. The current study was performed specifically to assess the electrophysiological effects of clinical and supratherapeutic doses of dabigatran etexilate (150 mg and 600 mg, respectively) compared with placebo and the active control moxifloxacin in healthy subjects. It was conducted in 2006 as part of the clinical development of dabigatran etexilate and was previously published as an abstract and presented as a poster at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in 2011.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Randomized Treatments</title><p>This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, four-treatment, four-period crossover study.

The time point &#x02212;0.5 was used as the time-matched baseline for the 24-h time point. ECGs were recorded digitally, in compliance with regulatory guidance for annotated digital ECGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], using a Corina CardioSoft electrocardiograph (ECG) and MUSE CV cardiology system (General Electric Medical Systems, Freiburg, Germany). ECG readings were sent electronically to a central laboratory for semi-automated interval measurement (using manual over-read of automatically determined fiducial interval marks) of R wave to R wave (RR), PR, QRS and QT intervals.</p><p>For each ECG, the ECG intervals were determined from four wave forms, preferably in lead II. Hence, the triplicate ECG recordings resulted in data from 12 wave forms. The average of these values formed the ECG interval endpoints for each of the time points.

Global tolerability was reported as &#x02018;good&#x02019; for all subjects and with all treatments, except for one subject who responded &#x02018;not satisfactory&#x02019; after receiving moxifloxacin. A total of 21 subjects experienced at least one adverse event. All adverse events were of mild intensity and all subjects fully recovered. Five subjects reported adverse events during screening: headache (<italic>n</italic> = 3), back pain, allergic reaction (<italic>n</italic> = 1 each). During the three washout periods, adverse events were reported on ten occasions: herpes labialis (<italic>n</italic> = 3), headache (<italic>n</italic> = 2), flatulence, puncture-site pain, influenza-like symptoms, hayfever, diarrhoea (<italic>n</italic> = 1 each). Within the treatment period, adverse events were reported in three subjects (7.5&#x000a0;%) receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg (headache, heartburn, puncture-site haematoma) and four (10&#x000a0;%) receiving dabigatran etexilate 600 mg [puncture-site haematoma, hypermenorrhea, application-site allergy (i.e. electrode contact site), heartburn and headache]. One subject (2.5&#x000a0;%) reported &#x02018;feeling dazed&#x02019; with moxifloxacin; dizziness and thoracic pain was recorded for one subject (2.5 %) receiving placebo. All bleeding events and the moxifloxacin-related adverse events were deemed to be drug related. Seven female subjects belatedly reported increased menstrual flow; no correlation with dabigatran etexilate treatment was apparent. There were no deaths and no serious or significant adverse events reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of dabigatran etexilate prolong the QT interval. Dabigatran etexilate 150 mg once daily is the lower of two doses available for primary VTE prevention following elective hip and knee replacement surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily is a dose approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Based on previous PK studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], 600 mg once daily was adopted as the supratherapeutic dose. Additionally, a single rather than a multiple [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] supratherapeutic dose design was adopted, allowing a higher maximum plasma level of the drug without compromising safety. In a pilot study, this dose resulted in a two- to threefold increase in the main coagulation parameter (activated partial thromboplastin time) achieved at 2&#x02013;4 h post-dose. Higher doses were deemed inappropriate because the bleeding risk increases dose dependently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>The PK results confirmed that the C<sub>max</sub> after administering dabigatran etexilate 600 mg was approximately fourfold higher than that achieved with the 150-mg dose. This C<sub>max</sub> is also 2.6 or 4 times higher than the steady-state concentration in patients receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily (146 ng/mL) or once daily (99.2 ng/mL), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, it is unlikely that the C<sub>max</sub> in clinical use would usually exceed that of the supratherapeutic dose tested. Dabigatran etexilate has been administered to healthy volunteers at single doses up to 400 mg and multiple doses up to 400 mg three times daily for 6 days. The pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of dabigatran etexilate predicted the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran; indeed, no time-dependent changes were observed in the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran after multiple dosing, despite accumulation seen with the three-times-daily regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Although using single rather than multiple dosing might be considered a limitation in the design of thorough QT studies, a single-dose approach using a four-period crossover has been employed to test QT prolongation with other medications such as rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The rivaroxaban QT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] also employed the positive control moxifloxacin 400 mg and a placebo. While our study used a fourfold supratherapeutic dose of dabigatran etexilate, the rivaroxaban study used a threefold supratherapeutic dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Whereas the population in our study ranged in age from 24 to 53 years, the patients in the rivaroxaban trial were at least 50 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although most patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery or who have AF tend to be over 60 years of age, dabigatran etexilate is also being assessed for VTE treatment and these patients are likely to cover a wider age range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, this current safety study is relevant for patients who could potentially receive dabigatran etexilate in the future.</p><p>The control, moxifloxacin, was administered as commercially available capsules, with ECG recorded up to 6 h post-dose (rather than 24 h for dabigatran) and no pharmacokinetic sampling. Thus, treatment was double-blind for the two doses of dabigatran etexilate and placebo and open-label for moxifloxacin. Open-label assessment of moxifloxacin effects is a possible limitation of the study. Nonetheless, ECG intervals were measured in a fully blinded fashion at a central laboratory. The laboratory was audited to ensure that their blinding process for ECG evaluation was carried out correctly.</p><p>The primary formula used to correct the QT interval for heart rate was different than in other QT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A study of the direct thrombin inhibitor AZD0837 in patients with atrial flutter used the Fridericia (QTcF) formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although both Fridericia and Bazett (QTcB) correction formulas are widely used, their accuracy and use have been criticized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Thus, a formula using subject-specific baseline data for calculating the QT interval (QTcI) was primarily employed, similar to that used for the rivaroxaban QT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A recent white paper on QT interval correction in the presence of drug-induced heart rate changes has been published since we conducted our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although we could have used an alternative method of heart rate correction as the primary formula, we have shown in our evaluation of different methods that this would have had very limited impact on the study results.</p><p>The primary endpoint of our study demonstrated non-inferiority for both doses of dabigatran etexilate (150 mg and 600 mg) compared with placebo. The upper limit of the 95&#x000a0;% CI was approximately 1.5 ms, which was significantly below the usual 10-ms margin for non-inferiority. Both doses of dabigatran etexilate were also non-inferior to placebo for the secondary endpoints. The upper limit of 95&#x000a0;% CI was below 4 ms, which was clearly lower than the 10-ms margin for non-inferiority. Furthermore, and as stated in the ICH E14 Guideline, drugs that prolong the mean QT or QTcl by around 5 ms or less do not appear to cause <italic>torsade de pointes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Results from our study show that treatment with dabigatran etexilate does not prolong the QT interval by more than 5 ms, hence is not expected to treat serious cardiac pro-arrhythmias; this can therefore be termed a negative thorough QT study.</p><p>For the positive control moxifloxacin, the mean CfB of QTcI between 1.5 and 3 h post-dose was 9.4 ms, and 14.2 ms when compared with placebo. For all treatments and time intervals, changes in heart rate were nominal and within the range of &#x000b1; 2.0 bpm. These findings are indicative of the robustness of the QT analyses performed in this study. The adverse events observed are consistent with those previously reported in trials examining the tolerability and safety of dabigatran etexilate at therapeutic or fourfold supratherapeutic doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. No adverse event led to premature study discontinuation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that therapeutic (150 mg) and supratherapeutic (600 mg) doses of dabigatran etexilate are not associated with QT prolongation or arrhythmogenic effects. The risk of potential events related to QT prolongation or cardiac repolarization effects of dabigatran etexilate is therefore considered to be very low.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>The study was presented at the 60th Annual Scientific Session of the American College of Cardiology and the abstract has been published (J Am Coll Cardiol 2011;57: 56).</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The study was sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc.
