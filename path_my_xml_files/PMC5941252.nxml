Schools from disadvantaged neighbourhoods are oversampled. The intervention consists of 9 sessions, including 58 activities of a total duration between 9 and 13 hours, and the booster intervention of 2 sessions with 8 activities lasting 3 or 4 hours. They are multilevel (individual, family and school) and multicomponent (classroom, physical activity and family). Data are collected through anthropometric measurements, physical fitness tests and lifestyle surveys before and after the intervention and the booster intervention. In the intervention group, families complete two questionnaires about their children&#x02019;s eating habits and physical activity. The outcome variable is the cumulative incidence rate of obesity, obtained from body mass index values and body fat assessed by triceps skinfold thickness. The independent variables are socio-demographic, contextual, eating habits, food frequency, intensity of physical activity and use of new technologies.</p></sec><sec><title>Expected impact for public health</title><p>It is essential to implement preventive interventions at early ages and to follow its effects over time.

Of importance, obesity is more common among disadvantaged neighbourhoods and it is precisely these environments that have the lowest involvement in preventive interventions. Consequently, it is very important to target these populations when designing an intervention. This study will provide an evaluated childhood obesity intervention which includes the perspective of gender and social inequalities. In addition, a sustainability plan has been developed for the intervention. It is planned that, in the near future, the intervention and its reinforcement are part of the set of health educational programmes offered by the Ag&#x000e8;ncia de Salut P&#x000fa;blica de Barcelona (Spain) to schools, with funding both the cost of the training and the materials borne by the Ag&#x000e8;ncia.</p></boxed-text></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>School-based intervention programme</kwd><kwd>Evaluation</kwd><kwd>Lifestyle</kwd><kwd>Eating habits</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding: the study has been partially funded by the Fondo de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Sanitaria (PI09/02259), of the Carlos III Health Institute (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Spanish Government) and by the Ag&#x000e8;ncia de Salut P&#x000fa;blica de Barcelona.

Overweight or obese children are more likely to remain obese in adulthood and to have cardiovascular disease at younger ages.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>In the last few decades, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has steadily increased in most developed countries. A study in 6- to 9-year-olds from 12 European countries participating in the European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI) of the World Health Organisation (WHO) concluded that the prevalence of overweight (including obesity) ranged from 19.3% to 49% in boys and from 18.4% to 42.5% in girls, depending on the country. For obesity, the prevalence ranged from 6.0% to 26.6% in boys and from 4.6% to 17.3% in girls. These data show a north-south pattern with the highest prevalence of obesity in southern European countries.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Spain has one of the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity in Europe. The enKid study<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> found that, among 2- to 24- year-old, 12.4% were overweight and 13.9% were obese in 2000, while a more recent study in 2012<sup>4</sup> showed that, among 8- to 17- year-olds, 26.0% were overweight and 12.6% were obese.</p><p>The causes of overweight and obesity are multifactorial, with multiple complex determinants. The main social factors supported by evidence are having a disadvantaged socioeconomic status (SES), and belonging to an immigrant or a single-parent family.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Genetic and family factors such as maternal overweight during pregnancy<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and not having been breastfeed play an important role in the development of childhood obesity.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Additionally, notable lifestyle-related determinants are those linked to eating habits, unhealthy food, low physical activity,<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> excessive screen time (which encourages a sedentary lifestyle)<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and fewer hours of sleep.</p><p>Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of the association between weight and size, which varies depending on age and gender and is considered the main indicator of weight problems. BMIbased definitions of overweight and obesity are clear in adults but controversial in children. In Spain, the curves and tables of the Orbegozo Foundation<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> have been used in clinical practice. In recent years, the WHO has encouraged the use of the z-scores,<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> which are based on standard deviations (SD). Nevertheless, some authors argue that body fat distribution, measured by skinfold thickness, may be a more sensitive and simpler obesity indicator in children aged 6 to 10 years.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>A Cochrane systematic review on interventions for preventing obesity in children showed that the most effective interventions are those addressed to children aged 6 to12 years old and most of them are based on theories of behaviour change and developed at school. Most interventions include content related to diet (88%) or programs related to physical activity (88%) and almost 100% apply content on healthy lifestyle. In addition, evidence is needed on the long-term effects of these interventions, beyond three years, as well as on knowing the impact of each component on multifactor interventions.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>There are few studies on the prevalence of childhood obesity in Spanish and Catalan child population with representative samples. <sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Additionally, none of these studies deepens in the differences between advantaged and disadvantaged populations. Therefore, the childhood obesity prevention programme in Barcelona (POIBA Project) aims to determine the true prevalence of the problem and to devise solutions. The conceptual framework of the project is based on Dahlgren and Whitehead&#x02019;s 1991 model of social determinants.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Likewise, the POIBA Project includes a school-based intervention, in which most determinants are those relating to lifestyles, addressing mainly those of behavioural kind. The aim of this paper is to describe in detail the methodology of the POIBA project and the intervention designed in its framework.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>General objective of the project POIBA</title><p>The childhood obesity prevention programme in Barcelona (POIBA Project) aims to design and evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel (individual, family and school level) and multicomponent (classroom, physical activity and family) intervention to prevent overweight and obesity among 8- to 12-year-olds.

Effects of the intervention in a group of schoolchildren, the Intervention Group, are compared with another group not exposed to the intervention, the Comparison Group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Study population and setting</title><p>The study involves 4139 pupils from 104 schools in Barcelona aged 8-9 years at baseline, of which 3624 were enrolled in the study (a non-response rate of 12.4%). The main causes of non-participation were parental refusal to allow their children to participate in the study and pupil absence from the classroom at the time of data collection.</p><p>Among the 10 districts of the city, 4 of them were conveniently assigned to the IG and the other 6 to the CG, in order to oversample the schools located in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Once it was decided which districts of the city would be part of the IG and which of the CG, the schools located in those districts were randomly selected. The IG was composed of 1633 children in 47 schools (75 classrooms). In this group, half the schoolchildren attend schools located in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The CG was composed of 1991 children attending 57 schools (97 classrooms) where, similar to the IG, half of the schools were randomly selected from disadvantaged neighbourhoods, to achieve comparability between the IG and the CG. The composition of the sample at different stages of the project is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig001">Figure 1</xref>. SES was measured according to the Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI),<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> an ecological indicator that measures the average family purchasing power for each neighbourhood; neighbourhoods with a GDHI &#x02265;85 are considered to be advantaged and those &#x0003c;85 to be disadvantaged. The sample was stratified according to the SES of the neighbourhood of the school, its ownership (state or subsidised) and the size or number of year 4 primary school classrooms. The schools were randomly selected following the same distribution of these strata for schoolchildren in the city. Others schools belonging to the same SES and type of school replaced those that refused to participate in the study.</p><p>The project begun in January 2009, when pupils were 8-9 years old, and it is planned to follow-up the students until they are 17-18 years old.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The project has been evaluated and approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Parc de Salut Mar (CEIC-Parc Salut Mar), reference number 2009/3470/l.</p><p>During the study, national and international guidelines are followed (codes of professional ethics, the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and subsequent revisions). Additionally, the Spanish law on data confidentiality was observed (Law 15/1999 of 13 December on Personal Data Protection). Parents provided signed consent for their children to participate in the project. All information is protected by using data management and information storage procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Sample size calculation and final study sample</title><p>A sample size of 2450 schoolchildren allows detection of a 3- point decrease in the prevalence of obesity (for example, a reduction in prevalence from 10.4% to 7.4%) with an alpha error of 5 (error type I of 0.05) and statistical power of 80 (type II of 0.20 error), assuming 15% of losses between the initial examination and the post-intervention. In the analysis, the intraclass correlation involving group sampling will be taken into account. A total of 40 schools and 100 classrooms in each group were required to obtain 2450 schoolchildren in each group. Other factors influencing school selection were the type of school (state or subsidised) and the size or number of year 4 primary school classrooms. Therefore, the required study sample size was 4900 students, with 2450 students in each group (40 schools, 100 classrooms).</p><p>In practice, the schools enrolled in the study have a total of 4139 schoolchildren because, in some strata, the schools refused to participate and the possibilities of replacing them were exhausted. Of these 4139 students, 3624 participate in the study, representing a non-participation rate of 12.4%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Study development</title><p>A pilot study was conducted in 92 children aged between 9 and 10 years attending year 5 in two schools of Terrassa (Catalonia, Spain).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Intervention</title><p>The global intervention <italic>We grow up healthy</italic> was developed by taking into consideration the characteristics and specific needs of people with low SES and from immigrant communities. The intervention is multilevel (individual, family and school) and multicomponent (classroom, physical activity and family) and is addressed to year 5 pupils.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The main contents are those related to promoting a healthy diet and proper energy balance, the practice of at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily, a maximum of 2 hours screen time and a minimum of 9 hours of sleep per night. A detailed description of the intervention is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table001">Table 1</xref>.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Individual level</title><p>The <italic>classroom intervention</italic> is implemented in the classroom throughout the school year by a teacher previously trained by staff at the Ag&#x000e8;ncia de Salut P&#x000fa;blica de Barcelona. The sessions are divided into three work modules, consisting of 58 activities distributed into nine teaching sessions with an overall duration of between 9 and 13 hours. The sessions last between 55 and 110 minutes. Each module presents activities for the classroom and the family environment. The first module consists of two sessions and focuses on personal growth and body image, the second module consists of five sessions on diet (food and nutrition) and the third is composed of two sessions on physical activity and rest. In the case of immigrant families, the specific needs taken into consideration have to do mainly with their eating habits. In the design of these activities cultural diversity was taken into account so that schoolchildren belonging to immigrant communities could be represented. Thus, as an example, the breakfast session included foods consumed by other cultures such as Arabic bread in the case of cereals or papaya and mango in the case of fruits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>physical activity intervention</italic> is applied by physical education teachers with the support of the Ag&#x000e8;ncia de Salut P&#x000fa;blica de Barcelona. It seeks to intensify physical activity during school hours, after school and in leisure time among pupils. The project funds extracurricular activities to those pupils whose families have economic difficulties. These activities were chosen by each beneficiary family based on the children&#x02019;s preferences, with the most popular being soccer, basketball and swimming.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Family level</title><p>Families collaborate by carrying out some activities from the family booklet and participating in a workshop which aimes to provide families with skills and strategies to achieve a healthy, full and balanced diet and to improve their sleep hygiene.

The CIR is defined as the change in the percentage of children with childhood overweight or obesity between baseline and follow-up. It is constructed from the values of BMI and triceps skinfold thickness. BMI is calculated based on weight and height and according to age and gender, following the WHO z-score definitions,<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> which are based on standard deviations (SD). In addition, data on triceps skinfold thickness are calculated according to percentiles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Independent variables</title><p>The independent variables are obtained from questionnaires and physical fitness tests.</p><p>Both questionnaires collect individual sociodemographic variables and contextual variables. POIBA-How do we eat? collects variables related to eating habits and food frequency. Information on physical activity in school, after school and in free time and use of new technologies is collected through the <italic>POIBA-How do we move</italic>? questionnaire. The variables gathered by the physical fitness examination are those relating to the results obtained by the schoolchildren in the six tests that composed the batteries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Data analysis</title><p>A descriptive and bivariate analysis will be conducted between the independent and dependent variables. Chi-square Pearson contrasts will be used to observe relationships among the variables studied, with significance set at 5%. The Cohen test will be used to indicate the standardised effect size. Bivariate logistic regression models will be calculated between overweight and obesity and social determinants and lifestyle, obtaining odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. A multivariate logistic regression model will be adjusted with the significant variables in the bivariate analysis. The possible interactions in the model will be taken into account. A generalised estimating equation will be used to estimate the parameters of a generalised linear model with a possible unknown correlation between outcomes. Finally, multilevel models are appropriate for research designs that organise data for participants at more than one level (<italic>i.e.</italic>, nested data). The units of analysis will be individuals (at a lower level) who are nested within contextual/aggregate units (at a higher level). All analyses will be stratified by sex. Data will be analysed using the statistical packages SPSS v.13 and Stata/SE v.13.1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Discussion</title><p>Obesity has become one of the main public health problems in Spain, because it affects a high percentage of our child and adult population.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2-4</xref></sup> This problem is most prevalent among disadvantaged and immigrant populations. Because childhood and adolescent obesity is a predictor of adult obesity, preventive interventions should be implemented at an early age. Most interventions addressed to children younger than 10 years are school-based. In 2006, Flynn <italic>et al.</italic> reviewed the actions that can be carried out in childhood and youth to reduce obesity and associated chronic diseases. <sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Among these activities, the most common were those related to food education and the practice of physical activity, the school being the main setting to achieve a positive impact. The design of the POIBA Project is in line with these guidelines. This project is a school-based childhood obesity prevention programme that aims to provide children and their families with the knowledge, skills and means necessary to make healthy life choices in terms of food, physical activity, rest and screen viewing.</p><p>Defining overweight and obesity is more difficult in the child than in the adult population. This is due to the difficulty of establishing clear criteria for the paediatric age group to classify persons as overweight or obese based on BMI, which is the main indicator of weight problems, since BMI cannot distinguish between lean and fat body mass. Consequently, some authors argue that distribution of body fat is a more sensitive indicator than BMI for determining body fatness in children and adolescents, for monitoring obesity in children and for predicting high adult body fatness.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The percentage of body fat can be calculated based on the height, weight and thickness measurements of four skinfolds (biceps, triceps, subscapular and suprailiac).<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> If only one skinfold can be measured, it is recommended to use the triceps skinfold.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Thus, in the POIBA Project, the triceps skinfold measurement is also carried out, since its measurement is feasible and relatively inexpensive.</p><p>Some school-based childhood obesity preventive interventions, in which an improvement of the unhealthy habits has been shown, have been carried out in our country<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and Europe<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> previously. The contribution of the POIBA Project intervention to these studies is based on the fact that it is a multilevel and multi-component intervention addressed to children from 8 to 12 years old, which allows to involve in the activities not only the children but also their families and the school community.</p><p>Our study has several methodological limitations. Those concerning the intervention include the difficulties arising from the absence of a regular education schedule for health in school. Nevertheless, about one third of the school population of the cohort born in 2002 participate in the study. Even though randomisation is not an essential criterion in evaluative studies, one of the possible evaluation drawbacks could be that the CG and the IG could not be randomised because there had been contamination between groups. However, to minimise this effect, the schools were randomly selected and stratified by the main confounding factors and the cluster-randomization was taken into account in the sample size calculation. Information bias is common in self-reported questionnaires but both questionnaires have been previously validated. Finally, because this is a follow-up study, another possible limitation could be data matching attrition but this has been minimised to 25% to 30%.</p><p>A major strength of the study is that it is the first to obtain data on overweight, obesity and its main determinants in children in a large sample of the city of Barcelona. Additionally, this study is part of a broader project that will address the prevention of childhood obesity in preschool and primary schoolchildren, addressing individual, family, school and community components, following them until the adolescence. Another important strength is that a sustainability plan has been developed for the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-7"><title>Expected impact on public health</title><p>Prevention of childhood obesity is one of the main aims in current health policies due to its increased prevalence in our environment. The POIBA Project focuses on education on nutrition and physical activity, the latter being the critical intervention in programmes for the prevention and reduction of childhood obesity. This project focuses specifically on the most disadvantaged groups, which are most at risk and which receive the least support. It also intervenes in the family and school environment. Thus, the current project, based on theoretical design models and especially focused on reducing inequalities through economically sustainable and feasible actions, could become a local and national model for preventive intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the schools for their collaboration in the project, the staff of the Terrassa City Council Department of Community Health for their strong involvement in the pilot study, the nurses of the Community Health Department of the Ag&#x000e8;ncia de Salut P&#x000fa;blica de Barcelona who established contacts with the schools and are involved in the body composition examinations.
