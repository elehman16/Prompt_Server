Untreated sleep disturbances can contribute to the maintenance and exacerbation of PTSD symptoms, which may diminish treatment response and constitute a risk factor for poor treatment outcome. Controlled trials on treatment of sleep disturbances in refugees suffering from PTSD are scarce. The present study aims to examine sleep-enhancing treatment in refugees with PTSD. We aim to assess if add-on treatment with mianserin and/or Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) to treatment as usual (TAU) for PTSD improves sleep disturbances. We will study the relation between sleep disturbances, PTSD symptoms, psychosocial functioning and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study is a randomised controlled superiority trial with a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial design.

All four groups receive TAU &#x02013; an interdisciplinary treatment approach covering a period of 6&#x02013;8 months with pharmacological treatment, physiotherapy, psychoeducation and manual-based cognitive behavioural therapy within a framework of weekly sessions with a physician, physiotherapist or psychologist. One group receives solely TAU, serving as a control group, while the three remaining groups are active-treatment groups receiving add-on treatment with either mianserin, IRT or a combination of both.</p><p id="Par4">Treatment outcome is evaluated using self-administered rating scales, observer ratings and actigraph measurements at baseline, during treatment and post treatment. The primary outcome is subjective sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Secondary outcome measures are objective sleep length, nightmares, PTSD severity, symptoms of depression and anxiety, pain, quality of life and psychosocial functioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par5">This trial will be the first randomised controlled trial to examine sleep-enhancing treatment in trauma-affected refugees, as well as the first trial to investigate the effect of IRT and mianserin in this population. Therefore, this trial may optimise treatment recommendations for sleep disturbances in trauma-affected refugees. Based on our findings, we expect to discuss the effect of treatment, focussing on sleep disturbances. Furthermore, the results will provide new information regarding the association between sleep disturbances, PTSD symptoms, psychosocial functioning and quality of life in trauma-affected refugees.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par6">EudraCT registration under the name &#x02018;Treatment of sleep disturbances in trauma-affected refugees &#x02013; a randomised controlled trial&#x02019;, registration number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2015-004153-40">2015-004153-40</ext-link>, registered on 13 November 2015.</p><p id="Par7">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02761161.

Approximately 22.5 million of these people became refugees. These numbers are currently increasing every year, primarily due to the conflict in Syria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">It is estimated that roughly 30% of the world&#x02019;s refugees suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and often of a more chronic form, compared to other populations suffering from PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Refugees are a heterogeneous group in terms of cultural background and country of origin, but share the experience of being forcibly displaced from their country of origin and in this matter differ from other groups being exposed to traumas, who continue to live under familiar and safe conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Refugees differ from populations with single or few traumatic experiences by often having experienced prolonged and repeated traumas pre-migration, during migration and continue to live under post-migration stressors, such as uncertainty about asylum status and temporary residence, concern about their families still unsafe in their home country, cultural and language difficulties, and perceived discrimination and racism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Clinical guidelines for treatment, derived from research on other populations fail to account for the specific circumstances experienced by refugees, and cannot be assumed to apply to trauma-affected refugees in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Sleep disturbances</title><p id="Par41">Sleep disturbances are often referred to as a hallmark and as core symptoms of PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

In a sample of 752 trauma-affected refugees undergoing psychiatric treatment at Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry (CTP), Mental Health Services in the Capital Region of Denmark, in the period 2008&#x02013;2012, 99% reported sleep disturbances and recurrent nightmares [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Sleep disturbances comprise problems initiating and maintaining sleep, nightmares, early awakening and, consequently, reduced length and quality of sleep.

Sleep disturbances often persist post treatment. For instance, as many as 48% of patients treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for PTSD reported residual insomnia post treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Sleep disturbances may also affect the efficacy of first-line PTSD treatment and constitute a risk factor for poor outcome of psychiatric treatment. It has been argued that targeting sleep disturbances in treatment may lead to the alleviation of PTSD symptoms in general and accelerate PTSD recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Furthermore, sleep disturbances in PTSD are found to be related to increased psychiatric comorbidity, including alcohol use disorder, and poor health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Sleep disturbances have consequences not only for the individual, by compromising social and vocational functioning and quality of life, but also from a socioeconomic perspective due to reduced productivity, increased absence from work and increased rates of unemployment and early retirement pensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

However, most studies did not evaluate changes in sleep-related outcomes. Reviews on pharmacological treatment of sleep disturbances in PTSD have concluded that antidepressants, benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics are not beneficial. Only treatment with prazosin (a selective &#x003b1;-1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) has been found effective in more than one randomised controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Prazosin, however, is not marketed in Denmark and is not available for treatment.</p><p id="Par49">In an attempt to relieve sleep disturbances, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics are often prescribed despite side effects and uncertainty about long-term efficiency. Benzodiazepine side effects include development of tolerance, risk of dependence, withdrawal symptoms and cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Histamine H<sub>1</sub>-inverse agonist (i.e. strong antihistamine effects) and alfa<sub>1</sub>-antagonist activity is thought to be responsible for the sedative quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">In a large-scale trial evaluating treatment of trauma-affected refugees at CTP, treatment with sertraline and add-on treatment with mianserin showed significant improvement of sleep-related items on self-reported ratings (The World Health Organisation-Five Well-being Index (WHO-5), The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) and Hopkins Symptom Check List-23 (HSCL-25)), but due to the study design it was not possible to evaluate whether this was an effect of mianserin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An academic literature review did not identify any other studies in which people suffering from PTSD were treated with mianserin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is thus a need for further studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Psychotherapeutic intervention</title><p id="Par52">Due to a high acceptability in patients and a lack of side effects, CBT is recommended as both first-line treatment of primary sleep disturbances, prior to pharmacological treatment, and as first-line treatment of PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Most studies on the psychotherapeutic treatment of PTSD have not evaluated sleep-related outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Current CBT for PTSD does not focus on sleep disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As a consequence, a number of psychotherapeutic interventions targeting sleep disturbances and nightmares have been developed. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia in PTSD (CBT-I) and Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) have shown promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
