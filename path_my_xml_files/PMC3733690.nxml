Cost effectiveness analysis: The cost-effectiveness of the AFLY5 intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality checking, cleaning data and deriving variables</title><p>Identical cleaning/QC and variable derivation procedures will be used for data that were collected at baseline (completed May&#x02013;October 2011), first follow-up (completed May&#x02013;September 2012) and second follow-up (planned for February-July 2013).</p></sec><sec><title>Accelerometer data</title><p>Accelerometer data will be analysed using appropriate software (e.g. Kinesoft).</p><p>In both studies of children and adults different methods are used for deriving accelerometer outcome variables in different studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Differences occur in:</p><p>&#x02022;The epoch (time) length of recorded bouts of data</p><p>&#x02022;What period of records of consecutive zero movement/counts are taken to indicate a participant has removed the accelerometer (these periods are removed from the calculation of hours wear per day)</p><p>&#x02022;Number of hours per day that are considered to provide valid wake-time wear for derivation of outcomes</p><p>&#x02022;Number of days that the accelerometer should be worn to provide valid total wear time for derivation of outcomes</p><p>&#x02022;The thresholds of counts per minute of activity that are used to define MVPA and sedentary behaviour</p><p>Whilst the considerable research in this area highlights how different decisions for these issues result in different mean levels of outcomes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we could find no evidence that considered what effect (if any) these differences might have on the results in epidemiological association studies or in intervention studies, such as AFLY5. In a well-conducted randomised controlled trial, we would expect all participant characteristics, other than the intervention, to be the same by randomised group (other than differences that may occur due to chance). Thus, the particular accelerometer criteria that are used for all participants in a RCT should not influence the effect of the intervention on outcomes. That is we would expect differences in characteristics such as return of accelerometer, wear-time, number of periods of a given time of consistent zero levels of activity, etc., to be similar between children from schools randomised to control and those randomised to the intervention. We will test this assumption in AFLY5 (see Section 2.2 and dummy table in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1).</p><p>Consequently, in AFLY5 we have selected all criteria related to wear time on the basis of face validity relevant to our study population and consistent with the instructions given to the children about wearing the accelerometer, as suggested in a recent review
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Our thresholds for defining time spent in MVPA and in sedentary behaviour are based on a literature review conducted at the time of writing this protocol. A recent review of calibration and validation studies in children for determining the thresholds that should be used to define MVPA noted the poor quality of many of these
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Calibration studies of between one to nine participants suggested thresholds for MVPA of between 1,770 to 3,581 counts per minute
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. External validation studies included more participants than the original calibration studies, but were still of small sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30&#x02013;206), often of poor quality and used a variety of comparison methods
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Fewer studies are available of thresholds for defining sedentary behaviour in children. The most recent, and the largest (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;206) and methodologically most sound external validation study to date
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], suggested that the thresholds recommended by Evenson
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] were most valid. We will therefore use the Evenson thresholds for MVPA (&#x02265;2,296 counts per minute) and sedentary behaviour (0&#x02013;100 counts per minute) in AFLY5.</p><p>Further considerations in choosing which criteria to use for deriving accelerometer outcomes are the importance of minimising chance findings due to multiple testing and of potentially compromising statistical efficiency by excluding too many participants for not having valid wear data. We will compare accelerometer characteristics by randomised group to test our assumption that these are similar.</p><sec><title>Criteria that will be used in AFLY5 for deriving accelerometer outcome measurements</title><p>&#x02022;Data collected in 10-s epochs</p><p>&#x02022;A period of &#x02265;60&#x000a0;min of consecutive 0 counts assumed to be non-wear and these periods removed from the measurement of wear-time</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02265;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;h per day to be considered to have valid wear-time for a given day</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02265;&#x02009;3 valid days in total</p><p>&#x02022;MVPA defined as &#x02265;2,296 counts per minute</p><p>&#x02022;Sedentary behaviour defined as 0 to 100 counts per minute</p><p>Once the key outcomes &#x02013; time spent in MVPA and in sedentary behaviour &#x02013; have been derived using the accelerometer software they will be exported from that software into Stata, and &#x02018;general&#x02019; cleaning and checking of the distributions of these variables will be undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Cleaning/QC of the accelerometer derived variables will include</title><p>&#x02022;Normal plots, histograms and scatter plots will be used to identify potentially implausible measurements.</p><p>&#x02022;Scatter plots will compare for each variable its baseline and follow-up value and also will compare different variables measured at the same time point that would be expected to be moderately to strongly correlated; time spent in MVPA to time spent in sedentary behaviour, time spent in MVPA to weight and time spent in sedentary behaviour to weight.</p><p>&#x02022;Values that appear outside of the main distribution in the majority of participants (i.e. outliers) on normal plots and histograms will be assumed to be correct if the scatter plots show consistency &#x02013; e.g. lying close to the main &#x02018;line&#x02019; of positive association for the same variable measured at baseline and again at follow-up or the inverse association of time in MVPA with time in sedentary behaviour and close to the main &#x02018;line&#x02019; of inverse association of time spent in MVPA with weight.</p><p>&#x02022;Outliers that deviate from the &#x02018;line&#x02019; of the scatter plots by 2 SD or more on either axis will be considered implausible.</p><p>&#x02022;For implausible values, the original data will be checked in the accelerometer software to make sure criteria have been applied correctly and any errors will be corrected.</p><p>&#x02022;For remaining implausible values a variable that indicates &#x02018;possible implausible value of <italic>X</italic>&#x02019; (where <italic>X</italic> is the name of the variable that has a possible implausible value) will be derived.</p><p>&#x02022;In the main effectiveness analyses we will complete analyses with all participants (including where they have a possible implausible value) included and again with participants excluded for analyses with a given outcome if their value for that outcome has been marked as possibly implausible.</p><p>&#x02022;If removal of participants with possible implausible values results in a change of a magnitude that for that outcome would affect the interpretation/conclusion for that outcome then both sets of results will be reported; otherwise only the results with all included irrespective of &#x02018;implausible value&#x02019; status will be reported.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Diet data</title><p>Questionnaire responses are entered into a Microsoft Access database.</p><sec><title>Initial cleaning</title><p>Is undertaken to assign each food to a food or drink category (e.g. fruit and vegetables) based on the range of spellings (including incorrect spelling) that were identified in the pilot study and during cleaning of the baseline data for this trial.

ITT requires all participants in a clinical trial to be included in the main analyses in the groups to which they were randomised
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This is straightforward if there is no loss to follow-up or missing data on some outcomes at follow-up amongst those who have been randomised, but is less straightforward where there is loss to follow-up/missing data
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A four-point framework for dealing with missing outcome data has recently been proposed to deal with this issue
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It emphasises the fact that all approaches (including complete case analysis &#x02013; i.e. only including those with observed outcome data) &#x02013; rely on assumptions that in any given situation may be more or less plausible but are always untestable. It therefore cautions against a &#x02018;one size fits all&#x02019;, but suggests using the most plausible assumptions about the nature of missing data and then testing these assumptions in sensitivity analyses; in particular it notes that in many cases the most plausible assumptions would support analyses on those with observed data using either mixed (multilevel models) or complete case analyses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Complete case analyses and several of the common methods for imputing/dealing with missing data, including the multilevel linear regression model that we will use here for all primary outcomes, assume that missing data are missing at random (MAR). That is, missing values in participants with missing data are assumed to be similar to observed values in participants with similar levels of other variables that are observed in other participants (i.e. missing is independent of unobserved characteristics). Another way of thinking about this is that the effect of a randomised intervention is the same in those with missing data as in those without missing data. Having similar proportions of participants with missing data in each arm of a trial is reassuring with respect to the MAR assumption being correct, but is not a guarantee, as the plausible reasons for missing data in each arm could be different but result in similar proportions with missing.</p><p>In AFLY5, we minimise the extent of missing data through catch-up data collection &#x02013; i.e. for each participating school at each phase of data collection there is a day for main data collection, but some children may be absent from school on that day; therefore for each school we have &#x02018;catch-up&#x02019; days to obtain data on these children. As a result the likely reasons for missing follow-up data for ALL outcomes (i.e. where a child is not seen at all at one of the follow-up phases) are that the child moves school between data collection phases or the child is absent from school for a prolonged period or frequently so that they miss the main and catch-up data collection days. Missing one or more (but not all) of the specific measurements at follow-up could occur if the child does not give assent, or for the accelerometer-based outcomes the child does not return the accelerometer or does not wear it for a required period of time. In the case of the AFLY5 RCT, MAR is plausible since randomisation is at the level of the schools, parental opt-out consent is ascertained at the start of the study and relevant for all data collection times, and it is implausible that the delivery of the intervention lessons and homework in the intervention schools or lack of these in the control groups would affect the likelihood of a child being absent on days of data collection, declining assent for a particular measure or not returning the accelerometer or wearing to for the required time. Information from the local councils suggests that movement between schools is relatively low, but it is possible that children who move may differ from those who do not on the basis of unobserved characteristics. Children who move school might be from families who are relatively unorganised with children often moving school or they could be from families who move their child from state to private school in year 6 in order to attend private secondary school (Bristol has a higher than average for the UK proportion of children in private secondary school education). The possibility that these types of missing data might bias our findings if not explored will be assessed in sensitivity analyses (see sensitivity analyses 3 and 4 in Table&#x000a0;

For the main approach to all analyses any child with the measured outcome at follow-up will be included; we will do these analyses for each outcome separately so numbers included in the analyses between each outcome may vary. In order to include all children with the follow-up outcome measure (including those with a missing baseline value) and also be able to take account of the baseline value, we will use the method suggesting by White and Thompson for dealing with missing baseline values
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] in the first (immediate) effectiveness analyses and the mediation analyses. In the second (long-term) effectiveness analyses, we will use a repeated measures multilevel modelling approach to examine differences between randomised groups in the change in outcomes over time from baseline, and so missing data at baseline will be taken into account within these models. Both of these approaches assume data are MAR and in addition to these main analyses a number of sensitivity analyses will be undertaken; see Table&#x000a0;

If variables are approximately normally distributed they will be used as they are (i.e. with no transformation). If they are clearly non-normal we will explore transforming them to improve normality of the residuals in the regression models. The choice of whether or not to transform variables, and if so which transformation to use, will be decided by considering: (1) the distribution of the variable, (2) the distribution of residuals from regression models, (3) the ease of interpreting results following any given transformation compared with no transformation and (4) whether main results/conclusions are influenced by the transformation or not. From our pilot and feasibility studies for this trial and considerable experience with the outcome measurements that are used in this trial, we anticipate that all outcomes will be either approximately normally distributed or right (positively) skewed. For right skewed variables that result in markedly non-normal residuals in regression models we would use a natural log transformation and compare results with and without this transformation. If the overall conclusion is not altered by whether the variable is transformed or not, we would use the untransformed (easier to interpret) version. Where variables have been log-transformed, the resulting coefficients will be converted to differences in means on a % scale.</p><p>&#x02022;Use multilevel multivariable linear regression to determine

All aspects of these analyses (except for the way the outcomes are derived) will be the same as the main analyses described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional sensitivity analyses to explore whether there is any evidence that the intervention effect differs by gender and area deprivation</title><p>As noted in the grant application and study protocol paper
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], this RCT is not powered to be able to test the null hypotheses that the intervention works similarly in males and females and by different levels of area deprivation. However, the study funders (NIHR) are interested in whether there is any evidence that it might or not. Therefore the aim of these additional analyses is to explore whether there appears to be differences by gender or deprivation that are sufficiently large that they would warrant funding of a further RCT that was adequately powered to detect them or not. Such a situation would not only require a large difference but would really require the effect to work in one group at a level that would have public health importance but not work in another group (or even be detrimental in another groups). It is unlikely that if the intervention worked in both females and males but was somewhat stronger in one gender than another that would provide sufficient evidence to do a further RCT to confirm that or not as in practice it would be easier to provide the intervention to all children (irrespective of gender) and so such a trial would be unlikely to change practice. These analyses will be reported in the funder monologue (which is peer reviewed, publically available and widely disseminated), but we do not envisage including them in the main effect analysis journal publication due to the lack of statistical power and a concern that they would detract attention from the main results that the trial was powered to assess.

The justification of undertaking these analyses is that we feel that exploring whether the intervention has an effect on mediators that are relevant to this intervention is important for fully understanding the process by which the intervention may work or why it does not work if that turns out to be the case. For example we may find that the intervention is effective and that this is in part mediated by the child&#x02019;s knowledge, but not by self-efficacy. Or we may find that the intervention does not work and also that it has no effect on any of the mediators, which would suggest either that it was poorly delivered or that it does not effectively work on the proximal characteristics that it is expected to work on. To balance the importance of looking at mediation with the fact that our original sample size calculation did not take account of this mediation analysis we consider these analyses to be exploratory and will take account of multiple testing for mediators in these analyses.</p><p>These analyses will be done after the immediate effectiveness analyses (described in Section 2.2 above) and will be published separately alongside qualitative analyses that will also explore whether the intervention worked in the way we would expect it to (see process evaluation plan). The mediation analyses will be conducted by Debbie Lawlor, Laura Howe and Tim Peters, with the expectation that a paper for publication will be submitted in November 2013.</p><p>Mediation will be assessed for the effect of the intervention on the primary outcomes only. This is because we have assessed child reported self-efficacy and parental support for these outcomes only. Mediation analysis assumes that the intervention influences the mediator(s) and through this influence on the mediator produces the effect on the outcome(s). Therefore the first stage in mediation analyses is to examine the effect of the intervention on the mediators (i.e. in these analyses mediators are treated as outcomes &#x02013; dependent variables in the regression analyses).</p><p>To examine mediation we will</p><p>&#x02022;First, determine the effect of the intervention on each of the ten measured mediators (see Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> above).</p><p>&#x02022;Each of these mediators will be treated as a continuously measured variable and in the first stage we will explore the differences in mean scores of each mediator comparing children in the intervention to those in the control schools.</p><p>&#x02022;Distributions of the mediators will be explored and procedures for transforming any that are non-normal will be the same as those used for the continuously measured primary and secondary outcomes, as described in Section 2.2 above.</p><p>&#x02022;Multilevel multivariable linear regression will be used to examine the effect of the intervention on each mediator using the same approach as that used for the continuously measured primary and secondary outcomes, as described in Section 2.2 above.</p><p>&#x02022;In these analyses we will include the following baseline and stratified covariables: age, gender, the baseline measure of each mediator, whether the school is involved in other health promoting activities and school level deprivation. Note: knowledge was not assessed at baseline so there is no baseline measure of this.</p><p>&#x02022;Only the main approach for dealing with missing data (see Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> above) for any one of the mediators will be undertaken.</p><p>&#x02022;As discussed in the section on cleaning these variables we will conduct analyses with and without those who have high levels (see above for definition) of item missingness within scales. Thus, for these analyses we will do one main analysis and one sensitivity analysis (with those who have high levels of item missing data for any mediator removed).</p><p>&#x02022;In these analyses we will correct for multiple testing by adding the ten mediators to the nine secondary outcomes and assuming (two-sided) statistically significant effects with <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.003 (0.05 &#x000f7; 19). In journals we will present <italic>p</italic>-values multiplied by 19 to help interpretation.</p><p>&#x02022;Second, we will explore whether mediators explain the effect of the intervention on outcomes. This second stage will only be conducted if: (1) the intervention has been shown to effect one or more of the primary outcomes (Section 2.2 above) and (2) the intervention has been shown to effect one or more of the mediators relevant to a primary outcome that the intervention has affected (first stage of mediation analyses described above).</p><p>&#x02022;If the two criteria above are fulfilled we will complete multilevel multivariable linear regression exactly as described above in Section 2.2 for the specific outcome fulfilling these criteria. We will then repeat that analysis with any relevant mediator added and compare the effect of the intervention on the outcome before and after adjustment for the mediator.</p><p>&#x02022;Each mediator that has been shown to be affected by the intervention, and that is relevant to an outcome that has also been affected by the intervention, will be added as a single covariable. In addition relevant mediators will then be added simultaneously in one final mediation model. For example, if the intervention is shown to increase time spent in MVPA, to increase knowledge relevant to the aims of the intervention and to increase child self-efficacy for physical activity (but has no impact on parental support for physical activity), we would complete the multilevel linear regression model with time spent in MVPA exactly as describe in Section 2.2 above. We would then repeat that analysis adding the following additional covariables: (1) knowledge score; (2) self-efficacy for physical activity score; (3) both knowledge and self-efficacy for physical activity score.</p><p>&#x02022;A relative reduction (change towards the null) of the initial effect of the intervention on outcome (i.e. before addition of any mediators as covariables) of 10% or more will be considered to indicate some evidence of mediation.</p><p>&#x02022;The% relative reduction in the initial trial effect on any of the primary outcomes will be recorded (see Additional file

We will not complete secondary per protocol and stratified (by gender and school based deprivation) analyses. This decision is made on the basis of the large number of analyses that will be undertaken for the first (immediately after intervention) effectiveness analyses and the importance of not &#x02018;over analysing&#x02019; data. It is plausible that if the intervention is effective it will be more strongly effective in the short term. Therefore doing a very detailed analysis including secondary and stratified analyses at that time point is justified.

We will fit an interaction term with time so that we can explore whether differences between the two randomised groups in the change in outcome between baseline and immediate follow-up and then between immediate follow-up and long-term follow-up are consistent with each other.</p><p>In these models any participant with a measurement at any one of baseline, immediate or long-term follow-up can be included, and we will only do one set of analyses for this change measure with all participants included who have one of these time point assessments for a given outcome.

Noble.</p><p>The objective of the economic evaluation is to evaluate the difference in costs and the difference in effectiveness between the two arms of the trial. Only the costs relating to the delivery of the intervention and the intervention itself will be measured and valued, i.e. trial-related costs, e.g. data collection costs will not be included.</p><p>A cost consequence approach will be taken. This is when the differences in costs and consequences between the two arms of the trial are given in tabular form, and there is no attempt to estimate a summary score to encapsulate all the costs and benefits (e.g. the Incremental Cost effectiveness ratio). This approach is chosen given the number of important primary and secondary outcomes.</p><p>All costs will be valued in 2012/13 prices. As costs will be valued within the year no discounting of costs will take place.</p><p>These analyses will be undertake in late 2013/early 2014 with the timing of the cost-effectiveness publication to be with the publication of the paper reporting the long-term effectiveness outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The perspective will be that of the provider, schools and teachers.</p><p>The data for this primary analysis has mainly been collected through electronic time sheets, training day expense sheets and the teachers&#x02019; logs. The cost of each item of resource use will be evaluated as the resource use (e.g. number of hours) multiplied by its unit cost (see Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> for how resource use will be measured and valued). In the primary analysis it is assumed that no costs incur in the comparison arm. Costs per child will be estimated using the school specific information and allocating global costs equally amongst the children in the intervention schools.</p><table-wrap position="float"
