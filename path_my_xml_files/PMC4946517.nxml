Experimental studies indicate that an organ rinse with the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus before implantation protects against IRI. The tacrolimus organ perfusion study was initiated to examine the effects of ex vivo tacrolimus perfusion on IRI in transplantation of EDC livers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective randomized multicenter trial comparing ex vivo perfusion of marginal liver grafts (&#x02265;2 EDC according to Eurotransplant manual) with tacrolimus (20 ng/mL) or histidine-tryptophane-ketoglutarate solution (control) was carried out at 5 German liver transplant centers (Munich Ludwig-Maximilians University, Berlin, Heidelberg, Mainz, Regensburg) between October 2011 and July 2013. Primary endpoint was the maximum alanine transaminase (ALT) level within 48 hours after transplantation. Secondary endpoints were aspartate transaminase (AST), prothrombine ratio, and graft-patient survival within an observation period of 1 week.

In contrast to these findings, Kristo et al<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> recently failed to show a reduction of alanine transaminase (ALT) levels through such a treatment after transplantation of nonmarginal livers.

In 2010, EDC organs made up more than 70% of all transplanted livers in Germany, and the proportion of liver grafts exhibiting 1 or more EDC increased from 29 % in 1997 to 73% in the year 2010 (data provided by Eurotransplant). Thus, new therapies have to be developed to reduce IRI in EDC organs.</p><p>The hypothesis of the TOP study was that a single ex vivo tacrolimus rinse reduces IRI in transplantation of marginal liver grafts. In this respect, experimental data demonstrate a protective role of the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus on the hepatic IRI after warm and cold ischemic periods.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> For the present trial, an ex vivo tacrolimus rinse in EDC liver grafts has been chosen as study medication. This dosage form is based on previous experimental<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and clinical<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> data indicating protective effects of a single ex vivo tacrolimus treatment in the cold liver graft: St Peter et al<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> described a significant reduction of postoperative aminotransferase levels after a tacrolimus rinse in transplantation of normal, nonmarginal liver grafts. The second trial by Kristo et al<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> could not reproduce a clinical reduction of IRI but showed a decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines through such a treatment. In both studies, however, nonmarginal liver grafts were included. Thus, the results of these trials do not reflect the current clinical problem of organ shortage and marginal liver grafts.</p><p>With respect to the current study design it must be stated that the metabolism of the graft is certainly reduced during the ex vivo rinse treatment of the cold liver. As a calcineurin inhibitor, tacrolimus requires active T cells to develop its effect which are not present during the ex vivo perfusion. Nevertheless, tacrolimus may exert its therapeutic effects throughout the gradual warming of the graft during reperfusion. Furthermore, a local treatment is supposed to supply higher concentrations of tacrolimus compared with a systemic treatment of the recipient. In an experimental setting, the authors were also able to demonstrate a relevant decline of the tacrolimus concentration in the perfusate after passing the ischemic graft.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>In an attempt to provide protective action of tacrolimus from the beginning of reperfusion, most of the previous experimental models have performed a systemic donor preconditioning.<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Despite their promising results, the clinical implementation of these models is problematic due to the organ allocation policy of Eurotransplant generating a confusing group of recipients. Whether a systemic recipient treatment before organ implantation would improve the effectivity of tacrolimus should be considered in further studies.</p><p>The hepatic IRI is triggered by innate immune activation and is characterized by proinflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and diminished microcirculation. In this respect, potential mechanisms for the effects of tacrolimus on the hepatic IRI have been described, including an impact on inflammatory processes, a decrease of neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis as well as an improved microcirculation.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Because tacrolimus has its effects primarily through a downregulation of IL-2 and a consecutively diminished activation of T cells, this pathway may also account for the postulated action of a tacrolimus rinse besides the well-known anti-inflammatory properties of this substance. In this respect, Khandoga et al have reported a novel concept for the development of IRI demonstrating a pivotal of T cells in those pathophysiological processes.<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>In the TOP study, an organ rinse with tacrolimus dissolved in HTK was compared with HTK-only (control group). This study design was also chosen because the rinse procedure itself may have protective effects on ischemia-reperfusion in liver transplantation. In this respect, experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that perfusion with Carolina Rinse or warm Ringer lactate exerts protective effects in terms of graft damage and survival.<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In contrast to these findings, a recent prospective trial by Heise<sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> incorporating 264 patients failed to show protective effects when performing an ex situ perfusion of the hepatic artery with HTK solution.</p><p>The inclusion criteria (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) chosen for this trial were based on their association with decreased graft function and survival. The study proposal has been published previously.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The prevalence of 2 or more EDC was the central inclusion criterion because some authors describe that even transplantation of grafts from extremely extended criteria donors may not negatively influence the long-term outcome as long as only a single-donor risk factor is present (ie, donor age &#x0003e;70 years).<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Instead, certain combinations of donor and recipient factors seem to be of higher prognostic value than the existence of single risk factors. For instance, a high donor age and hepatitis C in the recipient<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> or the combination of a worsening MELD score (D-MELD) and the presence of &#x02265; 2 EDC in organ donors<sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> may decrease survival after liver transplantation. Therefore, the TOP study only included marginal liver grafts exhibiting 2 or more EDC.</p><p>The design of the TOP study resulted in a clinically relevant reduction of graft quality to prove therapeutic effects of the study medication. In this respect, the median DRI was 1.9 in all organ donors whose grafts had been used for the TOP study. The average number of EDC did not differ between the study groups. Although the DRI represents a rating system for graft quality developed specifically for the United States,<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> it is also a valid marker for graft quality within the Eurotransplant allocation system.<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The relevance of the DRI is further emphasized by a previous analysis conducted by our group which included 448 patients from our institutional liver transplant database, which showed a DRI of 1.25 or greater to be a highly prognostic marker in multivariate analysis with a hazard rate ratio of 3.2.<sup><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>The prognostic relevance of the hepatic IRI and other nonimmunological pathomechanisms, however, is the subject of ongoing discussion.<sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>Acute effects of IRI include the generation of reactive oxygen species and the release of inflammatory cytokines which result in microcirculatory disturbance causing graft damage and potentially graft loss.<sup><xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Ischemia-reperfusion injury also correlates with the initial organ function.<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Therefore, clinical markers of hepatic IRI (ALT, AST) were chosen as endpoints in the TOP study. Although IRI is a diagnosis mainly made by histologic staining,<sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> the primary endpoint of the study, ALT, correlates well with intrahepatic changes characteristic for reperfusion associated liver damage.<sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>Moreover, IRI may be associated with chronic alterations of the graft. In this respect, some authors suggest an interaction between nonimmunological and immunological factors thereby influencing the long-term outcome of liver grafts: O'Leary et al<sup><xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> have shown a correlation between organ damage and the generation of donor specific HLA-antibodies.</p><p>In the present study, a tacrolimus rinse at a concentration of 20 ng/mL did not reduce postoperative ALT levels. Even a trend toward slightly higher levels of ALT seems to be evident in grafts treated with tacrolimus, and this observation reaches statistical significance in AST in the postoperative course (<italic>P</italic> = 0.011). Nevertheless, based on the present results suggesting no therapeutic effect also if larger numbers of patients had been recruited or even harmful action of a tacrolimus rinse the TOP study was terminated in July 2013 according to a decision of the scientific committee.</p><p>Conflicting data on ALT and AST levels after tacrolimus rinse before liver transplantation have been published.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Similar to our results, Kristo et al<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> reported no effect of tacrolimus on AST and ALT levels in nonmarginal organs. On the molecular level, a reduction of precursors of inflammatory markers using highly sensitive gene chip array analysis after a tacrolimus rinse with 20 ng/mL in liver transplantation was evident. These findings argue against a hepatotoxic effect of tacrolimus.</p><p>Altogether, previous data suggest that tacrolimus could also exert protective effects in marginal liver grafts which exhibit an increased IRI.</p><p>To analyze potential effects of a rinse treatment in marginal liver grafts itself, the results of the present study were compared with placebo using the liver transplant database of our hospital. For this purpose, 24 recent consecutive transplantations of livers exhibiting 2 or more EDC were analyzed. Preoperative ALT/AST values did not differ between study patients and placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). When analyzing postoperative ALT/AST values (days 1, 2, 4, 7), no differences were evident between study patients that had received an ex situ rinse and placebo (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>In summary, the study medication failed to decrease IRI and partially even increased graft damage in transplantation of marginal livers. Only a small number of patients (n = 24) has been included in this study, which limits its significance. Nevertheless, missing evidence of the effectiveness of the study medication must be presumed based on the present data. Whether varying the dosage of tacrolimus in the rinse solution or new approaches (ie, adding tacrolimus to a continuous machine perfusion) will increase its effectiveness should be addressed in future trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Critical organ shortage contributes to decreased graft quality which is associated with an increase in IRI as well as reduced survival after liver transplantation. Experimental and clinical data indicate a protective role of a tacrolimus rinse in healthy, nonmarginal liver grafts. The aim of the TOP study was to reduce hepatic IRI with a single ex vivo tacrolimus rinse before reperfusion in EDC liver grafts. The present data do not indicate a protective role of tacrolimus rinse of marginal organs in liver transplantation rather demonstrating harmful effects. Thus, ex vivo tacrolimus rinse is contraindicated as an approach to decrease IRI after transplantation of marginal livers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors thank Marieke van Rosmaalen, M.D. (Eurotransplant) for her constant support of our work and Dr. Amanda Tufman for correcting and editing the English language and grammar of the article.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Published online 4 May 2016.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study was financed by a grant from Astellas Pharma GmbH, M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>S.P. participated in research design, in the writing of the article, in the performance of the research and data analysis.
