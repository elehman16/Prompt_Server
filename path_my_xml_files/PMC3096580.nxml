Local delivery of drugs to the tissues of the oral cavity has a number of applications including the treatment of toothache, periodontal diseases, dental caries, bacterial and fungal infections. The conventional formulations for the local delivery of drugs to the oral cavity are the mouth paints, rinses, troches, creams, oral tablets and suspensions. But limitations include, poor bioavailability, poor availability of drug at the site of action and patient compliance. One way to improve the efficacy of the dosage form is to deliver the antifungal agent locally in the oral cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] on the effected site. Better stability and longer residence time of locally administered antifungal agent will allow better penetration through the oral mucosal layer to act on <italic>Candida </italic>species.</p><p><italic>In situ g</italic>els can resist the physiological stress caused by the skin flexion, mastication and movement of tongue, adopting shape of the applied area and controlling the drug release for prolonged time. Fluconazole is an orally active bistriazole antifungal agent which is used in the treatment of superficial and systemic candidasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The present dosage regimen of fluconazole for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidasis (OPC) of 100 mg tablets of fluconazole tablet twice daily. The occurrence of OPC in patients deteriorates the oral mucosa; increases pain, dysphagia, and anorexia; alters taste; and contributes toward worsening nutritional and general status. Recurrence of infection is usually seen in approximately 33% of patients treated with tablet formulation of fluconazole. Thus, there is a need for a topical agent which is as effective as systemic agent upon single administration, well tolerated and would not increase the risks of emergence of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Rene-jean Bensadown et al., demonstrated the ability to deliver high and prolonged salivary concentration of 50 mg mucoadhesive buccal tablets of miconazole helped in reduction of dose, reduced the risk of systemic exposure, drug-drug interaction and other toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In view of eliminating the signs and symptoms of OPC, present study was focused on formulation of <italic>in situ </italic>gels of fluconazole and evaluated for its physico-chemical properties as well as <italic>in vivo </italic>efficacy in patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of study was to assess efficacy of topical application of <italic>in situ </italic>gels of fluconazole for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis.

Further, it was also found that, the formulations were liquid at room temperature (25&#x000b0;C) with viscosity of 85 cps which underwent rapid gelation when the pH was raised to 6.8 which contributed to the increased viscosity of 14000 cps.

In the present investigation <italic>in situ </italic>gels of fluconazole was formulated and evaluated for the <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>characteristics. It is established that formulations containing calcium carbonate produce a significantly produced stronger gel than those containing sodium bicarbonate. This is due to the internal ionotropic gelation effect of calcium on gellan gum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The present investigation utilized Ca<sup>++ </sup>ions in complexed form with sodium citrate (0.17%w/v) which upon contact with the saliva formed gel which would release the drug for a longer duration of time. The slightly acidic conditions of the buccal cavity ensured reproducible gelation of the gellan gum. Low level of cations present in the solution was sufficient to hold the molecular chains together and inhibit hydration. A reduction in the concentration of gellan gum without compromising the gelling capacity and rheological properties of the delivery system may be achieved by the addition of viscosity enhancing polymers such as sodium carboxylmethylcellulose (NaCMC). Since NaCMC helped the gel to rapidly settle because of its higher density, the gels showed better adhesion property to the mucous membrane and subsequently prolonged release. The formulation showed optimum pH of 7.0 &#x000b1; 0.3 which is very essential to reduce irritation. The formulation showed good sol to gel conversion with low viscosity of the sols and subsequent gels showed higher viscosity. The higher viscosity could contribute in better mucoadhesive property and retentive property. The <italic>in vitro </italic>release profile was conducted for a period of 6 h and showed biphasic release pattern which is a characteristic feature of matrix diffusion kinetics. The initial burst effect was considerably reduced with increase in polymer concentration.</p><p><italic>In vivo </italic>evaluation showed that all the three groups showed good clinical response during the treatment duration (14 days). Group I, group II and group III showed clinically cured for 95%, 98% and 93% of the patients respectively. During the follow up the patients treated with fluconazole tablets showed higher incidence of relapse at faster rate (within 18 days). The group II patients did not show any signs of relapse for a period of 44 days. No statistically significant differences between different treated groups were observed in the clinical response during the treatment period. The faster relapse were seen in patients treated with oral tablets was may be due to lower drug concentration at the site of infection. <italic>C. albicans </italic>was cultured in more than 66.6% in all treated groups. Because of immunosupression in HIV patients, &#x0003e;90% of the cases showed relapses at the end of 21 days and remained "unchanged" which was same in case of group III, Significant clinical efficacy was seen in patients of group II with no relapse and the patients were clinically "cured". A comparison of various treated groups of patients free from OPC is given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison Test studies showed no significant difference in clinical response (P &#x0003c; 0.005) between the treated groups at the end of 14 days.

Microbiological investigation revealed a statistically significant difference (P &#x0003e; 0.001) when the different treated groups were compared for a period of 14 days. <italic>In situ </italic>gels were more effective than fluconazole tablets in producing greater rates of negative culture and better clinical response. The more conventional method of assessing mycological response-negative culture demonstrated a significant difference in the ability of <italic>In situ </italic>gels to eradicate <italic>Candida </italic>species at the end of therapy when compared with fluconazole tablets. The results of the <italic>in vivo </italic>evaluation demonstrated that fluconazole <italic>in situ </italic>gels for 14 days (0.5%w/v) was effective in treating of oral candidiasis with patients suffering from HIV/AIDS and with partial or complete dentures. <italic>In situ </italic>gels were well tolerated by the patients in the trails. Adverse events reported in the literature tend to be relatively minor and usually related to the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The finding was confirmed in our study as well. Gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) were experienced by approximately 6 patients in the treated groups.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Percentage of patients who were free from symptoms of candidal infection</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-99-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the <italic>in situ </italic>gel formulation of fluconazole has shown significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis and produced successful clinical outcomes. The <italic>in situ </italic>gels were easier to administer, well tolerated and showed better clinical efficacy in treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with partial or complete dentures or HIV/AIDS patient and can be considered as a viable alternative to the current conventional formulations available for the treatment of candidiasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HMN is the trial co-ordinator.
