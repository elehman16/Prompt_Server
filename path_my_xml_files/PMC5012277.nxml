Prior to initiation of study activities, the iChoose Kidney Study was registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0015">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (protocol <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02235571" id="intref0020">NCT02235571</ext-link>). This study was approved by Institutional Review Boards at Emory University, Columbia University, and Northwestern University. All patients will be consented for participation in the study before study involvement.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Target Population, Setting, and Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><p>The study will be conducted in 3 US kidney transplant centers with a total target enrollment of 450 (150 at each site): Emory Transplant Center in Atlanta, Georgia, Columbia University Medical Center in New York, New York, and Northwestern University Transplant Center in Chicago, Illinois.</p><p>ESRD patients will be recruited into the study during transplant medical evaluation if they meet inclusion criteria: (i) 18 to 70 years of age; (ii) no previous solid organ or multiorgan transplant; (iii) English speaking; and (iv) no severe cognitive or visual impairment.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Study Arms</title><p>At kidney transplant evaluation, the control group will receive the usual center-specific standard-of-care education about renal transplantation, without the iChoose Kidney decision aid. The intervention group will also receive the usual center-specific standard-of-care education. However, it will be supplemented by the use of the iChoose Kidney decision aid (either iPad or iPhone version). Among patients randomized to the intervention study arm, a nephrologist or transplant surgeon will use iChoose Kidney to provide individualized risk estimates of mortality or survival by treatment (dialysis vs. transplant; LD vs. DD transplant) based on a patient&#x02019;s demographic and clinical characteristics. Using visual displays, the iChoose Kidney decision aid communicates both absolute and relative risk estimates in several messaging frames to increase patient and provider understanding of treatment benefit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). The provider will have the option of which format to display for the patient when discussing the risks and benefits of each treatment option.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Screenshots of the iChoose Kidney decision aid (iPad version), which communicate both absolute and relative risk estimates in several messaging frames. By entering a patient&#x02019;s clinical information (sex, age, race, ethnicity, time on dialysis, and several comorbidities), the risk prediction calculator generates individualized 1- and 3-year mortality and survival risk estimates for (i) dialysis versus kidney transplant and (ii) deceased- versus living-donor transplant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>At each site, research assistants will identify patients who meet inclusion criteria at the time of the patient&#x02019;s evaluation visit. Patients who agree to participate will be provided with detailed study information, and informed consent with written documentation will be obtained from the research participant or appropriate representative prior to initiation in the iChoose Kidney Study. Research assistants will then generate study identification numbers for consented participants and randomize patients to 1 of 2 study arms (the intervention arm or the control arm) with a random number generator application via iPad or iPhone. Patients will be surveyed on the same day before (baseline) and after (follow-up) meeting with the provider, completing a total of 2 surveys. Providers will take a baseline survey prior to the start of the study, a follow-up survey directly after meeting with each study patient, and a final poststudy completion survey (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>). All patient and provider surveys will be administered through SurveyMonkey, an electronic surveying tool (or paper surveys later entered into SurveyMonkey if Internet access is unavailable).

Baseline surveys include questions about patient demographics, exposure to transplant education, transplant knowledge, preferences for treatment, and decisional conflict.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5.3"><title>Provider Follow-up Survey</title><p>Directly following each nephrology or surgery transplant evaluation, research assistants will administer a short survey to providers to assess satisfaction with and usefulness of the tool. Providers will report whether or not they discussed the survival benefit of transplant versus dialysis and report other conversation topics. Providers who use the tool with intervention patients will be asked whether they used mortality or survival estimates. They will also report&#x000a0;whether they perceived that the patient gained transplant knowledge through the use of the iChoose Kidney tool. Providers who do not use the tool (if the patient was a control, or for some other reason) will be asked whether they felt their conversation with the patient could have benefited from using iChoose Kidney.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5.4"><title>Patient Follow-up Survey</title><p>Following the provider consultation, patients will be given a follow-up survey, which consists of questions similar to the baseline survey, including transplant knowledge, preferences of treatment, decisional conflict, and health literacy and numeracy.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5.5"><title>Provider Poststudy Survey</title><p>Within 1 month of study completion, providers will be surveyed again on their conversations with patients during the pretransplant evaluation and opinions on the iChoose Kidney application. Specifically, they will be asked about the average time spent during an evaluation visit, how often they discuss survival benefit of transplant versus dialysis, words used to communicate mortality risk, and perceived barriers to using mobile technology. They will also be asked their opinions of iChoose Kidney: its effect on patient knowledge and uncertainty regarding treatment, challenges to using the tool, how it could be improved, how it would best be used in practice (e.g., the time point when it should be used, who should administer it, which patients would benefit most), and whether they intend to use it in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1.6"><title>Outcome Measures</title><sec id="sec1.6.1"><title>Transplant Knowledge</title><p>The primary outcome of the iChoose Kidney Study is change in patient knowledge about the survival benefits of transplantation. Improvement in knowledge will be measured using 8 survey questions in the pre- and postassessment. First, patients will be asked 2 knowledge questions in the baseline and follow-up survey: &#x0201c;On average, dialysis patients live: 1) longer than transplant patients, 2) about the same time as transplant patients, 3) a shorter time than transplant patients, or 4) unsure&#x0201d;; and &#x0201c;On average, living donor transplant patients live 1) a longer time than deceased donor transplant patients, 2) about the same time as deceased donor transplant patients, 3) a shorter time than deceased donor transplant patients, or 4) unsure.&#x0201d; Patients in both study arms will also be asked to estimate their absolute chance of 3-year survival on dialysis, transplant overall, deceased-donor transplant, and&#x000a0;living-donor transplant (4 items) both pre- and postassessment. Lastly, patients will be asked to estimate their relative risk of mortality with dialysis versus kidney transplant (on a scale from 1 to 9) and whether they are more, less, or equally likely to die with dialysis compared to with a kidney transplant (2 items) both pre- and postassessment.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.6.2"><title>Decisional Conflict</title><p>Decisional conflict was measured in both the pre- and postsurvey by a validated scale of 10 items that assess personal perceptions of uncertainty in choosing options, modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty, and effective decision making (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> This particular version of the decisional conflict scale was selected for the study given its recommendation to be used on individuals with &#x0201c;limited reading or response skills.&#x0201d; The subscales for decisional conflict include uncertainty (patient feels certain about choice), informed status (patient informed of treatment options), values clarity (patient clear regarding personal values), and support (patient feels supported in decision making).

Numeracy will be scored continuously on a scale from 1 to&#x000a0;11.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.7.4"><title>Provider Factors</title><p>The following provider factors will be collected: time practicing medicine or surgery, use of patient educational tools, perceived barriers to using mobile technology, average time spent during an evaluation visit, how often the survival benefit of transplant versus dialysis is discussed, and specific reasons why the provider might not discuss the survival benefit of transplant versus dialysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1.8"><title>Data Management</title><p>Research assistants will track study participants uniformly across sites, using a worksheet they will later transcribe into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Patient demographics, social support, and any deviations from the study protocol will be recorded in this spreadsheet (e.g., if the provider performed the intervention with a control patient). At each site, patient demographics (race, age, sex, ethnicity), dialysis start date, and comorbidities included in the iChoose Kidney application will be abstracted or extracted from patient electronic medical records. To ensure data accuracy, self-reported patient survey data will be compared to data collected from electronic medical records.</p><p>The limited de-identified electronic medical record&#x02013;collected data from all 3 sites, as well the de-identified SurveyMonkey patient and provider survey data, will be merged, cleaned, and operationalized at Emory University. Microsoft Excel and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) will be used to prepare and merge study data.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.9"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><sec id="sec1.9.1"><title>Descriptive Analyses</title><p>All analyses will be conducted using an intention-to-treat approach where patients will remain assigned to the treatment condition they were randomized to regardless of whether they receive the intervention (e.g., patients randomized to the intervention arm but who did not receive the iChoose Kidney clinical decision&#x000a0;aid will still be considered as intervention participants).&#x000a0;Descriptive analyses of transplant center&#x02013;level baseline variables (demographic and clinical characteristics and transplant access measures) will be compared. To evaluate the differences between study arms at baseline, Pearson&#x02019;s &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests and <italic>t</italic>-tests, or their non-parametric equivalents, will be performed for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics will be adjusted when assessing the overall intervention effect as described above.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.9.2"><title>Change in Knowledge</title><p>To assess change in knowledge from pre- to postassessment, the change in score from the knowledge questions will be calculated for each patient. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test will be used to determine whether this difference in proportions is significant in intervention versus control patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.9.3"><title>Change in Decisional Conflict</title><p>Each of 10 items in the decisional conflict scale will be given a value of 0, 2, or 4 for responses &#x0201c;yes,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;no,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unsure,&#x0201d; respectively. The items will then be summed, divided by 10, and multiplied by 25 to determine the total score of the decisional conflict variable. Decisional conflict will then be scored on a scale from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (high decisional conflict) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). The change in decisional conflict will be calculated for each patient from pre&#x02013; to post&#x02013;provider consultation to determine whether the change is significantly higher in intervention patients versus control patients using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or multivariable logistic regression.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.9.4"><title>Change in Treatment Preferences</title><p>We will calculate the proportion of patients who initially preferred dialysis to transplantation but changed to transplantation during the postsurvey. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;test will be used to determine whether this difference is significant in intervention versus control patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.9.5"><title>Access to Transplant</title><p>We will create a composite measure of living-donor inquiries, placement on the wait list, and receipt of transplant to determine long-term outcomes at 1 year after inclusion in the study. We will use &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests or multivariable logistic regression to determine whether positive outcomes are significantly different among intervention patients versus control patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.9.6"><title>Planned Subgroup Analyses</title><p>To determine whether the effect of iChoose Kidney varies by health literacy, numeracy, and race, we will conduct similar analyses for knowledge and decisional conflict but across different subgroups of patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.9.7"><title>Provider Attitudes</title><p>To evaluate whether providers believe the tool impacted study patients, we will use descriptive analyses to assess variables collected directly after the patient appointment. We will use &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests to assess whether there was a difference in the number of times&#x000a0;providers had the conversation about the survival benefit of transplant versus dialysis, and of living- versus deceased-donor transplants with intervention versus control patients. We will also compare differences between provider responses at baseline and poststudy regarding use of mobile decision aids in general&#x000a0;and intention to use iChoose Kidney using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.9.8"><title>Power and Sample Size Calculations</title><p>Sample size calculations will be based on our primary aim to improve patient knowledge about the survival benefit of transplantation versus dialysis. To test the primary null hypothesis of no difference in referral proportions between the control and intervention groups, a sample size of 450 patients (225 patients per study arm) achieves 80% power to detect a moderate knowledge difference of 13% between the 2 groups at 5% significance level.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Discussion</title><p>Critically important treatment decisions are often made without evidence-based information about a patient&#x02019;s prognosis. Typically, average, population-based, non-tailored prognosis estimates of mortality on dialysis versus transplant are the only types of estimates communicated to individual ESRD patients, if these estimates are communicated at all.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Despite overwhelming evidence to support transplantation for certain ESRD patients,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> patient-specific prognostic information is rarely used to calculate a patient's individualized prognosis.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The iChoose Kidney clinical decision aid<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> is a tool that clinical providers, including nephrologists, surgeons, and other ESRD educators, could potentially use with patients to explain their chance of mortality or survival on dialysis versus transplant, ultimately helping to facilitate more informed decision making among ESRD patients about their treatment options. However, prior to dissemination for use in a clinical setting, the efficacy of the clinical decision aid in improving patient knowledge about the survival benefit of transplantation is needed.</p><p>While transplantation is the preferred treatment for most ESRD patients, significant barriers exist in access to multiple steps of the kidney transplantation process. Patients who are minorities, of lower socioeconomic status,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and of lower health literacy<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> are less likely to receive a kidney transplant. Education about transplantation as a treatment option may also play a role in disparities in access to kidney transplantation. According to the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, disparities in health outcomes are due, in part, to differences in access to health care, provider biases, poor patient&#x02013;provider communication, and poor health literacy.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Mobile health technology can be a useful way to deliver interventions and may have a high potential for reducing health disparities. Effective risk communication strategies must consider patients with varying degrees of health literacy, numeracy, and education levels to ensure that the information provided by the tool is relevant and understandable to patients from diverse backgrounds. The iChoose Kidney decision aid communicates risks of mortality on dialysis versus transplant in both absolute and relative terms to meet best practices in conveying health risks.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Evidence-based research supports presenting absolute risk in visuals to emphasize the clinical significance and size of risks,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> which iChoose Kidney utilizes.</p><p>Upon completion of this research, we will have assessed the effect of a decision aid in improving knowledge about the survival benefits of kidney transplantation versus dialysis. We will also have assessed providers&#x02019; attitudes toward clinical decision tools and their impact on the patient&#x02013;provider interaction. If found to be effective in improving knowledge about the survival benefit of transplant, the clinical decision aid could be a useful tool for improving access to transplantation and improving decisional conflict with regard to treatment options.</p><p>A strength of this randomized controlled trial is the conduct of the research among a diverse, multicenter population of ESRD patients, as results may be broadly generalizable to other ESRD patients who have been referred for transplantation to the more than 250 transplant centers across the United States. Further, with additional testing in a population of incident ESRD patients, the iChoose Kidney decision aid may also be applicable for use across the more than 5000 dialysis facilities or chronic kidney disease clinics in the United States. Future studies could also assess the applicability of the use of such a tool outside of the United States.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Disclosure</title><p>All the authors declared no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="sref1">US Renal Data System. 2013 Annual Data Report: Atlas of Chronic Kidney Disease and End-Stage Renal Disease in the United States. 2013.
