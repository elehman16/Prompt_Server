Exercise is an important &#x02018;therapy&#x02019; in the treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia because muscle contraction stimulates glucose uptake by skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0108629-Mikines1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108629-Dela1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Furthermore, we revealed that 4 weeks of endurance training under hypoxic conditions resulted in greater improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia than training under normoxic conditions <xref rid="pone.0108629-Morishima1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In a study by Mackenzie et al., 2011 <xref rid="pone.0108629-Mackenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, type 2 diabetic patients rested or exercised for 60 min under hypoxic conditions. Blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower after 60 min of rest or exercise under hypoxic condition compared with baseline values. Although the mechanism of glucose lowering by hypoxic exposure is not fully understood, changes in substrate utilization patterns may be involved because acute exercise under hypoxic conditions increases carbohydrate oxidation <xref rid="pone.0108629-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108629-Peronnet1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In particular, enhanced glucose uptake by skeletal muscle is thought to account for increased carbohydrate oxidation under hypoxic conditions. Several studies have demonstrated that severe hypoxia stimulates the translocation of glucose across the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0108629-Cartee1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108629-Fujii1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Kelly et al., 2010 <xref rid="pone.0108629-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> reported that plasma glucose response to a 75 g glucose load was significantly attenuated under severely hypoxic condition (a simulated altitude of 4300 m) in healthy adults. In an animal study, increased glucose uptake by the soleus muscle was observed after 1 week of exposure to severe (FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10.0%) hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0108629-Gamboa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus, severe hypoxic stimulation (a simulated altitude of&#x0003e; 4000 m) probably has a beneficial effect in preventing postprandial hyperglycemia through promoting glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. However, because the use of severe hypoxia would not be appropriate, due to the risk of acute mountain sickness (e.g., headache, nausea, and anorexia), exposure to <italic>moderate</italic> hypoxia (a simulated altitude of &#x0003c;3000 m) is more practical in terms of application for obese and overweight people. Although several studies reported that greater improvement of glucose tolerance by chronic staying or hiking at moderate or severe (altitude of 2200&#x02013;4000 m) altitude was found <xref rid="pone.0108629-Schobersberger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108629-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, information about the influence of acute exposure to moderate hypoxia on glycemic regulation is still limited. Furthermore, no reported study has investigated the effect of rest and exercise under moderately hypoxic conditions on metabolic responses over a day in overweight subjects.</p><p>Given this context, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of rest and exercise under 7.5 h of moderately hypoxic conditions on substrate utilization and postprandial metabolic responses in overweight men. We hypothesized that the combination of rest and exercise under moderately hypoxic conditions would increase carbohydrate oxidation and attenuate postprandial blood glucose response over the day.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eight sedentary, overweight men participated.

During the first and second visits the subject's maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) was assessed using a graded power test on an ergometer (828E, Monark, Stockholm, Sweden) under normoxic (first) and hypoxic (second) conditions. These tests were conducted on different days at least a week before experimental trial. The first load began at 60 W, and the load was increased progressively in 30-W increments every 2 min until exhaustion. The test was terminated when the subject failed to maintain the prescribed pedaling frequency of 60 rpm or reached an oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) plateau. Respiratory gases were collected and analyzed using an automatic gas analyzer (AE300S, Minato Medical Science Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The data collected were averaged every 30 s. HR was measured continuously during the test using a wireless HR monitor (Acculex Plus; Polar Electro Oy). The test to measure VO<sub>2</sub>max was repeated under hypoxic conditions (FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15.0%) on a separate day to determine the workload during an exercise trial under hypoxic conditions.</p><p>Four experimental trials were subsequently carried out in a randomized crossover design. Each trial was separated by &#x02265; 7 days. The experimental trials consisted of four different scenarios: a rest trial under normoxic condition (FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20.9%, NOR-Rest), an exercise trial under normoxic condition (FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20.9%, NOR-Ex), a rest trial under hypoxic conditions (FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15.0%, HYP-Rest), and an exercise trial under hypoxic conditions (FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15.0%, HYP-Ex).

We selected 15.0% (a simulated altitude of 2700 m) of FiO<sub>2</sub> as a &#x0201c;moderate hypoxia&#x0201d; because previous studies reported that endurance training under this level of hypoxia further improved glycemic regulation compared with the same training under normoxic conditions <xref rid="pone.0108629-Morishima1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108629-Haufe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

After a 30 min rest, a polyethylene catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein and a baseline blood sample was collected. Subsequently, respiratory gas, heart rate (HR), and percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. During experimental trials, blood samples were collected at baseline and immediately before each meal (at the end of exercise), and at 20, 40, 60, and 120 min after each meal (16 points in total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108629-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Respiratory gas was collected at 10 points (baseline, immediately before, and at 60 and 120 min after each meal) to determine VO<sub>2</sub>, carbon dioxide production (VCO<sub>2</sub>), and ventilatory volume (VE). All respiratory variables were averaged in each 3-min period.

Postprandial blood glucose responses in hypoxic trials (HYP-Rest and HYP-Ex) did not differ compared with the normoxic trials (NOR-Rest and NOR-Ex) over 7.5 h. However, the HYP-Ex trial showed significantly higher carbohydrate oxidation than the NOR-Ex trial over the day. The novel finding of the present study was that neither rest alone nor rest and exercise in moderate hypoxia attenuated postprandial glucose responses, despite exercise in moderate hypoxia markedly promoted carbohydrate oxidation over 7.5 h.</p><p>AMPK is an intracellular energy-sensing enzyme that promotes blood glucose transport with stimulation, such as exercise or hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0108629-Fujii1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Because skeletal muscle is a major site for postprandial glucose disposal, the AMPK-related glucose transport pathway is considered to play a predominant role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the whole body <xref rid="pone.0108629-Hardie1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108629-Musi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, we hypothesized that greater glucose uptake via augmented AMPK activation would be observed in the hypoxic trials (HYP-Rest and HYP-Ex) compared with the normoxic trials (NOR-Rest and NOR-Ex). However, the blood glucose response was not significantly different among the trials over 7.5 h. Overweight or obese individuals generally show metabolic abnormality. In fact, AMPK activation has been reported to be impaired in overweight or obese people <xref rid="pone.0108629-Sriwijitkamol1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Because we selected overweight subjects in the present study, impaired AMPK activation in the present subjects may explain, at least in part, the lack of difference in the postprandial glucose response between the hypoxic and normoxic trials.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108629-g003">Figure 3</xref>, postprandial glucose responses to second and third meals were significantly greater in the exercise trials (NOR-Ex and HYP-Ex) than in the rest trials (NOR-Rest and HYP-Rest). We did not expect these results because exercise has been shown to promote glucose uptake into skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0108629-Richter2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and to attenuate postprandial blood glucose responses <xref rid="pone.0108629-Koopman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108629-Short1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, several previous studies indicated that the postprandial glucose response was aggravated by conducting exercise immediately before a meal <xref rid="pone.0108629-Pestell1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108629-OGorman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Aggravated glucose response by prior exercise may be associated with temporal insulin resistance immediately after exercise, characterized by impaired insulin secretion <xref rid="pone.0108629-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and reduced hepatic glucose uptake <xref rid="pone.0108629-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> in response to the meal consumed. In support of this, insulin responses to the second and third meals in the NOR-Ex and HYP-Ex trials were smaller than in the NOR-Rest and HYP-Rest trials. In future studies, optimal timing of exercise to prevent increased postprandial glucose responses should be examined.</p><p>A unique component of the present study was the comparison of time-course changes in substrate utilization patterns between normoxic and hypoxic conditions over 7.5 h in overweight men. In baseline data, evaluated after entering the environmental chamber, RER was significantly higher in the hypoxic trials than in the normoxic trials (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, data not shown). It is well known that acute hypoxic exposure induces hyperventilation <xref rid="pone.0108629-Dempsey1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108629-Easton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This may cause an overestimation of CO<sub>2</sub> production <xref rid="pone.0108629-Ferrannini1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108629-Friedmann1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and affect the validity of calculating RER due to the elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. However, there was no significant difference in VE at baseline between the normoxic trials and hypoxic trials. Thus, it seems unlikely that hypoxia-induced hyperventilation affected the results of the present study. However, the higher levels of %carbohydrate contribution at baseline in hypoxic trials were temporary responses because there was no significant difference in %carbohydrate contribution between NOR-Rest and HYP-Rest trials at the remaining measurement points. We think that moderate hypoxic exposure alone did not have a strong impact on metabolic or endocrine responses.</p><p>The relative contribution of carbohydrate oxidation (%carbohydrate contribution) during the exercise and post-exercise periods was significantly higher in the HYP-Ex trial than in the NOR-Ex trial, consistent with several previous reports. Peronnet et al., 2006 <xref rid="pone.0108629-Peronnet1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and Katayama et al., 2010 <xref rid="pone.0108629-Katayama1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> reported that carbohydrate oxidation during prolonged exercise was significantly higher in hypoxic conditions than in normoxic conditions. Brooks et al., 1991 <xref rid="pone.0108629-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 1992 <xref rid="pone.0108629-Brooks2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and Roberts et al., 1996a <xref rid="pone.0108629-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, b <xref rid="pone.0108629-Roberts2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> suggested that enhanced reliance on plasma glucose oxidation for energy production under hypoxic conditions leads to the promotion of carbohydrate oxidation during exercise. Data from the present study indicate that &#x0201c;moderate hypoxia&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;exercise&#x0201d; have synergistic effects in promoting carbohydrate oxidation during exercise and post-exercise periods. However, blood glucose and insulin responses did not differ between NOR-Ex and HYP-Ex trials over 7.5 h. Additionally, blood lactate concentrations during exercise did not differ significantly between the NOR-Ex and HYP-Ex trials. Thus, increased carbohydrate oxidation in the HYP-Ex trial was apparently not sufficient to affect blood variables regarding glucose metabolism.</p><p>The relative contributions of fat oxidation (%fat contribution) during exercise and the post-exercise period were significantly lower in the HYP-Ex trial than in the NOR-Ex trial. The reduced fat oxidation under hypoxic conditions agrees with a previous study that reported impaired adipose tissue lipolysis after prolonged exposure to hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0108629-deGlisezinski1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, in the present study, there was no significant difference in serum FFA or glycerol concentrations during exercise between the NOR-Ex and HYP-Ex trials, suggesting that exercise-induced adipose tissue lipolysis was not attenuated by moderate hypoxic exposure. An inconsistent result between fat oxidation and lipolysis has been reported previously. Ohkawara et al., 2013 <xref rid="pone.0108629-Ohkawara1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> indicated that an increased meal frequency decreased FFA concentrations over a day, in contrast to fat oxidation, which was unchanged.</p><p>We understand that some limitations should be carefully considered for interpretation of the present study. First, subjects in the present study were overweight men, but they did not have any metabolic disorder, which may affect the present results. Further studies using severely obese people or people with type 2 diabetes are necessary to extend our understanding. Second, substrate levels in blood do not correspond correctly to substrate utilization because substrate levels such as glucose, lactate or FFA are influenced by the rates of appearance and disappearance. This will partly explain for lack of attenuations of glucose and insulin responses in hypoxia, in despite of augmented carbohydrate oxidation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neither rest alone nor rest and exercise under moderately hypoxic conditions attenuated postprandial glucose responses. Additionally, rest alone under moderately hypoxic condition did not affect the substrate oxidation pattern markedly. However, carbohydrate oxidation was enhanced significantly over 7.5 h when three bouts of submaximal exercise were incorporated under moderately hypoxic conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all of the subjects who participated in the study.
