The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was higher in the TCZ+MTX group, driven primarily by events of sinusitis, nausea and headache. Most AEs were considered mild or moderate in intensity. Serious AEs (SAEs) were experienced by one patient in the MTX group and two patients in the TCZ+MTX group (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204427/-/DC1">supplementary table</ext-link> S3). During the first 8&#x02005;weeks, no patients in the MTX group discontinued treatment because of an AE or disease flare. One patient in the TCZ+MTX group discontinued treatment on day 10 because of hypersensitivity and urticaria. No patients discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy or worsening of RA. Over the 20&#x02005;weeks of the study, 41 (68.3%) patients in the TCZ+MTX group experienced 116 AEs (upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, nausea, headache, nasopharyngitis and urinary tract infection were the most commonly reported), and five SAEs were reported in four patients. Five patients in the TCZ+MTX group discontinued treatment because of AEs.

Results of this study indicate that immune responses to PPV23 after TCZ+MTX treatment were slightly attenuated compared with MTX alone; 60.0% and 70.8% of patients, respectively, responded to &#x02265;6 of 12 anti-pneumococcal antibody serotypes. Response to this T-cell-independent vaccine after TCZ treatment gave an evaluation of the impact of TCZ on specific immunoglobulin production to pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens. Similarly, numerically greater proportions of MTX-treated than TCZ+MTX-treated patients responded to multiple combinations (&#x02265;1&#x02013;12) of pneumococcal antigen serotypes. The response to individual pneumococcal serotypes varied among patients in each treatment group. Numerically, the proportion of responders to serotypes 1, 6b, 8, 9n, 18c and 19f (generally associated with invasive pneumococcal disease and multidrug resistance) was greater in the MTX group, although these differences are of unknown clinical significance and the protective titre against each subtype is unclear. As expected, the immune response to PPV23 was attenuated in older patients. However, the difference in proportions of responders between older and younger subpopulations was similar in the two treatment groups.</p><p>Because most patients had detectable baseline anti-tetanus antibody titres, response to this T-cell-dependent vaccine after TCZ treatment gave an evaluation of the effect of TCZ on immunoglobulin G production by memory T-helper cells (anamnestic or recall response to TTV). The immune response to TTV after TCZ+MTX treatment was similar to that after treatment with MTX alone (42.0% vs 39.1%, respectively). The reduction in response rates observed with MTX was consistent with previous reports.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Small differences were observed between treatment groups in the proportion of patients with &#x02265;2- and &#x02265;4-fold increases from baseline in TTV antibody levels at week 8 for patients with baseline antibody levels &#x02265;0.1&#x02005;IU/mL.</p><p>The rapid and sustained reduction in CRP levels from baseline confirmed that TCZ was pharmacologically active. Overall, the vaccines and randomised treatments were well tolerated. As expected, most AEs reported by patients randomly assigned to MTX occurred after week 8, when TCZ was added. The AE profile was consistent with the known TCZ safety profile.</p><p>While most patients with RA treated with TCZ 8&#x02005;mg/kg&#x02014;the highest approved dose&#x02014;mounted a detectable immune response to PPV23 and TTV, levels of protective antibodies were poorly defined. A limitation is that vaccine response was measured after only two TCZ infusions; whether results would be similar with longer-term TCZ treatment is unknown. Although no specific safety concerns were identified after vaccination in patients treated with TCZ, data from this study do not change the current prescribing recommendations that patients be brought up to date with immunisations in accordance with current guidelines if possible before TCZ treatment is initiated.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
