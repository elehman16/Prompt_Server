This is also a problem during and after continuous medical education programs, where the final aim is to change professional behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. EBM &#x02013; the systematic finding, appraisal and use of up-to-date research findings to support decision-making &#x02013; has been advocated in several studies within the field of disability evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we showed that the use of evidence in the daily practice of physicians performing disability evaluations can be improved through the application of a clinically integrated comprehensive postgraduate EBM training program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As a result of this program physicians trained in EBM used almost 10&#x000a0;% more evidence of sufficient quality in their disability reports compared to non-trained physicians. Likewise, knowledge and skills of EBM also showed statistically significant differences in favor of the group trained in EBM up to one year follow up.</p><p>In a similar educational EBM program among general practitioners developed by Shuval et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] physicians reported that EBM enhanced the quality of their practice with regard to justifying decisions and selecting best treatment for patients. However, in another study, general practitioners in busy practices perceived using EBM resources during consultation hours as difficult and impractical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. General practitioners focus on diagnosis and treatment decisions, whereas physicians involved in disability evaluation mainly focus on client limitations in work or work disability resulting from a chronic disease or handicap, how these limitations will evolve and how adverse effects on work ability can be minimized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Given these differences in tasks, we wanted to study if the themes mentioned above are similar for physicians performing disability evaluations after participating in a EBM course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to other medical specialties the consequences of using evidence-based decisions do not only affect the judgments of work disability evaluations themselves but are also vital for the health, well-being, work participation and financial compensation of the client and have a substantial social and financial impact for workers. In this survey we explored experiences and perceptions regarding EBM practice in disability evaluation. The group of physicians doing disability evaluations who participated in comprehensive formal education in EBM was not only aware of the theoretical possibilities of EBM, but also had time to experience opportunities and problems in practice. For this reason, the central aim of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of physicians doing disability evaluations regarding motivators and preconditions for the implementation of EBM in daily practice. From the physicians&#x02019; answers we also hoped to learn on what aspects our future EBM training and implementation efforts could be improved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and participants</title><p>This survey study was nested in a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which we evaluated a clinically integrated training program in EBM which successfully improved the use of evidence in disability evaluation in the intervention group compared to the control group without a training program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this cluster RCT approval was sought from the research ethics committee of the Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam. However, as this constituted the evaluation of an educational intervention with physicians, written exemption of ethics approval was received from the committee secretary. All participating physicians in this trial signed an informed consent form (Trial registration NTR1767: 20-apr-2009). They were all working for the Dutch National Institute for Employee Benefit Schemes (UWV) and performed disability evaluations as a substantial part of their job. The participants were selected by their peer group leaders and came from all different parts of the Netherlands.</p><p>In total 45 of 59 physicians who had completed the six-month EBM training program participated in this end-of-program qualitative survey in the form of group discussions. The group discussion design was considered convenient and feasible, given the non-sensitive nature of the discussion topics. The mean age of the complete intervention group was 49.7&#x000a0;years (sd 7.1). They had been employed for a mean of 16.4&#x000a0;years in their current job and only one quarter had previous experience with EBM, mostly consisting of a one-day introductory course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Group discussions</title><p>Focus group methodology was used to discuss physicians&#x02019; perceptions and experiences regarding EBM. In total, nine group discussions (average duration 1&#x000a0;h) and two plenary discussions (average duration 1.5&#x000a0;h) were conducted at the end of the EBM educational program to explore perceived motivators and preconditions. The focus groups consisted of on average five physicians and all group and plenary sessions were audio-recorded in Dutch. Experienced tutors (JH, PS, RK) supervised these nine group meetings, facilitating the process and encouraging participants to engage in the discussions but did not take part in the discussions themselves.</p><p>Using input from personal action plans (see <xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>), which were completed as home assignments by the participating physicians, the group discussion evolved around the topic of how physicians pictured themselves as being active EBM practitioners in the future, exploring the perceived motivators and preconditions to the application of EBM in their practice.</p><p>In every group, participants read out their plans, discussed experiences and perceptions, asked clarifying questions and gave feedback to each other. Additionally one group participant in each group took notes during the meetings so that findings could be introduced in the plenary discussion following the group discussions.</p><p>During two plenary discussions, one person from each group reported on the group&#x02019;s findings, which allowed the members of the other groups to further question, add to, or explain perspectives and to clarify ideas. The plenary discussions allowed for alternative perceptions that had not been expressed before to be put forward.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>One of the researchers (SMK) transcribed the audio-recordings of the 11 discussions verbatim in Microsoft Word. The software program MaxQDA was used for data analysis. Coding of categories and themes was performed in Dutch by two researchers (SMK and RK) and checked by a third member of the research team (JLH). Themes and quotations were translated in English afterwards.</p><p>The analysis was performed in phases using the three types of coding originally proposed by Strauss and Corbin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the first phase &#x02013; the open coding phase &#x02013; every text fragment that could provide an answer to the research question was given a code. In the axial coding phase, relations between categories and larger concepts were sought. When necessary, new categories were coded. Finally, in the selective coding phase, themes were organized to formulate an answer to the research question. Iteratively, three main concepts or themes emerged along which perceptions, experiences and other discussion elements could be categorized. The content, descriptions, titles and final selection of the themes and subthemes were checked and discussed by the research team in each phase. We used the items of the COREQ checklist for improving the quality of reporting qualitative research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results</title><p>Three main concepts or themes emerged after analyzing the group discussions representing both motivators and preconditions for implementation: 1) improved quality of physicians&#x02019; actions; 2) improved work attractiveness; and 3) preconditions to work in an evidence-based way including professional competence, facilitating material conditions and organizational support and demands.

Other quality aspects refer to improved process characteristics such as improved consultation with other medical disciplines, or better processing of the evaluations in favor of the organization.

However, some recently trained physicians remarked that applying EBM costs time, with the results often being disproportionate to the time and effort spent: <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026; I have to get up to all sorts of tricks to find the time, plus the fact that once you&#x02019;ve spent all that time, the results are unfortunately not always worth it&#x0201d;</italic>. (inter 5, para 6)</p><p>Though EBM took time, some physicians wanted to keep up to date on EBM and scheduled time for it: <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026; you just have to allocate blocked time for it because otherwise it just won&#x02019;t happen &#x02026;&#x0201d;.</italic> (inter 11, para 147) Additionally, for the application of EBM in everyday practice, participating physicians stated it would help if more time was available for reporting evidence-based disability evaluations, in which evidence was sought as underpinning for decision making:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;That you acknowledge, particularly, that that&#x02019;s an element we have to pay far more attention and energy to, that&#x02019;s really important if we want to raise the quality, and that definitely makes a difference, and having the time you need to be able to tell your story effectively&#x0201d;.</italic> (inter 1, para 202&#x02013;203)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Not surprisingly physicians indicated that to work in an evidence-based way, time must be facilitated in a structural manner, in addition to the physician&#x02019;s own time:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;If you want to do it, you need the time for it. And of course it can also be a combination, for me in any case, or for us, it can be a combination of leisure time and work time&#x0201d;.</italic> (inter 11, para 52)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In order to encourage evidence-based working, and also to acquire the resources, such as time and opportunity necessary for this, it was suggested that it was also important to create &#x02018;allies&#x02019; among the management and the senior staff physicians.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;And when I consider lobbying I mean also among the management team, to make clear how important it is, for the client of course, for our own professional sector, that we do have some say in the matter, including towards treating physicians. So that we really are a sparring partner for treating physicians, but also for society as a whole. That you can also now and then support the opinion that someone may perhaps have a complication that can still be treated. And that you can then ensure that action plans are set into motion and that therefore the damage to health can be limited, as well as the resources that will need to be used&#x0201d;.</italic> (inter 6, para 16)</p><p><italic>&#x0201c;Yes, but it&#x02019;s all about whether the management team is convinced that it (EBM) has added value. If you simply say, well yes, we are able to make better prognoses, manage the dossier stream better, and therefore also save time. And it (better underpinned decisions) probably results in less clients who appeal against the decision, which is also time saved of course. So that could also be an argument for claiming it as work time&#x0201d;.</italic> (inter 1, para 151)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Working in an evidence-based manner could be further encouraged if, for example, the evidence was specified in a separate heading in the disability evaluation report:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;I find also that you have to use it (evidence) in your reports, which is also now being proposed &#x02026; Even if you&#x02019;re only referring to the protocol, that&#x02019;s evidence too &#x02026; Just as a standard thing in your reports &#x02026; You mean just like a standard heading (in the report itself) &#x02026; information from third parties EBM (proposed subheadings).&#x0201d;</italic> (inter 7, para 129)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Including the degree of substantiation through evidence as a part of the standard quality check was also believed as a stimulus for evidence-based working by the physicians:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026; quality test (of the report) &#x02026; Would you include this (evidence) as a chapter there then, or could you take it (evidence) into consideration there &#x02026; as a controlling function. Indeed, that acts as a stimulus for physicians a little &#x02026; Yes, and of course you&#x02019;re not just checking (evidence), you&#x02019;re also encouraging&#x0201d;.</italic> (inter 10; para 253&#x02013;257)</p></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we found several motivators and preconditions perceived to promote or hinder implementation of EBM in clinical practice. The participating physicians indicated that EBM improved the quality and attractiveness of their work. They were also clear about what needed to be done to improve the application of EBM in terms of professional competence needed, material conditions facilitated and support and demands from the organization.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A strength of this study is that we examined the perceptions and experiences of physicians who completed formal education in EBM and who had recent practical experience of its opportunities and problems, as shown in the results. We organized a substantial number of focusgroups (9), including two plenary sessions, and consequently identified many overlapping responses within each theme. However, we hypothesize that we may have included physicans with a somewhat positive attitude towards EBM as we did not include any physicians without recent EBM training who lacked recent motivation or reinforcement. Future studies might therefore consider including physicians whose training in EBM is less recent. In addition, as the participating physicians were interviewed within the EBM course, and the facilitators were acting both as course tutors and researchers, this may have positively skewed any attitudes in favor of EBM. Prior to the start of the course the physicians attitude towards EBM was already highly positive, and remained stable over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, we believe the most important concepts and barriers to EBM related to the use of EBM for this group of physicians have been addressed and reported, as similar themes have also been reported in other interview studies within EBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] among different professionals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Similar to other studies among general practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and occupational physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we found that physicians who performed disability assessments believed that EBM enhanced the quality of their practice by keeping up to date with relevant developments, decisions being better underpinned with evidence and clients ultimately benefitting from the application of EBM. Unlike Shuval et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and Hugenholtz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we found that physicians perceived that the services of their organization could be improved as a consequence of using evidence, another aspect of quality of their practice. In our study consultation with medical colleagues and job satisfaction also improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>When physicians are able to raise the level of medical content of their profession by using the medical literature, it could enhance their job satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some physicians perceived themselves as not sufficiently skilled or motivated for EBM practice. Considering the mean increase in self-efficacy in our RCT, and even a consequent change in behavior, this finding deserves attention. Likely a subgroup felt less confident. Hugenholtz et al. made a similar observation, despite the overall favorable results including enhanced evidence-based advice after training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These authors found that peer group sessions facilitated the sharing of knowledge, a concept that is reflected in our subthemes of &#x02018;more appreciation and job satisfaction&#x02019; and &#x02018;collaboration&#x02019;, in which knowledge exchange is thought to facilitate evidence-based practice. Likewise, Shuval et al. mention the need to meet regularly with colleagues experienced in information retrieval and to jointly look for answers to medical questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In line with several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], physicians in our study perceived lack of time as a barrier for applying EBM. Recently, a study in this journal about perceptions of Norwegian doctors towards EBM confirmed that both the organization and the physicians themselves should invest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in EBM, similar to our finding. A novel aspect in our view is the finding that physicians often regarded the output of their EBM efforts as being disproportionate to the time invested. This may have to do with a lack of experience in information retrieval as our physicians recently completed their course. In another study general practitioners achieved an efficient trade-off between maximizing search success and information reliability, and minimizing search time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Another explanation may be lack of recognition for the use of EBM in daily practice and not receiving a reward from management or colleagues for these extra efforts. As with most educational interventions, keeping up with EBM is more difficult over time, unless skills and knowledge are refreshed. This is also why in educational interventions refresher courses are advocated to stimulate the continued use of EBM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Implications for practice and further research</title><p>In order to further increase competency and motivation participating physicians expressed the wish to receive EBM refresher courses and for a helpdesk for EBM questions, a proposal also mentioned by Shuval et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As a result of the first request, EBM refresher courses have already started and provide input for the further refinement of our EBM program towards enhancing evidence-based disability assessment in the Netherlands. The possibilities of a helpdesk or consulting team to facilitate initiatives from the professionals themselves, as requested, is still under consideration within the Dutch National Institute for Employee Benefit Schemes (UWV). Similar facilities set up for general practitioners in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have been evaluated positively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Involving more medical internship students who, in general, are better skilled in EBM can help physicians learn from EBM assignments done by these interns. The expressed need, also in other disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], for collaboration with other colleagues to practice EBM, should be embraced in order to further implement EBM in the field of disability evaluations. A number of groups already started after the course. Evidence-based practice could be facilitated if the organization, manager and medical colleagues all see the application of EBM as a priority.</p><p>Conversely, the increased expertise of these physicians could also help the organization in their efforts in improving products and collaboration with other organizations. This contributes directly and explicitly to the ambition of the Dutch National Institute for Employee Benefit Schemes to become the leading expert organization in disability evaluation in the Netherlands, competing with the best institutes in other countries. Needless to say, a good knowledge infrastructure &#x02013; and its maintenance &#x02013; with online access to requested evidence, is an absolute prerequisite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Future research could include the evaluation of the introduction of new EBM tools, such as online access to up-to-date search strategies and search engines, EBM case-based tutorials, online pre-appraised literature or even an EBM question repository, to facilitate evidence-based work. Furthermore, investigating the foraging approach that aims at an efficient trade-off between maximizing search success and information reliability, and minimizing search time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] could enable physicians evaluating disability to work more evidence based.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Physicians are inclined to use EBM because they perceive it as improving the quality of their work and as a factor making their work more attractive.
