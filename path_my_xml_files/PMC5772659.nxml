We evaluated the effect of musical auditory stimulus associated with anti-hypertensive medication on heart rate (HR) autonomic control in hypertensive subjects. We evaluated 37 well-controlled hypertensive patients designated for anti-hypertensive medication. Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated from the HR monitor recordings of two different, randomly sorted protocols (control and music) on two separate days. Patients were examined in a resting condition 10&#x02009;minutes before medication and 20&#x02009;minutes, 40&#x02009;minutes and 60&#x02009;minutes after oral medication. Music was played throughout the 60&#x02009;minutes after medication with the same intensity for all subjects in the music protocol. We noted analogous response of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure in both protocols. HR decreased 60&#x02009;minutes after medication in the music protocol while it remained unchanged in the control protocol. The effects of anti-hypertensive medication on SDNN (Standard deviation of all normal RR intervals), LF (low frequency, nu), HF (high frequency, nu) and alpha-1 scale were more intense in the music protocol. In conclusion, musical auditory stimulus increased HR autonomic responses to anti-hypertensive medication in well-controlled hypertensive subjects.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Recently, adaptations in life-style have gained attention as a primary preventive of hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

The review selected references based on population, comparison, intervention, outcome and study type fundamentals to define the eligibility criteria. Only three studies achieved their rigorous inclusion conditions. The samples located in the study references ranged between 30 and 60 subjects with a patient mean age of 60 to 93 years. The review indicated that music therapy had significant positive effects on systolic arterial pressure (SAP) (&#x02212;6.58&#x02009;mmHg; 95% CI, &#x02212;9.38 to &#x02212;3.79&#x02009;mmHg; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), but no significant statistical influence on diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) (&#x02212;1.76&#x02009;mmHg; 95% CI: &#x02212;5.61 to 2.09&#x02009;mmHg; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.37) in hypertensive subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">However, another systematic review did not support these findings. K&#x000fc;hlmann <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> followed the PRISMA guidelines and examined publications that evaluated the effects of music on arterial pressure in hypertensive patients through PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Central, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar. They found 10 studies among the preliminary 1689 references that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Yet the randomized controlled trials selected in the review reported a reduction in SAP from 144&#x02009;mmHg to 134&#x02009;mmHg and a decrease in DAP from 84&#x02009;mmHg to 78&#x02009;mmHg. No statistical significance was achieved.</p><p id="Par5">The acute effects of music on cardiovascular parameters have been investigated in this context. Vlachopoulos <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> evaluated the short-term effect of music on arterial stiffness and wave reflections in healthy humans. They reported that classical and rock music reduced aortic stiffness and wave reflections.</p><p id="Par6">Vanderlei <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> assessed cardiac autonomic function through heart rate (HR) variability (HRV), a non-invasive method that studies vagal and sympathetic influence on HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> in healthy young women during exposure to the musical genres of baroque classical music and heavy-metal. In order to avoid the influence of sex hormones, the authors selected only females. The heavy metal music used was &#x0201c;Heavy Metal Universe&#x0201d; from Gamma Ray, which is based on an excitatory rhythm composed of a lead voice, guitar and bass. The classical music applied was the Canon in D by Johann Pachelbel, which is originally scored for three violins and basso continuo, and paired with a gigue. Both movements are in D major. It combines the forms of canon and ground bass. Three voices are engaged in canon, while a fourth voice and the basso continuo play an independent ground bass. The authors reported that heavy-metal music reduced parasympathetic control of HR while no significant change was achieved for classical music when applying nonlinear techniques for assessment. This was possibly due to the excitatory responses related to the heavy metal music style.</p><p id="Par7">Roque <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> investigated the effects on healthy women of listening to baroque classical music and found no significant effect on linear indices of HRV. Also, it was conveyed that baroque classical music acutely decreased global modulation of HR through geometric HRV analysis. This effect was due to the sound intensity of the music<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Accordingly, subjects of either gender diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis or pulp necrosis of the upper front teeth were exposed to music during endodontic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: one group submitted to surgical endodontic treatment without music, the other submitted to endodontic treatment while being exposed to music throughout the surgical procedures. The authors documented that although salivary cortisol levels were unaffected by music, music acutely attenuated HR autonomic responses during surgical treatment.</p><p id="Par9">The studies mentioned above encourage us to investigate the association of music with cardiovascular interventions. Although earlier studies have already evaluated the acute effects of music on autonomic HR control, it is unclear whether music might influence the effect of medication on HRV, SAP and DAP. This information might assist clinicians in improving new pharmacological interventions for hypertension. With this in mind, we evaluated the acute effects of musical auditory stimulus associated with anti-hypertensive medication on cardiovascular variables in hypertensive subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par10">In the resting state, there was no significant difference between the control and music protocols regarding SAP (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25), DAP (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53) and LF/HF (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.58).

As such, it is looked upon as an important factor in the development of conditions aggravating the cardiovascular system, marking it as an important public health problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. According to Santos <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> there are several ways to establish an effective treatment but controlling blood pressure alone is inadequate. Music therapy has been investigated as a possible contributor to the treatment of hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">We set out to evaluate the acute effects of musical auditory stimulus associated with anti-hypertensive medication on HRV in well-controlled hypertensive patients. Of chief importance, we detected that music acutely intensified the effect of anti-hypertensive medication on HRV. The effect size calculations for spectral analysis and DFA upheld the added intense response of HR dynamics when medication was linked with music, equated to medication administrated in the absence of music.</p><p id="Par26">The period of the medication response changes in relation to the type of treatment and its configuration. In most cases the effects begin to appear around 15 to 20&#x02009;minutes after administration and approaches the optimum therapeutically around 60&#x02009;minutes later<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">All medical drugs in this study generate significant changes in vagal control of HR as stated in the research literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Based on our results, anti-hypertensive medication presented more intense effects on HR when associated with music, even taking into account that resting HR was reduced during the music protocol, thus reinforcing the influence of music on parasympathetic responses induced by such medications.</p><p id="Par28">Similarly, the influence of music on changes in HRV induced by medication were observed in the HF band, indicating the parasympathetic regulation of HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Spectral analysis of HRV revealed that HF significantly increased in normalized units for the entire 60&#x02009;minutes after medication administration associated with music, while it remained unchanged when the medication was administered alone. Statistical analysis via protocol interaction demonstrated that HF in absolute units (ms<sup>2</sup>) significantly increased 40&#x02009;minutes after medication in the music protocol compared to the control protocol for the same period. This reinforces the view that music enhances the therapeutic effects anti-hypertensive medication had on HRV.</p><p id="Par29">Furthermore, we detected increased RMSSD values 40&#x02009;minutes after medication in the music protocol compared to the control protocol at the same time. Also, higher pNN50 values were noted in the music protocol 20&#x02009;minutes and 40&#x02009;minutes after medication compared to the control protocol at the same times, suggesting that music augmented the pharmacological effects.</p><p id="Par30">The influence of music on HRV responses to anti-hypertensive medication is supported by the large effect size found in the HF band (nu) for moment interaction, which can also be observed in pNN50 and RMSSD for protocol interaction.</p><p id="Par31">Previous studies verified the effect of music on vagal HR regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Nakamura <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> studied gastric vagal nerve activity in urethane-anesthetized rats during exposure to a relaxant music. The investigators observed elevated parasympathetic activity when rats were exposed to relaxant music (Schumann: Traeumerei). But during white noise there was no significant change in vagal activity. Through expression of c-Fos protein, it was revealed that this mechanism was dependent on the auditory cortex.</p><p id="Par32">An additional study investigated the effect of Mozart&#x02019;s music on HRV in 64 Taiwanese children whose ages ranged from 7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 years old (extending from 2 years 11&#x02009;months to 15 years 4 months)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The researchers determined that changes in parasympathetic modulation of HR is involved in the reduction of epileptiform discharges during exposure to Mozart&#x02019;s music.</p><p id="Par33">We therefore support the view that the intensification of HR responses to anti-hypertensive medication in the music protocol is because music can intensify the vagal activity response induced by such pharmacological treatments. We accept that music could activate the parasympathetic system, as stated by Nakamura <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> causing an increase in gastrointestinal activity, thus accelerating the absorption of anti-hypertensive medication and intensifying the effects on HRV.</p><p id="Par34">However, previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the reduction of HR vagal regulation induced by music. Roque <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> detected that young adult women exposed to classical baroque music (Pachelbel: Canon in D) delivered no change in parasympathetic regulation of HR. The same judgement was supported by da Silva <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Then again, Ferreira <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> stated increased global modulation of HR followed exposure to the same classical baroque music.</p><p id="Par35">A methodological factor that could explain the opposing results concerning musical effects on HR autonomic control is associated with the musical genre applied. The studies mentioned above prescribed different music compared to the music evaluated in our investigation. Under these circumstances, musical genre is a critical consideration when investigating the influence music has on HRV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">Similarly, we completed nonlinear dynamic analysis of HR after anti-hypertensive medication alone and then accompanying music. The research literature reports that adrenergic blockers increase the nonlinear behavior of HR dynamics, which is advantageous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par37">Based on our statistics, alpha-1 scale was unstable between 1.2 and 1.4 in the control protocol, while it decreased and remained close to 1.0 in the music protocol. Cohen&#x02019;s d displayed medium effect size for moment interaction in the music protocol and large effect size for protocol interaction. The most complex structure based on fractal fluctuations is alpha equal to 1.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, our results demonstrate that anti-hypertensive medication increases the nonlinear dynamics of HR. This response was exaggerated by the musical stimulus.</p><p id="Par38">Our study contains further points which need highlighting. Auditory equivalent levels were not measured, therefore it is impossible to detect any effect related to sound intensity. Musical empathy scale was not applied since such a questionnaire was not validated in the subjects&#x02019; language. We did not choose specific pharmacological agents, since the medications directed encompassed diuretics, calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers. This would have delivered essential information regarding which hormone or neurotransmitter is involved in the HRV responses to medication associated with the music applied. There was a significant age range among the sample, 28 to 83 years old, however, the sample investigated is characteristic of the clinical population.</p><p id="Par39">Different periods of medication response are a constraint in our study. We attempted to minimize this bias by matching the groups according to the length of time they had been taking medication, specifically patients were under anti-hypertensive treatment for between six months and one year.</p><p id="Par40">One clarification of the positive acute effects of music on anti-hypertensive medication is that the musical sequence was repeated four times. A recent study applied repeated songs and evaluated HRV in subjects under stressful conditions. Santana <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> stated that it positively influenced HRV during endodontic treatment. In this context, we suggest that the repeated music sequences used in our study may become familiar to the patient and elicit a calming effect.</p><p id="Par41">Here, we investigated a specific group of well-controlled hypertensive patients. We strongly encourage additional investigation under different pathological conditions to perform further experiments to detect whether music has a significant influence on pharmacological action.</p><p id="Par42">It has recently been suggested that treatment of hypertension should be based on life-style behaviors including physical activity and/or giving up smoking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In this context, complementary therapies applied to assist hypertensive treatment may further decrease dependence on pharmacological intervention.
