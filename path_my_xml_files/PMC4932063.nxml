students were selected by convenience sampling, with 20 assigned to an exercise group and
20 assigned to a control group. The yogic eye exercise intervention was performed for 60
minutes, two days a week for 8 weeks. It consisted of 8 steps: palming, blinking, sideways
viewing, front and sideways viewing, rotational viewing, up and down viewing, preliminary
nose tip gazing, and near and distant viewing. Eye fatigue was measured using a
questionnaire for evaluating ocular fatigue. [Results] The exercise-group measurements
revealed a significantly decreased eye-fatigue score compared with that of the control

fatigue score in undergraduate nursing students.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Eye yoga</kwd><kwd>Eye fatigue</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eyes are vital organs in an individual&#x02019;s daily lives. Except during sleep, an immense
variety of visual information is perceived by us through eyes both, at work and at home.
Most users of visual displays have reported forms of visual discomfort such as tired eyes,
dry eyes, eye strain, eye irritation, poor visual acuity, burning sensations, redness, and
double vision<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nowadays, university students are readily exposed to accelerated
environmental eye fatigue as frequent users of computer screens. Eye fatigue is a frequent
complaint due to computer usage for academic or recreational purposes or social
networking<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, eye fatigue can
be influenced by factors such as artificial or insufficient lighting, prolonged watching of
visual displays, poor diet, eye muscle inefficiency due to prolonged hours of office work
and academic studies, psychosocial and emotional tension, and ageing<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that eye disorders are commonly related to functional
defects in the ocular muscles exacerbated by pain and tension resulting from computer
work<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, relaxation practices may help to relieve eye
fatigue<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yoga practices have been
associated with physical as well as mental health benefits via down-regulation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies reported that yoga exercises are related
to better self-rated relaxation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
and significantly decreased stress levels in nursing students<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. These practices have been shown to enhance visual perceptual
sensitivity and the ability to discriminate a flickering stimulus by increasing the
frequency of blinking, which decreases the magnitude of the optical illusion that a flicker
is steady<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nursing students in the yoga
exercise group had a significant decrease in stress levels over this 12-week period, while
those in the control group had an increase in stress levels. However, few studies have
provided evidence that the practice of eye yoga helps to relieve eye fatigue. Hence, the
purpose of this study was to assess the effects of yogic eye exercises on eye fatigue in
undergraduate nursing students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study used a pretest-posttest design with a non-equivalent control group. The subjects
of this study were 30 healthy female and 10 healthy male undergraduate nursing students aged
20&#x02013;23&#x02005;years with no medical eye diseases, no history of applying eye medications, and no
experience with yoga exercises. The participants were recruited through the Internet
homepage of nursing department, Kangwon National University. The participants volunteered to
participate as members of one of two groups, either the yoga exercise or the control group.
All participants received detailed information on the purpose and usefulness of this study
and signed an informed consent form. They were recruited to the yoga exercise (n=20) and
control groups (n=20). Forty subjects completed the entire study. The Institutional Review
Board of Kangwon National University approved the study. Demographic information and eye
fatigue scores were measured as pretest data. Eye fatigue scores were also measured as
posttest data.</p><p>Eye fatigue was measured using a questionnaire for evaluating ocular fatigue<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This instrument consisted of 12 items scored using a 7-point Likert scale (0=none, 1 or
2=slight, 3 or 4=moderate, 5 or 6=severe), assessing the source of eye fatigue from 12
items: tired eyes, sore/aching eyes, irritated eyes, watery eyes, dry eyes, eyestrain,
hot/burning eyes, blurred vision, difficulty focusing, double vision, and visual
discomfort<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A higher score indicates a
higher level of perceived fatigue. Eye fatigue scale measurements were obtained from the
participants both before the commencement of the study and after the completion of the yogic
exercise intervention.</p><p>Yogic exercises were conducted for about one hour per session, twice a week for 8 weeks.
The yoga instructor was certified by Bihar Yoga Bharati in India. The yogic exercises were
performed in the Department of Nursing. Eye-yoga exercises were chosen because of the
availability of scientific studies on this type of yoga. They consisted of 8 steps: palming,
blinking, sideways viewing, front and sideways viewing, rotational viewing, up and down
viewing, preliminary nose-tip gazing, near and distant viewing etc. Each step was performed
for 5 minutes per cycle. After the eye exercises, the participants practiced the Shavasana
(corpse pose) for 20 minutes to relax their eyes. The scientific explanation for yoga eye
exercise has been described as follows: palming relaxes and revitalizes the eye muscles and
stimulates the circulation of the aqueous humor, the liquid that runs between the cornea and
the lens of the eye, aiding the correction of defective vision; the blinking exercise
encourages the blinking reflex to become spontaneous, inducing relaxation of the eye
muscles; sideways viewing relaxes the tension of muscles strained by constant reading and
close work, preventing and correcting squint; front and sideways viewing improves the
coordination of medial and lateral muscles; rotational viewing restores balance in the
muscles surrounding the eyes and improves the coordinated activity of both eyeballs;
up-and-down viewing balances the upper and lower eyeball muscles; preliminary nose-tip
gazing improves the accommodating and focusing power of the eye muscles; and the near and
distant viewing are similar to the preliminary nose-tip gazing exercise but the range of
movements is further increased<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS program (version 18.0) for Windows. All
data are presented as number (percentage) or median (range). A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test with
Fisher&#x02019;s exact test or Z test was used to test for homogeneity of demographic and clinical
characteristics between the exercise and control group. Significant differences between
groups were determined using Wilcoxon rank sum tests due to nonhomogeneous ages in the
demographic characteristics. Significant differences within groups were determined using
Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Probability values of less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Variables are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Homogeneity test results for general characteristics and eye fatigue between the

Except for the age variable, no significant differences in characteristics
were found between the yoga group and the control group. There were no significant
differences in the pre-intervention eye fatigue scores between the two groups. After the
course of yoga exercises, the eye fatigue scores differed significantly between the 2 groups
(yoga group vs. control group, p&#x0003c;0.001) and over time (pretest vs. posttest,
p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>As shown in the study results, after 8 weeks of yogic eye exercises, the eye fatigue scores
were significantly decreased compared with those obtained before starting yoga practice.
Additionally, nursing students in the yoga exercise group had a significant decrease in
their eye-fatigue levels over the 8-week period, while those in the control group had no
difference in their eye-fatigue levels. These findings are similar to those of a previous
study that reported that yoga practices significantly decreased the visual discomfort score
of participants working in a software company<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study has suggested that a
yoga program should include yoga postures, breathing, joint exercises, visual cleansing
exercises, and relaxation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast to
the yoga group in this study, the control group had no differences in their eye fatigue
scores. The differences between the two groups, besides the eye-yoga effects, may be
influenced by psychological benefits gained by participants in the yoga group from attending
frequent meetings with the instructor. This supports the concept that psychological effects
could be an additional factor in the yoga group<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, these findings confirm that yogic eye exercises can be
considered as a non-pharmacological intervention for relieving eye fatigue. However, there
have been few studies related to eye-yoga exercises, implying that follow-up studies are
needed to establish rigorous methodological evidence to support the relief of eye fatigue
through an eye-yoga program.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. The eye fatigue scale was self-rated, with no
comparison with objective indicators of eye fatigue. This study was not conducted under
strictly controlled research conditions; for example, some participants wore contact lenses,
which may lead to higher levels of dry eyes. Despite these limitations, these findings
suggest that yogic eye exercise can relieve eye fatigue levels in nursing students.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Telles</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Naveen</surname><given-names>KV</given-names></name><name><surname>Dash</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of yoga on self-rated visual discomfort in computer
