Pneumoperitoneum is commonly induced by carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Pneumoperitoneum, as well as hypercapnia due to CO<sub>2</sub>, is responsible for the adverse cardiovascular effects. An abrupt elevation of mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance, and decreased cardiac output are commonly noted.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This vasopressor response is due to the release of both catecholamines[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and vasopressin.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The cardiac output will be further decreased by the reverse Trendelenburg position used in these surgeries. These events will be less tolerated, especially by patients with compromised cardiac function. Hence, attenuation of these vasopressor responses is of paramount importance to an anesthesiologist. Opioids,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] beta blockers,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] magnesium, and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have been used for this purpose.</p><p>Magnesium has shown to block the release of catecholamines release from both adrenal medullae, as well as from nerve terminals.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It has been used to attenuate intubation-induced vasopressor response. Magnesium also acts directly on blood vessels causing vasodilation, thus attenuating vasopressin-induced vasoconstriction.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine, a selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist, decreases heart rate (HR) and arterial pressure. It has been used for attenuating vasopressor responses.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] We hypothesized that magnesium and clonidine can be used for attenuating the hemodynamic responses to pneumoperitoneum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was undertaken after obtaining institutional Ethical Committee clearance, as well as informed consent from all patients. It was a randomized, double-blind study. The primary objective was to compare the effect of intravenous (IV) clonidine and magnesium sulfate on intraoperative hemodynamics during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The secondary objective was to compare the effects of clonidine and magnesium sulfate on postoperative recovery, such as time for extubation and time to verbal response.</p><p>Ninety patients, aged 18&#x02013;60 years, scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) health status Classes I and II were included in the study. Patients were assigned randomly (computer-derived random number sequence) into three groups of thirty patients each: Group M (magnesium sulfate group), Group C (clonidine group), and Group NS (normal saline control group). The three groups were:</p><p>

</p><p>The drugs were prepared and administered by an anesthesiologist who was not involved with data collection or patient management. The patients, investigators, and the anesthesiologists were all blinded to the solution infused. Patients with hypermagnesemia, known allergy to magnesium sulfate and clonidine, hypertension, morbid obesity, and severe hepatic, renal, endocrine, and cardiac dysfunction were excluded from the study.</p><p>Premedication was with tablet ranitidine 150 mg and tablet ondansetron 8 mg orally at bedtime the night before surgery and on the day of surgery. Injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscular half an hour before shifting to OT. On arrival in the operation theater, monitors were attached (HR, noninvasive blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, electrocardiogram, and temperature) and baseline vital parameters were recorded. Preoxygenation was done for 3 min and patients received 1 &#x000b5;g/kg of fentanyl citrate intravenously. Propofol 2 mg/kg was used for induction and endotracheal intubation was facilitated by a muscle relaxant, vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg.</p><p>The test drugs were infused over 10 min before creating pneumoperitoneum. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), MAP, and HR were recorded before induction (baseline values), at the end of magnesium sulfate/clonidine/saline administration and before pneumoperitoneum (P0), 5 min (P5), 10 min (P10), 20 min (P20), 30 min (P30), and 40 min (P40) after pneumoperitoneum. Pneumoperitoneum inflation pressures were maintained at 14 mm Hg. Maintenance of anesthesia was with nitrous oxide (50%), oxygen (50%), and isoflurane. IV fentanyl was given at a dose of 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg when there were signs of inadequate analgesia (increase of MAP and HR 20% above baseline). Vecuronium 0.02 mg/kg was used for maintenance of muscle relaxation based on a train of four monitoring. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was used and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) was maintained between 35 and 40 mm Hg. Patients were positioned in head up tilt of 15&#x000b0; with right lateral tilt. Intraoperative fluid requirements were as per Holliday-Segar formula. Hypotension (MAP &#x0003c;20% of baseline) was managed with fluid bolus or ephedrine 6 mg IV bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;50 bpm) was treated with atropine 0.6 mg IV. Neuromuscular blockade reversal was achieved at the conclusion of the surgery, with injection neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Patients in whom laparoscopic cholecystectomy was converted to open procedure were excluded from the study.</p><p>Following times were noted down after tracheal extubation: (i) Time to tracheal extubation and (ii) time to response to verbal commands.</p><p>HR, MAP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and EtCO<sub>2</sub> were recorded throughout the surgical procedure at an interval of 10 min. Any other adverse events or side effects were recorded during the postoperative period.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was estimated based on the data provided in the study, &#x0201c;effects of magnesium sulfate and clonidine on propofol consumption, hemodynamics, and postoperative recovery.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Thirty in each group were recruited and estimated using the nMaster software (Department of biostatistics, CMC, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India).</p><p>Analysis of variance was used to find the significance of study parameters between three or more groups of patients. <italic>Post hoc</italic> Tukey's test was used to find pair-wise significance and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed, dependent) was used to find the significance of study parameters on the continuous scale within each group.
