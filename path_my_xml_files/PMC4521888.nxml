It is characterized by peri and/or retro patellar pain, and can be so debilitating that everyday tasks become difficult [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, it is a chronic condition, with 50% of patients reporting same or worse pain after 4 years, and 27% still reporting same or worse pain after 16 years [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, it has been proposed that when left untreated, PFP may lead to the development of patellofemoral osteoarthritis [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Patellofemoral pain is commonly treated with medially wedged insoles, but the reason why this type of footwear produces clinical benefits is unknown. Indeed, systematic reviews have highlighted the need for randomized controlled trials studying the relationship between wedged insoles, biomechanics and treatment outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>It was previously found that subjects with PFP demonstrate increased internal knee abduction angular impulses (KAAIs) compared to healthy controls during running [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mathematically, KAAIs are calculated as the integral of the internal knee abduction moments with respect to stance time. Therefore, biomechanically, KAAIs represent the cumulative resultant frontal-plane internal load the knee joint experiences during the stance phase of running. Internal knee abduction moments develop to balance external moments acting to compress the medial tibiofemoral joint. To counteract the external moment, it is believed that tension increases, passively or actively, in lateral knee tissues such as muscles/tendons or retinacula, and this may create greater compressive and shear stress in the patellofemoral joint, activating mechanical nociceptors within the joint thereby contributing to PFP [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, one possible strategy for PFP treatment is a reduction of KAAIs during running.</p><p>Laterally wedged insoles tend to decrease KAAIs during locomotion in healthy subjects via a lateral shift of the centre of pressure beneath the foot [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the osteoarthritis literature, lateral wedges have also been shown to reduce external knee adduction moments (a variable mathematically related to internal knee abduction moments and angular impulses) [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite these positive biomechanical effects, lateral wedges have never been tested as a treatment for PFP. Conversely, medial wedges are commonly used for treatment of PFP [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; however these types of wedges have been shown to increase internal and external frontal-plane knee joint moments during locomotion in both healthy and knee osteoarthritis populations [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, medial wedges tend to increase frontal plane knee loading&#x02013;a characteristic associated with PFP&#x02013;yet still seem to be of benefit to patients with PFP, although KAAI and clinical outcomes have never been evaluated together previously in insole studies for individuals with PFP. It is therefore not currently clear whether a reduction or increase in KAAI magnitude is more beneficial for pain relief.</p><p>We undertook a randomized controlled trial to determine if a change in KAAI is related to pain reduction for runners with PFP, specifically by comparing lateral and medial wedge insole interventions, and increased KAAI and decreased KAAI groups. It was hypothesized that lateral wedges would be a superior intervention to medial wedges as a result of reduced KAAI magnitudes. In the event that not all individuals experienced KAAI changes in the expected directions (i.e. reduction for lateral wedge and increase for medial wedge), we hypothesized that those who did experience reduced KAAIs would experience greater pain reductions than those who experienced increased KAAIs. Among all participants, we hypothesized a linear relationship between % change in KAAI and % change in pain over the six-week period, with greater % reductions in pain attributed to those runners who experience greater % reductions in KAAI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Participants</title><p>Volunteers responded to television, newspaper, radio and poster advertisements calling for runners who suffered from knee pain.

Insoles were prepared to the same specifications a priori. Insoles were cut to the appropriate shoe size out of 3 mm ethylene vinyl acetate &#x0201c;EVA&#x0201d; (SOLFLEX Firm 60, Vittoria Phoenix Inc., Vittoria, Ontario), and then sanded either medially or laterally along the full length of the insole to create a wedge. Thicker wedges were made by placing additional EVA layers on top of one another. We compared a 3 mm lateral wedge to a 6 mm medial wedge, which corresponded to wedge angles of approximately 3&#x000b0; and 6&#x000b0; respectively (<xref rid="pone.0134461.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). A medial wedge of 6 mm was chosen since this is commonly studied in PFP research, is often used clinically and since greater thicknesses may be uncomfortable [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, other studies using them have shown good subject compliance [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus the 6 mm medial wedge represented the gold-standard wedge for our study. A 3 mm lateral wedge was chosen as a conservative thickness to ensure a comfortable fit within the shoe, and to reduce the risk of any injurious effects since lateral wedges have not been tested as a treatment for PFP previously. Additionally, wedge thicknesses lower than 3 mm may not elicit KAAI changes during gait [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since measures of static joint alignment, foot shape, or patellar tracking were not performed in this study, these factors were not considered in wedge design or wedge assignment to participants.</p><fig id="pone.0134461.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0134461.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>The wedged insole conditions tested in this study.</title><p>On right, the 6mm medial wedge is shown.

Since the randomization sequence was generated a priori, the researcher was not blinded during data collection. Although subjects could feel and see their assigned intervention during the six-week study, all subjects were told they were receiving an experimental insole, regardless of the condition they were actually assigned to.

Kinetic and kinematic biomechanical data were imported into KinTrak v7.0 software (University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta), and were smoothed using fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filters, with cut-off frequencies of 50 Hz and 12 Hz, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Three-dimensional joint kinematics were determined using a joint coordinate system, and resultant 3D joint kinetics were calculated using inverse dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Resultant internal knee abduction moments were integrated with respect to stance time to yield the knee abduction angular impulse (KAAI) for each trial. The average KAAI across the five trials in each insole condition for each subject was used in subsequent statistical analysis. Errors associated with calculation of KAAIs are described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measures for this study were (1) change (i.e. difference) in KAAI between the neutral shoe condition and the assigned wedge condition, measured by biomechanical gait analysis, and (2) change in pain during running over the six-weeks measured by cVAS. Change scores were quantified as % change, since this method is less biased by baseline scores [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Sample Size</title><p>Collins et al.[<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that participants in their medial wedge condition experienced usual pain of 38.6 mm (SD 16) at baseline and 25.4 mm (SD 17.4) at six-week follow-up on 100 mm VASs, or approximately a 34% decrease in pain. We considered the lateral wedge condition to be a superior treatment for PFP if pain could be reduced by a clinically meaningful additional 20 points (i.e. a 86% reduction in pain) [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Based on this mean difference, a standard deviation of 17.4, a two-tailed &#x003b1; of 0.05, and an expected drop-out rate of 15%, 13 subjects per group would achieve 80% power in comparing the lateral and medial wedge groups by independent-samples t-test.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v19 (IBM Corp., Somers, NY) on a per-protocol basis. All data were first checked for normality. The primary analysis for this study was a multiple linear regression to compute the r-squared value (<italic>R</italic>
<sup><italic>2</italic></sup>), where % change in KAAI, and baseline pain were predictor variables, and % change in pain during running was the outcome variable. Since medial wedges are known to increase frontal-plane knee loads, yet may still be beneficial for PFP treatment [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we also conducted a second multiple regression analysis where absolute % KAAI (instead of &#x000b1; % change) and baseline pain were predictor variables, and % change in pain was the outcome variable. This second analysis allowed us to observe relationships between any type of change in KAAI, regardless of increase or decrease.</p><p>Two-tailed independent-samples t-tests were used to compare all baseline and follow-up data between insole groups. In addition to analyzing participants grouped by assigned insole, comparisons were also made between an &#x0201c;increased KAAI&#x0201d; group that comprised all participants who experienced increased KAAIs, regardless of wedge assigned, and a &#x0201c;decreased KAAI&#x0201d; group that comprised all participants who experienced decreased KAAIs, regardless of wedge assigned. This secondary grouping allowed us to make the distinction between differences that occurred due to wedge type and differences that occurred due to wedge biomechanical effect. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec021"><title>Results</title><p>From June to October 2011, 370 volunteers were screened, of which 36 were enrolled in the study (<xref rid="pone.0134461.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

Since both the increased and decreased KAAI groups experienced pain improvement, a second post-hoc multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between % pain reduction and the absolute % change in KAAI instead of using the &#x000b1; % change in KAAI. Here, a significant relationship between absolute % change in KAAI and % change in pain (or, pain reduction) during running was observed (n = 25, <italic>R</italic>

On average, clinically meaningful pain reductions occurred regardless of insole assigned, and regardless of KAAI effect. Over 6 weeks, Collins et al. [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported a reduction in worst pain by just under 20 mm (baseline of 59.4 mm) on a standard visual analogue scale for individuals treated with medial wedges. These participants were asked to use their insoles as much as possible with their daily footwear. In contrast, the present study found worst pain reductions of about 30 points (baseline of 40&#x02013;50 points) for both the lateral and medial wedge groups over six weeks when participants used the insoles exclusively with their running footwear. Similar to these results, Eng and Pierrynowski reported pain reductions during running of about 66% from week 2 to week 8 (week 0 not reported) with medial wedges [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; however, this intervention was combined with an exercise program. It should be noted that the construction method of the wedges differed in each study, suggesting construction method may play a role in wedge efficacy.</p><p>Differences in pain reduction between the 3 mm lateral wedge and 6 mm medial wedge groups, and between the increased KAAI and decreased KAAI groups were not found in the present study. In addition, no relationship was found between % change in KAAI and % change in pain. Thus, our hypothesis that decreased KAAIs would be associated with greater pain reductions compared to the increased KAAI group was not supported. However, when assessing the relationship between absolute change in KAAI (i.e. regardless of KAAI increase or decrease) and % change in pain, a significant association was found.</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that runners with PFP experience higher KAAIs during running than healthy controls [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similar to work on knee osteoarthritis, where increased frontal-plane loads are also implicated in disease progression [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we expected a decrease in KAAI magnitude to be most beneficial for treatment. However, our results suggested that further increases to KAAIs were beneficial in the short term as well. We have presumed that PFP is a condition of mechanical origin, i.e. where increased patellofemoral loads are implicated in disease development and continuance,[<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and that these mechanical changes occur internally, as opposed to external joint angle changes from the wedged insoles [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. If this is true, then mechanically, PFP treatment would require either decreased joint stress, and/or alteration of the location of peak stresses (i.e. change patellar tracking) [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Given that both increased and decreased KAAIs seemed beneficial for PFP management in this study, yet long-term increases to the KAAI may have implications for development and progression of medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] further investigation into the relationship between KAAI magnitudes/changes and patellofemoral mechanics would be important. This could be done through use of musculoskeletal simulation or <italic>in vivo</italic> animal modeling approaches [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134461.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It may also be of interest to investigate further the role of the retinaculum in modulating frontal-plane knee joint loads and patellofemoral mechanics.</p><p>In the present study, absolute magnitude of KAAI change accounted for 21% of the variability in the observed change (reduction) in pain over six weeks. While this value is low, it is to be expected since KAAI&#x02013;a tibiofemoral joint variable&#x02013;was used as a surrogate for patellofemoral joint loading. This was necessary because estimation of patellofemoral loads using motion analysis alone is not possible. In addition, the precise influence that resultant KAAIs have on patellofemoral mechanics is not yet known, as described above. These two points may account for much of the remaining 79% in data variability. At present, KAAIs should not be used clinically as a predictor of PFP outcome until further research is conducted to better understand their relation to patellofemoral mechanics.</p><p>The influence of wedge type on KAAI change was not consistent. Specifically, the ratio of subjects who experienced increased KAAIs versus decreased KAAIs was approximately 1:1 for both the lateral and medial wedge groups. In healthy runners, some studies have reported similar inconsistent KAAI effects [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; however, as our data suggest, the shape of the wedged insole does not seem to be as important as the mechanical effect it produces in terms of pain reduction over six weeks. Other research on insoles have also shown that as knee joint loading variables are altered, it is also possible that altered loading at other joints such as the ankle or hip may occur [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the long term, this may have implications for new injury development, and so should be considered in future trials.</p><sec id="sec025"><title>Strengths &#x00026; Limitations</title><p>Strengths of this study included our randomized and blinded design, the high degree of control we implemented that reduced the possibility of measurement bias, our close monitoring of subjects, as well as the collection of biomechanical data in conjunction with pain data, allowing for direct quantification of a treatment mechanism.</p><p>Although we achieved high control using standardized wedges with a constant shoe model for all participants, custom-footwear orthotics are often preferred in the clinical setting due to improved comfort, or consideration of other anatomical characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Other studies have shown that custom foot orthotics that incorporate a wedge produce similar joint loading effects as a wedge alone, and so we believe our results are clinically applicable and externally valid [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While the controlled shoe model allowed us to attribute all observed mechanical changes to the wedged insole, a limitation with this approach is that we do not know if the shoe alone induced changes to the participant&#x02019;s baseline KAAI. Consequently, the actual magnitude of KAAI change relative the participant&#x02019;s baseline in their own shoe may be higher or lower than what is reported in this study, and this may have affected the goodness of fit of our regression model, or possibly even explain why individuals in the increased KAAI group experienced clinical improvement. Additionally, our regression model only considered participants who experienced a reduction in pain, and so the influence of altered KAAIs on worsening symptoms remains unknown.</p><p>The primary limitation of this study was a relatively short follow-up period. The six-week period was chosen since this has been shown to be the time of greatest improvement for PFP [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Extended follow-up times should be studied to determine the long-term effects of altered KAAIs using medially or laterally wedged footwear. In addition, although our sample size was smaller than other larger long-term trials [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], our sample was sufficient as a trial with the objective being to determine if large treatment differences between groups existed, and to identify the mechanism by which wedged insoles produce clinical benefits.</p><p>An additional limitation of this study was that KAAIs were only measured at baseline. Lewinson et al. [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] have recently shown that KAAI magnitudes are maintained during 30 minute runs with medial and lateral wedge insoles, and other authors have shown that KAAI magnitudes are maintained over a period of 6 weeks with wedged insoles [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Together, this suggests that under normal circumstances, KAAI magnitudes would not be expected to change over 6 weeks or during a given run. It is not known whether this holds true for clinical populations where KAAI magnitude may interact with pain severity and potentially change if pain changes over time. Consequently, it is possible that one explanation for why we observed improvements in both the increased KAAI and decreased KAAI group is that KAAIs were continually altered during the course of the 6-week study. Since we hypothesized that reduced KAAIs would be superior, we did not anticipate a need to collect follow-up biomechanical data; however, it is recommended that future trials assess biomechanical parameters at baseline and at follow-up to confirm that KAAIs are maintained over the duration of the study.</p><p>Finally, the lack of a neutral control group could be seen as a limitation since we were not able to compare both lateral and medial wedges to a neutral group. However, given the success of medial wedges in previous PFP studies [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we assumed the medial wedge to be a supported clinical treatment and instead designed a superiority study for direct comparison of two wedge types rather than withholding participants from receiving treatment, as would be the case in a neutral group.</p><p>To further strengthen the external validity of our findings, the mean age, height, mass, body mass index, and sex distributions of the sample in our study were similar to those reported in other PFP trials [<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134461.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Greater absolute % change in KAAI during running was related to greater % reductions in pain over six-weeks for runners with PFP who experienced pain reduction with a wedged insole, regardless of whether lateral or medial wedged insoles were used. This suggests that absolute % change in KAAI is one mechanism by which wedged insoles elicit clinical benefits. This is also the first study to show that laterally wedged insoles have the potential to serve as an alternative therapy to medial wedges for management of PFP; however, they should be studied further in long-term studies before implementation into regular clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134461.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist for the study based on the submitted manuscript.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134461.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134461.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Original protocol approved by the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134461.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. V.M.Y.
