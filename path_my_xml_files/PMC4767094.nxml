The study was conducted in a Tertiary Care Level Institute and a Clinical Research Organization after Ethical Committee approval. A total of 60 patients of American Society of Anaesthesiologist physical status (ASA) Grade I and II, age between 15 and 65 years of both sexes were studied. Patients with co-morbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, renal or hepatic disease and pregnancy were excluded. Furthermore, patients on antihypertensive medication and those with anticipated difficult airway were excluded. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups by allocation sequence generated by computer-generated random number table. Each group consisting of 30 patients. Group allocation was done by an anesthesiologist who was not the part of study design. Drugs were administered by the anesthesiologist who was not the part of data collection and analysis. Group A received oral clonidine 5 &#x000b5;g/kg and Group B received oral gabapentin 800 mg, 90 min prior to surgery with sips of water.</p><p>In the operating room, intravenous (i.v.) cannula was secured, and standard monitors were placed.</p><p>Monitoring included heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>). Baseline (preinduction) HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the patients were noted. After preoxygenation, all patients were induced with injection propofol (2 mg/kg) i.v. and injection suxamethonium (2 mg/kg) i.v.</p><p>After the introduction of direct laryngoscope HR, SBP, DBP and MAP were monitored at 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min of laryngoscopy. Baseline reading was taken after giving clonidine or gabapentin orally. 0<sup>th</sup> min reading indicates values after induction and before intubation. The rest of the readings were taken after intubation.</p><p>Intubation was done with the appropriate sized endotracheal tube. Intubation was done by trained anesthesiologists in all cases. Duration of laryngoscopy and intubation was restricted to &#x0003c;30 seconds as measured by a stopwatch. In case of hypotension mephentermine, 6 mg i.v. and for bradycardia atropine 0.6 mg i.v. was kept as a rescue treatment. However, none of the patients required above clinical intervention. Postoperative sedation was evaluated using Ramsay Sedation Scale score, and side effects of these drugs were noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistics</title><p>Preliminary sample size estimation showed that approximately 30 patients should be included in each group. It was assumed that 15% reduction in HR and blood pressure will be clinically meaningful with estimated standard deviation of 11 for HR and 20 for blood pressure respectively, in order to ensure the power of 80%. An alpha error was assumed to be 0.05 (95% confidence interval).</p><p>Patient characteristics were compared using two independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test and Chi-square test.

Direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation is routinely performed during the administration of general anesthesia. This pressor response causes tachycardia, hypertension, and increased the workload on the myocardium and its subsequent detrimental effects. Several pharmacological agents have been tried to decrease this response in past.</p><p>Both clonidine and gabapentin are being investigated as useful adjuncts to anesthesia. Clonidine has known sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic properties. It stimulates &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic inhibitory neurons in the medullary vasomotor center. Decreased central sympathetic outflow is manifested as peripheral vasodilatation and decrease in systemic blood pressure, HR and cardiac output. One of the highest densities of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-receptors is present in pontine locus ceruleus, a vital modulator of vigilance. Sedative effects of clonidine reflect inhibition of this nucleus.</p><p>Gabapentin, a structural analog of neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid acts by inhibiting calcium influx and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitter in pain pathways by binding to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> subunit of the presynaptic voltage-gated Ca<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> channels. Gabapentin is a second-generation anticonvulsant that is, effective in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. It was shown to be effective in treating a variety of chronic pain conditions, including postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, complex regional pain syndrome, inflammatory pain, central pain, malignant pain, trigeminal neuralgia, HIV-related neuropathy, and headaches. The mechanism by which gabapentin attenuates the pressor response to laryngoscopy and intubation is unknown. The drug inhibits membrane voltage-gated calcium channels, thus acting in a manner similar to calcium channel blockers and calcium channel blockers have been found to be effective in blunting the pressor response, so that may be the underlying mechanism of action.</p><p>Fassoulaki <italic>et al</italic>. have shown the efficacy of gabapentin in attenuating the pressor response. 100 patients undergoing elective surgery were randomly allocated into two groups of 50 patients each. Patients in Group A received gabapentin 800 mg and patients in Group B received placebo capsules the night before and on the morning of surgery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] SBP was significantly lower in the gabapentin as compared to the control group 0, 1, 3, 5, and 10 min after intubation. DBP also was lower in the gabapentin group 0, 1, 3, and 5 min after intubation. MAP also was lower in the gabapentin group 0, 1, 3, and 5 min after intubation. HR also was lower in the gabapentin group 0, 1, and 3 min after intubation.</p><p>In our study, demographic data, when analyzed, did not show any significant difference in age, weight, height and sex ratio among two groups, and thus the two groups were comparable.</p><p>The hemodynamic pressor response to direct laryngoscopy and intubation as observed by change in pulse rate, SBP, DBP, and MAP were attenuated in both groups, effect being more significant in Group A to control pulse rate. Both drugs were equally effective to control SBP, DBP and MAP.</p><p>Singhal <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a similar study. They allocated 100 patients into two groups of 50 each. Group A received oral clonidine 200 &#x000b5;g and Group B received oral gabapentin 900 mg 90 min prior to surgery. The study revealed that rise in HR was obtunded in group A as compared to Group B except at 1<sup>st</sup> min. MA<italic>P</italic> values were found below baseline at all times in Group A as compared to Group B in which significant rise was seen at 1<sup>st</sup> min. The results are similar to our study.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In another study, Marashi <italic>et al</italic>. concluded with contrasting results. They investigated the comparative assessment of clonidine and gabapentin premedication on attenuation of hemodynamic responses following laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Group I received 0.2 mg clonidine, Group II received placebo, and Group III received 900 mg gabapentin, 120 min before the operation. The analysis revealed that the HR, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure significantly differed between groups. The highest rates of HR, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure were in the placebo group and the lowest rate were in the gabapentin group at the time of 1, 3, 5 min of laryngoscopy, except that the lowest rate of HR in 10 min after laryngoscopy was in clonidine group.</p><p>Montazeri <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study on 96 patients. These were divided into three groups of 32 each. Group <italic>P</italic> received placebo; Group G was given gabapentin 800 mg and Group C clonidine 0.3 mg. The analysis revealed HR significantly reduced in Group G and Group C as compared to Group <italic>P</italic> just before laryngoscopy. No significant difference was noted between Group G and Group C with respect to variables SBP, DBP, MAP. The results are similar to our study.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Memis <italic>et al</italic>. studied 90 normotensive patients (ASA Grade I) undergoing elective surgery. They were divided into three groups of 30 patients each. Patients received oral placebo (Group I), 400 mg of gabapentin (Group II) or 800 mg of gabapentin (Group III) 1 h prior to surgery in the operating theatre. The HR and arterial pressure was significantly less in Group III at 1, 3, 5 and 10 min after intubation compared to Groups I and II.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Shreedhara <italic>et al</italic>. compared gabapentin and clonidine for a pressor response with similar results.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, they did not compare the sedation with the two drugs. The postoperative sedation, as observed by Ramsay Sedation Scale score was more in gabapentin as compared with clonidine.</p><p>Clonidine and gabapentin have certain adverse effects inherent to their structure. Clonidine can cause dry mouth, sedation, hypotension and marked bradycardia. The most frequent side-effects reported with gabapentin are somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, unsteadiness, nystagmus, headache, tremors, diplopia, and nausea. Few side effects such as sedation, bradycardia in Group A and drowsiness in Group B were observed. None of these side effects warranted any active clinical intervention. However, this single dose use of these drugs is unlikely to cause above effects.</p><p>Propofol was used for induction in both groups in our study; it can interfere with the assessment of pressor response as it can cause bradycardia and hypotension. However, it was used in both groups. Other inducing agents like thiopentone may cause tachycardia and may reveal misleading results. We did not measure levels of catecholamine during the study. These can be considered limitations of our study.</p><p>Hemodynamic pressor response is a complex process that is affected by multiple factors including depth of anesthesia, opioid use in premedication, i.v. anesthetics, inhalational agents and use of supraglottic airway devices to name a few. Future studies can be directed toward the effect of these confounding factors on the efficacy of clonidine and gabapentin. These can be supplemented by concurrent measurement of catecholamine and cortisol levels for better correlation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Overall, we conclude that both oral clonidine 5 &#x000b5;g/kg and oral gabapentin 800 mg given as premedication 90 min prior to surgery, effectively attenuates hemodynamic pressor response to direct laryngoscopy. Clonidine controls pulse rate better than gabapentin whereas both drugs equally reduces blood pressure. Gabapentin produces more postoperative sedation than clonidine. Few side effects like dry mouth and bradycardia with clonidine and drowsiness with gabapentin were noted requiring no active clinical intervention.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Desborough</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The stress response to trauma and surgery</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2000</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>109</fpage><lpage>17</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10927999</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sulaiman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Karthekeyan</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Vakamudi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sundar</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Ravullapalli</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Gandham</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effects of dexmedetomidine on attenuation of stress response to endotracheal intubation in patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting</article-title><source>Ann Card Anaesth</source><year>2012</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>39</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22234020</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stoelting</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Blood pressure and heart rate changes during short-duration laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation: Influence of viscous or intravenous lidocaine</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1978</year><volume>57</volume><fpage>197</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">565157</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Prys-Roberts</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>LT</given-names></name><name><surname>Meloche</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Fo&#x000eb;x</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Studies of anaesthesia in relation to hypertension.
