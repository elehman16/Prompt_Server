Insulin dysfunction causes chronic hyperglycemia, irregularities in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fat, and proteins.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Systemic effects of diabetes may lead to a variety of complications including impaired vision,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] impaired function of kidneys, heart, blood vessels, nerves, and diabetic wounds that may result in the amputation of limbs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Global prevalence of diabetes has dramatically increased over the past two decades from 30 million in 1985 to 285 million in 2010.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] According to the International Federation of Diabetes prediction, the current figures of the diabetic population will increase to 438 million patients with diabetes by 2030.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The US Prevention and Control Diseases Center reported that about 25.8 million people (8.3%) were living with diabetes in 2010 in the USA.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In Iran, only among the adults population (25&#x02013;64 years old), 2 million people were living with diabetes, and 16.8% of this population had also impaired fasting glycemia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Reduction of the serum levels of glucose among patients with diabetes, particularly by medications with minimum side effects, has been investigated widely in recent decades. There are numerous plants worldwide, which have beneficial effects on the treatment of diabetes. Several studies have shown reassurance to the traditional medicine and natural therapies in the treatment of diabetes.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Also, WHO emphasizes on diabetes therapy with traditional treatments, particularly by natural hypoglycemic plants as a useful source of oral medications.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Application of chemical treatments such as sulfonylurea agents and metformin should be limited, due to their pharmacokinetic properties and different side effects. <italic>Citrullus colocynthis</italic> plant has a strong laxative property and application of high dosages of this herbal drug can cause diarrhea, painful cramps, and bloody diarrhea in humans.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Application of very high doses of this plant in laboratory animals has caused heart attack and death.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> is currently prescribed, as a dried fruit, for patients with diabetes in several cities of Iran, by traditional healers, in different dosages ranged from 300 to 800 mg/day. There is no monitoring for the evaluation of effectiveness and/or toxicity rates of this plant among patients using the treatment.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Although, experimental studies have confirmed the blood glucose lowering properties of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> plant, to our knowledge, only a few clinical studies have been performed on its effectiveness or relevant side effects among patients so far.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The present study was designed to investigate the efficacy of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> fruit on fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin as well as its possible side effects among the patients with type II diabetes in Sabzevar city in the Northeast of Iran.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study followed the guidelines of The Declaration of Helsinki and Tokyo for humans and was approved by Research Ethics Committee of Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam-Iran and was dedicated the IRB approval of EC/92/H/187. All patients completed an informed consent form before starting the study.</p><p>In this double-blind clinical trial study, among those with inclusion criteria, a total of 70 consecutive patients with type II diabetes attended to the Diabetes Clinic of Sabzevar Medical University in Northeast of Iran, during 2 months period in 2014, were enrolled. A written informed consent was obtained from the each patient. All the participants had previously confirmed diabetes and were under treatment for type II diabetes. Inclusion criteria were: Having diabetes type II, mean glycosylated hemoglobin more than 7 in the three recent consecutive testing, age group of 40&#x02013;65 years old, at least 1-year duration of diabetes, and filling an informed consent form. Exclusion criteria were: Being on insulin therapy, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, pregnancy, breastfeeding, digestive tract diseases, liver and kidney diseases, impaired liver function tests, and history of surgery on the digestive system.</p><p>Participants were randomly divided into an intervention group (receiving capsules of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic>) and a control group (receiving placebo: Starch powder). Demographic characteristics of patients were collected by a prepared validated questionnaire. <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> (125 mg whole dried fruit powder per capsule), and placebo in the same shape and color were prepared in the Institute of Medicinal Plants in Tehran, Iran. All the patients with diabetes in both groups continued metformin and glibenclamide drugs as usual. Two blood samples were taken at the beginning and end of the 2 months study to compare the mean fasting blood sugar (FBS) and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in each group before and after intervention, as well as, between the two groups of intervention and placebo. Blood samples were taken after an overnight (12 h) fasting. Patients in the treatment group took one capsule of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> (125 mg) once per day just before lunch meal, and controls received placebo at the same time. Patients were advised to measure their fasting blood glucose by glucometer, during the first 3 days of taking treatments, and inform the researcher if their blood glucose level was sharply decreased and then continue testing and recording their FBS weekly to the end of study. Diet regimens and patients lifestyles were continued as before <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of grouping and random allocations of participants in the diabetes clinical trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-8-130-g001"/></table-wrap><p>All the patients were required to report any possible side effects by telephone.

Although the hypoglycemic effect of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> has been reported by experimental studies,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] its relevant mechanism is not still clear. One study indicated experimentally that <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> had a therapeutic effect on isolated pancreatic islets similar to insulin.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Another study showed that <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> inhibited the toxic effects of streptozocin on pancreatic cells in rats.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In type II diabetes, the increasing rate of serum glucose and free fatty acid levels causes oxidative stress and the release of reactive oxygen species.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These metabolic abnormalities lead to chronic complications of diabetes and insulin resistance, &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction, and impaired insulin secretion.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The favorable effects of antioxidants on the oxidative metabolic disorder, caused by hyperglycemia, have been reported by other studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The toxicity of high doses of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> has been reported by experimental studies on both animal and human samples.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Abdel-Hassan <italic>et al</italic>. reported saponine as the main component of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic>, involved with the blood glucose lowering effects of this plant,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] while Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that hypoglycemic properties of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> were due to the presence of phenolic antioxidants and flavonoids components.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Sebbagh and colleagues have reported that even the oil of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> can cause a significant decrease in the blood glucose levels of diabetic rats.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] We used the fleshy part of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> plant without skin and seed to evaluate the effects of this plant on fasting blood glucose in patients with type II diabetes. Several studies on animals and humans have reported different side effects for <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> including: Liver disorders, gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, painful cramp, and bloody diarrhea or even death particularly after its high dose application. However, in the current study, consumption of 125 mg of this plant, once per day, did not show any side effects. Our findings indicate that 2 months consumption of 125 mg capsule of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic>, once per day, is safe for patients with diabetes. This trial was the first study in which the effects of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> with a dosage of less than 125 mg in combined with a powder (including tragacanth, starch, Arabic gum, and fennel all equal to 25 mg) was applied. Based on our findings, the average blood levels of the investigated variables among intervention group, before and after the study, were significantly reduced. Therefore, consumption of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> capsules in the intervention group significantly reduced the mean fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and did not show any side effects at the dosage of 125 mg or less during study period. This result was in accordance with several other studies[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] which reported that the aqueous extract of the outer shell of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> has hypoglycemic effects in animals with diabetes which was associated with its saponins and glycosidic components. Considering the notable hypoglycemic effects of different parts of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic>, its toxic effects, which appear mainly in its high doses, cannot be regarded as an inhibiting factor for application of this useful plant, particularly among patients with diabetes.</p><p>Compared to other studies in Iran, we used a lower dosage of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> in our study, and the same effectiveness without any side effects was obtained. Though, there were no significant side effects during the study period (2 months), the long-term side effects of this medication are unknown and should be investigated via the longitudinal studies in the future. Although, there was a significant reduction in the mean level of FBS in the treatment group, at the end of the study compared to the beginning, there was no statistically significant difference for this marker between placebo and intervention groups at the end of study. It seems that this discrepancy was due to a higher level of mean FBS in the intervention group (170.6 &#x000b1; 46 mg/dl), compared to that in the control group (159 &#x000b1; 53 mg/dl) at the beginning of the study. One of the limitations of this study was the slight heterogeneity of the mean FBS, between intervention and placebo groups, at the start of the study. We performed the ANCOVA to adjust the possible confounding variables and heterogeneity to reduce this limitation.</p><p>Conducting future studies to differentiate the therapeutic and toxic effects of this hypoglycemic plant is recommended. The duration of diabetes and the body mass index of the patients are important factors on the effectiveness of taken drugs. The average duration of diabetes for participants in this study was 7.5 years. Therefore, for the better efficacy of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> plant among patients with diabetes, it is necessary to keep in mind the patients' weights and duration of diabetes, before starting the application of this herbal drug. Further experimental and animal studies are recommended to evaluate the possible effects of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> on insulin production by pancreatic islets cells via increasing the dosage or duration of the therapy taking also into account the toxicity of this plant.</p><p>According to the results of the present study, 2 months application of 125 mg <italic>C. colocynthis</italic>, once per day can significantly decrease the mean serum levels of HbA1c and FBS among patients with type II diabetes. Application of this herbal drug at the defined dosage did not show any side effects and patients with higher fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin and even higher BMI showed greater reduction rate. The toxicity of the high doses of <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> has been reported by experimental and trial studies on both animal and human samples; however, the lower dosage (125 mg once per day) applied in this study showed similar efficacy without any side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This work was supported by Faculty of Medicine, Ilam
