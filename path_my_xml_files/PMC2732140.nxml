The second part of the study reported here (supplementary consort information, available in an online appendix <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-0533/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-0533/DC1</ext-link>) was a 39-week follow-up study commencing at the time of withdrawal of study drug to test the durability of the intervention on &#x003b2;-cell function, inflammatory markers, insulin requirement, and insulin sensitivity. In the follow-up study, glucose-lowering therapy was intensified if indicated, and insulin treatment was initiated if A1C was &#x0003e;8.0% or fasting plasma glucose exceeded 8 mmol/l. Other medications were added or increased in dose at the discretion of the investigator.

In the present protocolled follow-up study, we show that the reduced PI/I ratio and CRP and IL-6 serum levels were maintained 39 weeks after anakinra withdrawal, indicating that at least 39 weeks of remission of these parameters were caused by 13 weeks of anakinra treatment.</p><p>Furthermore, a subgroup analysis showed that the 21 (62%) patients who experienced any reduction in A1C after 13 weeks of IL-1Ra treatment with anakinra (responders) maintained their anakinra-induced improved &#x003b2;-cell function assessed by both the PI/I ratio and stimulatory testing 39 weeks after anakinra withdrawal, whereas the &#x003b2;-cell function of the patients treated with placebo and those unresponsive to anakinra treatment further deteriorated after cessation of placebo and anakinra therapy, respectively. The superior &#x003b2;-cell function of the anakinra-responsive patients was reflected by a lower insulin requirement to obtain target glycemia in this group.</p><p>The preserved &#x003b2;-cell function 39 weeks after anakinra withdrawal indicates that modulation of &#x003b2;-cell function or increased &#x003b2;-cell mass occurred during IL-1Ra therapy. Apart from one study using short-term intensive insulin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), in which the 45&#x02013;51% who responded had maintained an acute insulin response to intravenous glucose testing, no other therapy has been shown to maintain &#x003b2;-cell function in type 2 diabetes after treatment withdrawal.</p><p>Both leptin and hyperglycemia induce IL-1 production in the pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Reduction of hyperglycemia improves &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, the improvement in &#x003b2;-cell function observed in this study does not seem to be a consequence of improved glycemia per se, because declining &#x003b2;-cell function was observed in patients not responsive to anakinra and placebo group patients, irrespective of the improved glycemic control obtained during the follow-up phase. This finding suggests that the inhibition of IL-1 signaling was the mechanism behind the improved &#x003b2;-cell function.</p><p>Elevated IL-1Ra serum levels are found in nondiabetic individuals prone to develop type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), whereas patients with overt type 2 diabetes have reduced &#x003b2;-cell expression and serum levels of IL-1Ra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), indicating that a downregulation of IL-1Ra expression is a consequence of the diabetic state. In this study, low baseline IL-1Ra serum levels predicted the glycemic and &#x003b2;-cell secretory responses to anakinra treatment. The increased frequency of the C allele of SNP rs4251961, associated with lower IL-1Ra and higher IL-1 serum levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) in the responders to anakinra treatment, indicates that the observed 62% response rate to anakinra treatment may be genetically determined. In accordance with this notion, we have previously shown that &#x003b2;-cells from 6 of 10 patients with type 2 diabetes expressed IL-1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The observed frequencies of the T and C alleles of SNP rs4251961 in this study did not differ from the frequencies in populations without type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), indicating that the C allele is not predisposing to diabetes development per se but is a pharmacogenetic biomarker for a glycemic response to anakinra treatment.</p><p>The lack of association between changes in CRP and IL-6, surrogate markers of systemic IL-1 activity, and the PI/I ratio or any reduction in A1C after anakinra therapy indicates that systemic inflammation is not likely to affect &#x003b2;-cell function and that the improved &#x003b2;-cell function caused by anakinra treatment is due to inhibition of IL-1 produced in the vicinity of the &#x003b2;-cell. IL-1 production could thus originate from the &#x003b2;-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) or from macrophages infiltrating the islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) as the <italic>IL1B</italic> gene is overexpressed in blood monocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>The sustained reduction of CRP and IL-6 levels at 39 weeks after anakinra withdrawal is notable and indicates that transient IL-1 blockade is capable of inducing not only a metabolic but also a 39-week-long inflammatory remission. In this study, the inflammatory remission was not related to insulin sensitivity. This finding is in line with recent findings from the Whitehall II study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>There are some limitations to this follow-up study. First, multiple hypotheses were tested; second, a subgroup analysis was performed.</p><p>In summary, this study suggests that 13 weeks of anakinra treatment is capable of inducing a 39-week-long preservation of &#x003b2;-cell function and a similar inflammatory remission in patients with type 2 diabetes. Low baseline serum IL-1Ra levels predicted the metabolic response, and this phenotypic trait was associated with the C allele of an <italic>IL1RN</italic> SNP. Future studies will have to be conducted to confirm these results and to test higher doses and longer treatment and follow-up periods in patients with type 2 diabetes selected on the basis of their <italic>IL1RN</italic> SNP genotype. If the results are confirmed, the perspective of these findings is that anakinra treatment could be used as substitution therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with genetically determined IL-1Ra deficiency and as induction therapy during flares of hyperglycemia in the course of the disease.</p></sec>
