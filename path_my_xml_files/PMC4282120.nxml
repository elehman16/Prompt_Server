However, the improvements in smoking cessation rates that are achieved by current products are modest. In the United Kingdom, the proportion of smokers who successfully quit for 52 weeks without any behavioral support using NRT products in primary and secondary care is estimated as just 7%&#x02013;10%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">Smokers may fail to quit because the currently available NRTs do not deliver nicotine in the same way as cigarettes,<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> with slower onset of systemic nicotine delivery. Furthermore, most of the existing NRTs do not replace the unique sensory cues or rituals of smoking.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> More effective and acceptable forms of NRT are needed to help smokers quit and to provide a satisfactory alternative to smoking for those unable to stop.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In the United Kingdom, recently published recommendations advocate the use of licensed nicotine-containing products to help people cut down before stopping smoking, to reduce their smoking frequency, or to abstain from smoking using a harm-reduction approach.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">A new inhaler has been developed that delivers a nicotine aerosol and replicates many of the rituals associated with smoking. The device is the size and shape of a conventional cigarette and comprises a small, breath-operated valve that allows a user to self-titrate the inhalation. The rate at which nicotine is delivered from one charge of the inhaler device is therefore dependent on the number of &#x0201c;puffs&#x0201d; over which one charge (or &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d;) is inhaled and this, in turn, depends on an individual&#x02019;s depth of inhalation. For most users, the device provides a comparable number of puffs to that of a conventional tobacco cigarette. The device can be refilled approximately 20 times via a pressurized canister of pharmaceutical grade (free-base) nicotine formulated with propylene glycol, ethanol, saccharin, menthol, and HFA134a (chlorofluorocarbon free) propellant. The canister forms an integral part of the storage container, which is similar in size to a pack of 20 cigarettes. The novel nicotine inhaler is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ntr/ntu122/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>. The novel nicotine delivery device contains no tobacco and requires neither combustion nor heat in its operation. This contrasts to electronic cigarettes where heat is required to vaporize the nicotine. Furthermore, electronic cigarette brands and models differ in their efficacy and consistency of nicotine vaporization<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and few have undergone pharmacokinetic and safety analyses or formal assessment of their effectiveness on craving.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The amount of nicotine inhaled from 15 puffs of an electronic cigarette that vaporizes nicotine effectively is far lower than from smoking a conventional cigarette.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">It is important that any new NRT relieves symptoms of tobacco withdrawal and the craving or desire to smoke. The relief of such symptoms is thought to mediate the clinical effect of abstinence, and their measurement can be used to assess the effectiveness of a nicotine replacement agent and to predict quit success.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">We performed a four-part study to evaluate nicotine delivery from this novel device. The two parts reported here were similarly designed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of nicotine delivery from this novel device and the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg), and their effectiveness on craving satiation and smoking urges. The results of the remaining two study parts are to be discussed separately (CM, AH, AR, in progress).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This Phase I study comprised four parts: A, B, C, and D:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>

(Human Research Ethics Committee Number 2011003) in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study was conducted at a single center in Perth, Australia, between January 9, 2012, and July 6, 2012, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to study start.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy volunteers (male or female) aged 18&#x02013;55 years were eligible to participate if they had smoked at least 10 manufactured cigarettes per day for the last year and smoked their first cigarette within 1hr of waking. Women of childbearing potential were eligible only if they tested negative for pregnancy prior to study start and were using an accepted method of contraception. All participants had an expired carbon monoxide level of at least 10 ppm at screening and were required to abstain from smoking for 12hr prior to their scheduled dosing time.</p><p content-type="indent">Participants were excluded if they had a known or suspected history of hypersensitivity to nicotine or any other component of the inhaler or Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator.

Pregnant or breast-feeding women were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Study Treatment</title><p>Participants were familiarized with the use of the novel device using a placebo formulation on the day prior to receiving active treatment. The placebo formulation was identical to the active formulation with the exception of nicotine. Study participants were blinded to the dose of nicotine administered in each part of the study. Participants inhaled the contents of one charge of the novel device in a similar way to a cigarette. All participants were instructed to inhale the dose at the same rate of one inhalation every 15 s over approximately 2min (i.e., eight inhalations in total). The fine particle dose (&#x0003c;5 &#x000b5;m) has a specification of 160&#x02013;305 &#x000b5;g for a formulation concentration of 0.056% wt/wt nicotine (i.e., 35%&#x02013;68% of the nicotine dose). The nicotine dose contained in 0.8g of formulation (a single dose/refill of the novel device) is estimated to be 0.45 and 0.67mg for the 0.056% wt/wt and 0.084% wt/wt concentrations, respectively. The Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg) is an orally inhaled NRT product and was selected as the comparator because it was the closest available presentation to the novel inhaler device. Participants took one inhalation of the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg) every 15 s, taking no longer than 20min (i.e., 80 inhalations) to complete the dose, in line with the regimen described in the prescribing information.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The available nicotine dose per cartridge of Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg) is estimated to be 4mg but is temperature dependent.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The time at which participants started to take the first inhalation of the test product was recorded as the dose time (<italic>t</italic> = 0).</p><p content-type="indent">In Part B, each participant received a single dose of nicotine on three consecutive days, at dose levels of 0.45 and 0.67mg via the novel nicotine inhaler device, and a single dose via the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg).</p><p content-type="indent">In Part D, each participant received a single dose of nicotine via the novel nicotine inhaler device (0.45mg) and a single dose of nicotine via the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg) on two consecutive days. For the novel device, Part B tested the first refill, whereas Part D examined the fourth refill. During the early stages of the study, it was noted that the quantity of nicotine delivered via the novel inhaler device for the first dose (i.e., one complete refill) tended to be only approximately 70% that of subsequent doses. In Part D of the study, the fourth refill of the novel device was investigated by filling and flushing the device three times, using a pump (Cole-Parmer), a Critical Flow Controller (Model TPK), and the Dose Uniformity Sampling Apparatus. Administration of the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg) was identical in both study parts.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Study Assessments</title><sec id="s7"><title>PK Analysis</title><p>PK assessment was the primary outcome measure for this study.

The method was validated for linearity, precision, and accuracy. Quality control samples at concentrations of 3.0, 7.5, and 37.5ng/ml, as well as 37.5ng/ml used as dilute quality control for samples of low volume (diluted 1 in 2), were used to determine inter- and intraprecision and inter- and intra-accuracy. The mean inter-run accuracy was within 1% and precision was within 5%.

The most common AEs were oral paresthesia, throat irritation, headache, and oral hypoesthesia, which showed no clear dose&#x02013;effect relationship. Oropharyngeal sensations, including &#x0201c;throat scratch,&#x0201d; may be viewed as enhancing the respiratory cues associated with smoking by some individuals, rather than regarded as unpleasant.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">Comparison of venous plasma nicotine concentrations shows that the time course of nicotine delivery from a single cigarette is markedly different to that from currently available NRT products,<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> which deliver nicotine more slowly. A standard cigarette delivers 1&#x02013;2mg nicotine, which is rapidly absorbed into the pulmonary circulation. This leads to a rapid rise in arterial nicotine concentration and nicotine reaches the brain within seconds. Currently available forms of NRT may fail to help many smokers quit, as their nicotine PK profiles differ to smoking a cigarette.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In this study, craving reduction was at least as great following nicotine administration with the novel device as the reduction following administration with the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg), despite a lower overall nicotine exposure. The marked reduction in craving may well result from the close replication of behavioral aspects of smoking, combined with a rapid delivery of nicotine and respiratory tract sensory cues. Although the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg) is also an inhaler device and mimics the hand-to-mouth action of smoking with upper airway sensory stimulation, nicotine is released in the vapor phase, leading to pronounced buccal deposition of nicotine. Nicotine absorption from the buccal mucosa has been shown to be slower than from pulmonary deposition.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In this study, the venous peak in nicotine concentration occurred more rapidly with the novel device than with the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg). Although the time to peak venous nicotine concentration with the novel device 0.45mg was longer than that reported for smoking (11.7 [Part B] and 21.0 [Part D] vs. 11.9min),<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> the overall results of this study, nevertheless, suggest that the novel nicotine inhaler device could potentially be a more satisfying and acceptable alternative to cigarettes than the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg). More appealing nicotine-containing products are regarded as being important for reducing the prevalence of smoking in the future, reducing the harm caused by tobacco-based nicotine addiction and addressing the associated health implications.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">This investigation has some limitations that should be acknowledged. A dose anomaly may have affected the PK results in Part B of the study. Following a review of laboratory testing of the novel device during the early phase of the study, it transpired that the quantity of nicotine delivered via the novel device for the first dose (i.e., for one complete refill) tended to be significantly lower (at 70%) than the nicotine delivered in subsequent doses. This anomaly may have affected data from Part B as PK testing was performed following the first refill of the novel device. This first-dose anomaly was avoided in Part D by testing the fourth refill. Results between the two parts were similar despite this discrepancy.</p><p content-type="indent">In Parts B and D of this study, PK analysis was carried out using venous blood samples and some of the conclusions drawn are based on an extrapolation of the results to the arterial PK profile.</p><p content-type="indent">Although this small, short-duration study was not designed to fully evaluate safety, AEs were collected systematically and the trial was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice. Both products were well tolerated with similar AE rates and profiles, all consistent with expectations for oral/inhaled NRT.</p><p content-type="indent">In conclusion, nicotine inhalation with the novel nicotine inhaler device provided greater craving relief than with the Nicorette&#x000ae; Inhalator (10mg), despite lower total nicotine exposure. Assessment of craving and smoking urges showed that craving reduction by the novel device was at least as great as the active comparator and statistically superior at the majority of timepoints, which was also shown in an overall craving AUC analysis. This is possibly owing to the novel device achieving a combination of nicotine PK and sensorial profiles that closely resemble those of a cigarette. This novel nicotine inhaler device has the potential to confer additional benefits in smoking cessation.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
