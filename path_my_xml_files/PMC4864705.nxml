In maxillofacial surgeries various preincisional local anesthetic (LA) infiltration in surgical wound and/or nerve blocks have been used for producing preemptive analgesia.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>During maxillofacial surgeries, perilesional LA infiltration when combined with general anesthesia (GA) provides good operative condition but has relatively shorter duration of postoperative analgesia.

The secondary goal was to compare it with placebo in the regard of visibility of surgical field, satisfaction of the surgeons, recovery profile, adverse effects, and perioperative hemodynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining permission from Institutional Ethics Committee, written informed consent was taken. Total 76 adult patients were randomly allocated to two equal groups (<italic>n</italic> = 38 in each group) using computer generated random number list. Between 2010 June and 2013 January, patients having American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, aged 20&#x02013;40 years of both sexes undergoing unilateral reconstructive maxillofacial surgery under GA were enrolled in the study.</p><p>Patients in group DL received 15 cc of 2% lignocaine + adrenaline (1:200,000) solution (xylocaine 2% adrenaline [1:200,000], AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India) mixed with 1 &#x000b5;g/kg. Dexmedetomidine, as perilesional infiltration 5 min prior to skin incision but after administration of GA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>: Schematically]. Similarly patients in group PL received 15 cc of 2% lignocaine + adrenaline (1:200,000) solution mixed with normal saline (placebo), as perilesional infiltration 5 min prior to skin incision but after administration of GA. The drug mixture was infiltrated by same resident maxillofacial surgeon after confirming the lesion clinically and from orthopantomogram in both the groups in all the cases for blinding purpose. The study participants, operation nurse, and the chief maxillofacial surgeon constituted the &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d; study group. The anesthesiologist performing the GA was unaware of the infiltration drug and allotment of the group and similarly resident doctors keeping records of different parameters were also unaware of group allotment.

General examination, systemic examinations, and assessment of the airway (particularly mouth opening) were done. Preoperative fasting for minimum 6 h was ensured before operation in all day care cases. All patients received premedication of tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg orally the night before surgery as per preanesthetic check-up direction to allay anxiety, and for sound sleep. The patients also received tablet ranitidine 150 mg in the previous night and in the morning of operation with sips of water. All patients were investigated for total hemogram blood sugar, urea, creatinine, and liver function tests. A 12 lead electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were also taken. Perioperatively standard monitors were attached for monitoring vital parameters.</p><p>Philips IntelliVue (MP20) monitor used for this purpose. Intravenous (IV) infusion of Ringers' lactate started and xylometazoline nasal drop was given in each nasal aperture to reduce bleeding during nasal intubation just 2 h before operation. After transfer, patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for a period of 5 min. Injection fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg) were given intravenously 3 min before induction of anesthesia. All the patients were induced with injection propofol (2 mg/kg). After that, atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) was given to facilitate laryngoscopy and intubation. Nasal intubation was done to ensure proper dental occlusion after open reduction and mini plate fixation in each case. Laryngoscopy, intubation, and cuff inflation were completed within 45 s in all cases. ET tube was fixed at a point where bilateral air entry is ensured. Muscle relaxation was maintained with intermittent IV atracurium (0.2 mg/kg) as and when required. Controlled ventilation was maintained manually with 33% oxygen in 66% nitrous oxide and isoflurane 1.5 MAC using Boyle's apparatus to maintain end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> pressure between 32 and 40 mm Hg.

When heart rate was &#x02264;50, 0.6 mg IV atropine was applied to combat bradycardia.

We also found that dexmedetomidine infiltrated group provided significantly better satisfaction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) for the surgeons than placebo. This is probably due to lesser bleeding and clearer surgical field.</p><p>In our study; vomiting, ondansetron used for controlling vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, urinary retention, and bradycardia all were comparable among two groups. But the nausea was more in the placebo group in a significant manner than dexmedetomidine group and this is probably due to higher opioid consumption in the placebo group. Similar results were observed by Guven <italic>et al</italic>. while doing a study between dexmedetomidine versus magnesium sulfate for producing controlled hypotension for the patients undergoing FESS.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Again in our study, dexmedetomidine infiltrated group maintains stable hemodynamics throughout the operative and postoperative period whereas the placebo group frequently suffers from tachycardia and hypertension which were controlled with fentanyl, propofol, nitroglycerine infusion for smooth maintenance of operation. These findings were quite similar to that of Bekker <italic>et al</italic>. who conducted 56 intracranial surgeries and found that addition of dexmedetomine to sevoflurane opioid anesthesia rendered a much stable hemodynamics than placebo group and dexmedetomidine did not increase the incidence of hypotension or bradycardia, common side effects of the drug.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>One of the limitations of the current study is the absence of a complete placebo-controlled group. Secondly, we did not use scores for postoperative pain assessment other than visual analogue scale. We had not measured sedation and plasma catecholamine or stress hormone concentrations which may reveal relations between sympatholytic properties of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists and earlier discharge after their use. Another limitation is that we used dexmedetomidine based on their known optimal dose without the knowledge of its true optimal doses. However, a larger study with large sample size needs to be conducted to establish the author's point of view with solidarity.</p><p>We do conclude that during reconstructive maxillofacial surgery, preincisional perilesional infiltration of dexmedetomidine (1 &#x000b5;g/kg) when co-administered with lignocaine-adrenaline (1:200,000) mixture is more effective in producing perioperative analgesia and amnesia measured by reduced consumption of fentanyl, propofol, and subsequently earlier discharge from PACU. This &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist had also reduced surgical site bleeding and rendering an excellent surgical field with higher surgeon's satisfaction score with better hemodynamic control and lesser side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of
