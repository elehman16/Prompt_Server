The reporting of the economic evaluation completes our reporting of all trial outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview of approach</title><p>In keeping with best practices and the study protocol, a prospective economic evaluation of eDCT (treatment) compared with usual care (control) was conducted as part of the RCT. The RCT was a two-arm trial comparing eDCTs to usual care, defined as traditional discharge communication generated by dictation, for patients being discharged from a Canadian tertiary care centre&#x02019;s internal medicine medical teaching units (MTUs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These units provide care to non-surgical adult inpatients. Details of the full RCT methodology and results have been reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 4</xref> Between January 2012 and December 2013, 1953 patients were approached and screened for inclusion, and 1399 were randomised to discharge mechanism.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Among these, 45 patients did not have data on cost for the index hospitalisation cost, so they were excluded from cost analyses. As a result, a total of 1354 patients contributed to the economic evaluation.</p><p>The RCT was powered to detect a 25% relative reduction in a composite of all-cause mortality or all-cause readmission within 90 days.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The primary economic outcome was the cost per QALY with secondary outcomes of the cost per readmission gained and the cost per life saved. This is a deviation from the original study protocol; the cost per QALY is a more appropriate primary outcome to support allocative efficiency decisions. A healthcare public payer perspective was adopted over a 90-day time horizon. A 90-day time horizon was felt to be appropriate as it reflects a timeline where events could relate to discharge communication and is long enough to permit an event to occur.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This is also a commonly reported time frame in readmission studies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> All costs were inflated to 2016 Canadian dollars using the Canadian consumer price index.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cost of usual care</title><p>Costs for traditional discharge generated by dictation was provided by estimates from the University of Calgary Medical Group Transcription Services.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The base case costs assumed in-hospital dictation transcriptions are outsourced to an external provider (a common practice in many large healthcare systems). When outsourced, the total cost is calculated using the average cost per minute of dictation excluding technology fees. Ten physicians were asked to estimate the average length of a dictation. The average time was then used to calculate the total cost. The costs of a printer, printer toner and paper were excluded, as they would be negligible. Dissemination costs, including fax machines, were also excluded as these resources are commonly used in the physician offices for a variety of purposes and not exclusively for dictation discharges. All assumptions were explored in sensitivity analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Costs of eDCT</title><p>To estimate the per person costs of eDCT, the disaggregated costs from the development, implementation and pilot testing of the previously described eDCT were considered. Reliability of the project estimate was confirmed by reviewing invoices and receipts. The total estimated cost was amortised over 3&#x02009;years, which is reflective of the technology life-cycle.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Monthly payments were calculated using an assumed 1% annual interest rate.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The monthly payment amount was divided by the average number of discharges from the ward per day (~9&#x02009;discharges/day) multiplied by 30 days.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This daily average included all patients on the ward and not only study participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Death, readmission and health-related quality of life</title><p>Death and readmissions were modelled separately as these outcomes are valued differently and incur different resource utilisation. Death within 90&#x02009;days postdischarge was captured through linkage to data from the Alberta Bureau of Vital Statistics.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Readmissions within 90&#x02009;days postdischarge were captured through data linkage to the AHS Data Integration, Measurement&#x000a0;and Reporting unit.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For both death and readmission, all-cause events were included, and&#x000a0;avoidable and unavoidable events were not separated.</p><p>Health-related quality of life was measured at baseline, 30&#x02009;days postdischarge, and 90&#x02009;days postdischarge using the Health&#x000a0;Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI-3). Utility scores were calculated from the HUI-3 data using the HUI-3 Multiattribute Utility Function on the Dead-Healthy scale.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> To calculate QALYs at 90&#x02009;days, the difference in utility score from baseline to 90&#x02009;days was multiplied by 0.25 (reflective of the time horizon over 1&#x02009;year of life).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Healthcare resource utilisation and cost</title><p>Index hospitalisation costs were estimated using microcosting data, which provide a detailed cost per patient including all resources consumed within the hospital stay such as nursing time, physician fees, drug costs and overhead costs. To estimate physician visits, physician claims and billing codes were used. Both the cost and number of readmissions were calculated. Patients who were readmitted to the same centre within 12&#x02009;hours of discharge or another centre within 24&#x02009;hours of discharge were assumed to be hospital transfers, not readmissions. Costs of the readmission hospitalisation were determined using gross costing methodology applied in the administrative data (Canadian Institute for Health Information Case Mix Grouper Plus). Ambulatory care utilisation and costs were determined by linking trial patients to the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. Gross costing methodology was also applied (Canadian Institute for Health Information Comprehensive Ambulatory Classification System).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Drug costs were estimated using data from the Pharmaceutical Information Network.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Calculating the ICER</title><p>Due to the differing numbers of patients included in each treatment arm (n=679&#x02009;and n=675), an average cost per patient was calculated. The average cost per patient includes the discharge mechanism (eDCT or usual care), the index hospitalisation, the readmissions, the emergency department (ED) visits, the ambulatory care visits, the drugs and the physician claims. The difference in the average cost per patient was then divided by the difference in the average clinical effect in each arm resulting in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Sensitivity and scenario analyses</title><p>To examine the impact of uncertainty on the ICER, sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted. Sensitivity analysis varied the costs of the eDCT&#x000a0;&#x000b1;25%. For the usual care arm, speech recognition systems or computer-aided medical transcription, that format draft documents to allow medical transcriptionists to edit and review rather than transcribe entire dictations may be used. Thus, a scenario analysis considering the costs of traditional discharge using internal (as opposed to outsourced) transcription with both a non-speech recognition system and a speech recognition system was completed. These analyses included the monthly technology fee, monthly outsourcing costs and monthly salary and benefits of transcriptionists (including overtime).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Uncertainty bootstrapping analysis</title><p>To examine the overall uncertainty, a bootstrapping analysis was completed. Moreover, to examine the variability in the total cost per patient and QALYs gained in each of the treatment arms, random samples of 50 patients for each of the trial arms were replicated 1000 times. The total cost per patient (including the cost of eDCT or usual care and all healthcare resource utilisation) as well as the average QALYs gained (between baseline and 90&#x02009;days) were calculated for each sample. The cost and QALY difference between the two trial arms for each sample are plotted in a scatterplot to present the variability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Costs of usual care</title><p>In the base case, outsourcing transcription costs to an external provider, the average cost per patient was determined to be $C22.28. Average dictation time from 10 physicians was 10.87&#x02009;min (range: 4&#x02013;22&#x02009;min), and the average cost per minute of transcription was $C2.05.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Cost of eDCT</title><p>From the project estimate, the estimated incremental cost of eDCT (on the backdrop of a functioning hospital information system platform) was $C127&#x02009;575. This estimate broadly captured costs of tool development, tool implementation, training and assistance, maintenance and taxation. After a&#x000a0;3-year amortisation at a 1% annual interest rate, the monthly payment amount for the tool was $C3598.

The cost per QALY gained with eDCT compared with usual care was $C239&#x000a0;933, the cost per death avoided was $C44&#x02009;051 and the cost per readmission gained was $C17&#x02009;490. The large ICERs are due to the approximately $C800 difference between arms with minimal effect on clinical outcomes. Moreover, when uncertainty is assessed, this evaluation resulted in relative equivalence for both the costs and the outcomes with approximately equal simulations resulting in higher costs and effects as lower costs and effects.</p><p>Given the neutral clinical effectiveness results, a cost-minimisation analysis may be considered. Within this framework, only the differences in costs are considered, as the outcomes are considered equivalent, with the least expensive option identified as the most attractive choice (achievement of the same clinical outcome for lower cost).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Our findings in the context of cost minimisation are that eDCT is about $C9 less expensive per patient than usual care. Based on this result, the use of an eDCT may be cost saving. Importantly, the cost of the eDCT used in this analysis only considered the costs of the pilot project estimate. It is expected that costs of large-scale implementation may differ from the costs reported in this analysis. Other costs to consider include: the acquisition of the eDCT by the healthcare system, the introduction of the eDCT into existing infrastructure (including current electronic medical records), ensuring appropriate infrastructure and systems for community care physicians and ongoing software and network maintenance. However, establishing an eDCT is a relatively fixed cost; as the number of patients discharged through the eDCT increases, the per patient cost decreases. In contrast, traditional discharge is a variable cost whereby the total cost increases with each patient. Due to this, it is quite likely that the per patient cost associated with the eDCT would decrease further in the context of a large-scale adoption.</p><p>Another consideration for the adoption of eDCTs is the maturity of the existing electronic management platforms within a healthcare system. For instance, in systems that have highly developed eHealth platforms, the adoption of an eDCT may be more economically attractive. The development of an additional page/tool and its incorporation into a well-managed and comprehensive system would be expected to be low cost, highly feasible and easily integrated into care delivery. Under these conditions, costs of electronic discharge may be expected to be lower than usual care. In contrast, systems with non-existent or minimally developed eHealth platforms will require major investment to implement an eDCT. For these systems, remaining with usual care or saving for the next technological advancement may be reasonable. In this scenario, eDCT is expected to be more expensive than usual care and without significant clinical benefit. It is also in this situation where adoption of an eDCT would require major trade-offs with other health technologies that may improve clinical outcomes.</p><p>In this trial, eDCT did not demonstrate an improvement in clinical outcomes. This is an important finding when considering the opportunity cost associated with an adoption decision. Specifically, under a limited budget, the adoption of these tools may require trading off with other life-saving or clinically beneficial tools. However, the outcomes assessed (death and readmissions) may be perceived as too narrow a lens to assess effectiveness when making adoption decisions. For example, many systems have adopted the quadruple aim to ground their perspective on healthcare system goals and performance.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This model for optimising health system performance suggests considering clinical benefit, cost-effectiveness, patient experience and healthcare provider satisfaction. These four points could also be considered when facing adoption and implementation considerations. Specifically, patients in the eDCT arm were easily provided with a printout of their discharge summary as they were leaving the hospital. Through this mechanism, patients are also able to share information with other care team members and take a more active role in their healthcare; two important components of high-quality healthcare.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, in a cohort study of acute and community care physicians completed alongside this RCT, acute care physicians preferred eDCT over traditional dictation and discharge methods.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Acknowledging this user preference may further increase provider satisfaction. Thus, when a framework such as the quadruple aim is adopted, eDCT may be viewed as an important step towards healthcare system improvement in 3 of the 4 domains (cost, patient satisfaction and provide satisfaction).</p><p>Our study had limitations. First, the costs of electronic discharge and traditional dictation are expected to vary across organisations and healthcare systems. Moreover, estimates for the cost of discharge mechanism are context specific and will depend on the number of patients discharged, the existing infrastructure and the eDCT itself. Organisations facing adoption decisions should consider their own costing and resources to inform policy decisions. Second, a small number of patients (n=45) were lost to follow-up resulting in missing data; however, these patients were removed from the analysis and were similar to the patients who were not lost to follow-up. Third, the RCT permitted physician cross-over between trial arms. More specifically, due to the unit of randomisation being the patient, a physician may have used the eDCT to discharge one patient and then immediately switched to usual care to discharge the following patient. This concurrent exposure to the eDCT, which helped ensure balanced patient groups in the RCT, may have also improved the quality of the discharge summary in the usual care arm. Thus, the true benefit of eDCT may have been underestimated, which would in turn produce an overestimate of the cost per QALY. Finally, this study was restricted to the outcomes captured by the RCT. Specifically, differences in avoidable and unavoidable deaths were not divided in the RCT and are therefore not reflected in this analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This prospective economic evaluation of a novel eDCT found that there were no differences in the costs and clinical benefits compared with usual care. However, there were immediate cost savings in transcription costs when eDCT is adopted that, when considered alongside positive patient and provider experiences with the eDCT, increase the impetus for healthcare organisations to invest in such systems. However, when considering the adoption of eDCTs, healthcare systems should critically assess their current eHealth infrastructure and the required investment to adopt eDCTs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e216" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-019139.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e217" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-019139.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the other investigators who contributed to the design of the RCT: Jayna Holroyd-Leduc, Danielle Southern, Ward Flemons, Maeve O&#x02019;Beirne, Michael Hill, Alan Forster and Deborah E White.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LKS, M-JS, WAG and FC contributed to the conceptualisation of the study.
