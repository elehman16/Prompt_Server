The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint consisting of all postoperative infectious complications occurring during the first 30&#x000a0;days after surgery. Secondary endpoints include all the individual components of the primary endpoint, all other complications, duration of hospital stay, and total costs. The hypothesis is that the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis is noninferior to the presence of antibiotic prophylaxis. A noninferiority margin of 10% is assumed.

Although this is considered to be a low-risk procedure, the complication rate is not negligible. The most common complication is a postoperative infection, either at the surgical site or a distant site, occurring in approximately 17% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As such, many patients receive antibiotic prophylaxis before cholecystectomy, often to be continued for several postoperative days, in order to reduce postoperative infectious complications.</p><p id="Par16">The Working Party on Antibiotic Policy in the Netherlands (Stichting Werkgroep Antibioticabeleid) issued guidelines for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in Dutch hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to these guidelines, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for surgical procedures with a moderate or high risk of postoperative infections, including biliary surgery. Prophylaxis given within 2&#x000a0;h before incision appears to be most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recommended is single-dose prophylaxis, not only because it has proven to be as effective as multiple-dose prophylaxis but also for reasons of cost-effectiveness and prevention of bacterial resistance. The Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, as well as the Tokyo Guidelines, also recommend antimicrobial prophylaxis for patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These recommendations, however, are based on low-quality evidence, and therefore the actual effect of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis remains unclear. Consequently, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in the treatment of acute cholecystitis is highly variable among surgeons and hospitals.</p><p id="Par17">In patients undergoing <italic>elective</italic> cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis, high-level evidence is available demonstrating that prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the incidence of postoperative infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For this indication, the use of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is discouraged. According to a recent randomized controlled trial, also in <italic>emergency</italic> cholecystectomy the continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery is disputable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This study demonstrated that postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (in addition to a single prophylactic dose prior to surgery) in patients with mild and moderate acute cholecystitis did not reduce the risk of infectious complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis after cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis may therefore be omitted. The remaining question is whether a single preoperative dose of antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial in patients undergoing emergency cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. This has never been studied.</p><p id="Par18">If the present study demonstrates that omitting antibiotic prophylaxis does not increase the postoperative infection rate, the use of antibiotics for this indication can be dropped as a whole. If so, the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery of the entire upper gastrointestinal tract will become questionable. A decrease of antibiotic use on such a scale may result in a large reduction of needless medical activities, costs, and bacterial resistance. The latter is a growing issue in contemporary medicine and has emerged as one of the eminent public health concerns nowadays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The Perioperative Antibiotic Use in the Treatment of Acute Inflammation of the Gallbladder (PEANUTS II) trial is designed to assess whether preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated to prevent postoperative infectious complications in patients undergoing emergency cholecystectomy for acute calculous cholecystitis.

This figure is based on recommendations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which recommends 10% for anti-infective trials. With a 1-sided risk of 2.5% and a power of 80%, a total of 454 subjects will have to be included in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p id="Par33">Dichotomous data and counts will be presented as frequencies. Continuous data will be presented as means with standard deviations or, in cases of skewed distribution, as medians with interquartile ranges.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Analyses</title><p id="Par34">After the last patient has completed follow-up, raw data will be presented to an adjudication committee to determine whether the endpoints meet the protocol-specified criteria. Each member of the adjudication committee is blinded to the treatment allocation and will assess the potential endpoints individually. Disagreement will be resolved in a plenary consensus meeting. After consensus is reached on each individual endpoint for each patient, final analysis will be performed by an unblinded independent statistician. This analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, which means that all randomized patients will be included in their initially assigned study arm, regardless of adherence to the protocol.</p><p id="Par35">For nominal data, the chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be used; for continuous data, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test will be used. Noninferiority will be demonstrated if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the difference of the proportion of the primary endpoint between the two groups is lower than the noninferiority margin. The effect will be measured by the absolute risk difference, and the precision will be quantified by means of the 95% CI. The formal statistical hypothesis regarding noninferiority will be tested by the Westlake-Schuirmann test, with the noninferiority margin set at 10% and a one-tailed <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.025 considered statistically significant. For all other tests, a two-tailed <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.050 is considered statistically significant. In general, for the primary endpoint, we do not expect data to be missing; if so, missing data will not be imputed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Premature termination of the study</title><p id="Par36">The DSMB will perform a formal interim analysis for superiority with respect to the primary endpoint when 50% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;227) of the total number of patients have been randomized and have completed the 1-month follow-up. The Peto approach will be followed, which includes that the study will be stopped only for benefit or harm in case of a <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Because this is the first randomized trial on this subject and because future treatment policy will be based on it, this trial will not be stopped for futility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Feasibility</title><p id="Par37">Recruitment commenced in March 2016 and is anticipated to run until March 2019. Currently, patients are being recruited at seven major teaching hospitals in The Netherlands. Every 6&#x000a0;months, the inclusion rate will be assessed. If accrual is too slow, additional centers will be invited to participate.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par38">Whether antibiotic prophylaxis has any additional value in preventing infectious complications after emergency cholecystectomy is a much-debated subject in the surgical community. Evidence-based guidelines are lacking, and, as a result, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis varies greatly among surgeons and hospitals. Recently, high-level evidence became available demonstrating that <italic>postoperative</italic> antibiotic prophylaxis (in addition to a single preoperative dose) does not reduce the risk of infectious complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. <italic>Preoperative</italic> antibiotic prophylaxis in relation to the risk of infectious complications, however, has never been studied. We therefore designed the PEANUTS II trial with the aim of determining the utility of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing emergency cholecystectomy for acute calculous cholecystitis.</p><p id="Par39">The PEANUTS II trial has a noninferiority design. The hypothesis is that the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis will not lead to an increase of postoperative infectious complications. In the nontreatment group, either an increase of the infectious complication rate or no effect will be seen. Because it is very improbable that the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis will lead to a decrease of infectious complications, and thus deviation is possible in only one direction, a noninferiority design is best suited to answering this primary question.</p><p id="Par40">The best design for a therapeutic trial is a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, but because treatment of acute cholecystitis is often performed in an acute setting outside regular working hours, such a design is difficult to organize. Therefore, an open comparative design was chosen. We believe that blinding and placebo are not of absolute importance, because the primary outcome of the study is an objective criterion with a clearly defined (internationally accepted) definition. In addition, all potential endpoints will be assessed individually by the members of the adjudication committee, who are blinded to the treatment allocation. Only after reaching consensus on each individual endpoint for each patient will final analysis be performed by an unblinded independent statistician.</p><p id="Par41">Patients with grade III (severe) acute cholecystitis are septic and require antibiotic treatment in addition to appropriate organ support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This is the rationale for exclusively including patients with grade I (mild) and grade II (moderate) acute cholecystitis.</p><p id="Par42">If this study demonstrates that omitting antibiotic prophylaxis does not increase the postoperative infection rate in patients with acute cholecystitis, the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery of the entire upper gastrointestinal tract will become questionable. A decrease in the use of antibiotics may result in a large reduction of bacterial resistance, the latter being an increasingly serious threat to global public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par43">Recruitment commenced in March 2016 and is anticipated to run until March 2019. As of August 20, 2017, 158 patients had been randomized, and 7 hospitals were participating in the trial. The study results will be communicated via publication.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par50">
