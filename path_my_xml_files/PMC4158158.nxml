<italic>Background</italic>. Damage of the intestinal mucosa barrier may result in intestinal bacterial and endotoxin translocation, leading to local and systemic inflammation. The present study was designed to investigate whether peritoneal air exposure induces damage of intestinal mucosal barrier. <italic>Methods</italic>. Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 210 to 230&#x02009;g) were randomized into five groups (6/group): a control group, a sham group, and three exposure groups with peritoneal air exposure for 1, 2, and 3&#x02009;h, respectively. At 24&#x02009;h after surgery, blood and terminal ileum were sampled. The serum D-lactate levels were determined using an ELISA kit. The intestinal permeability was determined by measuring the intestinal clearance of FITC-dextran (FD4). The histopathological changes in terminal ileum were also assessed. <italic>Results</italic>. Compared with the controls, peritoneal air exposure caused an increase in both serum D-lactate level and intestinal FD4 clearance, which were proportional to the length of peritoneal air exposure and correlated to Chiu's scores, indices for intestinal mucosal injury. Edema and inflammatory cells were also observed in mucosa and submucosa of ileum in three exposure groups. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Peritoneal air exposure could induce damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier, which is proportional to the time length of peritoneal air exposure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Peritoneal air exposure is a common clinical phenomenon in open abdominal surgery. Although it is well accepted that peritoneal air exposure induces injury to various tissues/organs, the etiology and underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. It is reported that peritoneal air exposure induces intestinal and systemic inflammatory response [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the originating site of inflammation after peritoneal air exposure is unknown; it is also unclear whether the inflammatory response is related to the duration of peritoneal air exposure.</p><p>The intestinal tract is one of the target organs during various stresses [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Damage to the intestinal mucosa barrier will result in intestinal bacterial and endotoxin translocation and further contribute to local and systemic inflammations [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In clinical practice, patients with serious gastrointestinal failure undergoing open abdominal surgery often show systemic inflammatory syndrome. Therefore, the injury and inflammation in the intestinal tract are often considered as the driving force of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Investigations to explore the risk factors for damage to intestinal mucosal barrier and to develop the intervention approaches to restoring the barrier function are popular pursuits in modern surgical research.</p><p>The present study was designed to investigate whether peritoneal air exposure leads to intestinal mucosal barrier damage and whether this effect is related to the duration of peritoneal air exposure under experimental conditions mimicking clinical operation room atmosphere.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Animals</title><p>Healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 210 to 230&#x02009;g) were obtained from Jinling Hospital, Nanjing, China. The rats were housed in our laboratory in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment; they had free access to standard rat chow and tap water. The lights were maintained on a 12&#x02009;:&#x02009;12&#x02009;h light&#x02009;:&#x02009;dark cycle. The animals were allowed a minimum of one week acclimatization before experiments. This animal use and care protocol and experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jinling Hospital. The experiments were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines on the use of laboratory animals.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Experimental Procedures</title><p>Thirty rats were randomly divided into five groups (<italic>n</italic> = 6 each): a control group, a sham group, and three exposure groups with peritoneal air exposure for 1, 2, and 3&#x02009;h, respectively. The animals were anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 2% pentobarbital sodium (3.5&#x02009;mL/kg body weight) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and the total anesthetic time was 4&#x02009;h for all the five groups of animals. The surgical procedures were performed in an aseptic environment with controlled temperature and humidity. For the exposure groups, after the anesthesia was induced, a 3&#x02009;cm midline abdominal incision was made, and then the wound edge was retracted to allow for maximal peritoneal air exposure for 1, 2, and 3&#x02009;h, respectively [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thereafter, the abdomen was closed in one layer with 3&#x02013;0 silk continuous suture. For the sham group, the animals underwent the same anesthesia operation procedure but without laparotomy. For the control group, the animals underwent the same anesthesia but without any operative procedures. The animals in all the five groups were monitored until they recovered from anesthesia and then returned to their corresponding cages. At 24&#x02009;h after surgery, samples&#x02009;of blood and intestinal tissues were obtained after the animals were anesthetized. The selection of terminal ileum as the investigation site was based on previous publications [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These studies have indicated that the terminal ileum is the major site for observation of damage to gut barrier functions following exposure to various injuries. It is suggested that terminal ileum is the most sensitive section of the intestinal tract [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. D-Lactate (D-LA) Determination</title><p>D-lactate is one of the major products of bacterial metabolism, which is hardly seen in normal circulation or body fluids. When the permeability of the intestine is increased after bacterial infection, the level of D-lactate will increase, penetrate across intestinal barrier, and enter the circulation, resulting in an increased blood level of D-lactate. Therefore, in the present study, D-lactate was chosen as a marker for the changes in intestinal barriers after peritoneal air exposure. The blood samples were obtained from the inferior vena cava. The serum was&#x02009;prepared&#x02009;by&#x02009;centrifugation&#x02009;at&#x02009;a&#x02009;speed&#x02009;of&#x02009;1,500&#x02009;rpm for 15&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C,&#x02009; and&#x02009; the&#x02009; levels&#x02009; of&#x02009; D-LA were&#x02009;determined with an ELISA kit for rats (R&#x00026;D Systems, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Intestinal Permeability Determination</title><p>The intestinal permeability was also determined by calculating intestinal clearance of fluorescein-isothiocyanate dextran (FD4) as described in the literature [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Briefly, a segment of terminal ileum with length of 8&#x02009;cm was prepared, and the mucosa was everted. One end of the gut segment was ligated, and a gut sac was made by injecting 1.5&#x02009;mL of Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer from the other end. The sac was then suspended in a solution containing 0.5&#x02009;mg/mL of FD4, and the temperature was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C. The bathing solution was aerated by gently bubbling with a gas mixture containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% O<sub>2</sub>. Thirty minutes later, the value of the mucosal surface area (<italic>A</italic>) in the sac solution was measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer. The clearance of FD4 was calculated according to the following formula:

The degree of intestinal mucosa injury was assessed by using Chiu's scoring system as described previously [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The intestinal mucosal changes after peritoneal air exposure were graded as follows: Grade 0, normal mucosal villi; Grade 1, development of subepithelial Gruenhagen's space, usually seen at the apex of the villus, often with capillary congestion; Grade 2, extension of the subepithelial Gruenhagen's space with moderate lifting of epithelial layer from the lamina propria; Grade 3, massive epithelial lifting down the sides of villi, with a few tips being denuded; Grade 4; denuded villi with lamina propria and dilated capillaries exposed, increased cellularity of lamina propria; and Grade 5, digestion and disintegration of lamina propria, hemorrhage, and ulceration. The average scores of the exposure groups were compared with that of the controls.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD.

Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we investigated whether peritoneal air exposure led to intestinal mucosa barrier damage and whether the effects were related to the duration of peritoneal air exposure. Our results showed that peritoneal air exposure caused increases in both serum D-lactate level and intestinal clearance of FD4, when compared with the control group. This difference was proportional to the exposure time length of peritoneal air exposure. In addition, edema and inflammatory cells were also observed in the mucosa and submucosa of ileum, although there was no substantial injury in the three exposure groups. Furthermore, both serum D-lactate level and intestinal clearance of FD4 were positively correlated to Chiu's score for intestinal mucosal injury.</p><p>Peritoneal air exposure is a common clinical phenomenon in open abdominal surgery impacting the patient's recovery after operation and quality of life. There are limited studies linking the severity of injury with peritoneal air exposure. Peritoneal air exposure could induce intestinal and systemic inflammatory response [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, compared with the control group, the level of systemic inflammatory response was much greater in the experimental group when gut was exposed to air for one minute in rat induced by opening abdomen with 2&#x02009;cm incision [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, what location this inflammation originates from during peritoneal air exposure is still unclear.</p><p>Bacterial colonization of the gut is extensive and bacteria are confined to the gastrointestinal tract by the mucosal barrier. Damage to the intestinal mucosa barrier will result in intestinal bacteria and endotoxin translocation and further contribute to local and systemic inflammations [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Patients with serious gastrointestinal failure undergoing open abdominal surgery often have systemic inflammatory syndrome. Therefore, in order to elucidate the mechanism of the systemic inflammation induced by peritoneal air exposure, it is important to determinate the change in intestinal mucosa barrier during peritoneal air exposure.</p><p>It is a challenging task to measure the integrity and/or function of the intestinal mucosal barrier. In many published reports, measuring the intestinal permeability is employed to indirectly assess the barrier function. For example, D-lactate has been used as a biomarker for the permeability of the intestines, especially for bacterial infection [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, we choose D-lactate as a marker for the changes in intestinal barriers after peritoneal air exposure. In addition, FD4 is a relatively large molecule, which could not penetrate the normal intestinal barrier. When the intestinal permeability is increased under pathological conditions, FD4 can come across the intestinal barrier. Therefore, the FD4 clearance is also a good marker for function of intestinal barrier [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the present study, we found that peritoneal air exposure caused an increase in both serum D-lactate level and intestinal clearance of FD4. These changes were proportional to length of peritoneal air exposure. In addition, both serum D-lactate level and intestinal clearance of FD4 were positively correlated to Chiu's scores for intestinal mucosal injury. All of these results indicated that peritoneal air exposure could induce damage of intestinal mucosal barrier then cause an intestinal bacteria and endotoxin translocation and further contribute to local and systemic inflammation.</p><p>It is well known that patients undergoing longer length of operation time will have a higher level of surgical stress and suffer from more complications after surgery. According to our results in the present study, the time length of peritoneal air exposure may be also an important role in the development and progression of intestinal mucosal barrier damage. Therefore, in clinical practice, when patients undergo excessive abdominal surgery, methods to prevent peritoneal air exposure or reduce operation time may be an effective way to alleviate postoperative intestinal mucosal barrier damage, decrease systemic inflammatory response, and further enhance recovery after surgery.</p><p>Of note, there were some limitations in the present study. It has been well documented that several factors affect the development and progress of systemic inflammatory response syndrome after open surgery, including operation procedure and time, temperature, humidity, air atmosphere, and blood loss [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The present study attempted to mimic the clinical operation conditions and observed the relationship between air exposure time and the changes in intestinal barriers. Under our experimental conditions, the contribution of each individual factor cannot be clearly defined. Future studies are needed to investigate these factors in a better designed and well-controlled study setting. In the present study, the terminal ileum was chosen as the investigation site based on previous publications in the research field [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is suggested that terminal ileum is the most sensitive section [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, we could not completely rule out the possible effects of the bacterial translocation on other sections of the intestine such as colon. Future studies need to investigate other sections in addition to terminal ileum.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that peritoneal air exposure could induce damage to intestinal mucosal barrier, and this effect is proportional to the time length of peritoneal air exposure.
