It has been shown that mortality of patients with AAD per hour early after the onset of symptoms is about 1% to 2%. Furthermore, mortality of patients with AAD who do not receive surgery is 58.0% in contrast to 26% in surgically treated patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> In patients with AAD, multiple organ failure including acute lung injury (ALI) is frequent.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> It is reported that 51% of patients meet the criterion of oxygenation impairment (oxygen fraction [PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>]&#x0200a;&#x02264;&#x0200a;200&#x0200a;mm Hg) within 24 hour after onset of distal type AAD.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Actually, preoperative ALI has been shown as a frequent complication associated with a number of untoward consequences, such as prolonged ventilator support, longer stay in intensive care unit and hospital, and even induces death. The previous work by Wang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> showed that the incidence of postoperative hypoxemia was up to 49.5% in Chinese adult patients undergoing Stanford type-A AAD surgery and postoperative hypoxemia was attributable to preoperative disturbance in oxygenation (78.5%, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;&#x02264;&#x0200a;200&#x0200a;mm Hg). In addition, preoperative hypoxemia can also result in surgery delay, which increases the risk of aortic rupture, cardiac tamponade, or even death. Therefore, the prophylaxis and/or treatment of preoperative ALI induced by AAD is important for final outcomes of patients.</p><p>Better understanding of the pathophysiology of preoperative ALI in the patients with AAD can improve clinical prophylaxis and/or treatment, but its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. It is reported that the occurrence of oxygenation impairment on hospital days 2.5 in patients with Standford type-B AAD can be predicted by a multivariate logistic regression model.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> To our best knowledge, however, there is no study having assessed whether the preoperative ALI in Chinese adult patients undergoing the Standford type-A AAD surgery can be predicted by preoperative clinical and basic assessments. Thus, we put forward a prospective study strategy aiming to address the above issues.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study are to clarify the incidence, independent risk factors, and possible mechanisms of preoperative ALI in Chinese adult patients undergoing the Standford type-A AAD surgery. This will include a detailed statistical analysis of perioperative clinical baselines and serum variables, such as coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammatory, reactive oxygen species, and endothelial cell function. The outcomes of this study will obtain the details regarding the incidence, independent predictors, and pathophysiological mechanisms of preoperative ALI, which will benefit the prophylaxis and/or treatment of preoperative ALI induced by Standford type-A AAD.</p></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Design of trial</title><p>This trial is a prospective, double-blind, signal-center clinical trial which had been registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (identifier NCT01894334) and approved by the Beijing Anzhen Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The flowchart of the trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-95-e5164-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Participants (inclusion and exclusion criteria)</title><p>The sample of subjects is estimated to 130 patients, based on a 79% incidence of ALI before surgery in patients with Stanford type-A AAD<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and the set power to 80% for a type I error of 5% (Power Analysis and Sample Size, PASS V11.0, NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, UT). A convenient sample will be recruited from the Beijing Anzhen Hospital. The AAD surgery in the Beijing Anzhen Hospital is performed in approximately 300 cases per year. If 30% of these patients are eligible and consent, we will meet our recruitment target in about 1.5 years, which can avoid the bias from the different levels of surgical procedures in different periods.</p><p>Patients aged 18 to 75 years will be included. The patients with coronary heart disease; heart failure; severe cardiac tamponade; unstable hemodynamics; nervous system abnormalities; clinically apparent malperfusion<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> including lower limb, cerebral, coronary, and renal malperfusion; and visceral ischemia will be excluded. All patients enrolled in this study have normal hepatic and renal function according to the preoperative physical and laboratory examinations. No patient is prescribed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids before or after admission. All patients will be informed and consented with regard to their participation in the study.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Anesthetic managements</title><p>To avoid aortic rupture, systolic blood pressure will be controlled between 100 and 120&#x0200a;mm Hg with oral &#x003b2;-blockers and intravenous infusion of vasodilators (nitroprusside, etc.) before surgery. On surgery day, morphine hydrochloride 10&#x0200a;mg will be injected intramuscularly 1 hour before entering operation room. After entering the operating room, patients will be monitored with a 5-lead electrocardiography, pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), bispectral index (BIS), and invasive blood pressure through a left radial artery catheter. After tracheal intubation, a right internal jugular central venous catheter will be placed for monitoring of central venous pressure.</p><p>Anesthesia will be induced with intravenous midazolam, etomidate, sufentanil, and neuromuscular blockade drugs. After tracheal intubation, general anesthesia will be maintained with intravenous sufentanil, propofol, and either isoflurane or sevoflurane. BIS will be maintained at between 45 and 55 throughout surgery. The patient&#x02019; lungs will be mechanically ventilated with a FiO<sub>2</sub> 100% oxygen and a 5-cmH<sub>2</sub>O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure will be maintained at between 35 and 45&#x0200a;mm Hg by adjusting tidal volume of 6 to 8&#x0200a;mL/kg and respiratory rate of 10 to 15&#x0200a;times/min. During the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mechanical ventilation will be discontinued and pulmonary static inflation (5&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O) will be performed with compressed air.</p></sec><sec><label>3.4</label><title>Surgical procedure<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></title><p>Patients undergo median sternotomy and CPB. Cannulation of the femoral artery and/or right axillary artery will be performed for CPB. Furthermore, the right axillary artery cannulation will also be carried out for selective cerebral perfusion. After CPB is established and cooling is initiated, the ascending aorta will be clamped and cardiac arrest will be accomplished with cold cardioplegic solution during the cooling phase. When the nasopharyngeal temperature is decreased to 20&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C to 25&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C, circulatory arrest will be instituted. A stent graft and a 4-branch prosthetic graft will be used for arch replacement. After the open distal anastomosis is completed, the 4-branch prosthetic graft will be cross-clamped. Then the blood perfusion of the lower body will be started via the perfusion limb of the 4-branch prosthetic graft. Selective cerebral perfusion will be continued until the anastomosis to the left common carotid artery, innominate artery, and left subclavian artery is accomplished. Then CPB will be resumed to normal flow, and rewarming will be started. Valve-sparing root resection (aortic valve plasty, the David procedure, or valsalva sinus plasty) or valve graft replacement will be performed according to the subtype of the aortic root.</p></sec><sec><label>3.5</label><title>Definitions</title><p>In all patients, the diagnosis of AAD will be confirmed by history, chest radiography, transthoracic, and contrast-enhanced computed tomogrphy or magnetic resonance imaging.

However, there has been no reliable incidence of preoperative ALI of such patients in China. Our study will be conducted in one of the largest clinic center of cardiovascular diseases in China, and a large nationally representative sample of the Standford type-A AAD in China will be collected. Therefore, the outcome of this trial can present the clinical characteristics of preoperative ALI in Chinese adult patients undergoing the Standford type-A AAD surgery.</p><p>In patients with AAD, ALI is a usual complication associated with untoward consequences or even leads to losing the chance of surgery. Although the risk factors and mechanisms of ALI are still unclear, the available evidence shows that systemic inflammatory response is activated through AAD surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Inflammation is a protective response essential for maintaining human health and fighting disease, but excessive inflammatory response can promote the irreversible cellular damage. The extensive activation of leckocyte and uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines can increase the permeability of the vessel wall and thrombosis, which will contribute to the organs damage. Since the pulmonary vascular bed is an important reservoir of neutrophils, the lungs tend to be a major site of tissue damage by AAD.</p><p>Recent works have shown that coagulation/fibrinolysis and inflammation are host defense mechanisms, mutually dependent in mounting an adequate immune response against potentially injurious challenges.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, secondary fibrinolysis can aggravate ALI.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Thus, we hypothesize that both the inflammation and coagulation are involved in ALI by AAD. By the statistical adjustment and analysis, it can be anticipated that findings of this study may reveal the related mechanisms of ALI by AAD. If these hypotheses are confirmed in our further clinical study, the treatments aimed to the pathophysiology of preoperative ALI can be recommended to decrease perioperative morbidity and mortality by ALI in patients with AAD. Thus, our findings have potentially clinical implications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AAD = acute aortic dissection, ALI = acute lung injury, CPB = cardiopulmonary bypass, EuroSCORE = European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation, FIB = fibrinogen, Hb = hemoglobin, LVEDd = left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction, Murray LIS = Murray lung injury score, PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>YC and MJ have contributed equally to the article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: The study was supported by grants from Capital medical development research foundation (no. 2011-2006-03), Beijing Municipal Science &#x00026; Technology Commission (no.
