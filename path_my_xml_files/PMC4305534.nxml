vibration applied to an unstable support surface on the thickness and length of the
transverse abdominis. [Subjects] The subjects were 64 healthy university students who were
randomly assigned to a bridge exercise with sling and vibration group (BESVG, n=30) and a
bridge exercise with sling group (BESG, n=34). [Methods] The bridge exercise was repeated
four times per set and a total of 18 sets were performed: 9 sets in a supine position and
9 sets in a prone position. In both the BESVG and the BESG groups, the thickness and
length of the transverse abdominis (TrA) were measured using ultrasonography with the
abdomen &#x0201c;drawn-in&#x0201d; and the pressure of a biofeedback unit maintained at 40 mmHg, both
before and after the intervention. [Results] In intra-group comparisons, the BESVG showed
significant increases in the thickness of the TrA and significant decreases in the length
of the TrA. The BESG showed significant increases in the thickness of the TrA. The BESVG
showed significant increases in the thickness of the TrA and significant decreases in the
length of the TrA compared to BESG. [Conclusion] Closed chain exercises for the lumbar
region performed with local vibration applied to slings, which are unstable support
surfaces, are an effective intervention for altering the thickness and length of the
TrA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Closed chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Vibration</kwd><kwd>Transverse abdominis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ever since humans began to walk upright, some of their muscles have always been activated
to maintain the balance of the body on narrow support surfaces. If these posture-maintaining
muscles lose their function, low back pain will be induced due to the maintenance of
unstable postures<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared to healthy
persons, patients with low back pain have reduced proprioceptive sense in the deep lumbar
muscles, which makes the spine unstable, and this may lead to the recurrence of low back
pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. When healthy persons without any
low back pain move their upper or lower limbs quickly, their transversus abdominis (TrA)
muscles contract first to contribute to lumbar stabilization. However, in the case of
patients with low back pain, the TrA muscles do not contract first<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Delayed contraction of the TrA makes the trunk unstable,
leading to reduced motor and postural control abilities and inefficient actions of the
spinal muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Richardson et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the low back pain recurrence
rate was reduced from 75 to 35% for three years after &#x0201c;abdominal drawing-in&#x0201d; exercises were
performed to strengthen the TrA and multifidus muscles. Page<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> advised that rather than exercises using stable bearing surfaces,
lumbar stabilization exercises using an unstable support surface are more effective for the
maintenance of postural balance and the recovery of proprioceptive senses. Kang et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that according to the measurements
taken using ultrasonography and the visual analogue scale after patients who had received
herniated disc surgery had performed lumbar stabilization exercises using slings, which are
unstable support surface, the activity of the TrA muscle increased and pain was relieved.
Therefore, these previous studies indicate that closed chain exercises on an unstable
support surface have the effect of activating lumbar stabilization muscles. The local
vibration used for the intervention in this study took the form of isometric exercises that
have been attracting great attention after results indicating that they positively affect
motor function improvement and increase energy metabolism and blood flow rates<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Rittweger et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when vibration and exercises
were performed by a group of low back pain patients, there was evidence of pain relief and
improvement in their neuromuscular control ability.</p><p>This study compared and analyzed the changes in the thickness and length of the TrA muscle
when vibration was applied to low back pain patients while they performed closed chain
exercises on an unstable support surface.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 64 healthy university students residing in Daegu, Korea, who were
randomly divided into a bridge exercise with sling and vibration group (BESVG) of 30
students, and a bridge exercise with sling group (BESVG) of 34 students. The BESVG&#x02019;s mean
age was 21.8&#x000b1;1.6&#x02005;years, their mean height was 166.1&#x000b1;7.7&#x02005;cm, and their mean weight was
61.2&#x000b1;11.2&#x02005;kg. The BESG&#x02019;s mean age was 22.5&#x000b1;1.8&#x02005;years, their mean height was 169.6&#x000b1;7.2&#x02005;cm,
and their mean weight was 60.7&#x000b1;9.4&#x02005;cm. Those who had neurologic or orthopedic problems or
could not perform supine/prone bridge exercises due to pain or other problems were excluded
from the study. All of the participants understood the purpose of this study and provided
their written informed consent prior to their participation in this study, in accordance
with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>When the subjects in the BESVG performed the bridge exercise in supine positions, each
adopted a supine position on the table. For the starting posture, the subjects placed their
two hands on the floor to support the body, maintained 90&#x000b0; flexion postures of the hip and
knee joints, and placed both ankles in a narrow sling. During the exercise, the subjects
loaded their weight on both lower limbs, avoiding pelvic tilt and lifted their hip so that
the trunk, pelvis, and lower limbs made a straight line. When the subjects in the BESVG
performed the bridge exercise in the prone position, each adopted a prone position on the
table. For the starting posture, the subjects placed their two ankles in a narrow sling
while maintaining the shoulder and elbow joints at 90&#x000b0;. During the exercise, the subject
loaded their weight on both lower limbs and elbows, avoiding pelvic tilt and lifted their
hips so that the trunk, pelvis, and lower limbs made a straight line. The performance of
each exercise four times constituted one set, and nine sets of the bridge exercise were
performed in both the supine and prone positions. The subjects took a rest for 30 seconds
after each set was completed. The BESG performed the same bridge exercises without local
vibration in the supine and prone positions.</p><p>Local vibration was applied by suspending the two ropes of the sling that supported both
lower limbs from vibration equipment (Redcord<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Stimula, Norway), so that
vibration was applied only while the subjects were performing bridge exercises and not
during rest times. Vibration was applied at 15&#x02005;Hz in the first 3 sets, at 20&#x02005;Hz in the next
3 sets, and at 30&#x02005;Hz in the last 3 sets.</p><p>An HD11XE ultrasound system (Philips, Netherlands) was used for ultrasonic imaging, and
measurements were conducted by one person who was skilled in ultrasonic measurement. Before
the ultrasonic measurements were taken, subjects lay comfortably in the supine position. A
pressure biofeedback unit (PBU) was placed between the umbilicus and the floor, and a
triangular pillow was placed under the subject&#x02019;s knees for support, thereby relaxing the
subject&#x02019;s lower limbs. An assistant adjusted the pressure of the PBU to 40 mmHg, and the
tester then placed the probe transversely on the top of the iliac crest and moved it to the
center of the abdomen to align the end point of the TrA muscle with the end point of the
screen. Once this had been done, the subject &#x0201c;drew in&#x0201d; the abdomen within the range in which
the gradation of the PBU did not change, and the distance moved by the end point of the TrA
muscle was measured. In this way, the distance was measured three times, both before and
after the intervention and the average values were recorded. Since the total length of the
TrA muscle could not be measured due to the nature of ultrasonography, the sliding distance
from the abdomen to the outside was measured instead.</p><p>For the statistical analyses, intra-group changes in TrA thicknesses and lengths were
analyzed using the paired t-test, and intergroup comparisons were performed using the
independent sample t-test. Statistical processing was conducted using SPSS 12.0KO (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA) with a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the results of this study, in the intragroup comparison, the BESVG showed a

alignment and stability, and improve proprioceptive stimuli and dynamic stabilization<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study involving 51 patients with
chronic low back pain, Saliba et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
demonstrated that bridge exercises on an unstable support surface provided by slings were
more effective at increasing TrA muscle activity than bridge exercises on stable bearing
surfaces as measured by ultrasonography. Eom et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that bridging exercises performed by healthy persons using
slings as an unstable support surface showed larger increases in TrA thicknesses than
bridging exercises performed by the same persons on stable bearing surfaces. In a study
conducted by Brumagne et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> with
chronic low back pain patients, in which proprioceptive sense exercises and local vibrations
were additionally applied, proprioceptive stimuli and deep muscle control abilities of the
subjects improved. The studies cited above indicate that closed chain exercises on an
unstable support surface are effective lumbar stabilization exercises for activating the TrA
muscle. Hides et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
according to MRI and ultrasonography conducted after athletes had performed drawing-in
exercises, the TrA muscle became thicker and shorter. Hides et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that weight-bearing stabilization exercises
performed by low back pain patients greatly increased the thickness of the internal oblique
muscles, and shortened the TrA muscle.</p><p>According to the results of this study, in the intragroup comparisons the BESVG showed a
significant increase in TrA thickness and a significant decrease in TrA lengths; and the
BESG showed a significant increase in TrA thicknesses. In the intergroup comparison, the
BESVG showed a significant increase in TrA thickness and a significant decrease in TrA
lengths compared to the BESG. Given these results, we consider the local vibration applied
to the BESVG during closed chain exercises on an unstable support surface improved TrA
muscle strength and power and lumber/pelvic tilt repositioning senses, thereby affecting TrA
thickness and length more than in the BESG. Fontana et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when healthy persons performed weight-bearing
exercise while vibration was applied, the subjects&#x02019; lumber/pelvic tilt repositioning senses
were improved by as much as 39%. Therefore, applying local vibration during bridge exercises
using slings in clinics should be an effective method for lumbar stabilization, because it
improves TrA muscle activation. In addition, it can be presented to patients with chronic
low back pain as an exercise intervention method in clinics.</p><p>Although many previous studies have measured TrA muscle activity through the thickness of
the muscle using ultrasonic imaging, those that used local vibrations are few in number.
Therefore, it is important that related studies in this field are undertaken in the
future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Al-Obaidi</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Zoabi</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Shuwaie</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The influence of pain and pain-related fear and disability
