The most common type of eczema, atopic dermatitis (AD), affects 15%&#x02013;30% of children and 2%&#x02013;10% of adults (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Eichenfield et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Ellis, Mancini, Paller, Simpson, &#x00026; Eichenfield, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Hanifin &#x00026; Rajka, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sabin et al., 2012</xref>). Typically, AD appears within the first 5 years of life (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Berke et al., 2012</xref>), with approximately 70% of children outgrowing the condition by early adolescence (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sabin et al., 2012</xref>); however, patients retain a lifelong predisposition for skin that is easily irritated.</p><p>AD presents as a condition with quiescent periods interrupted by periodic flare-ups. There are three clinical presentations of AD: subacute, acute, and chronic. Subacute eczema is characterized by dry, pruritic, scaly skin with erythematous papules and plaques (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Berke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sabin et al., 2012</xref>). Acute eczema is characterized by red, pruritic papules and serous exudates (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sabin et al., 2012</xref>). Secondary lesions can occur because of scratching, resulting in excoriations and crusted lesions. Chronic irritation and uncontrolled scratching can result in lichenification of the skin (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sabin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Pediatric skin differs from adult skin, having characteristics that may make it more prone to AD. The stratum corneum in infants is extremely thin and shows both increased exogenous water absorption rates and water desorption in the first year of life compared with adults, suggesting an inability to hold water (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Nikolovski, Stamatas, Kollias, &#x00026; Wiegand, 2008</xref>). Over the first 1&#x02013;4 years, the stratum corneum gains thickness and shows increased ability to hold water, with infant and toddler skin actually having higher water content than adult skin, despite lower natural moisturizing factor levels. However, the smaller and less dense corneocytes and keratinocytes, thinner total epidermis, inability to maintain hydration homeostasis, and higher ratio of surface area to volume in the skin of young children all reflect skin with compromised barrier integrity (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Fernandes, Machado, &#x00026; Oliveira, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Nikolovski et al., 2008</xref>). This compromised barrier results in water loss and xerotic skin, which is easily irritated and difficult to heal. To overcome the itch&#x02013;scratch cycle evident in AD, the skin needs to be adequately hydrated, and the itch needs to be controlled to allow the skin to heal (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sabin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Current European and U.S. guidelines recommend the daily application of emollient moisturizers for both the prevention and treatment of AD (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Eichenfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Hanifin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Ring et al., 2012</xref>). Emollient therapy can improve hydration, prevent transepidermal water loss (TEWL; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Eichenfield et al., 2012</xref>), and relieve itching (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2003</xref>). Topical corticosteroids are the primary prescription product used to control flare-ups of AD, with short-term oral steroids (up to 1 week) used to treat major exacerbations. However, long-term use of topical or oral steroids is not recommended for the treatment of AD, particularly in children, because of the risk for cutaneous side effects, rebound flare-ups, suppression of growth rate, and reduced bone density (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Hanifin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Ring et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, reports indicate that approximately 50% of parents request steroid-sparing medications for their children with moderate-to-severe eczema because of concerns about adverse events (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Hon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Kojima et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Development of steroid-free, over-the-counter (OTC) skin care products that can support the barrier and help manage bothersome symptoms is a major goal for eczema therapy. We have developed two new OTC products for the management and treatment of AD. The first is a Body Cream designed for daily use to maintain hydration of the skin, support skin barrier function, and reduce TEWL. An Instant Therapy cream has been designed to specifically treat acute AD flare-ups, calming the skin and supporting hydration and barrier repair. Both products contain colloidal oatmeal, licochalcone, ceramide 3, and castor oil. In addition, Instant Therapy contains menthoxypropanediol, a novel cooling agent to calm itch and provide a cooling sensation.</p><p>Here, we report on two controlled clinical studies conducted to test the efficacy and tolerability of the Body Cream and Instant Therapy in infants and children with AD.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Overview of Clinical Studies</title><p>Two single-center, 2-week clinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of two emollient creams&#x02014;one designed for daily moisturization (Eucerin Eczema Relief Body Cr&#x000e8;me: Body Cream) and the other for acute therapy of AD lesions (Eucerin Eczema Relief Instant Therapy cream: Instant Therapy).

Current guidelines for maintenance therapy of atopic skin recommend daily application of emollient therapy, whereas corticosteroids are typically used to control flare-ups (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Eichenfield et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Hanifin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Ring et al., 2012</xref>). However, approximately 50% of parents were reported to request nonsteroidal medications to treat their children&#x02019;s moderate-to-severe eczema (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Hon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Kojima et al., 2013</xref>). Parents&#x02019; reluctance to use topical steroids suggests that many children do not receive their prescribed steroid treatment until the condition has escalated (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Hon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Kojima et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, there is a need for steroid-free moisturizing skin care treatments that are safe and well tolerated in young children with compromised skin barriers.</p><p>Both the Body Cream and Instant Therapy were well tolerated in children as young as 3 months. Only one adverse event, a mild erythematous rash, was considered possibly related to treatment with the Body Cream; however, it was transient and resolved while treatment continued. No adverse events were related to treatment with the Instant Therapy. None of the subjects discontinued the study because of adverse events or for any other reason.</p><p>Daily hydration and protection of the skin may help to reduce the frequency of AD flares. Body Cream and Instant Therapy significantly improved the hydration of skin, particularly that of active lesions, as shown by the corneometry results. Similar studies in adults have shown that these products significantly improved barrier function, as evidenced by a decrease in TEWL (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the daily application of the Body Cream significantly improved the symptoms of AD, including erythema, tactile roughness, and itching.</p><p>The efficacy and tolerability shown by the Body Cream and Instant Therapy were observed without the use of concomitant prescription therapy. Although there are other OTC preparations available in the United States for the treatment of AD, very few have been studied in pediatric subjects, and several of those studies permitted the continuation of topical steroid treatment throughout the treatment period (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Del Rosso &#x00026; Kircik, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Simpson &#x00026; Dutronc, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2012</xref>). Allowing concomitant treatment makes it difficult to assess the true efficacy of the emollient formulation.</p><p>Symptoms of AD can have a dramatically negative impact on quality of life. Constant itching and discomfort can disrupt sleep as well as daytime work, school, and leisure activities (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Kiebert et al., 2002</xref>). Itching can also exacerbate the existing inflammation, preventing the skin from healing. Both Body Cream and Instant Therapy significantly improved the symptoms of AD, most notably itching. Parents confirmed the efficacy of both products, with more than 90% agreeing that the products effectively moisturized their child&#x02019;s itchy skin, calmed and soothed itch, protected against dryness, reduced redness, and were gentle enough to use every day. In addition, the skin showed overall visible improvements, which can be seen in Figures 3 and 7.</p><p>The efficacy and tolerability of the Body Cream and Instant Therapy are because of their formulations. Both product formulations are acidic, supporting the optimal pH of healthy skin and counteracting pH disturbances observed in atopic patients. The acidic milieu of the stratum corneum suppresses <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacterial growth and is necessary for the functioning of enzymes that drive lipid synthesis and maturation and the desquamation process (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Rippke, Schreiner, Doering, &#x00026; Maibach, 2004</xref>). The formulas also contain ingredients known to soothe skin and enhance barrier repair, including colloidal oatmeal, ceramide 3, licochalcone, and castor seed oil. Oatmeal, a skin protectant active for eczema approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, contains several dermatologically active constituents with moisturizing, soothing, anti-inflammatory, barrier protective, and antioxidant properties. Oatmeal has been shown to have clinical efficacy as adjunctive therapy in reducing symptoms of AD, including itch (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Fowler, Nebus, Wallo, &#x00026; Eichenfield, 2012</xref>). Ceramides are one of three stratum corneum lipid constituents of the skin barrier, deficiencies of which have been linked to AD (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Kezic et al., 2014</xref>). In the Eucerin formulations, ceramide 3 is an important constituent that combats the skin barrier defect, preventing TEWL and dryness. Licochalcone has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects on the skin that may reduce skin irritation, erythema, and itching (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2012</xref>). Castor seed oil contains natural emollients that deeply penetrate the skin, moisturizing the skin and reducing TEWL and dryness. The Instant Therapy cream contains twice the ceramide content of the Body Cream as well as menthoxypropanediol, a cooling agent that provides rapid relief of itching and burning sensations upon contact (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Akira, Michio, &#x00026; Yoshida, 1984</xref>). Both formulations calm and soothe itch and other symptoms of AD and support barrier repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>AD causes great discomfort for many children as they experience constant itch and subsequent scratching, inflamed lesions, and lichenification. Symptoms have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life for both children and parents. Providing parents with OTC options that are effective and well tolerated will help maintain the adequate hydration and protection needed for children with AD. The Eucerin Body Cr&#x000e8;me and Instant Therapy products have been specifically formulated to provide hydration and support barrier repair as well as to reduce symptoms of AD, allowing affected skin to heal. The studies reported here indicate that these products were effective and well tolerated in infants and children with AD as young as 3 months without the use of concomitant therapy. These formulations have also been tested in adults, with similar improvements in hydration and symptoms of AD (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2014</xref>). These products provide effective OTC treatments for eczema that are gentle enough for daily use in infants and children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank Jodie Macoun, PhD, of Evince Communications for her support in the preparation of this article.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>This project was sponsored and funded by Beiersdorf, Inc.
