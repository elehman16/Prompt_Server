A cluster-randomized design was chosen for this investigation because the intervention was directed at groups or clusters (rather than individuals), and this design helps to minimize or remove potential contamination (eg, spread of the effect of an intervention to controls) between randomized groups.<xref rid="b26-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, the participating institutions were carefully chosen in order to reflect the &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; situation, and not the type of environment encountered in specialized academic centers.

The psychoeducation program was designed specifically to be administered to small groups of parents (eg, 5&#x02013;6 parents per group) within one month of receipt of a diagnosis of ADHD.<xref rid="b27-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It was a standardized, manual-based program that included materials for leaders (manual, slide deck) and for parents and children (eg, workbook, brochures, reading material), and was administered in five weekly 90-minute sessions (weeks 1&#x02013;4 and week 9). The program was subjected to external peer review (ADHD clinical experts and advocacy groups) and a pilot test in a clinical environment before being included in this study.</p><p>Participating sites were required to have physicians with a medical specialty in psychiatry, child psychiatry, or child neurology, a potential recruitment rate of 3&#x02013;5 patients per month, and not to have a structured psychoeducation program in place as part of routine care for ADHD patients. Centers recruited patients sequentially over time into clusters and each cluster was then randomly assigned, stratified by clinic size, to parental psychoeducation plus medication or to medication alone, according to a concealed computer-generated sequence provided by the sponsor. An interval of at least 4 weeks was mandated between a cluster starting treatment and recruitment of patients to a new cluster in order to avoid potential contamination (eg, sharing of information) by investigators and parents during the administration of simultaneous programs.</p><p>Following baseline assessments and randomization, patients commenced treatment with a standard course of medication alone or a standard course of medication in addition to parental psychoeducation. Medication was administered at the discretion of the attending physician in accordance with the ADHD guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.<xref rid="b28-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Parental psychoeducation sessions lasted for 90 minutes and were given once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by a fifth session after a 5-week break. Sessions were offered at flexible times, although most took place in the late afternoon. They consisted of lectures, small-group and large-group discussions, shared learning from previous sessions, and homework. Details of session content are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-10-1081">Table 1</xref> and include provision of information on ADHD in general, pharmacologic management, and behavior management. Patients and parents attended the clinic for up to 12 months of follow-up, with assessments at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 52 following randomization. In addition, patient progress was monitored by telephone call between each clinic visit (a total of four telephone calls).</p><p>The trial was conducted in 27 centers in Spain. It adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by local ethical review boards. All parents provided written informed consent to participation in the trial and randomization to medication or to medication plus psychoeducation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients and parents</title><p>Eligible patients were children or adolescents aged 6&#x02013;12 years with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of ADHD (<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, Text Revision Fourth Edition [DSM-IV-TR] criteria), an Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV-Parent Version (ADHD-RS-IV Parent:Inv) score at least 1.5 standard deviations above the age norm for their diagnostic subtype, and a Clinical Global Impression-ADHD Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) score &#x02265;4 at baseline. Patients were required to be pharmacologically na&#x000ef;ve and willing to commence on medication at the same time as the first planned psychoeducation session. Adjustment of doses of pharmacologic treatment was allowed at the discretion of the prescribing physician. The presence of any learning difficulties, based on patient medical history and physician reports, was recorded.</p><p>Participating parents/guardians were required to be the primary caregiver and legal guardian of the patient at the time of initial diagnosis of ADHD. Before randomization, parents/guardians were also required to agree to possible participation in the psychoeducation program. Parents/guardians were not eligible for inclusion if pharmacologic treatment for ADHD was contraindicated for their children, or if either the parent/guardian or child was likely to start a structured psychoeducation program for ADHD outside of this trial. Parents/guardians were also excluded if their children had a history of bipolar disorder, psychosis, or autism spectrum disorder, or were in any way unsuitable to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint of this study was the duration of time in days until withdrawal or termination of medication due to any cause during the 12-month study period. For patients who were lost to follow-up or who started ineligible psychotherapeutic (pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic) treatment during the study, time to withdrawal was censored at the date of the last assessment. Secondary endpoints included the change from baseline to weeks 4, 12, 24, and 52 in the ADHD-RS-IV Parent:Inv score. The ADHD-RS-IV Parent:Inv is an 18-item scale with one item for each of the 18 symptoms contained in the DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD, each item being scored on a scale of 0&#x02013;3 (0, never or rarely; 1, sometimes; 2, often; 3, very often). The rating scale was used to assess symptom severity over the past week, and was administered and scored by qualified personnel at the investigative site based on an interview with the parent and the patient (not necessarily conducted at the same time).<xref rid="b29-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The total score was computed as the sum of the scores on each of the 18 items. Inattention and hyperactivity&#x02013;impulsivity subscale scores were also computed.</p><p>The change in CGI-ADHD-S score from baseline to weeks 4, 12, 24, and 52 was also evaluated. The CGI-ADHD-S<xref rid="b30-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> is a single-item clinician rating of the severity of ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician&#x02019;s total experience of patients with ADHD. Severity is rated on a 7-point scale (1, normal, not ill at all; 7, among the most extremely ill patients).</p><p>The functional outcome of patients at week 52 was assessed using the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent version (WFIRS-P). This is a parent-completed questionnaire that measures the impact of ADHD on their child&#x02019;s functioning in multiple domains.<xref rid="b12-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b31-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It rates impairment in six domains of functioning, ie, home, school, self-concept, social, activities of daily living, and risk taking. Each item is rated by the parent on a 4-point Likert scale of 0&#x02013;3 (0, never or not at all; 1, sometimes or somewhat; 2, often or much; 3, very often or very much). An average score was calculated by summing all items rated 0 through 3 and dividing the total by the number of nonmissing items. Items rated as not applicable were excluded from the calculation. Average scores were calculated for all six domains (total score) and for each subdomain.</p><p>Satisfaction with pharmacologic treatment at week 52 was assessed using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. This parent-administered questionnaire consists of five questions relating to treatment satisfaction that are each scored on a scale of 0&#x02013;4 (0, very satisfied; 4, very dissatisfied). It assesses a parent&#x02019;s satisfaction with his or her child&#x02019;s pharmacologic treatment over the past weeks.<xref rid="b32-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Treatment switching throughout the 12-month study period, the impact of therapy on the reasons for discontinuation, and satisfaction with the psychoeducation program (evaluation of home activities, handouts, and the session leaders&#x02019; preparation, teaching, interest, concern, and helpfulness) were also evaluated. Safety and tolerability were assessed by recording adverse events, their attribution to study procedures and interventions, and their severity and seriousness. In addition, adherence to pharmacologic treatment was evaluated at each visit by direct questioning of the parents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on the primary endpoint of time to discontinuation of treatment (any cause) and assuming discontinuation rates of 32% for the psychoeducation group and 17% for the control group,<xref rid="b33-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> it was estimated that a sample size of 360 patients would provide 80% power to detect hazard ratios of &#x02265;2.07 or &#x02264;0.48 at the 0.05 level of significance. In addition, a design effect correction was applied to the estimated number of events,<xref rid="b34-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> that took into account the intracluster correlation. Assuming that approximately 90 clusters were randomized with an average number of four patients per cluster and an intracluster correlation of 0.05,<xref rid="b35-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> the design effect would be 1.2 and the corrected estimated number of events would be 75.

All analyses accounted for clustering and site effects, and all tests of treatment effects were conducted at a 5% two-sided alpha level of significance.</p><p>For the primary endpoint, the distribution of time to discontinuation of treatment was estimated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier product-limit method.<xref rid="b36-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The proportion of patients still receiving treatment at 6, 10, and 12 months, and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were reported according to intervention group. Differences between the psychoeducation and control groups were estimated using a marginal Cox proportional hazards model<xref rid="b37-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> that accounted for clustering using a &#x0201c;robust sandwich variance&#x0201d; estimator. A basic model with the covariates of clinic size, type of ADHD diagnosis, and patient comorbidity was fitted to estimate and test for group differences.</p><p>Data for secondary endpoints (ADHD-RS-IV Parent:Inv, CGI-ADHD-S, and treatment satisfaction) followed a clustered longitudinal structure, in which individuals were nested within batches, and treatment was randomly assigned to batch and repeated measures (visits). These data were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures, which took into account the clustered structure of the data and allowed the residuals associated with longitudinal measures on the same individuals to be correlated. Batches and participants nested within each batch were assumed to be random factors. The model also included treatment, visit, interaction treatment by visit, and clinic size as fixed effects. An unstructured covariance matrix was assumed for the residuals. Intracluster correlation coefficients were estimated for all secondary endpoints using the mixed model for repeated measures.</p><p>Last observation carried forward change from baseline to endpoint analysis was conducted for the overall score and domains of the WFIRS-P, adjusting for clinic size and clustering. For analysis of the last observation carried forward change from baseline to endpoint, patients with a baseline value and at least one postbaseline measurement were included in the analysis. Analyses involved an extension of analysis of covariance, adjusting for the effect of clustering (ie, a mixed effects analysis of covariance with clusters nested in the intervention group). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study termination</title><p>This study was terminated early because recruitment had slowed dramatically despite extension of the recruitment period. The decision was made to analyze the available data even though the study would be underpowered, because prolonging recruitment for a longer period could put the validity of the data at risk due to a lack of control over evolving environmental conditions. Thus, compared with the 90 clusters and 360 patients required, only 65 clusters and 272 patients entered the study between May 2009 and October 2012.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Baseline characteristics and patient disposition</title><p>Patient characteristics were broadly similar at baseline for the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ndt-10-1081">Table 2</xref>).

Furthermore, nonadherence (at least one missed dose during the study) with pharmacologic treatment for ADHD was very low.

Adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported by two patients (1.4%) in the psychoeducation group (dystonia and glaucoma) and seven patients (5.6%) in the control group (irritability, malaise, pyrexia, tachycardia, akathisia, decreased appetite, and aggression). Serious adverse events were reported by three patients (2.1%) in the psychoeducation group (pneumonia n=2; femur fracture n=1) and one patient (0.8%) in the control group (appendicitis). All serious adverse events were considered to be unrelated to the study procedures and interventions or (probably) to ADHD medication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>At the time of conceptualization of this study, there was no randomized controlled investigation assessing the impact of psychoeducation on clinical variables in patients who were newly diagnosed or na&#x000ef;ve to treatment. Therefore, the present study was conducted to further define the role of psychoeducation in the treatment of ADHD by evaluating the effect of a structured parental psychoeducation program on clinical outcomes and, in particular, medication persistence among patients.</p><p>The psychoeducation program was a standardized, manual-based program designed for parents of patients with ADHD. The parent-orientated approach of the program reflects the pivotal role that parents play in the decision-making process for children with ADHD<xref rid="b21-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and the fact that their attitudes may impact on adherence.<xref rid="b22-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>In this study, administration of a structured psychoeducation program to parents of patients with a new diagnosis of ADHD requiring medication did not significantly affect medication persistence in terms of time to treatment withdrawal after 12 months of pharmacotherapy (primary endpoint). However, it is also notable that only 62 patients withdrew for any reason during the study, and that the number of patients affected was similarly low in the psychoeducation (n=28) and control (n=34) groups. It is also interesting to note that nonadherence to ADHD pharmacologic treatment was very low in both groups (despite the fact that the control group did not undergo psychoeducation), with only two patients (1.4%) in the psychoeducation group and six patients (4.8%) in the control group being nonadherent at least once during the study. These figures are lower than the nonadherence rates of 7%&#x02013;81% reported in recent publications,<xref rid="b38-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b44-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> depending on the drug and formulation used. Of note, the presence of learning difficulties increased the likelihood of treatment discontinuation by approximately three-fold in our investigation. It has been suggested that learning difficulties have an impact on adherence to pharmacologic treatment and that ADHD patients with learning difficulties may have a poorer response to pharmacologic treatment compared with those without this comorbidity.<xref rid="b45-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b47-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p><p>A statistically significant difference in improvement of clinical symptoms as measured by the ADHD-RS-IV Parent:Inv and severity of clinical symptoms as measured by the CGI-ADHD-S was observed between the groups, with stronger improvements seen in the psychoeducation group. However, no statistically significant differences in patient functioning were found between the groups using the WFIRS-P scale. Although the improvements in clinical symptoms in the psychoeducation group were modest, these may be important in some patients. The improvement in clinical symptoms may have been due partly to the fact that psychoeducation helped parents to recalibrate their feelings about the severity of their child&#x02019;s symptoms. In addition, it is possible that the beneficial effects of psychoeducation were time-related, with early effects being driven by medications<xref rid="b28-ndt-10-1081" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> but longer-term gains being achieved through an additive or interactive effect of medications and psychoeducation. It is also possible that ADHD medications and psychoeducation essentially served as a combined treatment approach, and that the psychoeducation program had a positive effect without influencing medication persistence. For example, it could have improved parenting self-efficacy, provided social support and advice on parenting practices, and improved parental understanding of ADHD, all of which could improve the child&#x02019;s functioning without influencing medication persistence. Regardless of the reason for the observed improvement in clinical symptoms, the results of the present study suggest that further investigations are warranted, particularly those evaluating the effects of psychoeducation on adherence and/or persistence and other outcomes in the longer term.</p><p>Limitations of this study included the slow recruitment process and eventual cessation of recruitment, leading to premature termination of the investigation before the planned sample size was reached. The complexity of the study design and the requirement for a large study population to achieve adequate statistical power were clear confounding factors in under-recruitment and may have contributed to the failure of the study to meet its primary endpoint. Reflecting this, the study was conducted over a prolonged period of almost 2.5 years. For some patients, it is also possible that the 12-month follow-up period was too short to detect any effects of psychoeducation on medication persistence, given that there were several positive indicators (albeit on secondary endpoints) of the benefits of psychoeducation. In addition, the study was not blinded; therefore, the possibility of investigator and informant (parent) assessment bias cannot be discounted. Finally, data on adherence with medication (the extent to which a patient acts in accordance with the prescribed dosing regimen, such as dose, timing, and frequency) were not collected in this study, only data on medication persistence. Likewise, data on mechanistic variables that might explain the usefulness of psychoeducation, such as parental attitudes towards ADHD medication and the child&#x02019;s perception of their medication, were not collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study did not demonstrate a significant advantage for parental psychoeducation plus medication over medication alone on time to withdrawal of medication when administered to parents of children undergoing treatment for newly diagnosed ADHD over a 12-month time period. However, patients with learning difficulties were more likely to discontinue treatment than those without such difficulties. Inconsistent but interesting effects of psychoeducation on other clinical outcomes were recorded and no safety issues were raised. These findings support the further evaluation of psychoeducation for parents of children being treated for ADHD in appropriately controlled trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the participating investigators and the patients and parents who contributed to this investigation.
