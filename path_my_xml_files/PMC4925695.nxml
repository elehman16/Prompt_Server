Quantitative data were collected at pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, and at 3&#x02009;months post-intervention, from December 2012 to June 2014.

A randomization sequence was generated in Microsoft Excel to assign families to the FSI-HIV intervention or to the control group of the trial. Randomization was conducted after baseline assessments. A sample size of 80 families was calculated, assuming 2 eligible respondents per family on average and moderate intra-class (within-family) correlation (approximately 0.5), to yield power of 0.80 to detect a standardized a &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d; effect size of approximately 0.50 in study outcome measures, assuming a standard alpha level of 0.05. Inclusion criteria required at least one caregiver to be HIV-positive and at least one school-aged child (7&#x02013;17&#x02009;years) to be resident within participating households. Caregivers agreed to discuss their HIV status with their children. Caregivers gave informed consent to participate for themselves and for their children. Additionally, children gave oral consent. Children could elect not to participate. A community advisory board was formed to oversee conduct of the study. All study procedures were granted approval by the Rwandan National Ethics Committee and the Harvard School of Public Health&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Intervention</title><p>The FSI-HIV was designed, developed, and tested within families affected by caregiver HIV in Rwanda (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, see footnote text 1). Previously published findings have demonstrated the acceptability and feasibility of FSI-HIV (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The four main aims of the FSI-HIV comprise development of resilience through family narrative, improved parenting and family communication, HIV psychoeducation, and engagement of formal and informal sources of support (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Data about demographics and HIV status of all family members were collected in introductory meetings. Then, trained bachelor-level counselors delivered a series of six core modules within each household. Counselor-led sessions with caregivers (Modules 1, 2, and 4) established the family narrative, discussed the effect of HIV on the family, and identified sources of resilience. Counselor-led sessions with children (Modules 3 and 5) established the family narrative from the children&#x02019;s perspective, provided psychoeducation on HIV, and identified sources of resilience. During the sixth and final module, caregivers led a family meeting and discussed the family&#x02019;s challenges, strengths, and goals (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Controls</title><p>Once enrolled in the study, participating households were randomized to receive the FSI-HIV intervention or care as usual social work. Control households received care as usual social work support through the locally available government-provided social services. This support generally consisted of advice concerning food insecurity and access to schooling. Study outcomes were measured in both FSI-HIV and control households at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Study Outcomes</title><sec id="S2-4-1"><title>Parenting and Family Unity</title><p>Parenting was measured using local and combined parenting scales consisting of a 32-item scale (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91).

Disclosure within a family environment is important to facilitate communication about HIV between family members (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, caregivers often fear negative consequences of disclosure such as being stigmatized or causing distress to their children (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, evidence suggests that caregiver HIV status disclosure conveys psychosocial and clinical benefits for HIV-affected families (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><sec id="S4-1"><title>Parenting</title><p>At the end of the FSI-HIV intervention, family unity and child-reported parenting appeared to decrease in intervention families, with recovery and signs of resolution after the follow-up period (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Trust was a common component to both the family unity and parenting scale scores. This suggests the possible mechanism of disrupted trust between parents and children underlying reduced parenting and family unity scores immediately surrounding the disclosure process. Discordance between caregiver and child-reported parenting may indicate differences between child and caregiver perspectives of relationships during family-based intervention and support of the disclosure process. In particular, while parents were gaining confidence in their parenting skills through the counseling sessions, children were adjusting to the disclosure of their caregivers&#x02019; HIV status. Supported parenting at this time contributed to improved family trust and unity and enhanced child resilience and mental health.</p><p>Increasing numbers of children are being affected by caregiver HIV, due to expansion of ARV programs across sub-Saharan Africa. The family is an important focus for intervention for delivering psychosocial support including child protection (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Prior studies have investigated the impacts of the mediating role of parenting in reducing the impact of caregiver distress on child well-being in HIV-affected families (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Stress on children surrounding the process of HIV status disclosure may be mitigated through supporting parenting <italic>via</italic> family-based intervention (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Parenting competence is defined by caregivers&#x02019; self-efficacy through self-estimation of competence or ability to positively influence the development of their children in their parenting role (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Caregivers with psychological distress lose self-esteem as caregivers or may perceive they lack knowledge and skills to provide a suitable environment in which to care for their children (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). HIV-positive mothers&#x02019; major concern is their perceived inability to provide adequate care to their children when they became ill (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Parenting behaviors, such as the maintenance of daily routines, may protect children when a parent is infected with HIV (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Hence, supporting the parental role, through recognition of its centrality within the family and empowerment of caregivers with a sense of self-efficacy, may be of critical value during HIV status disclosure. Further assisting with parental competences and parental stress management through family-based intervention could contribute toward positive parental coping and reduction of harsh parenting (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that improvement of parenting protects the mental health of children within the family during caregiver HIV status disclosure.</p></sec><sec id="S4-2"><title>Child Mental Health</title><p>Children in HIV-affected families living in situations of compound adversity are more frequently called upon to assume adult roles in response to diminished capacity of caregivers to assume responsibilities. This shift in roles is thought to contribute to a negative series of effects on child mental health (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Burdens on child mental health are exacerbated in situations where there is partial disclosure with a consequent lack of trust within-family relationships and fear of community stigmatization (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Child resilience and mental health were shown to improve over the course of the intervention in FSI-HIV families, when compared with control families (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The effects of HIV status disclosure on child mental health during the trial were potentially mediated <italic>via</italic> parenting, as delineated in the DAG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

There was insufficient evidence to justify repeating the randomization, which is generally reserved for extreme situations. There was insufficient justification to select variables for blocking (other than single- versus dual-caregiver status) prior to randomization.
