The alpha-2 receptor activation results in reduction in norepinephrine release, which can be used therapeutically to induce sympatholysis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine was first marketed for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation, to make use of highly selective adrenergic alpha-2 receptor agonist activity. Unlike commonly used sedatives such as Propofol or Midazolam, Dexmedetomidine produces an &#x0201c;interactive&#x0201d; form of sedation, in which patients can be aroused easily with stimulation, and are cooperative once aroused. Because of its sympatholytic properties, Dexmedetomidine was gradually developed as an anesthetic premedication, with the goal of attenuating the sympathetic response to perioperative stresses such as laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In addition to sedative effects, Dexmedetomidine has been labeled as &#x0201c;analgesia sparing&#x0201d; by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dexmedetomidine when coadministered with opioids has no depressant effects on respiration, but its analgesic effects offer a significant advantage for patients at risk for respiratory decompensation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The metabolic stress response to surgical trauma is characterized by increased serum levels of catecholamines and other steroid hormones.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] If this stress response is of prolonged duration, the hyper-metabolic state can lead on to decreased resistance, delayed ambulation and increased morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Excitation of the hypothalamus during stress results in the secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), which in turn initiates sudden increase in cortisol level. The cortisol mobilizes amino acids and fat from the body stores, and makes them available for synthesis of glucose, thus can cause hyperglycemia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, monitoring blood glucose level can reflect the metabolic stress response to surgery and the effect of Dexmedetomidine in blunting this stress response.</p><p>Several studies have indicated that administration of IV Dexmedetomidine during general anesthesia can decrease the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) of Sevoflurane. Thus a clinical study was conducted to assess the effect of Dexmedetomidine on Sevoflurane consumption.</p><p>The infusion of Dexmedetomidine will not significantly affect the recovery from anesthesia as indicated by time for tracheal extubation.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to observe the effect of intravenous (IV) Dexmedetomidine on levels of blood glucose, which is one among several stress response markers and Sevoflurane requirements under General Anesthesia (GA) for abdominal and abdomino-thoracic surgeries. The secondary goals were to maintain intra- and postoperative hemodynamic stability without affecting the tracheal extubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After obtaining approval from institutional ethical committee, a randomized, prospective, double blind, controlled, clinical study was formulated, and conducted at our hospital during the month of April 2012 to September 2012. By keeping the confidence limits of 95% to detect 20% change in blood glucose levels as primary criteria for a power of 80%, assuming an equal standard deviation in each group, the required sample size was 12 patients. However, for better validation of results we further increased the sample size to 20 in each group. These 40 patients were randomly allocated into two groups as Group &#x02018;D&#x02019; (Dexmedetomidine group) and Group &#x02018;P&#x02019; (Placebo group) using computer generated random numbers.</p><p>Informed written consent was obtained from all patients. The patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, aged 20-60 years, scheduled for elective abdominal surgery under general anesthesia (GA) were included in the study. Diabetic and hypertensive patients, patients on psychoactive medication, history of alcohol or drug abuse, patients receiving &#x003b1;-2 agonists or antagonist treatment, coronary artery disease and heart block were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with tab. Alprazolam 0.5 mg oral, the night before surgery and a minimum fasting state of 6 h before anesthesia was ensured in all patients. The standard monitoring consisted of electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry (SpO2), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), entropy, neuromuscular transmission monitor (NMT) and capnography. Before induction of general anesthesia, an epidural catheter was placed in all patients for the purpose of providing postoperative analgesia. The spectral entropy (SE) was measured with a plug in Datex Ohmeda entropy S/5 module&#x02122;. All patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 min and inj. Midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV, inj. Glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg IV, inj. Fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg IV were administered.</p><p>Group D patients were given an initial dose of inj. Dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg IV made to 20 mL with normal saline, over 10 min. Group C patients received similar volume of normal saline over 10 min. The study drug and placebo infusions were prepared by an anesthesiologist who was not involved in the study and the anesthesiologist recording the details was unaware of the type of infusion patients received. Anesthesia was induced in all the patients with inj. Propofol in successive 30 mg doses every 2 min until Response Entropy (RE) dropped to 50, and confirmed with loss of response to verbal commands. In both the groups, inj. Atracurium 0.5 mg/kg IV was administered, and trachea was intubated after disappearance of train of four twitch response. Additional dose of inj. Propofol 20-30 mg bolus was given if increase in entropy values were observed. A maintenance dose of inj. Dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/hour made to 20 mL with normal saline was administered in group D patients and a similar volume of normal saline was administered in Group P, till the end of surgery. Anesthesia was continued with Sevoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen and ventilated to maintain end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>(EtCO<sub>2</sub>) between 35 and 40 mmHg. Sevoflurane dial concentration was adjusted to ensure adequate depth of general anesthesia to maintain RE levels between 40 and 60 and difference between RE and SE less than 10, and also to maintain clinical variables like HR, NIBP, mean arterial pressure (MAP) within normal limits. Top up doses of Atracurium were guided by NMT monitor. Infusion of Dexmedetomidine was stopped 30 min prior to expected time of completion of surgery. Sevoflurane administration was turned off at the beginning of skin suturing. At the end of the surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with inj. Neostigmine 0.5 mg/kg and inj. Glycopyrrolate 0.005 mg/kg and trachea extubated after satisfactory recovery and presence of response to oral commands. All patients were administered only IV normal saline during study period.</p><p>The age, gender, body weight, duration of surgery (minutes), duration of anesthesia (minutes) were recorded. Serial blood glucose levels from fresh capillary whole blood using glucose test strips were estimated at following points &#x02013; before induction (basal), 30 min after intubation and at one and 6 h after recovery from anesthesia. The total and hourly Sevoflurane requirements were measured at the end of every hour. The usage of Sevoflurane during anesthesia can be calculated as follows.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Dion's Formula:</p><p>Usage of volatile anesthetic (mL) = [Dialed concentration &#x000d7; Total fresh gas flow &#x000d7; Duration at that concentration &#x000d7; Molecular weight]/[2412 &#x000d7; Density].</p><p>Loke's Formula:</p><p>Usage of volatile anesthetic (mL) = [(MAC) (FGF) (60 min) (MW)]/[(Pressure/(R &#x000d7; T))(D)].(FGF - fresh gas flow, MW &#x02013; molecular weight, R &#x02013; ideal gas constant and D - density in g/mL). But the Datex Ohmeda Avance S5 system automatically calculates and displays the usage of anesthetic liquid in mL on real-time basis.</p><p>The Hemodynamic and Entropy parameters were recorded every 5 min throughout intraoperative and postoperative period. The recovery from anesthesia was measured from the time all anesthetics were turned off.
