weight distribution on the feet of patients in the chronic post-stroke phase. [Subjects
and Methods] This study was a prospective, single blind, randomized controlled trial. In
the study we examined patients with chronic stroke (post-stroke duration &#x0003e; 1&#x02005;year).
They were randomly allocated to the study group (n=8) or to the control group (n=12). Both
groups completed a standard six-week rehabilitation programme. In the study group, the
standard rehabilitation programme was supplemented with sensorimotor foot stimulation
training. Each patient underwent two assessments of symmetry of weight distribution on the
lower extremities with and without visual control, on a treadmill, with stabilometry
measurements, and under static conditions. [Results] Only the study group demonstrated a
significant increase in the weight placed on the leg directly affected by stroke, and a
reduction in asymmetry of weight-bearing on the lower extremities. [Conclusion]
Sensorimotor stimulation of the feet enhanced of weight bearing on the foot on the side of
the body directly affected by stroke, and a decreased asymmetry of weight distribution on
the lower extremities of patients in the chronic post-stroke phase.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Sensorimotor foot training</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The rehabilitation of post-stroke patients targets at the performance of functional tasks
and neuromuscular re-education. In 70&#x02013;80% of cases the central goals of physical therapy
management are to restore lost functions and preserve existing functions, and to prevent
their further deterioration<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the greatest challenges faced by physical therapists
is developing an effective procedure for the therapeutic management of patients, especially
with regard to the improvement of balance and deep sensation. The maintenance of balance in
patients over 65&#x02005;years of age is more difficult due to their deterioration of vision,
impaired sensory function, lower muscular strength and extended response time to
destabilizing stimuli.</p><p>One of the crucial elements involved in the maintenance of body balance in the standing
position are the feet. The feet are the first and usually the only point of contact between
the body and the external environment. Proper foot function is ensured by sensory receptors
which are present in great abundance on the plantar surface of the foot, and the motor
system. Relevant information is transferred through feedback mechanisms to higher cognitive
centres, which is followed by the planning of consecutive motor activities. The ability to
maintain a free standing posture with a uniform distribution of weight on both feet is a
prerequisite for more complex motor activities, such as walking, changes of body position
and maintaining or regaining balance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study by Meyer showed that plantar
cutaneous sensation is one of the main factors determining correct postural control under
the eyes-closed conditions<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Messages
transferred from the feet allow continuous control and adjustment of the body&#x02019;s position in
relation to the environment<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other
elements playing a major role in maintaining body balance include the elasticity of soft
tissues (skin) and the mechanics of the foot. In the elderly population, the absence of
compensation in maintaining body balance is a consequence of the loss of skin elasticity and
poor foot mechanics<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was proven that
the weight-bearing symmetry of the feet while walking and standing changes after using foot
stimulation in the form of shoe insoles. That study was conducted on post-stroke
patients<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. It should be added that the
majority of analyzed interventions were supplements to classical physiotherapy procedures.
In many studies the posturographic platform has been used to observe changes in parameters
describing postural stability and the weight-bearing distribution on the feet after a
therapeutic intervention<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gok<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> observed positive changes in the
parameters describing balance and functional performance of patients in the chronic phase
after stroke after conducting training with biofeedback. A therapy oriented towards balance
improvement should, therefore, seek to achieve a uniform weight distribution on both
feet.</p><p>Since the feet play a crucial role in the process of maintaining body balance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, it is our opinion that sensorimotor foot
stimulation (SFS) should be utilised in physiotherapy for post-stroke patients. Sensorimotor
stimulation encompasses a range of therapeutic procedures performed in the immediate foot
region, aimed at improving sensory function and increasing the elasticity of tissues within
the feet. Therefore, the aim of study is to assess the effect of sensorimotor foot
stimulation on the symmetry of weight distribution on the feet in patients in the chronic
post-stroke phase. The hypothesis of this study was that supplementing the process of
rehabilitation by sensorimotor foot stimulation training would markedly increase the weight
placed on the foot directly affected by stroke, and would be more effective at correcting
the disproportionate distribution of weight on both extremities than the standard
rehabilitation regime.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study performed an assessment of the effects of SFS on the symmetry of weight-bearing
on the feet post-stroke patients.Itwas conducted in the rehabilitation department of
rehabilitation hospital in Pozna&#x00144;. The study was planned for the years 2013&#x02013;2015 and was
carried out with the approval of the Bioethics Committee of the University of Medical
Sciences Pozna&#x00144;. During this period a representative group of 80 patients with chronic
stroke in the rehabilitation department will be examined. Since few studies describing the
mechanism of direct stimulation of the foot and its influence on the symmetry of
weight-bearing on the feet and postural stability have been conducted, the present study is
presented as a pilot study, after completing the first year of intervention. A total of 42

preliminary examination. During the study, there were a total of 42 post-stroke patients in
the facility. Fifteen (35.7%) of them were immediately excluded, as they failed to meet the
study inclusion criteria or there were other contra indications to their participation.</p><p>The patients who were enrolled in the study were then randomly assigned to the study group
(SG, n=13) or the control group (CG, n=14). The procedure of randomization was carried out
using 28 unmarked envelopes.</p><p>During the course of the study, five patients from the SG dropped out due to their
unscheduled discharge from the hospital and two patients in the CG were excluded due to
their early discharge from the hospital (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

the facility in which the study was performed, and the Head of the Rehabilitation
Department. All the patients gave their consent to participation in the trial.</p><p>All the patients [SG and CG] with a history of ischaemic cerebral stroke who met the trial
inclusion criteria received a standard six-week therapeutic rehabilitation programme. SFS
was an additional element of the programme for the the SG only.</p><p>The standard programme of therapeutic rehabilitation comprised the following
components:</p><p>- individual therapy with a physical therapist (45-minute sessions in the CG five times a
week; 30-minute sessions in the SG five times a week + 15-minute SFS) based on Neuro
Development Treatment Bobath (NDT), prioprioreceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) and
other recognized physical rehabilitation concepts;</p><p>- other kinesitherapeutic procedures (45-minute sessions twice a day, five times a week for
both groups). The module of kinesitherapeutic procedures encompassed active non-weight
bearing exercises, active resistance exercises, treadmill walking, pedalling exercises for
upper and lower extremities on a cycloergometer, walking exercises and others. A total of
six kinesitherapeutic procedures were recommended.</p><p>- two physical therapy procedures five times a week.</p><p>All the physical therapy procedures were prescribed by the attending physician, a
specialist in motor rehabilitation.</p><p>The sensorimotor training programme consisted of 25 sessions of 20 minutes each.</p><p>Every session had the same structure, including preparation of the foot for weight bearing,
repetition of the key exercises practised during the previous therapeutic session, and the
main therapeutic intervention.</p><p>The daily schedule of therapeutic interventions:</p><p>Days 1&#x02013;3: improving elasticity of soft tissues in the tarsal joint and the foot,</p><p>Days 4&#x02013;9: facilitating and improving sensory function in the foot area,</p><p>Days 10&#x02013;13: learning and refining selective movements in the tarsal joint,</p><p>Days 14&#x02013;18: learning and improving symmetrical weight distribution on both feet during
rising to the standing position and in the standing posture with and without visual
control,</p><p>Days 19&#x02013;25: learning and improving symmetrical load distribution on both feet during rising
to the standing position and while standing on surfaces having different textures.</p><p>The main objectives of the underlying training were:</p><p>1) improving the elasticity of soft tissues in the tarsal joint and the foot by stroking,
rubbing, and scratching the dorsal and plantar surfaces of the foot in a predetermined
sequence and direction;</p><p>2) facilitating and improving the sensory function in the foot region, by using objects
with various facture and temperature with visual control;</p><p>3) learning and refining selective movements in the tarsal joint by patient&#x02019;s observations
of the foot and repetition of commands after stimulating the muscles to contract;</p><p>4) learning and improving symmetrical weight distribution on both feet during rising to the
standing position and in the standing posture with and without visual control; and</p><p>5) learning and improving symmetrical load distribution on both feet during rising to the
standing position and while standing on surfaces of different textures.</p><p>All the measurements and tests were performed by an experienced physical therapist, in a
quiet and peaceful location. The functional evaluation of the patients was conducted on the
first and the last day of their stay in the rehabilitation facility. The physical therapist
who performed the functional evaluation was not aware of the assignment of patients to the
respective trial groups.</p><p>Weight distribution on the feet was assessed using the Zebris FDM-TDL treadmill with Win
FDM-T software and a stance analysis module<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The device has an integrated matrix of 5,376 pressure sensors,
which form a measuring surface with a length of 94.8&#x02005;cm and a width of 40.6&#x02005;cm. The force
measurement range is 1&#x02013;100 N/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the signal sampling frequency is 100&#x02005;Hz.
The test was performed in silence, since auditory stimuli are known to interfere with
postural reflexes<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the
measurements, the patients stood on the platform barefoot, with their feet rotated outwards
(at a 14-degree angle), and by their the heels 4&#x02005;cm apart and aligned. The patients assumed
and maintained the standing posture with their arms sides and the head in the natural
position for 30 seconds<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A total of 10 measurements were performed. For the initial five measurements the patients
had their eyes open (EO), and for the next five measurements they were requested to close
them (eyes closed, EC). Each patients received the same verbal instructions during the
tests. The patient were told to stay still until hearing the next verbal instruction. During
the test performed under the EO condition, the patient&#x02019;s eyes were focused on a reference
point located on a wall 1&#x02005;m in front of them. After each measurement the patient was
requested to step off the treadmill, so that calibration could be performed<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Throughout the entire duration of the
tests the operator stood behind the patient.</p><p>A trial was not taken into account in the case of an unexpected loss of balance, sneezing
or moving, etc. The trial was repeated once. The study was discontinued and the patient was
excluded from further procedure in the case of having to repeat the trial &#x0003e; 1. The aim of
the test was to assess the difference in weight distribution on the right and left foot
under static conditions.</p><p>Student t-test was performed to compare the mean values of the characteristics determined
on different dates, and the mean increases in the value of different characteristics between
consecutive dates. Since the study groups were small, a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon
matched-pairs test) was also used</p><p>Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the significance of the differences found between

post-stroke patients<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is necessary
to constantly search for new methods of rehabilitating patients with a history of stroke,
and examine the effectiveness of such methods. Our present study highlights the need of
conducting high-quality studies using large homogeneous groups in the field of active
stimulation.</p><p>An earlier study by Forghany et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>
showed that an abnormal or asymmetrical foot posture was observed in a minority of stroke
patients. The present study found there was considerable asymmetry of weight distribution on
the feet both in the study group and in the control group, even after completing the
rehabilitation programme. It was also demonstrated that sensorimotor training of the foot
can contribute to increasing the weight distribution on the foot affected by the stroke
reducing the weight-bearing imbalance between the legs, under static conditions.</p><p>The sensorimotor foot stimulation (SFS) was a training item complementing a comprehensive
rehabilitation programme based on highly specialized physical therapy procedures. In
addition to the comprehensive rehabilitation programme carried out in the hospital, SFS
provided the additional beneficial effect of reducing the asymmetry of weight distribution
on the feet of post-stroke patients.</p><p>The physical exercise prescribed for the patients was instrumental in the increasing the
force with exerted by the DL foot pressed on the ground. The initially disproportionate
distribution of weight on both extremities was found to have decreased both under the
eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, which demonstrates there was an improvement in the
proprioceptive sense of the foot. It seems that our proposed method was more effective than
the sensory stimulation of the feet reported by Lynch et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, who assessed the effects of the sensory retraining protocol
involving the discrimination of different textures, sensation, postural control and gait.
Our proposed method also appears more effective than the passive exercise regime based on a
portable device discussed by Rudwig et al<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. There were no significant differences between the study groups in
the two studies.</p><p>Another line of research focuses on the assessment of a variety of physical therapeutic
modalities applied in the foot region, and their effects on postural stability and the
body&#x02019;s centre of gravity. Chen et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>
assessed the outcomes of thermal stimulation on the motor and balance functions of
post-stroke patients. They showed thermal stimulation had positive impact on the motor
function of the affected leg and on body balance. In the study by Magnusson et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, patients in the treatment group received
galvanic stimulation and sensory stimulation based on traditional Chinese acupressure. They
demonstrated there was an enhancement of postural function and quality of daily life, which
was maintained after more than two years after stroke.</p><p>Until now no studies have focused focusing specifically on the effects of sensorimotor foot
stimulation on the symmetry of weight distribution on the feet of stroke patients. However,
it is worthwhile to mention studies investigating the importance of the plantar surface of
the foot and its role in postural stability in groups of healthy individuals. Kavounoudias
et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> showed the importance of the
foot sole in correcting irregularities between body posture and body balance. Plantar skin,
together with other senses, enables control and planning of body posture by the central
nervous system. The experiment involved the stimulation of the mechanoreceptors in the foot
with vibrations of high frequency and amplitude. Nurse et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated the contribution of sensory feedback from the feet to
body posture maintenance, and the importance of sensory stimulation for the activity of
muscles during gait. These studies were based on the exposure of the plantar surface of the
foot and lower leg muscles to cold (ice).</p><p>In post-stroke patients, most studies have focused on forms of rehabilitation which have a
direct influence on the maintenance of balance. Srivastava et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> examined a larger group of 45 patients aged 22&#x02013;65. They
demonstrated there was a beneficial effect of training based on visual feedback using the
Biodex Balance Master on the sense of balance. Tyson et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> studied a total of 29 stroke patients aged 28&#x02013;82. A major
improvement in the parameters defining the speed of gait, balance and the force of plantar
flexion was noted after TENS stimulation. The studies discussed above were notable for the
large age ranges of their participants.</p><p>The participants of our study were aged 51&#x02013;80. Thus, the age range of our study group were
quite homogeneous compared to these earlier studies.</p><p>Another strong point of our study was the fact that we selected a group of patients in the
chronic, but quite narrow, period following the stroke episode (more than a year; mean:
4.2&#x02005;years; range: 1&#x02013;9&#x02005;years). This fact may facilitate future comparisons, e.g. focusing on
the outcomes of sensorimotor foot stimulation in the acute phase of the disease in contrast
to the chronic phase. In the study by Geiger et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, 13 outpatients with hemiplegia whose age ranged from 30 to
77&#x02005;years were examined. The subjectswere 15 to 538 days post-stroke, which means that they
included both patients in the acute and chronic post-stroke stages. Harris et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> studied a group of 99 patients aged 50&#x02013;93,
who were 1 to 24&#x02005;years post-stroke. A question thus arises whether such a large age span &#x02212;
and an even greater divergence in the post-stroke periods under analysis &#x02212; may be a
limitation affecting the conclusions drawn from the studies.</p><p>The present study provides valuable insights into the rehabilitation of patients in the
chronic post-stroke phase. Nevertheless, it also had certain limitations, such as the small
number of participants and the lack of functional tests to verify the impact of therapeutic
interventions on daily activities; therefore, it should be treated as a pilot study.
Attempts should be made in the future to conduct studies of larger numbers of subjects.
These two items definitely warrant further investigation in future studies on sensorimotor
foot training.</p><p>Our present study proved the validity of the therapeutic modality used. Thus, the problem
under study, i.e. the assessment of the effects of sensorimotor foot training on the
symmetry of weight distribution on the lower extremities, seems a legitimate research
effort. A more even weight distribution enhances the potential for balance control in the
standing position in patients aged between 54 and 80.</p><p>Finally it is in our opinion that sensorimotor stimulation of the feet of thepatients in
the chronic post-stroke phase elicited an increase in the load on the side of the body
directly affected by stroke, and a decrease in weight distribution asymmetry between the
feet in the standing position, with their eyes both open and closed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Mossakowska</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Wi&#x00119;cek</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>B&#x00142;&#x00119;dowski</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>: Aspekty medyczne, psychologiczne, socjalne i ekonomiczne starzenia si&#x00119;
