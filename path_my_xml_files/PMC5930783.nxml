The mechanisms underpinning these effects are not fully understood. One theory proposes that during long distance running, eccentric muscle actions disrupt muscle fibres and this disruption causes: (i) a loss of force and (ii) a secondary inflammatory response that produces the symptoms of DOMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Metabolic stress encountered during long distance running may also contribute to producing the symptoms of muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Because inflammation and DOMS may impact on performance and the ability to train, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is common among endurance athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although, NSAIDs may reduce inflammation and pain, their use is associated with a range of adverse effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal and vascular problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. NSAIDs may also interfere with the adaptive response to training, at least in young athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Consequently, there is interest in identifying alternative approaches to reducing inflammation and promoting recovery.</p><p id="Par25">Plant derived polyphenols exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and emerging evidence suggests they can reduce exercise-induced inflammation and soreness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

In cultured human colonic epithelial cells, extracts of bilberry inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory action of bilberries has also been confirmed in human intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Karlsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] reported that in adults at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, the consumption of 330&#x000a0;ml/d of bilberry juice (BJ) for 4&#x000a0;weeks reduced the concentrations of a range of markers of inflammation. Similarly, in adults with features of metabolic syndrome, the consumption of 400&#x000a0;g/d of whole bilberries for 8&#x000a0;weeks reduced an index of inflammation calculated from the sum of the Z scores for hsCRP, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12 and lipopolysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Collectively, these results indicate that bilberries exert anti-inflammatory actions. So, this study was conducted to determine whether supplementation of the diet with BJ would reduce inflammation and associated muscle soreness in recreationally trained runners completing a half marathon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par27">A total of 21 recreationally trained runners (male <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16; female <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) that had signed up to complete the 2013 Sheffield Half Marathon were recruited to an intervention study to determine whether BJ reduced post-exercise muscle damage, inflammation and soreness. The runners were recruited through personal contacts and targeted emails to running and triathlon clubs. Runners with a self-predicted finishing time of over 2&#x000a0;h were excluded. All participants completed health screening and physical activity readiness questionnaires to check for the presence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, gastrointestinal problems, musculoskeletal injuries and food allergies. Participants also provided details of the length of time they had been running and the number of half and/or full marathons they had finished.

Test drinks (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;200&#x000a0;ml servings/d) were consumed for 5&#x000a0;days prior to the Sheffield Half Marathon, on the day of competition and for two days post-race. Participants were instructed to drink one serving of their test drink with breakfast and one with their evening meal. At baseline, pre-race, post-race, 1 d post-race and 2 d post-race muscle soreness was assessed and capillary blood samples were collected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). On race day, capillary blood samples and assessments of muscle soreness were collected at the race venue. Blood samples were then stored in a refrigerator in a motorhome before being transferred to the laboratory for processing. At other time points, samples were collected in the laboratory or at the homes of participants. All samples collected off-site were stored on ice for transportation to the laboratory. Except on race day, all samples were collected within a 4&#x000a0;h time window between 4&#x000a0;pm and 8&#x000a0;pm to suit the participants&#x02019; availability. For the duration of the study, participants completed a food diary. Participants were asked to avoid taking anti-inflammatory medication and antioxidant supplements during the study.

This suggests that in recreationally trained runners, a half-marathon is an appropriate exercise challenge for investigating the effect of a dietary intervention on protection against EIMD and promotion of recovery.</p><p id="Par44">Immediately after the race, there was evidence of a <italic>possibly harmful</italic> effect of BJ on DOMS in comparison to PLA. The <italic>possibly harmful</italic> effect of BJ on post-race DOMS was mirrored by a <italic>likely harmful</italic> effect on CRP at 24&#x000a0;h post-race and a <italic>possibly harmful</italic> effect at 48&#x000a0;h post-race. This dual rise in DOMS and CRP indicates that runners consuming the BJ may have suffered more muscle damage during the half-marathon than those consuming the energy-matched PLA drink, although this was not reflected by a clear difference between groups in the change in CK from pre-race to any time point post-race. The lack of a clear difference in CK between groups may be partly explained by the large differences in CK response among our runners and the small sample size. Large inter-individual variability in the release of CK from muscles in response to protocols designed to induce muscle damage has been widely reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, evidence indicates that the degree of elevation in circulating CK may not directly correlate with the extent of muscle damage or loss of force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, circulating CK may not be a particularly sensitive marker for detecting small differences between individuals in the extent of muscle damage.</p><p id="Par45">Our findings of a small, <italic>possibly harmful</italic> increase in DOMS immediately post-race and a <italic>likely harmful</italic> moderate increase in CRP at 24&#x000a0;h post-race were unexpected, because we originally hypothesised that the polyphenols in BJ would exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and possibly protect muscles against soreness. To our knowledge no other studies have reported on the effects of BJ on EIMD, however, our results contrast with evidence that juice and extracts of tart cherry protect against inflammation induced by long distance running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], intermittent running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and high intensity cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The effect of tart cherry beverages/supplements on DOMS is mixed with some studies reporting no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and others reporting a reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], although we are unaware of any studies that have reported an increase. The disagreement between our study and the studies of tart cherry is difficult to explain, but could reflect differences in the quantity and type of polyphenols present in the juices. In-house analysis of the BJ revealed that our dosing strategy seemed to supply greater quantities of total phenols (&#x02248;1500&#x000a0;mg/d) and anthocyanins (&#x02248;160&#x000a0;mg/d) than the tart cherry supplementation studies in runners (ranges reported in the literature; total phenols 991&#x02013;1200&#x000a0;mg/d; total anthocyanin 66&#x02013;80&#x000a0;mg/d) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although, we originally hypothesised that a high intake of polyphenols might protect against exercise-induced inflammation and soreness, it is not inconceivable that it could produce the opposite effect. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by exercising muscles has been proposed to act as a brake on muscle contraction thereby limiting muscle damage during prolonged periods of contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. BJ polyphenols may have enhanced intramuscular antioxidant protection to the extent that it reduced the braking effect of ROS on muscle contraction thus enabling the participants to run harder, but at the expense of generating more muscle damage, soreness and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We are unaware of any studies reporting improved performance coupled with increases in markers of soreness or inflammation in response to supplementation with polyphenols, however, Cobley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] found that acute supplementation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine improved performance, but elevated muscle damage in recreationally trained runners completing the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test after a muscle damaging intermittent shuttle run test. Unexpected effects of antioxidant micronutrients on muscle recovery have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Close et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] found that supplementation with 1&#x000a0;g of ascorbic acid 2&#x000a0;h before and daily for 14&#x000a0;days after downhill running delayed the recovery of muscle function.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par46">This study has several limitations. First, we did not measure any functional markers of muscle strength, thus it is impossible to determine whether the small increase in DOMS and moderate increase in CRP that we observed resulted in a greater loss of muscle force or slower recovery of muscle strength. Second, the timing of the assessment of muscle soreness after the race varied slightly between runners because they had to make their way through a busy finishing area to our mobile laboratory for assessment. It is possible that this small variation in time lapse (approximately 5&#x000a0;min) may have influenced the post-race assessment of DOMS. Third, we only followed our participants for 2&#x000a0;days after the half marathon. Whilst this is consistent with two studies of tart cherry and long distance running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], it is possible that 2&#x000a0;days may have been insufficient to fully capture the effects of BJ on CRP and CK both of which had not returned to pre-race levels at the end of the study. Fourth, except for prohibiting the use of antioxidant vitamins and NSAIDs, we placed no restrictions on the diet of our participants. We asked participants to complete a food diary for the duration of the race, but a number in both groups failed to complete their diaries so we were unable to accurately assess whether runners in either group changed their diet in any way that may have substantially influenced our results. It is possible that standardising the diets of the participants and restricting their intake of foods rich in polyphenols may have enhanced our ability to detect more effects of the BJ intervention. Fifth, the use of capillary blood sampling techniques limited the number of biomarkers that we could measure. The collection of larger blood samples would have enabled us to measure a more comprehensive battery of inflammatory markers and a range of markers of oxidative stress, which may have proved informative. Sixth, we adjusted the effects of our intervention for body mass, but this may not have adequately accounted for differences in lean and fat mass, which could have contributed to the observed effects. Finally, whilst our sample size was similar to comparable studies, the statistical analysis revealed a number of <italic>unclear</italic> outcomes indicating that a greater sample size was needed to increase the precision of our estimates of treatment effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par47">The present study provides preliminary evidence that consuming BJ for 5&#x000a0;days before and 2&#x000a0;days after a half-marathon may evoke small to moderate transient increases in muscle soreness and inflammation in recreationally trained runners. Our surprising results require confirmation in a larger study, which should also determine whether the transient detrimental changes we observed result in adverse functional changes in muscle strength and recovery.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BJ</term><def><p id="Par5">Bilberry juice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par6">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CK</term><def><p id="Par8">Creatine kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par9">C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CV</term><def><p id="Par10">Correlation co-efficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOMS</term><def><p id="Par11">Delayed onset muscle soreness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EIMD</term><def><p id="Par12">Exercise-induced muscle damage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ES</term><def><p id="Par13">Effect size</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>g</term><def><p id="Par14">Gravitational force</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par15">Interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>kg</term><def><p id="Par16">Kilograms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mg</term><def><p id="Par17">Milligrams</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mmHg</term><def><p id="Par18">Millimetres of mercury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mph</term><def><p id="Par19">Miles per hour</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAIDs</term><def><p id="Par20">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PLA</term><def><p id="Par21">Placebo</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROS</term><def><p id="Par22">Reactive oxygen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par23">Standard deviation <bold>y</bold>: Years</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the participants for taking part in the study and Chris Trueman for assistance with the preparation of the placebo drinks.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Ethics approval and consent</title><p id="Par48">The study was approved by the Faculty Ethics Committee of Sheffield Business School, Sheffield Hallam University, UK (ref number SBSREC1213/13).
