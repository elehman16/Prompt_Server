The recruitment criteria included age (10&#x02013;13 years), no pain, injury or musculoskeletal disorder throughout the previous year, physical activity limited to school sport. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: (1) post-isometric relaxation &#x02013; PIR (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40), (2) static stretch combined with stabilizing exercises &#x02013; SS (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40) and (3) stabilizing exercises &#x02013; SE (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40). Hamstring flexibility was assessed with straight leg raise (SLR), popliteal angle (PA) and finger-to-floor (FTF) tests. The examinations were conducted by blinded observers twice, prior to the program and a week after the last session with the physiotherapist. Twenty-six children who did not participate in all six exercise sessions with physiotherapists were excluded from the analysis. The results obtained by 94 children were analyzed (PIR, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;32; SS, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;31; SE, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;31). In the PIR and SS groups, a significant (P&#x0003c;0.01) increase in SLR, PA, FTF results was observed. In the SE group, a significant (P&#x0003c;0.001) increase was observed in the SLR but not in the PA and FTF (P&#x0003e;0.05). SLR result in the PIR and SS groups was significantly (P&#x0003c;0.001) higher than in the SE group. As far as PA results are concerned, a significant difference was observed only between the SS and SE groups (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.014). There were no significant (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.15) differences regarding FTF results between the three groups. Post-isometric muscle relaxation and static stretch with stabilizing exercises led to a similar increase in hamstring flexibility and trunk forward bend in healthy 10&#x02013;13-year-old children. The exercises limited to straightening gluteus maximus improved the SLR result, but did not change the PA and FTF results.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reduced hamstring flexibility is a common clinical finding in adolescents <xref rid="pone.0072026-Brodersen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072026-Harreby1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072026-Milne1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

The aim of this technique is to inhibit hyperactive muscles by using nervous system reaction to elongate the muscles and to activate inhibited stabilizing muscles <xref rid="pone.0072026-Mottram1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072026-Sahrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>During rehabilitation programs as well as physical education lessons various exercises affecting gluteus maximus are applied <xref rid="pone.0072026-Mottram1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072026-Solberg1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

However, Wagner et al. <xref rid="pone.0072026-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> observed that a rehabilitation program focusing on improving strength and neuromuscular control of the gluteus maximus resulted in a decrease in hamstring activation and led to improving its flexibility. Sewall and Micheli <xref rid="pone.0072026-Sewall1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> noted a slight increase in hip joint range of flexion in prepubertal children participating in a progressive resistive strength training.

In turn, Magnusson et al. <xref rid="pone.0072026-Magnusson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> found that in 10 males the implementation of an isometric contraction before the stretching phase led to a greater improvement in popliteal angle compared to passive stretching only. However, it is worth noting that Feland et al. <xref rid="pone.0072026-Feland1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, Yuktasir and Kaya <xref rid="pone.0072026-Yuktasir1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> as well as Magnusson et al. <xref rid="pone.0072026-Magnusson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, concentrated their studies on the adult populations and did not supplement static stretching with exercises aimed at gluteus maximus strengthening, as it was done in this study. Therefore, a caution is advised while directly comparing these results with the results of the present study.</p><p>As far as we know, the influence of exercises aiming at strengthening gluteus maximus on the change in hamstring flexibility in children has not been assessed yet. We find it interesting that exercises involving daily activation of gluteus maximus exclusively (SE group) resulted in a significant increase in the SLR result. This observation might support the theory of Mottram and Comerford <xref rid="pone.0072026-Mottram1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> as well as Richardson et al. <xref rid="pone.0072026-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072026-Richardson2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> that increasing the activity of muscles responsible for stabilization (e.g. gluteus maximus) leads to an inhibition of global muscles (e.g. hamstring muscles). Wagner et al. confirmed that the training concentrating on gluteus maximus strength leads to an increase in hamstring length <xref rid="pone.0072026-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, these authors analyzed adult males with exercise-associated muscle cramping <xref rid="pone.0072026-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, in the present study no positive influence of these exercises was noted in the PA and the FTF tests. The presumed reason might be the fact that in the PIR and SS groups exercises may have increased the flexibility of other muscles (e.g. gastrocnemius), which might have influenced the results of the PA and the FTF. Another reason might be that the stabilizing exercises may not be as effective in increasing the flexibility of muscles as the exercises including stretching techniques. In our opinion, the results of the present study, which indicate that limiting to stabilizing exercises may be to a certain extent effective in increasing hamstring flexibility, could be the basis for carrying out further studies evaluating the influence of various types of stabilizing exercises on hamstring and other muscles flexibility.</p><p>Although the observers used the same instructions and guidelines, some children needed more instructions and assistance to perform exercises correctly. We believe that it did not influence the results significantly because the likelihood that children demanding more assistance were present in a given group was the same for all groups. A similar opinion was presented by Schuback et al. <xref rid="pone.0072026-Schuback1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. For the same reason, different levels of engagement in performing home exercises might also prove insignificant.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A 6-week training of post-isometric muscle relaxation and static stretch with stabilizing exercises exerted a similar influence on increasing hamstring flexibility and trunk forward bend in healthy 10- to 13-year-old children, as expressed by the improvement in the straight leg raise, popliteal angle and finger-to-floor test results.</p><p>The exercises limited to the straightening of gluteus maximus resulted in a significant increase in the SLR test result, but not PA or FTF test results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The author wishes to thank the physiotherapists from the Center of Body Posture in Olsztyn for the assistance in conducting the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0072026-Brodersen1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
