To evaluate a decentralized GDM detection and management approach through the primary health care level in Morocco, we are conducting a hybrid effectiveness-implementation research using a cluster randomized controlled trial design in two districts. In each district, 10 health centers were randomly selected with half of them serving as intervention and half as control facilities. In the intervention arm, women attending antenatal care will be screened for GDM and women positively tested will receive nutritional counselling and follow up through their health centers. In the control facilities, screening and initial management of GDM will apply standard practice. Birthweight of newborns of women with GDM will be compared between both groups and the prevalence of GDM at health center level assessed. We will further explore the quality of life and the care experienced by the women in both arms through a structured survey. In focus group discussions with providers we will explore and evaluate the feasibility of the intervention at primary level and its adoption by the health care professionals.</p><p>The findings of this study will be used to inform national stakeholders and are expected to contribute to an adaptation of the current strategy of detection and management of GDM in Morocco.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p>In Morocco, a country with a total population of 33.8 million, an estimated 1.67 million people suffer from diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With a current prevalence of diabetes in Morocco of 7.7%, this number is expected to double in the next 20&#x000a0;years. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] Women of childbearing age are not exempted from this development and alone in the MENA region, 3.7 million babies are born to mothers affected by gestational or pre-existing diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM) in Morocco is estimated to range between 8.2 and 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These figures originate from prevalence studies conducted at two university hospitals, but prevalence rates at lower levels of care are yet unknown. While Morocco has made considerable progress in lowering maternal mortality in the past decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], there is now an increased focus on maternal morbidity, including the effects of non-communicable diseases such as gestational diabetes on maternal and neonatal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Recommendations of high risk pregnancy management including the detection of GDM are available in Morocco and a fasting blood glucose test is routinely recommended to screen for diabetes during antenatal care (ANC). However, a situation analysis indicated that GDM screening is facing various obstacles particularly at the primary level of care. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] These include gaps in provider knowledge, delays related to blood testing or to specialist referral. Oral glucose tolerance tests are not routinely prescribed unless on specific request. These delays in the detection and treatment of GDM impinge a timely management of affected women who as a result may end up with complications that could have been prevented. The detection and initial management of GDM during ANC through the first level of care could be an appropriate approach to establish timely interventions. However, it is uncertain if such a strategy would be feasible in the context of the Moroccan public health sector. To close this knowledge gap, the study presented in this protocol aims at implementing and evaluating GDM screening and follow up through first line health care services in Morocco.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>We opted for a hybrid effectiveness-implementation research using a cluster randomized controlled trial design. This design allows to evaluate both clinical effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its implementation at the first level of care guided by its potential for national scaling up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study setting</title><p>The proposed study will take place in the region of Marrakech-Safi, a region with poor maternal health indicators and one of the priority regions of the Moroccan Ministry of Health. The two study districts Marrakech and Al Haouz, where we already conducted a situational analysis on GDM in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], have been selected for the strategy implementation. Marrakech is essentially urban whereas Al Haouz is a rural mountainous district with difficult geographical access to services. Together, the districts have a total population of 1.9 million with 92 public health centres and 53 dispensaries providing primary health care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Unit of randomization</title><p>The unit of randomization will be the health center (cluster). Cluster randomization rather than individual randomization will be applied to limit contamination between the different arms. In each of the two districts we will randomly select 10 health centers with at least 30 or more antenatal care consultations a month. Of these 10 health centers in each district, 5 are being randomized into the intervention group and 5 health centers serve as controls. As simple random selection does not account for contiguity, adjustments for &#x0201c;inter-cluster&#x0201d; effects will be done in the analysis stage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Population and sample size</title><p>All pregnant women attending ANC will be eligible to participate in the study. Pregnant women with a known diabetes type 1 or 2 will be excluded from participation. In each health center, at least eight women diagnosed with gestational diabetes will be identified and followed up during their pregnancies and up to eight weeks post-partum. The sample size of minimum eight women per cluster was calculated based on the assumption that neonatal birth weight will differ in both groups with lower birthweights in the intervention arm due to earlier screening and treatment initiation at health center level. Based on comparisons of birthweight in treated versus untreated mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], for the assumption of a weight difference of 300&#x000a0;g between intervention and control group, a power of 80%, an alpha of 0.05 and an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.1, we require 75 women with GDM in each arm.</p><p>A subsample of four women per district and arm will be selected for in-depth interviews based on the their educational level (&#x02264;primary / &#x02265;secondary); and distance from the health center (&#x0003c;30&#x000a0;min / &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;h). Furthermore, the health care providers from both intervention and control facilities who are involved in GDM detection and management will be requested to participate in a focus group discussion (2 FGDs per district).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p>In the intervention facilities, all women attending ANC will be offered a fasting glucose test at their first ANC visit and a 75&#x000a0;g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) if they are between 24 and 28&#x000a0;weeks pregnant. Tests will be done directly at the health center by capillary glucose testing using a standard plasma-calibrated glucometer. This corresponds to the latest consensus recommendations of FIGO for settings where no laboratories are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Women who are being diagnosed with gestational diabetes in the intervention facilities will receive nutritional counselling to start first a nutritional therapy combined with regular exercise for the duration of two weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Standardization of nutritional counselling will be supported by an initial training of intervention site providers on nutritional education and accompanied by a nutritional guideline and a patient brochure for GDM in French and Arabic developed by the Moroccan Ministry of Health. In case dietary measures will not be sufficient to control glucose values within two weeks, women will be referred to an endocrinologist for further management. Follow-up will be assured through the health centers in close collaboration with the public endocrinologists. To standardize the procedure of screening, initial management and follow-up in the intervention facilities, study algorithms that are based on both nationally and internationally recommended glycaemia thresholds for GDM testing and monitoring have been developed in consultation with the national research group on GDM and regional endocrinologists at referral level (for algorithms see Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The health care facilities that act as controls will screen for gestational diabetes and manage affected women according to their usual practice in accordance with existing national guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>GDM screening algorithm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12978_2017_336_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

</p><p>In each district two focus group discussions with up to two providers will be conducted separately for intervention and for control facilities to explore more in-depth their perceptions and experiences with GDM detection and management. Furthermore, we will conduct in-depth interviews with a subsample of 16 women participating in this study (see sample size) to get more insight how they experienced their pregnancy and the care received. In-depth interviews with key informants such as specialists at referral level as well as national and regional maternal and newborn health programme managers on their views of the intervention, its integration into the existing system and potential for scaling up will complement the picture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Quantitative data will be double entered into a pre-formatted excel file by the research assistants and converted into STATA Version 13 for further statistical analysis. The analysis will be applied on all recruited women following the intention-to-treat principle. Comparison of categorical variables will be done by using the chi-square/ Fisher&#x02019;s exact test while continuous variables will be analyzed by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Regression analysis will be applied to assess the relationship between the primary outcome birthweight and maternal determinants.</p><p>Qualitative data collection includes interviews with key informants, a sample of pregnant mothers and focus group discussions with providers. The recordings will be translated (those conducted in Arabic or Berber) and transcribed verbatim, followed by a thematic content analysis. Two independent researchers will code the data using NVIVO Version 11. Codes will then be grouped into categories and findings charted into a framework matrix.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Study management</title><p>A study advisory committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Health (Population Directorate, Directorate of Epidemiology and Disease Control), the National School of Public Health and of Senior Consultants including the specialties Obstetrics, Neonatology and Endocrinology will be established and meet on a quarterly basis. There will be monthly encounters between principal investigators, local study coordinators and research assistants to supervise the health care facilities, discuss the progress of the study and monitor recruitment and follow up of participants. Adverse events will be closely followed-up and any unforeseen incidents reported to the advisory committee to take appropriate measures. Implementing partners at regional and district levels are the regional and both district medical officers. A local coordinator in each district will oversee the activities and assure monthly monitoring of the study sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data protection</title><p>The collected data will be kept under lock and key. Entered data will be stored in a password protected database. Throughout the trial, all patient and interview data will be handled confidential. Only the investigators will have access to the database.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>Gestational diabetes screening and its initial management are fragmented in Morocco. Although general practitioners at health centers manage diabetic patients, the treatment of gestational diabetes is often reserved for specialists implying difficulties in access to higher levels of care and treatment delays. Implementation of a strategy that enables the primary health care sector to detect, initiate treatment and follow-up affected women has the potential to improve access to care, timely management and reduce obstetric and neonatal complications. The implication of the Moroccan Ministry of Health in the design and conduct of the study will be pivotal for the decision of a future scaling up. Although such a decision will be guided by acceptance, feasibility and clinical outcomes, the financial consequences cannot be omitted. Therefore an economic evaluation of the intervention is envisaged.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANC</term><def><p>Antenatal Care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GA</term><def><p>Gestational Age</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GDM</term><def><p>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OGTT</term><def><p>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Health in particular Laila Acharai and her team at the Division for the Protection of Maternal and Newborn Health for their dedication in the development of the nutritional guidelines that pathed the way for the implementation of this protocol.
