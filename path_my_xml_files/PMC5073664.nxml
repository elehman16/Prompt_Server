However, routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines could aid in reducing the incidence of IPDs. The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the non-inferiority of the investigational 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) to the currently licensed 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>1040 infants will receive a three-dose series of either PCV13 or PCV7 at ages 3, 4 and 5&#x02005;months, respectively, and a booster dose at 12&#x02013;15&#x02005;months. Primary end points are the percentage of participants reaching a serotype-specific IgG concentration of &#x02265;0.35&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL and the IgG antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) measured 30&#x02005;days after the primary immunisation. Secondary end points include the percentage of vaccine recipients reaching a serotype-specific IgG concentration threshold of 1.0&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL, the percentage of participants reaching the pneumococcal opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) titre threshold of 1:8, and the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of OPA measured 30&#x02005;days after primary and booster doses. The number of standard IgG responders and IgG GMCs measured 30&#x02005;days after the booster immunisation will also be determined. To evaluate differences between two groups, the sequential testing of the non-inferiority of PCV13 for the seven common serotypes and its effectiveness in treating the six additional serotypes will be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approvals have been granted by the Ethics Committees at the three provinces involved in this study: Shanxi, Henan and Hebei.

According to a WHO investigation in 2005, an estimated 0.7 to 1 million children under the age of 5&#x02005;years die from pneumonia every year, most of whom lived in developing countries.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The top 10 countries with the highest number of reported pneumococcal cases were all in Asia and Africa, with China accounting for 12% of the total.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Immunisation against Hib, pneumococcus, measles and pertussis is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Routine use of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) attributable to pneumococcal serotypes contained in the vaccine.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, there is still an urgent need for a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with expanded coverage for IPD resulting from serotypes not included in PCV7.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>On 24 February 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration licensed a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for children from 2&#x02005;months to 5&#x02005;years of age. Since then, several studies have been conducted on PCV13 in many countries except China. The licensed PCV13 has been shown to be as effective as PCV7 in the prevention of disease caused by the seven common serotypes and could provide expanded protection against the six additional serotypes with a comparable safety profile.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> When coadministered with diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), PCV13 is well tolerated and as immunogenic as PCV7.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The flexible primary immunisation schedules of PCV13 for infants found no significant differences in antibody levels for almost all serotypes after the booster dose at 12&#x02005;months of age<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and is thus recommended by the WHO.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Furthermore, the clinical efficacy of PCV13 for multiple purposes in age groups ranging from 6 to over 70&#x02005;years of age has been confirmed.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;16</xref> Nevertheless, it is still unknown whether the licensed PCV13 or a new PCV13 will be effective for the Chinese population until now.</p><p>To address the issue, we plan to initiate this trial for a prelicensing evaluation of a new PCV13. The investigational PCV13 (batch number 201511003) is manufactured by Yuxi Walvax Biotechnology Co (an affiliate of Walvax Biotechnology Co) and supplied in penicillin bottles. Each 0.5&#x02005;mL dose contains 2.2&#x02005;&#x000b5;g pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F and 4.4&#x02005;&#x000b5;g pneumococcal polysaccharide serotype 6B; each serotype is conjugated to a tetanus toxoid carrier protein and adsorbed on aluminium phosphate. In accordance with the guidelines formulated by the WHO,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the requirements established by national regulatory authorities, licensing a new vaccine requires randomised clinical trials to show the non-inferiority of the new vaccine to an existing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. PCV7 will serve as the control vaccine, since it is the only pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that has been licensed in mainland China. The control PCV7 (Prevnar, batch number H29315H13880) is manufactured by Wyeth and supplied in prefilled 0.5&#x02005;mL syringes. Each 0.5&#x02005;mL dose contains 2&#x02005;&#x000b5;g pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes 4, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F and 4&#x02005;&#x000b5;g pneumococcal polysaccharide serotype 6B; each serotype is conjugated to a CRM197 carrier protein and adsorbed on 0.5&#x02005;mg aluminium phosphate.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Objectives</title><p>The purpose of this study is to (1) determine if the seven common serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG responses elicited by PCV13 are all non-inferior to those elicited by PCV7 and (2) determine if the six additional serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG responses induced by PCV13 are all clinically effective 30&#x02005;days after the primary immunisation.</p><p>We hypothesise that for each of the seven common pneumococcal serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) (1) the lower bound of the 97.5% (98.75%, one-sided) CI for the difference (PCV13&#x02014;PCV7) in the proportion of vaccine recipients reaching the serotype-specific IgG concentration threshold of 0.35&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/mL is no &#x0003c; &#x02212;10%; or (2) The lower bound of the 97.5% (98.75%, one-sided) CI of the serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio (PCV13/PCV7) is &#x0003e; 0.5 (&#x02212;0.3, logarithmically transformed by base 10).</p><p>As a parallel hypothesis, we expect that for each of the six additional pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A) (1) The proportion of the serotype-specific IgG responders achieving an IgG threshold of 0.35&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/mL in the PCV13 group is greater than that of the PCV7 group; and (2) the lower limit of the 95% (2-sided) CI for the proportion of vaccine recipients reaching a serotype-specific IgG concentration threshold of 0.35&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/mL is &#x02265;70%.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study is a multicentre phase III randomised parallel group, allocation concealed non-inferiority trial with two groups to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 compared with PCV7 among healthy infants in China.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study includes six sites scattered in three provinces in North China.

If the non-inferiority does exist for a proportion of the test group, a sample size of 434 infants per group, 868 total, will provide 80% power to ensure that the lower limit of 97.5% two-sided CI for difference (test group&#x02013;control group) will be no &#x0003c; &#x02212;10%. We also postulate that the common variance of serotype-specific IgG GMC, which has been logarithmically transformed by base 10, will not be &#x0003e;1.0.

Before recruitment, all vaccines will be masked in identical white small boxes and labelled with vaccine numbers based on the allocation schedule by those who are not involved in the clinical trial procedures. Each vaccine number is composed of two parts: the subject identification number and the dose specification number. Four vaccines with the same subject number prefix will belong to the same participant. In case any unexpected situations arise, additional vaccines including PCV13 and PCV7 in a ratio of 2:1 will be prepared and wrapped separately in individual white boxes labelled with numbers from B0001 to B0540. The link between the additional vaccine number and subject number will be established based on an allocation sequence list by Medidata Rave&#x02014;the electronic data capture (EDC) system for this study. Emergency letters will be sent to each of the sites and properly preserved until needed.</p><p>Each eligible participant will be sequentially allotted a unique subject number according to the site allocation list by authorised assigners, and thus will have an equal chance of being assigned to either the test group or the control group. Blood samples will be labelled with subject numbers and collected independently of the vaccination process.

At the same time, the original record cards will be designed in accordance with the protocol to collect raw clinical data and to support the trial procedures. The source data obtained from each participant will be examined and verified by investigators and clinical research assistants (CRAs) at each study site. The entered data will be systematically validated and audited by the EDC system itself using edit checks, as well as by CRAs and data managers (DMs). Data query forms generated by medically trained personnel will be sent to the site investigators for identification. The electronic-case report form (e-CRF) will be inspected by DMs at regular intervals throughout the trial to verify the protocol compliance. The entered data should be complete, consistent and accurate.

Within each group, for each pneumococcal serotype, the proportion of participants with a specific-IgG antibody concentration threshold of 0.35&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/mL and the two-sided 95% CI for the proportion will be calculated; for each antibody concentration, the value will be logarithmically transformed to base 10, and the two-sided 95% CI will be structured.

Hence, this study intends to characterise the PCV13 among Chinese infants and develop a safety profile for the vaccine. To fulfil these objectives, we calculated sample sizes under different hypothetical conditions and determined the optimal sample size to use to take all factors into consideration. In study design, we adopted the sequential test method to inspect the non-inferiority of each of the seven common pneumococcal serotypes and the efficacy of each of the six additional pneumococcal serotypes step by step to avoid false-positive error inflation. To be more discreet and conservative, instead of setting pneumococcal serotype 6B in PCV7 as a baseline when verifying the immunogenicity of each of the six additional serotypes in PCV13, as many other researchers have done, we defined 70% as the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of responders that reach the serotype-specific IgG concentration threshold of 0.35&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/mL and supposed that the corresponding percentages in PCV7 are &#x0003c;50%.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Allowing for the cross-reactivation between 6A and 6B as well as 19A and 19B in PCV7, we will select a subgroup of which to obtain the OPA results for each of the 13 serotypes to correct for potential bias.</p><p>Given the main focus of the research, this study is not designed to involve the assessment of concomitant immunisation with other vaccines specified in paediatric vaccination schedules such as diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), which might be regarded as a potential limitation. Since the feasibility of PCV7 administered concomitantly with DTaP in mainland Chinese infants has been shown in the research reported by Li RC <italic>et al,</italic><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and the immunogenicity of PCV13 coadministered with DTaP was demonstrated by Togashi T <italic>et al,</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> we will not prohibit the usage of vaccines listed in the expanded programme on immunisation, but we will compulsively demand at least a fortnight's interval between two kinds of vaccination.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JLX provided statistical expertise and created the study design together with JJC.
