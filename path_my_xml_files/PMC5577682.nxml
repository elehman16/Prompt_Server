However, potentially inappropriate prescriptions and polymedication increases iatrogenic risks and can lead to adverse events. To limit the consequences of potentially harmful prescriptions, optimization of drug prescribing is a major stake of improving quality and safety of care in the elderly. The purpose of the OPTIM study is to study the impact of the optimization of drug prescribing on the evolution of functional autonomy at 18&#x000a0;months of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A multicenter, open-label, Randomized Controlled Trial was designed to assess the impact of an optimization program of drug prescribing consisting in a clinical medication review by a pharmacist, in collaboration with specialist physician of the geriatric/memory center and the referent physician, on the evolution of functional autonomy level, measured during 18&#x000a0;months of follow-up. The study will include 302 elderly outpatients visiting geriatric and memory centers, randomly distributed in one of the two parallel groups. One group will benefit of the intervention, while the other will be considered as control group. The effect of the intervention on evolution of the level of autonomy function, defined with repeated measures, will be estimated in a generalized linear mixed model. The intervention will be considered significant if the interaction between time and the study group is significant. Secondary analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of the intervention on secondary clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The &#x0201c;OPTIM&#x0201d; program should enable optimization of drug prescribing in elderly patients and therefore slow or prevent progression to loss of functional autonomy. It should also help to strengthen collaboration between the hospital team of geriatric/neurologist, the pharmacist and the private practice who are all involved in caring for the patient&#x02019;s health. The benefits for the patient are thus optimizing its medical management by linking health professionals met during his care pathway. In addition, pharmaceutical recommendations sent to referent physicians should help raise awareness of the prescription of drugs in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number clinicaltrials</title><p id="Par4">

However, several age-related characteristics increase the iatrogenic risk including reduced physiological reserve and homeostasis, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic modifications, acute and chronic diseases and polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, with an increased frequency of polymedication among elderly people, the proportion of interaction effects between drugs may be more frequent, and can conduct themselves to increased adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Some age-related syndromes, especially cognitive impairment and loss of functional autonomy, may also affect the medication efficacy and the ability of elderly people to take their medication. Indeed, these characteristics of ageing and geriatric syndromes have an impact on medication prescribing for elderly people and represent a challenging process in the selection of appropriate pharmacotherapy. The diversity of acute medical conditions of elderly people makes generalization of prescribing decisions difficult for clinicians. Therefore, the medication prescribing in elderly people is too often inappropriate. Different types of potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIP) have been described: the &#x02018;overuse&#x02019; (use of drugs with risks greater than the benefits and prescription of drugs without valid indication); the &#x02018;underuse&#x02019; (absence of prescription of potentially beneficial drugs); and the &#x02018;misuse&#x02019; (use of inappropriate dosage, duration, administration modalities, drug prescription with clinically significant drug&#x02013;drug and drug&#x02013;disease interactions, redundancy, cost). PIP are frequent in the elderly in outpatients as well as in patients living in health facility with a prevalence from 19% to 54% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A previous study showed that 42% of elderly have at least one prescription drug without a valid indication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This study also showed that the dosage and duration of treatment were inappropriate for half of the patients. The most concerned drugs were those used in cardiovascular therapies, analgesics, hypoglycaemic agents, psychotropics and anticoagulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Besides, many diseases remain poorly controlled in elderly e.g. drugs in heart failure and osteoporosis are under-used by 20 to 70% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The PIP has been found associated with an increased risk of morbidity, adverse drug events (ADE), hospitalization, mortality and increased healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In terms of use of the health care system, problems related to misuse of drugs are common since about 20% of emergency use in elderly patients were found associated to an adverse event related to drugs, in Italy and in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In France, proportion of hospitalisations due to ADE was estimated at 3.6% in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, a study conducted in the United States has shown that nearly 28% of adverse events related to drug prescriptions could be avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Besides, there is evidence for harmful effects associated with the polypharmacy and the use of specific classes of drugs. Various studies have shown that cumulative anticholinergic and sedative exposure was associated with functional and cognitive impairment in elderly people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a longitudinal study conducted among inpatients, prescriptions of drugs with anticholinergic and sedative effect were associated with increased risk of in-hospital fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Since drug consumption in older people is high, many commonly prescribed drugs have anticholinergic or sedative effects (such as antiemetics, antispasmodics, antiarythmic drugs, antihypertensives, analgesics, psychotropic drugs, antihistaminics and bronchodilatators). An estimated 7,5% of community-dwelling older patients use anticholinergic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore reducing the number and dose of anticholinergic and sedative medication may reduce the impact on cognition and slow functional dependence progression.</p><p id="Par18">To limit the consequences of potentially harmful prescriptions, optimizing drug therapy is a major focus of improving quality and safety of care in the elderly. In a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers, various pharmacist interventions can be implemented throughout the whole care process. The medication reviews are considered as a key element in improving the quality of prescriptions and in preventing ADEs among patient. There are three types of interventions: 1) prescription analysis, 2) adherence evaluation and 3) clinical medication review. The clinical medication review is defined as a structured, critical examination of a patient&#x02019;s drug prescription with the objectives of reaching an agreement with the patient about their treatment, optimizing the impact of drugs, minimizing the number of drug related side effects rationalizing and simplifying drug regimens and reducing the iatrogeny. The clinical medication review included five interventions: medication history, review of current medication, pharmaceutical intervention, multidisciplinary review of drug prescriptions and medication liaison service (comprehension medication history, discharge letter transmitted to referent physician (RP) of the patient and community pharmacist, discharge counseling). Previous studies have found a positive impact of these interventions on the reduction of PIP, polymedication, adverse drug events in hospitalized elderly and in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, impact of such interventions by the clinical pharmacist integrated in a multidisciplinary approach has not been evaluated in terms of evolution of functional autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The evolution towards functional disabilities, frequent with aging, is at the heart of the concerns of public health authorities. Due to an increasing proportion of elderly in the population and the increase in life expectancy, the care-dependent patients increase the human and financial costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The evolution of loss of functional autonomy has many causes and risk factors, among which some could be prevented. Among these causes or risk factors, cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 1 or 2 diabetes, impairment of cognitive performance, sleep disorders, depression, a recent hospitalization and polypharmacy may have negative impact on functional autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These observations from the literature make us assume the existence of an indirect link between inappropriate drug prescriptions and accelerated evolution to functional dependence, through suboptimal treatment of chronic diseases and greater frequency of adverse events. A literature review showed that the inappropriate prescription of drugs has a negative impact on functional status of patients; the most offending drugs are benzodiazepines, and anticholinergic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">By intervening at the drug prescription, it appears that a profit could be achieved in terms of slowing the progression towards functional dependency. Thus, the improvement of drug prescriptions could delay or prevent the loss of functional autonomy by reducing the risk of ADE, such as falls or cognitive decline and improving the management of chronic diseases. Our hypothesis is that an optimization program of the drug prescribing may slow progression to functional dependence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary aim</title><p id="Par20">The primary aim of the OPTIM study is to assess the impact of an optimization program of drug prescribing consisting in a clinical medication review by a pharmacist on the evolution of functional autonomy level, measured during 18&#x000a0;months of follow-up.</p><p id="Par21">Secondary aims<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par22">In patients, to evaluate the impact of the optimization program of drug prescribing at 18&#x000a0;months of follow-up on: risk of all-cause hospital admission, risk of all-cause emergency department visit, risk of onset of institutionalization, risk of falls, the overall cognitive function and its evolution, the quality of life, anxiety and depressive disorders, drug adherence, pain, and the risk of all-cause death.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">Among the RP of patients, to evaluate the impact of the optimization program of drug prescribing at 18&#x000a0;months of follow-up, on: PIP, drug related problem (DRP) identified by the pharmacist, the RP acceptance of pharmacist&#x02019;s interventions (PI).</p></list-item></list>

The IADL scale assesses the level of functional autonomy of a patient through the assessment of instrumental activities of daily living including ability to use the telephone, transportation, shopping, managing medications, manage a budget, prepare meals, maintain the house and do the laundry. The rating scale provides a score from 0 to 8. A higher score indicates a higher level of dependency, while a lower score reflects a lower level of dependence. The IADL scale consists of 8 questions. The DAD-6 assesses the patient&#x02019;s activities in his daily life. It includes six questions assessing the degree of autonomy for the following activities: Food, use the telephone or the computer, moving outside, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure and home maintenance. The score ranges from 0 to 18 points, the higher the score is, the more the patient is autonomous. The IADL and DAD-6 scales will be collected during an interview between the patient&#x02019;s primary caregiver and a neuropsychologist, a nurse or a physician.</p><p id="Par38">The secondary outcomes collected for patients will be the occurrence and the number of all-cause hospitalizations and all-cause emergency department visit after inclusion, admission in institution, and the delay before institutionalization, the occurrence and number of falls after inclusion, the overall cognitive function estimated by the Mini Mental Sate Examination (MMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] at baseline and its evolution assessed using the successive measures performed at each visit, the quality of life of the patients measured by the questionnaire EUROQOL 5D (EQ5D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], the depression and anxiety disorders measured respectively with the mini-GDS scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and the Hamilton scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], the compliance of patients with treatment measured with the Girerd questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], pain measured with an ordinal scale from 0 to 10, and the possible occurrence of all-cause death.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par40">The number of subjects needed was calculated on the primary outcome (IADL) to demonstrate a significant difference in the evolution of functional activities between the intervention group and the control group. The IADL score in patients aged 70&#x000a0;years deteriorates on average of 16% over a period of 18&#x000a0;months. This evolution would represent a change of 1.3 percentage points (SD 2) expected in the control group in our study population. To highlight a 20% difference of the evolution of this score, equivalent to a change of 1.04 points of IADL in the intervention group, for an alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05 and a power of 80% (two-tailed test), it is necessary to include 224 patients (112 per group). A first observation made in the Charpennes Hospital showed that RP referred 2 patients in average at the memory center. Taking the conservative assumption of 4 patients on average per referent physician, the inflation factor applied was 1.03 for an intra-class coefficient (ICC) of 0.01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Taking into account the ICC, the number of subjects needed was 232 patients spread between the 2 study groups. Finally, the number of subjects required was corrected for an expected attrition rate of 25%; the corresponding correction factor was 1.3. Assuming that the rate is the same in the 2 groups, the number of subjects required was 302 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par41">Prior estimations of the number of patients visiting the recruiting centers show the capacity of inclusion of the number of subjects needed over 12&#x000a0;months. Several strategies are envisaged to follow up the study population and allow the collection of data. In case the patient does not show up to the consultation of follow-up, the patient will be contacted to propose a new visit or to collect the reason of absence to the consultation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Assignment of interventions</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Randomization</title><p id="Par42">Random allocation is stratified by center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Patients are assigned to intervention or control group in the study after the eligibility criteria are met. The randomization is performed by following a list of random allocation generated by computer, by the project manager. The unit of randomization is then the patient since the enrollment in the study begins with the patient. However, to limit the risk of contamination due to the fact that a RP can have several patients included in the study, patients with the same RP will be allocated to the same study group. Specifically, each patient coming in geriatric or memory consultation and whose the RP was not identified for a patient previously included, will be assigned randomly to one of the study groups: intervention, or control. Patient will be enrolled by the geriatric/neurologist doctor during the consultation. When a new patient has the same RP that a patient previously enrolled in the study, this new patient will automatically be assigned to the same study group as the previous patient. Finally, the number of patients per RP will be limited to 4.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par44">The study is considered as open-label. The PI will perform the clinical medical review for all patients included in the study, regardless of their allocation group. Patients and RP will be aware of group allocation by the nature of the intervention which may lead to changes in their drug prescriptions.

Drugs are collected by the clinical pharmacist using the RP prescriptions and those of the specialist physician at hospital after the consultation. Drugs data and pharmaceutical analysis and PI are entered in the computerized database by the clinical pharmacist. The data collected in the CRF and in the database will be verified for accuracy, missing data, and data consistency with the documents &#x02018;source&#x02019; (medical records, visits schedules).

It should also help to develop and strengthen collaboration and communication between the team of geriatric/neurologist at the hospital consultation, the pharmacist and the RP who are all involved in caring for the patient&#x02019;s health. The benefits for the patient are thus optimizing its medical management by linking health professionals met during his care pathway. In addition, pharmaceutical recommendations sent to RP should help raise awareness of the prescription of drugs in these patients.</p><p id="Par57">Some limits are already considered. In some cases (allergy, occurrence of adverse effects), the substitution of some potentially harmful drugs could not be achieved. Furthermore, some patients may experience a reluctance to change the medication that they used to follow for many years. In any case, the drug outpatient prescription must remain an essential aspect of the relationship between the patient and his RP. The lack of blinding due to the nature of the intervention may be responsible of a bias; however the knowledge by patients of their allocation group may have little or no impact on the evolution their functional autonomy level.</p><p id="Par58">The study is implemented in the current care of patients followed at geriatric and memory consultation at the hospital and should allow to assess its impact in everyday practice. If the OPTIM study demonstrates a positive impact on older patients, implementing sustainable way of drug therapy optimization program could be considered on other hospitals in connection with their pharmacy service.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADE</term><def><p id="Par5">Adverse drug events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRA</term><def><p id="Par6">Clinical research associate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p id="Par7">Case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAD-6</term><def><p id="Par8">6-item Disability assessment of dementia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRP</term><def><p id="Par9">Drug related problem</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IADL</term><def><p id="Par10">Instrumental activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p id="Par11">Intra-class coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p id="Par12">Mini mental sate examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p id="Par13">Pharmacist&#x02019;s interventions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIP</term><def><p id="Par14">Potentially inappropriate prescriptions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RP</term><def><p id="Par15">Referent physician</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all the specialist physicians of the geriatric and memory centers who contribute to inclusion of patients in the study, in particular Dr. Aur&#x000e9;lia Marfisi-Dubost and Dr. Ahmed Salmi, the pharmacists who contribute to optimization of drug prescription, in particular Dr. Corinne Goubier-Vial and Marie-Agn&#x000e8;s Lepine, as well as Florian Gatto, Floriane Delphin-Combe, and Lucie Winterstein.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par59">The OPTIM trial was supported by the French Ministry of Health and obtained a grant (number 13-0531) from the Health Care System Performance Research Program.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par60">The final dataset of the OPTIM study will not be publicly available due to regulations and agreements obtained to perform the study, but will be available on reasonable request after publication of the primary objective.
