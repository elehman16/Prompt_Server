Direct experience preparing and tasting healthful foods and increasing activity during the school day are promising prevention approaches. Engaging parents and families remains an important challenge. <italic>Fuel for Fun: Cooking with Kids Plus Parents and Play</italic> is a multi-component school- and family-based intervention for 4th graders and their families intended to promote positive food and activity environments, policies and behaviors at the individual, family and school levels. This paper describes the design and evaluation plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Four cohorts of 4th-graders and their parents from 8 schools in 2 districts in the same Northern Colorado region are participating in a 4-arm cluster randomized controlled trial.

Outcomes include child and parent measures of fruit and vegetable preferences and intake, cooking, physical activity, sedentary behaviors and attitudes. School level data assess lunch plate waste and physical activity at recess. In-depth diet and accelerometry assessments are collected with a subsample of parent-child dyads. Data are collected at baseline, immediately post-intervention at 7&#x000a0;months, and at 12&#x000a0;month follow-up.

School-based interventions addressing diet and physical activity have demonstrated promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Specifically, programs that include children in cooking and food preparation and increase physical activity during the school day are recommended to counter childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>A recent systematic review of child-centered cooking programs identified eight articles meeting the inclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], of which two were rated strong in quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both of these highly-rated studies were evaluations of the <italic>Cooking with Kids</italic> (<italic>CWK</italic>) curriculum, a school-based food and nutrition education curriculum that engages elementary school children in hands-on learning with fresh affordable foods based on diverse cultural traditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cookingwithkids.org/">http://cookingwithkids.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Implementation of the full curriculum includes 16&#x000a0;h of cooking and tasting lessons throughout the school year, but allows for modifications to accommodate fiscal, time, and resource limitations. Participation in <italic>CWK</italic> among predominantly Hispanic, 4<sup>th</sup> grade children demonstrated gains in cooking self-efficacy among children with no previous cooking experience, and demonstrated increased preference for fruits and vegetables, especially for students receiving the cooking and tasting curriculum (as opposed to the curriculum with only tasting lessons). Moreover, gains in self-efficacy were particularly pronounced in male students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Self-efficacy in cooking and fruit and vegetable preferences are relevant measures given that self-efficacy related to diet and nutrition is strongly correlated with dietary behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and fruit and vegetable preferences are often associated with intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similar gains with <italic>CWK</italic> engagement were documented in a predominately non-Hispanic white sample of 4<sup>th</sup> graders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In that investigation of a <italic>CWK</italic> program of shorter duration (10&#x000a0;h of cooking and tasting lessons), significant improvements in vegetable preferences, and cooking and food preparation attitudes and self-efficacy were affirmed with <italic>CWK</italic> participation. As with the previous <italic>CWK</italic> investigation, students who reported no prior cooking experience demonstrated the greatest improvement in these measures, and the effect was greatest in boys. Together, these studies support participation in <italic>CWK</italic>, and affirm the positive influence of a curriculum designed to allow students of diverse cultural backgrounds direct experience to foods through cooking or tasting activities.</p><p>Physical activity (PA) is the other cornerstone to energy balance. The school environment plays an important role in children&#x02019;s PA accumulation, but despite opportunities for PA during recess breaks and physical education classes, the sedentary nature of many school environments poses a challenge to school-day PA accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Interventions and other studies have reported that increasing school day PA accumulation increases whole-day PA in a magnitude greater than expected from the changes in school-day PA alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For instance, children encouraged to be physically active during the school day (e.g., during recess and physical education) have been shown to be more active after school than children whose PA was restricted during school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. <italic>Sports Play and Active Recreation for Kids</italic> (<italic>SPARK</italic>) is one program shown to increase students&#x02019; moderate to vigorous PA during the school day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although energy balance may be as simple as &#x0201c;calories in&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;calories out&#x0201d; from a physiologic standpoint, translating this principle to achieve improvements in public health is more complex. Successful programs and interventions aimed at obesity prevention must also address the context in which an individual&#x02019;s nutrition and physical activity choices are made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For a pediatric audience, this includes the individual child, parents and family, school (including cafeteria) and community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This type of system-wide approach engages multiple sectors of society to improve health and reduce overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This approach stems from the Social Ecological Model (SEM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and is central to the action plan for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015&#x02013;2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Fuel for Fun: Cooking with Kids Plus Parents and Play (<italic>FFF</italic>) is one such multiple-component, school and family intervention with a social-ecological approach. <italic>FFF</italic> incorporates the tested, validated <italic>CWK</italic> program into wider school environments to include the cafeteria and facilitate family involvement. <italic>FFF</italic> builds on prior research to engage multiple sectors of the community to reduce the risk of childhood obesity by promoting healthful food and activity environments, policies and behaviors through: 1) developing and testing the efficacy of a 4th grade comprehensive school- and family-based intervention, 2) applying this intervention to an after-school setting, and, 3) state-wide program dissemination. Two of these aims, applying this intervention to an after-school setting, and to a state-wide program dissemination, will not be described here.

This 8-month process involved a K-12 interdisciplinary curriculum expert, 5 educators and curriculum specialists from the participating school districts, the <italic>CWK</italic> curriculum developers, and project nutrition education experts. Substantive changes included revising the lesson structure to be consistent with the Understanding by Design format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] so that assessment strategies consistently address learning objectives and standards; greater emphases on in-depth nutrition and mathematics knowledge and skills; regionally-relevant content (e.g., letters from local farmers); and more opportunities for differentiated instruction for diverse learning needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Integrating experiential classroom nutrition activities with cafeteria meals can increase fruit and vegetable consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

It incorporated successful strategies identified through an extensive literature review, and included: family nights at school, home-based action packs (i.e., activity packets) for parent and child to complete together, and a parent blog. Subsequent telephone interviews with a representative sample of parents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;24; 41.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.7y, 92&#x000a0;% female, 91&#x000a0;% White, 38&#x000a0;% used&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 food assistance program) of non-intervention 4<sup>th</sup> graders explored these elements in greater detail. Parents preferred family events at school to be held toward the end of the work week (Thursdays or Fridays) and in the early evening. Topics of greatest interest included ways to be more physically active as a family, easy-to-fix meals, strategies to prepare food with their child/ren, and affordable home meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>From these interview results we developed a family night protocol and procedures manual adapted from other school-based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Cooking stations and physical activities were designed using several constructs from SCT and ELT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We held 2 pilot events at a non-participating school, with half of the events tested at the first event and the remainder at the second. Surveyed parents and children gave the event high marks (e.g., &#x02265; 4.0 on 5 point scales, data not shown), and process evaluation through observation and debriefing after each event identified minor revisions (e.g., refining necessary booth resources and improving event flow).

The <italic>FFF</italic> Family Night is scheduled two times each intervention year, fall and spring, and takes place at the participating school. Invitation flyers are sent home with students at least two weeks in advance, and two additional email reminders are sent to parents before the event. Activities include cooking and tasting stations that mimic what students experience in the classroom, food and nutrition crafts, and <italic>SPARK</italic> games children have learned at recess. After families rotate through each station, they are invited to enjoy a light meal provided and served by the school cafeteria staff. Meals are designed using project recipes. To motivate attendance and promote project goals, each Family Night closes with a drawing for free cooking and activity prizes.</p><p>The second family element, <italic>FFF</italic> Action Packs, is an activity packet sent home with students after each tasting and cooking lesson. The activities correspond with each classroom lesson and <italic>SPARK</italic> Active Recess games and include nutrition and physical activity sections. Participation of parents and other family members is strongly encouraged through written prompts and documented by parent signature. Students are reminded to return completed Action Packs by the following lesson. Lastly, the <italic>FFF</italic> Parent Blog is designed to engage parents and keep them up-to-date on the <italic>FFF</italic> activities going on in their child&#x02019;s school.

Using the wrist-mounted GENEActiv ACC recording at a sampling frequency of 75Hz (ActivInsights Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK), seven days of free-living data are collected. The device is attached to each child&#x02019;s non-dominant wrist using a semi-removable, hospital-style plastic band. Children are instructed to leave the device on for the entire seven-day period, even while sleeping and bathing. Parents and teachers are provided written instructions for children&#x02019;s ACC use, notably, that children should not tamper with the device nor remove it during the assessment period. Children are encouraged to engage in their typical daily activities while wearing the ACC, and teachers provide the research team a daily class schedule for the week of ACC wear, including school start and end times, lunch and recess times, and PE periods. Extra wristbands are provided in case a child has to remove the ACC for any reason. Children receive a $10 gift-card to a local &#x0201c;superstore&#x0201d; upon receipt of the ACC as compensation for participation. Accelerometers, written instructions, and gift-cards for any consented children absent at drop-off are left with the teacher, with instructions to attach the device upon the child&#x02019;s return to school. At the end of the seven-day period, members of the research team return to collect the ACCs and the children receive a second gift card, this one valued at $15.

Parent group involvement includes a range of activities from control to both <italic>FFF</italic> family involvement and <italic>About Eating</italic>, an online food resource management program.</p><p>Unique strengths of this study include significant opportunities for parent involvement, and examination of parent engagement and parent response to 1 of 4 treatment options. Other significant contributions include the use of accelerometry, dietary, and survey data; with parent-child dyads for accelerometry and dietary assessments. Unlike many childhood obesity prevention interventions, we will follow students and parents into the subsequent school year, collecting a full year of diet and physical activity-related information. Additionally, the intervention and control groups are randomly assigned and cohort-based. Our dissemination plan includes adapting and testing <italic>FFF</italic> in afterschool and other out-of-school based venues and for low-income audiences.</p><p>This project builds on our prior work that shows impact of the <italic>CWK</italic> intervention on 4th graders, especially boys without previous cooking experience for both Hispanic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and mainly Caucasian samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, eating competence, shown to be associated with parent feeding and food-related behaviors in prior Hispanic sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], is included in the assessment of this mostly Caucasian, socioeconomically diverse sample of parents. <italic>Cafeteria Connections</italic> builds on previous school cafeteria behavioral economics research by Wansink and Just [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and ties the strategies to the <italic>FFF</italic> classroom lessons. Moreover, valid instruments and procedures are used to collect all study data.</p><p>In addition to examining the impact of an effective cooking and tasting curriculum on student food-related behaviors, we will examine parent engagement, interplay between parent and child involvement, relationships between physical activity, diet, and eating behaviors, and sustainability and dissemination potential of this type of curriculum. We will also explore and characterize the psychometric properties of previously tested instruments about physical activity, food and eating behaviors.</p><p>Limitations include that the target audience lacks racial and ethnic diversity, thereby restricting the generalizability of results. Because of the intervention design, we will have only indirect involvement of parents, relying on them to accept our invitations to join their child in intervention and measurement activities. If teachers continue teaching 4th grade in participating schools, they will participate in both control and intervention phases of the project; their prior experience may influence subsequent years. We will not be able to follow students beyond the beginning of the 5th grade year, therefore long-term impact is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACC, accelerometry; ASA24, Automated Self-administered 24-h recall; <italic>CWK</italic>, Cooking with Kids; DA, diet assessment; ELT, Experiential Learning Theory; <italic>FFF</italic>, Fuel for Fun; PA, physical activity; SCT, Social Cognitive Theory; SEM, Social Ecological Model; SOPLAY, System for Observing Play and Leisure Activity in Youth; <italic>SPARK</italic>, Sports, Physical Activity and Recreation for Kids</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We extend our sincere thanks to members of the <italic>Fuel for Fun</italic> steering committee not co-authoring this manuscript: Susan Baker and Laura Bellows at Colorado State University, Laurie Zenner with the University of Colorado Healthy Kids Club, and Lynn Walters and Jane Stacy with Cooking with Kids, Inc.
