mobilization on the joint position sense (JPS) of normal adults. [Subjects] A total of 30
normal adults were divided into an experimental group (n = 15) and a control group (n =
15). [Methods] The experimental group received lumbar joint mobilization and massage, and
the control group received massage only. Both the experimental and control groups were
evaluated for joint position error (JPE) by using a digital dual inclinometer before and
after the experiment. [Results] In the before and after comparison for the experimental
group, statistically significant differences were found in flexion, extension, left
lateral flexion, and right lateral flexion. There was no statistically significant
difference in the before and after comparison for the control group. [Conclusion] Because
lumbar joint mobilization can reduce JPE and improve JPS, its use in the treatment of
patients with lumbar problems is recommended.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Gong&#x02019;s mobilization</kwd><kwd>Joint position sense</kwd><kwd>Joint position error</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Intact proprioception is a basic element in controlling movement<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and joint position sense (JPS) is an important body

is provided by the spinal ligaments, facet joints, and intervertebral discs<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and much more stimulation is given to the
end range of joint positions<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
proprioceptive information originating from the muscle and joint receptors is an important
factor in trunk control<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Soft tissue
injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament deficiency, ankle sprains, glenohumeral

Muscle vibration reportedly increases proprioception and enhances local muscle control<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and athletes with back pain have a lower
lumbar position sense<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another similar
study investigated the effects of cervical joint manipulation on JPE in normal adults<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and many rehabilitation programs for
athletes have emphasized proprioception training because impaired JPE is a major cause of
recurrent injuries<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, whereas most of these studies identified the relation between back pain and JPS,
improved JPS through exercise, or identified the effects of cervical joint mobilization on
JPS, studies on the effects of lumbar joint mobilization on the lumbar JPS of normal adults
are rare. Therefore, we aimed to study this effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 30 students attending N University, Republic of Korea. They
were divided into the experimental group (n = 15; 1 male and 14 females) and the control
group (n = 15; 1 male and 14 females). The age, height, and weight of the experimental group
were 22.9&#x000b1;0.2&#x02005;years, 162.3&#x000b1;5.9&#x02005;cm, and 56.2&#x000b1;6.0&#x02005;kg, respectively. The age, height, and
weight of the experimental group were 22.0&#x000b1;0.3&#x02005;years, 163.2&#x000b1;4.9&#x02005;cm, and 55.1&#x000b1;8.5&#x02005;kg,
respectively. There was no significant statistical difference between the 2 groups
(p&#x0003e;0.05). All subjects were adults in their 20s, and those with a history of surgery,
those undergoing treatment, and those with lumbar disc hernia were excluded from the study.
This study was approved by Korea Nazarene University&#x02019;s institutional review board, and the
safety of the subjects was protected during all experimental processes. All of the subjects
understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent before
participation, in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The experimental group received lumbar joint mobilization by using Gong&#x02019;s mobilization
technique for 10&#x02005;min and a massage for 15&#x02005;min. For lateral flexion during lumbar joint
mobilization, the subjects sat astride the edge of a treatment bed in a position similar to
that in horse riding with both legs apart (the back and hip at that time were oriented
toward the direction of the edge of the bed). The hands were crossed and placed on the
shoulders, with the therapist positioned by the side of the subject. One hand of the
therapist made contact with the lower vertebral laminae of the joint to be mobilized, and
the other hand made contact with the opposite side of the trunk, after which lateral flexion
was induced to the coronal plane with respect to the Z-axis, and a short and rapid thrust
was applied from the end range. With this method, all 5 joints on the left and right sides
of the lumbar spine were mobilized<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
similar method was applied to the extension range of motion (ROM)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Massage was performed on the erector spinae, quadrates
lumborum, and latissimus dorsi muscles. The control group received only 1 massage for
15&#x02005;min<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>JPS was evaluated from the JPE; that is, the higher the JPE, the lower the JPS capability.
JPE was measured by using a digital dual inclinometer (Dualer IQ; JTECH Medical, Salt Lake
City, UT, USA). After the subjects were trained 2 times to locate certain positions
precisely (lumbar flexion [Fle] 35&#x000b0;, extension [Ext] 35&#x000b0;, left lateral flexion [LLF] 30&#x000b0;,
right lateral flexion [RLF] 30&#x000b0;) with passive lumbar movement under the guidance of the
evaluator in a neutral position, they were asked to locate with active lumbar movement the
positions in the 4 directions by themselves, without the guidance of the evaluator. The
difference between the 2 procedures was recorded; JPE was measured 3 times before and after
the experiment, and the average value was used in the analysis.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed by using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, a paired t-test
was used to compare changes in Fle, Ext, LLF, and RLF before and after the test in each
group. The differences between the 2 groups were tested by using an independent t-test. The
statistical significance level, &#x003b1;, was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the experimental group, the extents of Ext, LLF, and RLF (p&#x0003c;0.05) were statistically

In
addition, when a lumbar spinal motion occurs, the intervertebral angle and lumbar facet
joint capsule strain increase at the same time. The capsule of the facet joint is involved
not only in-joint stability through movement but also in pain and proprioception<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, increasing the ROM of the
capsule of the facet joint is thought to improve JPS by enhancing the proprioception
function. In this study, we investigated the effects of lumbar joint mobilization on the JPS
of normal adults.</p><p>In a lumbar joint mobilization-related study, Gong reported an increase in the lumbar
extension range of motion after applying Gong&#x02019;s mobilization to a patient with low back
pain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Konstantinou et al. applied the
joint mobilization technique to 26 patients with lumbar pain and reported that the lumbar
extension ROM significantly increased in the group that received the joint mobilization
technique<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other previous studies
also reported that application of the joint mobilization technique increased the lumbar
extension ROM<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the pre- and post-experiment comparison performed in this study, the change in JPE (Ext,
LLF, and RLF) of the subjects who received Gong&#x02019;s mobilization, was statistically
significant. In the independent t-test performed for comparisons of pre-experiment values,
post-experiment values, and the differences between pre- and post-experiment values in the 2
groups, the post-experiment values for Fle, Ext, and LLF and the differences between the
pre- and post-experiment values for Ext showed statistically significances. In particular, a
large reduction of JPE in Ext was seen.</p><p>In a similar study, Gong divided 30 normal adults into a cervical joint manipulation group
(n = 15) and a massage group (n = 15) and reported that cervical joint manipulation
decreased JPE and improved JPS. The results of Gong&#x02019;s study are similar to those of this
study, except for the difference in position (cervix vs. lumbar)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Simon et al. applied vibration to the paraspinal muscle
in 23 young patients with low back pain and 21 control subjects and measured the lumbosacral
position sense; they reported that the repositioning accuracy was significantly lower in the
patient group than in healthy persons. While mechanoreceptors in deep muscles were mainly
stimulated in their study, in another current study, mainly those in the joint capsule were
stimulated<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Georgy divided 45
participants into a back dysfunction group (n = 15), discogenic back dysfunction group (n =
15), and control group (n = 15) and measured JPE after performing a target position of 30&#x000b0;
lumbar flexion. Compared with the control group, the JPEs of the back dysfunction group and
discogenic back dysfunction group ware reportedly higher<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The JPE of the group that received lumbar joint mobilization in this study decreased
compared with the group that received massage only. This result is similar to a previous
study that showed that joint mobilization improves JPS<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mobility in each segment is generated by joint mobilization, and
joint mobilization activates proprioceptors in the joint capsule and deep muscle, which is
thought to lead to improvement in JPS. Therefore, we recommend the application of lumbar
joint mobilization to improve motion capability in subjects with diminished JPS due to a
reduced ROM or in patients with back dysfunction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lephart</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pincivero</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Giraldo</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The role of proprioception in the management and
