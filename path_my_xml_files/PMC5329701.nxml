There is a high probability of BPH occurring concurrently with ED <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. PDE5-Is are first-line medications for ED, and &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor blockers are highly effective in the management of LUTS/BPH. Close observation of both pathological conditions and medication-based treatments have been the first-line therapy for LUTS/BPH <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The pathophysiology of male LUTS is highly complex, multifactorial and still not completely understood <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The relationship between male LUTS/BPH and ED is supported by many theories: (i) autonomic hyperactivity and metabolic syndrome hypothesis, (ii) impaired nitric oxide/cyclic guanine monophosphate (NO/cGMP) signalling pathway in the prostate and penis, (iii) increased rho-kinase activation/endothelin pathway, (iv) pelvic atherosclerosis and ischaemia <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Notably, PDE5-Is have received much attention in the treatment of LUTS/BPH. This could be due to: (i) selective distribution of PDE5 that is mostly expressed and biologically active in the muscular compartment with the following rank order of activity: bladder neck&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;prostatic urethra&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;prostate <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, (ii) PDE5-Is increase NO levels in smooth muscle mediating its relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and bladder, thus facilitating penile erection plus bladder neck and prostate relaxation <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, (iii) PDE5-Is ameliorate the dynamic component (bladder dysfunction and urethral contractions) of male LUTS as they induce inhibition of the rho A/rho-kinase contractile mechanism in the bladder <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, (iv) PDE5-Is can restore morphological and functional changes in the bladder and prostate induced by chronic pelvic ischaemia, as PDE5 is highly expressed in the pelvic vasculature <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These findings suggest that the concurrent administration of an &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor blocker and a PDE-5I to patients with LUTS/BPH with or without ED may potentiate, or improve to some extent, the beneficial effects of each drug administered alone.</p><p>In the Kaplan et al. <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> study, improvements in the IPSS were significant for all three treatments but were the greatest for the combined therapy. They reported that after treatment with alfuzosin monotherapy (10&#x000a0;mg OD), sildenafil monotherapy (25&#x000a0;mg OD) or a combination of the two drugs for 12&#x000a0;weeks in patients with previously untreated LUTS and ED, that <italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub>, PVR and storage symptoms were significantly improved with alfuzosin alone and with the combined treatment. For IIEF scores, improvements were significant for sildenafil alone but greater with the combined treatment and was not significant for alfuzosin alone. Likewise, increases in the frequency of penetration and maintained erections were greater in the combined therapy group than in the alfuzosin or sildenafil alone groups <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These investigations showed that the combined use of a PDE5-I and &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor blocker might be more effective than monotherapy with either agent <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Liu et al. <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> in their review and meta-analysis of five RCTs assessing the use of PDE5-Is alone vs placebo in men with LUTS/BPH concluded that PDE5-Is are effective and safe, and should be used as a first-line for treating men with coincidental LUTS/ED. Laydner et al. <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> reported a significant improvement in both urinary and erectile function, without a change in <italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub>, in a systematic review without meta-analysis, including four trials on PDE5-Is alone in men with LUTS/BPH. Finally, Martinez-Salamanca et al. <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, analysed the role of combined therapy with PDE5-Is and &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor blockers, reporting a significant improvement in urinary symptoms with no evidence of an effect on urodynamic parameters, in a non-systematic descriptive review <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>In our present study, IPSSs were significantly improved in the two groups, but this improvement was more marked with combined therapy than for &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor blocker alone, and the 6-month scores were insignificantly improved compared to the 3-month scores in the two groups. These results are consistent with those of Kaplan et al. <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and Zhe et al. <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, <italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub> was significantly improved at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups in both groups, but this improvement was more marked with combined therapy (Group A) than for &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor blocker alone (Group B). <italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub> was improved in both treatment groups and was not significantly different, and the 6-month scores were insignificantly improved compared to 3-month scores in both groups.</p><p>One of the most remarkable outcomes of the Gacciet al. <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> meta-analysis of 12 RCTs was that the combination of PDE5-Is and &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor blockers could significantly improve <italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub> as compared with &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor blockers alone. Improvement of <italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub> above 1&#x000a0;mL/s in combined therapy, as compared with &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor alone, was reported by all authors in the previous study <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Limitations of the present study are the relatively small population size, short follow-up duration (6&#x000a0;months) and thus no long-term efficacy endpoints, and the dose of sildenafil citrate used (25&#x000a0;mg OD) is experimental. Thus further prospective studies with longer durations of follow-up are recommended.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Sildenafil citrate in combination with tamsulosin improved
