and active range of motion (AROM) in patients with chronic low back pain. [Subjects and
Methods] Thirty subjects with chronic low back pain were randomly allocated to two groups:
the CORE group (n = 15) and the control group (n = 15). The CORE group performed the CORE
exercise program for 30 minutes a day, 3 times a week, for 4 weeks, while the control
group did not perform any exercise. The visual analog scale (VAS) and an algometer were
used to measure pain, and pain-free AROM in the trunk was measured before and after the
intervention. [Results] The CORE group showed significantly decreased VAS scores at rest
and during movement and had a significantly increased pressure pain threshold in the
quadratus lumborum and AROM in the trunk compared with those in the control group.
[Conclusion] This study demonstrated that the CORE exercise program is effective in
decreasing pain and increasing AROM in patients with chronic low back pain. Thus, the CORE
exercise program can be used to manage pain and AROM in patients with chronic low back
pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>CORE exercise program</kwd><kwd>Chronic low back pain (CLBP)</kwd><kwd>Active range of motion (AROM)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain is a prevalent disorder in modern society, with 80% of the population
suffering from it at least once in their life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among them, 7&#x02013;10% will develop chronic low back pain (CLBP), and 1%
will have physical disabilities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. CLBP is
not only painful but also leads to loss of function, so this condition hampers a healthy
lifestyle<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low back pain is
increasingly seen in patients in their 20s to 40s, especially due to the economic
development of society and changing working environments<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Low back pain is caused by a degenerated or damaged facet joint or sacroiliac joint with
soft tissue injury on the trunk or by lumbar instability from weakened muscle strength<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar instability restricts muscle
strength, endurance, flexibility, and active range of motion (AROM). In particular, patients
with CLBP persisting for more than 6 months restrict trunk movement to minimize pain in the
lumbosacral area or leg, which aggravates the level of lumbar muscle weakness in paraspinal
muscles and the multifidus<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. These changes
increase lumbar instability and raise the recurrence of low back pain. Therefore, abdominal
and spinal extensors are crucial in improving lumbar stability. Patients with CLBP suffer
from deteriorated physical functions and production activities due to weakened muscle
strength in the lumbar region. Therefore, exercises that increase muscle strength and
flexibility are very important for CLBP patients not only to alleviate low back pain but
also for continued self-care<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, differences in motor control patterns, such as poor postural control and altered
muscle recruitment pattern, have been reported.</p><p>The CORE exercise program involves active participation to improve lumbar stability by
recovering the ability to control muscles and movements through muscle strengthening<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The CORE exercise program, suggested by
Brill, focuses on lumbar stabilization by controlling tension of the lumbo-pelvic-hip joint,
thereby maintaining lumbar stability, strengthening muscles, increasing endurance, and
correcting posture<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One method of the CORE exercise program focuses on abdominal respiration. The abdominal
respiration method supplies oxygen smoothly throughout the body and expands lumbar muscle,
thus reducing muscle tension and stress, which ultimately alleviates fatigue. The CORE
exercise program can easily be conducted at home with almost no restrictions regarding
place, time, and cost, and has a low risk of injury<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is designed to suit CLBP patients by combining traditional yoga
movements and exercises to increase muscle strength and flexibility, and to correct posture.
However, the effectiveness of Brill&#x02019;s CORE exercise program on pain and AROM in CLBP
patients remains unclear. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the effects of the
CORE exercise program on pain at rest and during movement and on AROM in patients with
CLBP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients with CLBP at local clinics located in Seoul were recruited for this study.
Subjects were randomly assigned to the CORE group (n = 15) or the control group (n = 15).
Patients who had a history of spinal or lower limb operation, signs of nerve compression,
inflammatory diseases, or signs of aggravated acute pain or had performed stabilization
exercises within 6 months were excluded from the study. All experimental procedures were
conducted in accordance with the guidelines set by the local research ethics committee.</p><p>The subjects in the CORE group conducted the CORE exercise program for 30 minutes, 3 times
a week, for 4 weeks. This program is divided into 3 categories: warm up, conditioning, and
cool down, which are described in Brill&#x02019;s book<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The control group received routine care but did not perform the
CORE exercise program. The purpose and process of the study were explained to the subjects,
and they signed an informed consent form. In order to reduce measurement errors, assessments
were conducted by the same investigator in the same place before and after the
intervention.</p><p>All measurements were performed before and 1 day after the intervention. To assess the
degree of pain, a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) was used at rest and during movement.
Unpleasant sensation or pain felt when keeping still was considered pain at rest, and pain
experienced during full flexion of the trunk was considered pain during movement. Patients
wrote down their pain intensity on a 100&#x02005;mm-long table, and the investigator measured the
length and marked it (mm). Pain pressure threshold (PPT) in the lumbar region was measured
using an algometer (NeuroDyne Medical, Cambridge, MA, USA). Subjects were fully explained
the purpose of the experiment. The instrument was placed perpendicular to the quadratus
lumborum (2&#x02005;cm lateral to L3 spinous process)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and then pressure was applied to the region at a consistent pace
of 1&#x02005;kg/s. The subject was instructed to make a sound on experiencing an unpleasant feeling
or pain. This was considered the PPT. An inclinometer (Angle/Level, Dejon Tool Co.,
Covington, OH, USA) was used to measure AROM without lumbar pain. The tester measured the
total moved angle of lumbosacral flexion and extension with a single inclinometer placed
over the L1-S2 spinous processes.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v15.0. The independent t-test was performed
to compare the differences in dependent variables between groups, and the paired t-test was
used to evaluate the differences within groups. The level of probability was set at p &#x0003c;
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The baseline characteristics of the participants are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of the participants in this study</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CORE group<break/>(n=15)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group<break/>(n=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.1 &#x000b1; 7.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.5 &#x000b1; 7.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.2 &#x000b1; 7.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.6 &#x000b1; 8.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.5 &#x000b1; 11.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.1 &#x000b1; 10.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Onset time (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.9 &#x000b1; 7.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.4 &#x000b1; 8.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

important in determining treatment efficiency<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study applied Brill&#x02019;s CORE exercise program to CLBP patients
and showed that it is effective in resolving pain and improving AROM.</p><p>The VAS actually measures different items<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, no study has separately evaluated pain at rest and during
movement in patients with CLBP undergoing treatment with the CORE exercise program. Our
study measured pain at rest and during movement separately. The CORE group showed
significant decreases in pain at rest and during movement compared with those in the control
group, and the significant pain reduction was sustained after the experiment. This is
similar to the results of Goldby et al., which showed pain reduction in CLBP patients after
10 weeks of specific spinal stabilization, and those of Koumantakis, which showed the
continuation of significant pain reduction in patients with low back pain 3 months after
application of stabilization enhanced exercise<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Typically, during the performance
of a specific stabilization exercise, patients learn how to recruit the deep muscles of the
spine and gradually reduce undesirable excessive activity of other muscles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another benefit of the CORE exercise
program is the restoration of coordination and control of the trunk muscles to improve
control of the lumbar spine and pelvis<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Brill&#x02019;s CORE exercise program, which was used in this study, controls tension of the
lumbo-pelvic-hip joint, which maintains lumbar stability to strengthen muscles, increase
endurance, and correct posture. Such exercises showed similar effects in decreasing pain
intensity.</p><p>According to our results, the PPT in the CORE group increased significantly, while that in
the control group did not. This result corresponds to the result of a study by Senthil,
which confirmed a statistically significant increase in PPT after applying segmental
stabilization exercise in CLBP patients<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such a result shows that the CORE exercise program applied in CLBP
patients is effective in reducing back muscle spasm. Back muscle spasm is a clinical feature
of CLBP and is considered secondary pain<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the case of chronic pain conditions, such as CLBP, abnormal
pain processing due to central neuroplastic changes plays an important role. The changes are
caused by continued stimulation rather than by inflammation or damage to peripheral
structures. Therefore, patients experience increased sensitivity to pressure and to pain
stimuli of a normal degree<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, CLBP patients suffer from muscle weakness in
the lumbar spine<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the
biomechanical model theory, weakened muscles cause mechanical irritation in the lumbar
spine, thereby causing pain by stimulating pain-sensitive structures<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such continued
stimulation serves as an initial cause of central sensitization and chronic pain<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vicious cycle of pain causing spasm
and spasm worsening pain is a generally accepted concept at the moment<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The CORE exercise program is based on transverse
abdominis contraction that can strengthen spinal muscle and enhance lumbar stability by
maintaining spinal balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is assumed
that the CORE exercise program can restore the function of weakened muscles in CLBP patients
and augment the ability to support and control the spine and pelvis, thereby alleviating
mechanical irritation and pain, ultimately reducing spasm in the low back region.</p><p>This study measured lumbar AROM after intervention, and the angles of flexion in the CORE
group increased significantly compared with those before treatment. This is similar to the
result of the study by Hicks, in which AROM was increased with application of stabilization
exercise for 4 weeks in CLBP patients<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The CORE program includes hamstring stretching, which can increase the flexibility of the
hamstring; the double knee to chest exercise, lying spinal twist, which stretches the lumbar
region&#x02019;s muscles and soft tissues; and the cobra, which relieves tension on the back and
disk pressure.</p><p>This study confirmed that the CORE exercise program applied to patients with CLBP was
effective in reducing pain and increasing AROM. Based on our results, Brill&#x02019;s CORE exercise
program could be used as an effective exercise method for managing patients with CLBP and
promoting a healthy lifestyle.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research
