Combination therapy was statistically superior to methotrexate in obtaining higher ACR20/50/70 responses, more clinical remissions, greater mean reductions in DAS28(CRP), no radiographic progression, and normal functional status at week 26 (p&#x0003c;0.001 for all). The only factor predicting stable LDA was disease activity at week 12. Patients achieving ACR/EULAR remission, particularly in the PBO+MTX group, had some advantage in radiographic outcomes compared with patients who only achieved LDA (but not remission). The overall frequency of adverse events was comparable between groups. There were more serious infections and deaths in the ADA+MTX group, with a possible age effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with ADA+MTX was significantly superior to methotrexate alone with respect to clinical, radiographic and functional outcomes in patients with early active RA.

Some patients with early RA may achieve significant benefit from methotrexate monotherapy, without the need for further therapy with biologic agents. However, it has not been consistently possible to identify such patients a priori.</p><p>With greater clinical success, it has been suggested that the management of RA should shift towards earlier, more intensive treatment strategies with sustained remission, or the lowest possible disease activity, as the ultimate goal of therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> This is the essence of the &#x02018;treat-to-target&#x02019; theory: abrogation of inflammation should prevent joint damage and preserve physical function, consequently improving overall quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> The focus on a goal of remission has resulted in the recent introduction of stringent American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) remission criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Potential differences in outcomes between patients achieving remission and those achieving low disease activity (LDA) have not been fully explored.</p><p>Optimal Protocol for Treatment Initiation with Methotrexate and Adalimumab (OPTIMA) was a phase 4, multinational, randomised, double-blind, controlled trial conducted in two periods. In the first period, reported here, patients with early active RA were randomly assigned to receive adalimumab plus methotrexate (ADA+MTX) or placebo plus methotrexate (PBO+MTX) for 26 weeks. Clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes were assessed, including indicators of response in each of the groups, and differences in outcomes between patients who achieved increasingly stringent treatment targets. In the second period, patients were followed for an additional year after potential treatment adjustments based on achieving a stable LDA target.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were 18 years or older with a diagnosis of RA based on the 1987 ACR classification criteria,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> with a disease duration from diagnosis of less than 1 year.

Patients with a latent tuberculosis diagnosis based on positive purified protein derivative testing results according to local guidelines or other evidence were accepted if treatment for latent tuberculosis began before the administration of study drug. Patients who had received previous methotrexate, more than two synthetic DMARD, anti-TNF therapy, or any other biological DMARD were excluded, as were those receiving intra-articular or parenteral corticosteroids in the 4 weeks preceding screening.

Following multivariate selection, lower disease activity levels at week 12 were predictive of higher chances of achieving the stable LDA target for both treatment strategies. Decreased numbers of swollen joints and lower patient's global assessment scores at week 12 were modestly associated with reaching the stable LDA target for both ADA+MTX (p values: SJC66 OR 1.14 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.20), p&#x0003c;0.001; patient's global OR 1.05 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.07), p&#x0003c;0.001) and for methotrexate monotherapy (SJC66 OR 1.19 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.27), p&#x0003c;0.001; patient's global OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.05), p&#x0003c;0.001).

At 26 weeks, approximately twice as many ADA+MTX-treated patients attained states of LDA and remission, including the new 2010 provisional ACR/EULAR remission criteria and the stable LDA target of DAS28(CRP) less than 3.2 at weeks 22 and 26, compared with PBO+MTX-treated patients, with significant clinical and functional differences observed as early as week 2.</p><p>OPTIMA extends the findings of previous trials of TNF inhibitors in early RA, including PREMIER.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Clinical outcomes observed at week 26 in OPTIMA were comparable to those at week 52 in PREMIER. However, the mean disease duration in OPTIMA was 4 months and thus the shortest among multinational clinical trials of TNF inhibitors in early RA. As an especially aggressive patient cohort was recruited, not surprisingly, patients exhibited the presence of poor prognostic markers, such as elevated CRP, high swollen joint counts, existing joint damage and a high frequency (&#x0003e;80%) of autoantibodies (RF and/or anticitrullinated protein antibodies). Given the risk of joint damage potentially associated with these factors, significant radiographic progression was already seen at 26 weeks in the methotrexate monotherapy group, while significant inhibition of joint damage was observed with ADA+MTX treatment, supporting the recommendation for the aggressive treatment of patients with early, active RA and poor prognostic factors, particularly if patients do not attain LDA on methotrexate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></p><p>It is of great interest and utility to clinicians to predict clinical outcomes a priori or even early into a course of therapy. In this study, the only predictors of clinical outcome at week 26 were measures of ongoing disease activity after 12 weeks of treatment, which is in alignment with treatment guidelines. This is a logical result, given that these factors are components of the score used to assess LDA. These data confirm that responses within 3 months of treatment initiation are predictive of lower disease activity long term.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></p><p>For patients who respond to treatment, the radiographic and functional consequences of achieving LDA versus remission are largely unexplored. When fulfilling ACR/EULAR index-based remission criteria, there was no mean progression of joint damage in either treatment arm. Not surprisingly, methotrexate-treated patients experienced significantly higher progression of joint damage when less stringent outcomes were used, such as DAS28(CRP) remission or LDA, compared with the new ACR/EULAR criteria. In contrast, radiographic benefits were comparable and robust in ADA+MTX-treated patients, irrespective of the achievement of stable outcomes, consistent with previous observations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Nevertheless, as radiographic progression is very low even in LDA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> our results suggest that an LDA target is reasonable and desirable for many patients. Similar findings were observed when assessing functional benefits for either treatment arm, namely lower HAQ values with increasing stringency of criteria. In sum, despite the smaller numbers of patients in the post-hoc subgroup analysis, it appears that both the stringency of the target and the treatment utilised impacted radiographic and functional outcomes.</p><p>Most AE in this study were comparable to those observed in other studies of TNF inhibitors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> The overall frequency of serious infections was consistent with the known safety profile for adalimumab. More deaths were observed in ADA+MTX patients versus PBO+MTX patients, which is inconsistent with previous clinical trial experience.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Advanced age and comorbidities have been reported in some analyses as risk factors for immunomodulatory therapy toxicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Older patients were over-represented, with four of six deaths in the ADA+MTX arm occurring in patients over 70 years old. In retrospect, the prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities in these patients appeared as possible contributing factors. Although adalimumab conferred enhanced clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes, the risks of treatment should be considered before initiating therapy, particularly in older patients and those with comorbidities or conditions that may predispose them to infection.</p><p>In summary, significant improvements in clinical and functional outcomes were observed as early as week 2 and continued to week 26 with ADA+MTX treatment. Combination therapy allowed one in five patients to achieve stringent remission according to the new ACR/EULAR definition within 6 months of treatment initiation, and an additional almost 30% achieved LDA; the data also reveal that approximately half of these proportions can be attained with methotrexate monotherapy. Early intervention with combination therapy also offered substantial protection from radiographic damage compared with methotrexate monotherapy. These results expand information on the use of combination methotrexate plus TNF inhibitors as a treatment option with substantial therapeutic benefits in patients with early, active RA. As with the use of any potent immunomodulatory therapy, patients should be appropriately screened before and closely monitored during treatment for relevant safety concerns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web figure</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2011-201247-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e847" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web figure</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2011-201247-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e855" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Elaine M Smith and Theresa J Peterson, of Abbott, drafted and revised the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Abbott Laboratories sponsored this study (NCT00420927), led development of the study design in collaboration with academic investigators, and analysed the primary data.
