training on the cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) of individuals suffering from myocardial
infarction. [Subjects] A total of 60 participants were divided into experimental (EXP;
n=30, mean age 56.7 &#x000b1; 2.8&#x02005;years, body mass 80.7 &#x000b1; 10.7&#x02005;kg, body height 171.9 &#x000b1; 7.2&#x02005;cm) and
control (CON; n=30, mean age 56.5 &#x000b1; 3.1&#x02005;years, body mass 84.4 &#x000b1; 12.4&#x02005;kg, body height 171.5
&#x000b1; 12.4&#x02005;cm) groups. [Methods] The members of the EXP group took part in an organized daily
physical exercise program (Monday through Sunday), for a period of 3 weeks. The exercise
program consisted of 60&#x02005;min daily specialized fitness exercises with an intensity ranging
from 55&#x02013;70% of the maximum heart rate, which was determined by test on a bicycle
ergometer. The effects of the exercise were monitored by means of the following
parameters: maximum oxygen uptake (VO2peak), resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure
and diastolic blood pressure. [Results] The results indicate statistically significant
post-exercise improvements in heart rate, relative oxygen uptake and systolic blood
pressure, among the members of the EXP group. The results indicate that at the initial
measurement of cardiorespiratory fitness no statistically significant differences were
found between the groups at the multivariate level (Wilk's &#x003bb;=0.83), while statistically
significant differences in the cardiorespiratory fitness were found at the final
measurement (Wil's &#x003bb;=0.430). [Conclusion] The obtained results indicate that the exercise
program, which lasted for a period of 21 days, though shorter in duration than other
programs still led to statistically significant changes in the CRF of individuals
suffering from MI.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd><kwd>Functional capacity</kwd><kwd>Aerobic training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Diseases of the cardiovascular system are at the top of the scale of modern-day illnesses
and are leading causes of death in most developed and developing countries. Cardiovascular
disease, especially myocardial infarction (MI), is responsible for from one third to one
half of all deaths and is the main cause of death among both men and women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Until the 1960s, bed rest and/or major
limitation of exercise were considered beneficial for the majority of patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the benefits of exercise training
for patients with cardiovascular disease are now generally accepted as a non-pharmacological
intervention for improve their fitness levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Part of the rehabilitation of cardiovascular patients includes a physical activity
program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, which is especially important for people who have been diagnosed
with MI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Today, various exercise programs
such as cardiorespiratory endurance (aerobic) training, flexibility exercises, arm exercises
and muscular resistance (strength) training, represent part of the recovery program for
individuals suffering from MI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
rehabilitation of individuals suffering from MI is currently topic of great interest, not
only due the frequency and increased number of MI occurrences, but also because of the very
course the illness takes, which over time significantly reduces an individual's ability to
work and leads to disability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
population of individuals who would benefit significantly from cardiovascular rehabilitation
is not limited to people who have suffered an MI, but also includes individuals who suffer
from peripheral blood vessel disorders, angina pectoris, hypertension and the like. Prior to
the start of a physical exercise program, it is necessary to analyze an entire range of
factors which are related to the individual who is considering joining the program. The
following characteristics need to be taken into consideration: age, gender, prior physical
activity levels, motivation for participating in the program, the status of the locomotor
apparatus, and especially the residual functions of the cardiovascular system.</p><p>Cardiorespiratory capacity has been shown to improve during training in post-myocardial
infarction patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercises that are
prescribed for individuals with MI have changed over the years, ranging from standard
exercises meant for everyone, all the way to exercises tailored to each individual, which
are created on the basis of risk factors, age and state of function. Proper dosing and
controlled physical activity do not have negative effects, which has been proven in various
research programs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is not exercise itself that endangers the health of individuals
suffering from MI, but primarily the way in which the exercise takes place and the extent of
the load, both in the qualitative and quantitative senses. Certain authors have indicated
that people who have suffered MI are able to run, even run marathons, which indicates that
the functional abilities of these individuals, following the realization of certain exercise
programs, can be quite great<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is the
recommendation of experts that all exercise programs contain dynamic work, which includes
large muscle groups, and which lies at the basis of everyday physical activities such as
walking, running, riding a bicycle, swimming and the like. Walking and riding a
bicycle-ergometer have always been the most popular forms of exercise. Even walking at a
relatively slow pace can be a sufficient stimulus for the improvement of the cardiovascular
fitness (CRF) of individuals suffering from a cardiovascular disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most important determinants of exercise in patients suffering from MI, which should
always be taken into consideration, include the following: intensity, duration and
frequency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the type of physical
load. The intensity of the exercise should be greater than the intensity of everyday
activities, and below the level which leads to bad clinical symptoms or the occurrence of
pain, in order to achieve positive changes. In addition, attention must be paid to the
intensity of the exercise, keeping it above the lower threshold of intensity, as otherwise
the exercise would not have any desired effects.</p><p>Scientific reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup> have recommended various types, durations and frequencies
of different levels of physical activity load for individuals suffering from MI. The
intensity should range from 40&#x02013;45% to 60% of the maximum heart rate (HRmax) achieved during
a load test<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some authors have stated
that exercise intensity should not exceed 70% HRmax<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, while other institutions and researchers have reported that
exercise programs for the improvement of the CRF of individuals suffering from MI should be
performed at an intensity between 60 to 80% HRmax<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The duration of the exercise,
according to some researchers, should last from 4 to 6 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, or from 10 to 12 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, with varying exercise frequencies
and individual exercise duration. There are even some studies with exercise programs that
lasted up to 24 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Kargarfart et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that a 2-month
exercise rehabilitation program for post-MI patients is useful for improving both blood
pressure and exercise capacity, and they opined that it should be more commonly used.
Previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup> have also shown that
exercises, if udertaken at moderate intensities, can result in improvements in health and
aerobic capacity. After acute MI, aerobic exercise promotes a decrease in percentage body
fat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, HRmax<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, reduces blood pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, and increases VO2peak<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, despite its importance, there is still controversy
regarding the level and format of exercises that can yield optimal beneficial effects.
Indeed, studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup> of the effects of
exercise training of cardiorespiratory fitness in patients after MI have mainly focused on
long-term aerobic training. To our knowledge, practical issues such as the optimal
intensity, volume and modalities of short term training effects are still unclear.
Therefore, this study was carried out with the aim of determining the effects of a physical
exercise program on the CRF of individuals suffering from MI. We hypothesized that
short-term aerobic training would improve the cardiorespiratory fitness of patients after
myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Sixty of 73 male participants finished the training program and participated in the
initial and final testing. Ten participants dropped out from the experimental group and 3
from the control group. Participants dropped out from the experimental group due to
cardiac arrhythmia (n=2), lack of motivation to exercise (n=4), and lack of availability
to participate in the study (n=4); three participants in the control group died. The
sample of 60 males, with an average age of 56.15 &#x000b1; 2.95&#x02005;years belonged to one of two
groups, an experimental (EXP) or a control (CON) group; all participants had suffered a
MI. The EXP group consisted of 30 participants, with an average body mass of 80.67 &#x000b1;
10.7&#x02005;kg, body height of 171.92 &#x000b1; 7.2&#x02005;cm, and BMI of 27.20 &#x000b1; 3.80&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The CON

between 50 and 60&#x02005;years old; myocardial infarction; ability to pedal independently on a
static bicycle; physical independence &#x02212; able to walk without assistance, and lack of
cognitive impairment or dementia, assessed as a score of more than 24 points for the
educated and 18 points for the unqualified respondents in the mini-mental state
evaluation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Excluded from the study
were patients with poor exercise tolerance (working capacity, less than 1&#x02005;W/kg body wt),
heart rhythm disturbances greater than Lown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup> classification IVa, or orthopedic difficulties that prevented
them from participating in the exercise program. The EXP group was involved in an exercise
program which consisted of calisthenics exercises, walking and riding a static bicycle,
which lasted for a period of three weeks. All three types of exercises were performed
daily. The experimental exercise program was carried out in the facilities and on the
fields belonging to the Institute For Treatment and Rehabilitation &#x0201c;Ni&#x00161;ka Banja&#x0201d; (Ni&#x00161;,
Republic of Serbia). The members of the CON group did not take part in any organized forms
of exercise. The members of both groups continued their prescribed pharmacological
therapy, as they had done prior to the study.</p><p>The Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Nis,
certified that this investigation conformed to all ethical standards regarding scientific
investigations involving human participants according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participation in the study was voluntary and each of the participants could withdraw from
the study at any time. All participants were fully informed about the risks and benefits
that this research would have for their age group before they signed a consent form.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Beside the results, the basic anthropometric parameters (body height and body weight)
were recoreded in the study protocol. The initial testing took place before the beginning
of the training program, and the final testing was performed after 21 days of
intervention. To prevent unnecessary fatigue accumulation, the participants were
instructed to avoid exercise for a 24-hour period before each testing session. During
testing, the air temperature ranged from 22&#x02005;&#x000b0;C to 27&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. The testing always commenced at
10 a.m. and was completed by 1 p.m. The assessments and part of the exercise sessions
(calisthenics and riding a static bicycle) took place in the therapy room at the
participants' rehabilitation center while walking activities took place on outdoor paths
under the supervision of a researcher, a chartered therapist qualified to prescribe and
oversee such exercise. The heart rate of the participants was monitored during the
exercise and any adverse events were recorded on the exercise data collection sheet.</p><p>Body weight was assessed to the nearest 0.1&#x02005;kg using a SECA Beam Balance Scale 700 (SECA
GmBH &#x00026; Co, Hamburg, Germany) with the participants wearing minimal clothing. Body
height was assessed to the nearest 0.1&#x02005;cm using a portable SECA Stadiometer 282 (SECA GmBH
&#x00026; Co, Hamburg, Germany). The stadiometer and scale were calibrated periodically during
the study. Body mass index was calculated using the formula: BMI=body weight (kg) / (body
height (m))<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>For the purpose of evaluating the CRF, the following measures were used: maximum oxygen
uptake (VO2peak), and relative oxygen uptake (relative VO2peak), calculated using the
submaximum standardized load test on a static exercise bicycle (Ergometer AX1; Heinze
Kettler, GmbH &#x00026; Co, Germany). We also monitored heart rate (PC-15; SIGMA Elektro, Gmbh
&#x00026; Co, Germany), resting heart rate (beat/min), systolic arterial blood pressure
(mmHg), and diastolic arterial blood pressure (mmHg).</p><p><italic>Maximal oxygen uptake</italic>. Sub-maximal exercise testing was carried out on a
static cycle ergometer (Ergometer AX1; Heinze Kettler, GmbH &#x00026; Co, Germany) at a
submaximal workload using the Astrand-Rhyming protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The test protocol was started after a rest period of 10&#x02005;min in
the supine position. The test comprised of a 3-min warm-up at a workload of 50&#x02005;W, followed
by a constant workload at 100&#x02013;130 W for 6&#x02013;7 minutes until the participants met the
steady-state heart rate. This was followed by a 3-min recovery period with workload set at
50&#x02005;W, followed by a 10-min rest period in the supine position. The load chosen in each
case was determined by the weight and age of the person, or heart rate during the first
minute of the test. We determined the VO2peak indirectly using Astrand's nomogram due to
the high correlation between directly and indirectly measured VO2peak<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. This method has previously been decribed in detail<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p><italic>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure</italic>. Evaluation of blood pressure was
conducted by an automatic digital device OMRON M4-1 (OMRON Healthcare Europe BV,
Netherlands). The cuff was positioned around the forearm of the seated male and female
subjects about three centimetres above the elbow. The results were read in mmHg. Before
the measurement, the subjects rested in a seated position. Three minutes of rest was taken
by the participants between three successive readings of blood pressure. Although the
three readings were different with the largest value being the first reading and the
smallest being the third reading on average, these differed by no more than 2 mmHg of
systolic blood pressure, and no more than 4.5 mmHg of diastolic blood pressure. We chose
to take the average of the second and third readings as recommended by the World Health
Organisation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup> in order to increase

divided into three parts, each including: calisthenics exercises; walking along fitness
trails with an asphalt surface, 800 to 2000&#x02005;m in length, with a 2% incline; and riding a
static bicycle. The 3-week daily (Monday through Sunday) training consisted of the
following activities.</p><p><italic>Morning sessions:</italic> Activities included walking on paths graded to the
capacity of the patients according to the score achieved during the initial test and
calisthenics exercises (23&#x02013;30 exercises for different muscle groups). Each calisthenics
exercise was repeated 10 times. During the walking activity patients had 2&#x02013;3 active rest
pauses (breathing exercises).</p><p><italic>Afternoon sessions:</italic> Participants rode a static bicycle for 10 minutes in
the first and second weeks and for 15 minutes in the third week. The workload was 25&#x02005;W in
the first and second weeks and 50&#x02005;W in the third week of the training program. All
sessions had equal duration of work and rest interval (5 vs. 5 minute).</p><p>The overall duration of the daily exercise sessions ranged from 45 minutes in the
beginning up to 60 minutes at the end of the program. The exercise intensity progressively
increased from 55% to 70% HRmax based on the results that were achieved during the
previously carried out standardized load test on the bicycle-ergometer. Training was
monitored daily by a heart rate monitor (PC-15; SIGMA Elektro, Gmbh &#x00026; Co, Germany) and
blood pressure recordings were made before and after each training session.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft. Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all experimental data. In addition, the
Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test of the normality of distribution was performed for all variables
before the analysis, the homogeneity of variance was tested by the Levene test. To
determine whether statistically significant differences existed between the means of the
EXP and CON groups' initial and final measurement, we used a multivariate and univariate
analyses of variance (MANOVA/ANOVA). The differences between the initial and final
measurements of the EXP and CON groups were determined using the t-test. For the purpose
of determining the effects of the exercise following the completion of the exercise

the members of the CON group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The primary purpose of the current study was to determine the short-term effect of a
physical exercise program on the CRF of individuals suffering from MI. We observed that the
3-week training program led to significant improvements in measurements of VO2peak, systolic
BP, heart rate, but had no discernible effect on dyastolic BP. On the basis of the results
of the initial and final measurements of the CON group, decreases were noted for Heart Rate,
Systolic BP and Diastolic BP at the final measurement. Heart Rate was reduced by 1 beat/min,
Systolic BP by 5.83 mmHg, while Diastolic BP was decreased by 2.50 mmHg. In the case of the
members of the control group at the final measurement, the VO2peak showed a higher numeric
value than the initial measurement. The improvement in the VO2peak can be explained by the
&#x0201c;spontaneous&#x0201d; improvement in functional aerobic capacity, which can occur during regular
recovery periods, which allows greater daily work activities unrelated to regular physical
exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even in the values for
relative VO2peak a mild increase was noted at the final measurement in comparison to the
initial one. Similar results have also been noted by other authors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. These authors
concluded that the improvement in the functioning of the cardiovascular system took place
due to improvement in sympathetic nervous activity, along with an improvement in heart
function, which are not related to exercise. The results of participants tended to increase,
irrespective of whether they took part in exercise programs or not.</p><p>The values of heart rate in the EXP group at the final measurement, compared to the initial
one, were reduced (though not in a statistically significant manner) by 3.14 beats/min.
Changes to the heart rate were most likely the result of the influence of the exercise
program; that is, the exercise led to a lower heart rate following the completion of the
program. One group of researchers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup> have
reported that following the completion of an exercise program, a decrease can occur in heart
rate of 5 beats/min. A decrease in heart rate following the completion of an exercise
program, has been noted by other authors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The decreases in systolic BP of 7 mmHg and diastolic BP of around 4 mmHg were not
statistically significant, but are in agreement with previous research, confirming there is
a decrease in arterial blood pressure following the completion of a physical exercise
program. These decreases in systolic BP and diastolic BP can range from 5 to 10 mmHg<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. In an analysis of 22 studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref><sup>)</sup> it was determined that physical exercise
programs lead to decreases in systolic BP of 6.4 mmHg and diastolic BP of 6.9 mmHg. The
positive effects of physical exercise on the decrease in arterial blood pressure have also
been confirmed in meta-analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
authors of the meta-analysis reached the conclusion that properly programmed and dosed
physical activity undoubtedly leads to a decrease in arterial blood pressure (3.84 mmHg for
systolic and 2.58 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure). In the meta-analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref><sup>)</sup>, which included 54 randomly selected
controlled studies comprising 2419 individuals, it was determined that physical exercise
programs of an aerobic character, which lasted for a period of at least two weeks, resulted
in significant decreases in arterial blood pressure. The decreases in systolic and diastolic
BP, following physical exercise programs has been reported by other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>. The
reduced values of arterial blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, are most likely the
result of increased elasticity of the blood vessels.</p><p>Between the initial and final measurements of the members of the EXP group, a numerical
increase was found in relative VO2peak (p=0.009). The overall increase of the EXP group was
9.1%, and this result is in accordance with the results of previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. In one study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref><sup>)</sup> of individuals with cardiovascular diseases, increases of
15% to 20% of maximum oxygen uptake were observed, following the completion of a physical
activity program. Other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref><sup>)</sup> have reported that physical exercise can
increase oxygen uptake from 11% to 36%. What is especially emphasized is the smaller
increase in relative oxygen uptake of 21% of individuals who are in post-myocardial
infarction period<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref><sup>)</sup>. The percentage of
improvement in VO2peak following the completion of a physical exercise program is equal in
the case of men and women, but the greatest improvements have been found in people who
initially had the worst aerobic abilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. These improvements are similar to those
of the elderly or younger individuals who take part in various exercise programs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The changes that took place among the members of the EXP group were also determined for
VO2peak but they were not significant, only numerically greater. There was a statistically
significant difference between the groups at the final measurement, and from this result we
infer that the completed exercise program had a positive effect on the CRF of the members of
the EXP group. Statistically significant differences were also found for heart rate,
relative VO2peak and systolic BP. Heart rate and systolic BP were numerically smaller in the
EXP group, which in this case constitutes a better result. The results are in accordance
with the results obtained by other researchers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The decreases in arterial blood pressure of 4.2 mmHg for systolic and 1.6 mmHg for
diastolic pressure are within the range of results that other researchers have reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref><sup>)</sup>. The possible mechanisms which induce a decrease in arterial blood
pressure are indirectly related to the decrease in the effects of the sympathetic nervous
system (the dominance of the vagus nerves over the sympathetic nervous system) and
vasoconstriction among individuals who take part in physical exercise.</p><p>The present study had a number of strengths, including topicality, and a large number of
participants. Besides that, we should note some specific study limitations. This study used
an indirect estimation of the maximal oxygen uptake by the Astrand nomogram. Also, BMI was
determined using a predictive equation instead of a more accurate measure such as
bioelectrical impedance. Therefore, in future researches direct methods for estimating the
VO2peak and body composition should be used. Consequently, future studies should deal with
the influence of various exercises program on the CRF of patients suffering from MI. Also,
longitudinal studies with several points of measurement, which would allow tracking and
correction for changes in CRF, would provide greater insight into the relationship between
exercises and MI.</p><p>The members of the EXP group had higher VO2peak and relative VO2peak values, indicating
that positive changes occurred as a result of the exercise program. The members of the EXP
group at the final measurement had higher values of VO2peak compared to the control group,
but they were not statistically significant. A significant difference was determined for
relative VO2peak. The results of the completed exercise program are in accordance with the
results of previous research programs, which also had the aim of determining the influence
of physical activity on functional abilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of these research programs
indicate that proper dosing and controlled short-term physical exercise can have a positive
effect on the cardiovascular function of individuals who exercise. In the early stages of
the post-infarction period, there is a need for activities at an intensity and extent that
would contribute to the improvement of cardiovascular functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ades</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention of
