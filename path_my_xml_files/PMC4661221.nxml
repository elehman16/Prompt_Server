Additionally, there is an increased release of phosphorus from the bone due to dysregulation in calcium balance and hyperparathyroidism.</p><p>Hyperphosphataemia has been associated with a variety of long-term complications and can affect any organ system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Prolonged hyperphosphataemia leads to soft-tissue and vascular calcification. Calcification of coronary arteries, cardiac valves, and pulmonary tissues is associated with cardiac disease, the leading cause of death in patients with kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to prevent and treat hyperphosphataemia and maintain serum phosphorus levels within the recommended ranges.</p><p>The mainstay of treatment is dietary phosphorus restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; however, many patients require pharmacologic management with phosphate-binding drugs. Currently available phosphate-binding agents include aluminium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate (CC), calcium acetate, sevelamer carbonate (SC), and lanthanum carbonate (LC).</p><p>The British Renal Association guidelines recommend that in patients with kidney disease, serum phosphorus, if elevated, should be lowered towards the normal range, between 1.1 and 1.8&#x000a0;mmol/L (3.41&#x02013;5.57&#x000a0;mg/dL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In Scotland, first-line treatment of hyperphosphataemia consists primarily of CC. Patients intolerant of or not responsive to CC can be treated with a second-line therapy based on noncalcium-based phosphate binders. SC is a noncalcium-based phosphate binder and is currently the market leader in this class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide (PA21) is a new calcium-free polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide phosphate binder with a high phosphate binding capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The authors aimed to determine the health economic impact of PA21 and SC as competing treatment options in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving maintenance dialysis and with hyperphosphataemia. PA21 and SC were compared from the perspective of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>A Markov cohort model was constructed using TreeAge Pro 2014 Suite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA) to assess the cost effectiveness of therapy with PA21 compared with SC. Given the potentially long-term consequences of the initial treatment decision, a lifelong time horizon was used.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Efficacy and Safety Data</title><p>Clinical model inputs were predominantly based on the efficacy and safety results of the PA-CL-05A/B trial. This trial studied 1041 (PA21 <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;694, SC <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;347) and 658 (PA21 <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;391, SC <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;267) maintenance dialysis patients enrolled in the US as well as several European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and the UK. Patients had a history of hyperphosphataemia and of receiving stable doses of phosphate binders. In the PA-CL-05A study, subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to either PA21 or SC, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In both trial arms, study drug was titrated for safety and efficacy during a 12-week titration period, and patients then received maintenance treatment for an additional 12&#x000a0;weeks (stage 1, total duration 24&#x000a0;weeks). Subjects who completed stage 1 of the PA-CL-05A study at week&#x000a0;24 and who consented to participate in stage 2 (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100) were randomised to receive either PA21 or SC at the dose administered at the end of week&#x000a0;24, or low-dose PA21 for 3&#x000a0;weeks. In the PA-CL-05B trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], subjects continued to receive either PA21 or SC as allocated at randomisation into PA-CL-05A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], at the same dose they were taking at the end of PA-CL-05A (week&#x000a0;24 for subjects who only participated in stage 1 and week&#x000a0;27 for subjects who participated in stage 2). Treatment with PA21 and SC continued for a further 28&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The primary endpoint was change in serum phosphorus level. The trial publications by Floege et al. reported the results of each phase of the trial separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, the second publication reported efficacy for the entire trial period (phases A and B combined), but focused on completers only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In contrast, all PA-CL-05A/B-based parameters used in this analysis were based on the full analysis set (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1041), as available from a currently unpublished clinical study report.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> In this set, the PA-CL-05A/B trial (phases A and B combined) showed overall mean reductions of serum phosphorus of 1.93&#x000a0;mg/dL (95&#x000a0;% confidence interval [CI] 1.78&#x02013;2.08) and 1.95&#x000a0;mg/dL (95&#x000a0;% CI 1.73&#x02013;2.17) in the PA21 and SC arms, respectively (see Footnote <xref rid="Fn1" ref-type="">1</xref>). These reductions were taken into account in the base-case analysis. A nonsignificant survival difference (relative risk [RR] 0.714 for PA21 vs. SC; 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.37&#x02013;1.40) observed between the trial arms was taken into account in a scenario analysis (see Footnote <xref rid="Fn1" ref-type="">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Structure of the Markov Model</title><p>The structure of the Markov model is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The mortality effect due to elevated serum phosphorus, and the treatment effect of PA21 and SC on serum phosphorus, were the two principal mechanisms in the model. Patients started on either PA21 or SC treatment at a mean serum phosphorus starting level of 7.59&#x000a0;mg/dL (see Footnote <xref rid="Fn1" ref-type="">1</xref>). Initial survival was adapted to account for the increased risk of mortality associated with a high baseline serum phosphorus level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The subsequent treatment-induced risk reduction was based on the mean reductions of phosphorus levels observed in the PA21 and SC arms of the PA-CL-05A/B trial (see Footnote <xref rid="Fn1" ref-type="">1</xref>), as reported above. The risk reduction was assumed to apply immediately after the initiation of treatment. Patients either continued their initial treatment or switched to the alternative treatment in case of withdrawal or sustained hyperphosphataemia. These options are represented by the six mutually exclusive health states of the model: on-target (patients continue and achieve target serum phosphorus levels), off-target (patients remain hyperphosphataemic), alternative treatment on-target (patients switched to alternative treatment achieve target phosphorus level), alternative treatment off-target (patients switched to alternative treatment receive maximum drug dose but do not achieve target phosphorus levels), renal transplant (implying the end of hyperphosphataemia treatment), and death, with stage transitions at the end of each cycle. Markov cycle length was set at 1&#x000a0;month and half-cycle correction was implemented as appropriate. According to the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) report, the expected remaining lifespan is approximately 8&#x000a0;years for dialysis patients aged 40&#x02013;44&#x000a0;years and approximately 4.5&#x000a0;years for those aged 60&#x02013;64 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Mean age at model entry was 56&#x000a0;years. The model adopted a lifetime time horizon represented by a maximum of 44&#x000a0;years (528 cycles), corresponding to age 100&#x000a0;years. Costs were assessed from the third-party payer perspective of the Scottish NHS, i.e. indirect costs were not included. Costs and effects occurring after year&#x000a0;1 were discounted at 3.5&#x000a0;%. The primary endpoints of this analysis were undiscounted survival, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost per QALY gained reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Decision analysis model. <bold>a</bold> Structure of the Markov model; <bold>b</bold> generic structure of the hyperphosphataemia treatment pathway model with six mutually exclusive health states. <italic>PA21</italic> sucroferric oxyhydroxide</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40273_2015_320_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Base-Case Assumptions</title><p>The modelled patient cohort was assumed to be intolerant to calcium-based phosphate binders. Due to high intolerance regarding calcium-based phosphate binders, we assumed that patients did not switch from a calcium-free to a calcium-based phosphate binder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For the base-case analysis, the following additional assumptions were made.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The risk of mortality for treated patients was driven by a mean reduction of serum phosphorus of 1.93&#x000a0;mg/dL (0.62&#x000a0;mmol/L, conversion factor 0.323) for PA21, and 1.95&#x000a0;mg/dL (0.63&#x000a0;mmol/L, conversion factor 0.323) for SC (see Footnote <xref rid="Fn1" ref-type="">1</xref>). RRs of mortality corresponding to these reductions of serum phosphorus levels were assigned and the resulting changes in mortality risk were applied to all patients receiving treatment, as calculation of the underlying average reductions also included patients who were &#x02018;off-target&#x02019;, i.e. experienced sustained hyperphosphataemia.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It was assumed that after the start of hyperphosphataemia treatment, patients were immediately &#x02018;on-target&#x02019; or &#x02018;off-target&#x02019;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The treatment-specific percentage of withdrawals due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) seen in the PA-CL-05A/B trial was applied to patients &#x02018;on-target&#x02019; (distributed over 1&#x000a0;year, corresponding to the trial observation period). &#x02018;On-target&#x02019; patients who withdrew from PA21 or SC due to TEAEs were assumed to switch to the other drug and were either &#x02018;on-target&#x02019; (with treatment continuing at standard dose) or &#x02018;off-target&#x02019; (with treatment continuing at maximum dose), based on the distribution of treatment success versus sustained hyperphosphataemia observed in the trial for each substance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with persistent hyperphosphataemia (&#x02018;off-target&#x02019;) switched to the other drug during half a year. After the switch from PA21 to SC, or vice versa, patients were also either &#x02018;on-target&#x02019; (with treatment continuing at the standard dose) or &#x02018;off-target&#x02019; (with treatment continuing at the maximum dose), according to the proportions seen in the entire trial (see Footnote <xref rid="Fn1" ref-type="">1</xref>). The same treatment-specific mean reductions of serum phosphorus as observed in the trial (see Footnote <xref rid="Fn1" ref-type="">1</xref>) were assumed (1.93&#x000a0;mg/dL for PA21 and 1.95&#x000a0;mg/dL for SC).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The occurrence of transplantations was set to zero in the base-case analysis, and dialysis and transplantation costs were excluded because these costs were not significantly affected by the choice of phosphate binder.

<sup>a</sup>For the cost-effectiveness analysis, the results of the combined endpoint of the PA-CL-05A/B trials obtained in the full analysis set were used. In the studies by Floege et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the mean reduction of serum phosphorus levels was presented only for completers of the study</p><p>

<sup>c</sup>SE was unknown and assumed to be 0.05</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>In order to provide a basis for modelling the impact of PA21 and SC treatment on survival, the following steps were undertaken (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). First, a Weibull distribution was defined to reflect the survival curve for patients with a kidney transplant, as reported in the Scottish Renal Registry (SRR) report (Table D3.1 in the report) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Subsequently, a Weibull distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] reflecting the survival of patients receiving dialysis, as available from the UK Annual Renal Registry report (Table&#x000a0;8.10 in the report) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], was implemented such that the joint survival curve of patients receiving dialysis and patients with a kidney transplant matched the overall survival estimates for all patients receiving renal replacement therapy, as available from the SRR report (Table C1.3 in the report) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Importantly, the impact of serum phosphorus levels on mortality was set to zero before these steps were undertaken. Because the baseline phosphorus levels in the PA-CL-05A/B trial full-analysis population (average across arms, 7.59&#x000a0;mg/dL or 2.45&#x000a0;mmol/L; conversion factor 0.323 (see Footnote <xref rid="Fn1" ref-type="">1</xref>)) were higher than in the SRR population (4.86&#x000a0;mg/dL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]), the &#x02018;starting&#x02019; mortality of the modelled cohort was subsequently adjusted &#x02018;upwards&#x02019; to reflect this difference. It was assumed that for every 1&#x000a0;mg/dL increase in serum phosphorus, the risk of mortality would increase by 35&#x000a0;% (RR 1.35; 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.16&#x02013;1.57), based on a meta-analysis by Palmer et al. including studies that adequately controlled for confounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. On this basis, and assuming the same RR per 1&#x000a0;mg/dL change, the phosphorus level changes observed in the trial could be applied (Palmer et al. also reported a second, more conservative estimate of the increase in mortality risk per 1&#x000a0;mg/dL increase in serum phosphorus of 1.18 (95&#x000a0;% CI 1.12&#x02013;1.25), partially based on less adequately controlled studies. This value was used in a scenario analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

By using the PA21 strategy, one would save &#x020a4;174,999 (or &#x020a4;123,463 when including dialysis and transplantation costs) for one QALY forgone. The underlying small QALY loss is partially driven by differences in TEAE occurrence between treatment strategies. When modelling the nonsignificant reduction in mortality (RR 0.714 for PA21 vs. SC) observed in the PA-CL-05A/B trial in a scenario analysis, the PA21 strategy accrued more QALYs and was more expensive than the SC strategy, leading to an ICER of &#x020a4;22,621. The relative increase in costs on the PA21 side was due to improved survival and hence longer times on hyperphosphataemia and renal replacement therapy.</p><p>Additional sensitivity and scenario analyses generally confirmed these observations but indicated a substantial degree of uncertainty due to sensitivity to some model parameters. The DSA showed that pill burden, while being a serious problem for patient adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], also substantially impacted the ICER over a patient&#x02019;s lifetime. Also influential were the drug costs of PA21 and SC, as well as the change in mean serum phosphorus level (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Importantly, the model was not sensitive to changes in the number of withdrawals, health state utilities, utility decrements, proportion of patients with sustained hyperphosphataemia, or occurrence of TEAEs. Assuming a lower impact of serum phosphorus level change on mortality did not alter the direction of the results. Including the occurrence of transplantations, as well as costs for dialysis and transplantation, resulted in higher total costs, but an unchanged cost difference and similar QALYs accrued for both treatment strategies. The same trend was seen when a 500&#x000a0;% increase in AE costs was assumed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Calcium-based binders have been the standard of care in phosphate-binding therapy for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In cases where this first-line therapy is not indicated (e.g. in hypercalcaemic patients), noncalcium phosphate binders are recommended for use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In terms of clinical effectiveness, there is evidence that SC is able to achieve similar reductions in serum phosphorus levels as CC, with a similar pill burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">26</xref>]. Some reports have addressed the cost effectiveness of other noncalcium phosphate binders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] but the current analysis is the first to assess the cost effectiveness of the novel drug PA21 in the treatment of hyperphosphataemia. The majority of data inputs could also be applied to the UK and therefore we believe that there would not be a big difference between our results and the results of a cost-effectiveness analysis performed from the perspective of the NHS in the UK.</p><p>Future research, ideally based on long-term observation, should focus on a possible association of reduced pill burden with improved compliance and adherence and resulting clinical effects, an aspect that could not be considered in this analysis due to a lack of data, but which has been addressed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The existence of differences in adherence between different phosphate binders and associated effects on clinical outcomes should be assessed in a real-life setting.</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations. The data sources available to us were limited in scope. Some assumptions had to be made where no data were available. In the study by Floege et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the mean reduction of serum phosphorus level was presented for completers of the PA-CL-05A/B trial. Therefore, efficacy data for the cost-effectiveness analysis were obtained from the unpublished clinical study report (see Footnote <xref rid="Fn1" ref-type="">1</xref>), which covers the full analysis set. In this analysis set, the mean reduction of serum phosphorus levels was slightly higher for SC than for PA21. This renders our cost-effectiveness analysis more conservative than if the values for completers reported in Floege et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] had been used (the mean reduction of serum phosphorus levels in completers was higher for PA21 than for SC). The proportions of patients &#x02018;on-target&#x02019; versus &#x02018;off-target&#x02019;, as well as the withdrawal rates observed in the PA-CL-05A/B trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], on which our results are based, may differ from those to be expected under real-world conditions. We did not include other phosphate binders in our cost-effectiveness analysis because SC was the only phosphate binder being compared with PA21 in a head-to-head trial. In current clinical practice, combination therapy with phosphate binders is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; however, published data on how different phosphate binders should exactly be combined and what the clinical implications would be is rather vague [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A strategy combining PA21 and SC in the same patient and at the same time could not be modelled without introducing an uncontrollable amount of uncertainty. Therefore, we decided to only model strategies representing monotherapy, with a possibility of switching to the alternative treatment in the case of nonresponse or withdrawal due to TEAEs. After switching, the same treatment-specific efficacy as observed in the trial (reduction in serum phosphorus levels, 1.93&#x000a0;mg/dL for PA21 and 1.95&#x000a0;mg/dL for SC) was assumed due to a lack of published data. In the case of continued nonresponse, administration of the maximum recommended dose was assumed. The assumed patient pathway may not fully reflect routine practice. Under the extreme assumption that patients would remain untreated after withdrawal from their initial treatment, the savings for one QALY forgone by using the PA21 strategy were reduced to &#x020a4;26,515 in comparison with &#x020a4;174,999 in the base-case analysis. PA21 was disfavoured here due to the higher withdrawal rates than for SC observed in the PA-CL-05A/B trial. However, given the long-term complications of hyperphosphataemia, we expect the assumption of no further treatment after withdrawal from PA21 or SC to be counterfactual for most patients. Cardiovascular calcification negatively impacts on cardiovascular risk and contributes to mortality in ESRD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. SC has been shown to slow down the progression of cardiovascular calcification compared with calcium-based phosphate binders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As PA21 is also a calcium-free phosphate binder and has shown a nonsignificant survival advantage compared with SC (RR of mortality 0.714; 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.37&#x02013;1.40), we assumed PA21 to be noninferior to SC with respect to positive effects on cardiovascular calcification, cardiovascular risk and survival not directly driven by the reduction in serum phosphorus. This was a prerequisite of building our base-case analysis on the change in serum phosphorus levels observed in the trial. Our base-case analysis did not include costs of dialysis and transplantation. However, these costs were close to equivalent in the two treatment strategies, as shown in a scenario analysis. This might also be the case for other costs caused by conditions that are not influenced by the reduction in serum phosphorus level. Because comorbidities and concomitant medications were not reported in the clinical trial publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], it was difficult to assess the comparability of patients in the clinical trial and patients in Scotland. However, in the unpublished study report, it was reported that the proportion of patients with cardiac disorders was similar in both treatment arms and no significant differences regarding concomitant medications were reported. Due to a lack of data regarding cardiovascular event risks, we could not assess the number of avoided cardiovascular events based on the reduction in serum phosphorus level. However, because the difference in the mean reduction of serum phosphorus levels was low, we assumed that the effect of PA21 versus SC on the occurrence of cardiovascular events would be limited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of PA21 in patients with hyperphosphataemia and intolerant to calcium-based phosphate binders may be cost saving when compared with SC, and yields only very limited disadvantages in terms of quality-adjusted survival. PA21 appears to be cost-effective from the perspective of the Scottish NHS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>Vifor Pharma. Clinical study report.
