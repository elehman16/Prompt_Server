However, advanced medical students&#x02019; ability to read patient charts and to identify patient hazards is rather poor. We therefore investigated whether it is possible to teach advanced medical students how to identify patient hazards independent of context (i.e. cancer versus cardiac failure) in patient charts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>All fifth-year medical students in one semester (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;123) were randomized into two groups. One group (IC) received a patient chart review-training first and then a control-intervention and the other group (CI) received the control-intervention first and then the patient chart review-training. Before and after the teaching sessions, students reviewed different scenarios with standardized fictional patient charts containing 12 common patient hazards. Two blinded raters rated the students&#x02019; notes for any patient hazard addressed in the notes using a checklist. The students were blinded to the study question and design. There was no external funding and no harm for the participating students.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 35 data sets had to be excluded because of missing data. Overall, the students identified 17% (IQR 8&#x02013;29%) of the patient hazards before the training and 56% (IQR 41&#x02013;66%) of the patient hazards after the training. At the second assessment students identified more patient hazards than at the first. They identified even more in the third. The effect was most pronounced after the patient chart review training (all p&#x0003c;.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patient chart review exercises and problem-based patient chart review training improve students&#x02019; abilities to recognize patient hazards independent of context during patient chart review.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Some common patterns constitute a large fraction of patient hazards. According to the data of the National Patient Safety Benchmarking Center, five most frequent medical errors and adverse events (surgical errors, medication errors, medical errors, patient falls, nosocomial infections) account for 67% of medical errors and for 81% of the costs attributable to medical errors <xref rid="pone.0089198-Chapman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In internal medicine, medication problems and diagnostic errors are frequent patient hazards <xref rid="pone.0089198-deVries1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Patient chart review is considered to be the gold standard for the identification of many common patient hazards, especially diagnostic problems (delayed, missed, wrong diagnosis, failure to follow up on actionable test results), medication problems (overmedication, undermedication, wrong dosage, medication contraindications, unauthorized medication, drug-drug interactions), nosocomial infections and problematic fluid/diet-management <xref rid="pone.0089198-Rancourt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089198-Lesar1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089198-Lesar2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089198-KrahenbuhlMelcher1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089198-Callen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089198-Zwaan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089198-Murff1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In patient safety research, patient charts are retrospectively reviewed by a nurse or physician specifically trained for this task <xref rid="pone.0089198-deFeijter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Since patient chart review should be routinely performed during every ward round, it has the potential to be a major tool for the promotion of patient safety. Previous investigations have shown that advanced medical students&#x02019; ability to read and interpret patient charts is rather poor: Nikendei et al. performed ward round exercises with final year medical students and found that the students performed only 49% of the expected tasks during patient chart review, prescribing and documentation <xref rid="pone.0089198-Nikendei1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In a previous study by our group, 5<sup>th</sup> year medical students identified only 20% of the patient hazards in fictional patient charts, irrespective of the number of weeks they spent in clerkships in internal medicine <xref rid="pone.0089198-Celebi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In a study by Heaton, which included 2413 medical students and recently graduated physicians, many participants stated that they learned to apply their pharmacology knowledge to real clinical situations only opportunistically during clinical rotations and the vast majority felt inadequately prepared for safe and effective usage of drugs <xref rid="pone.0089198-Heaton1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus there might be a gap in transferring the knowledge acquired during medical school classes to real patient care.</p><p>Complex medical tasks like patient chart review and ward rounds are only seldom taught in medical school; students report performing them only sporadically during clerkships <xref rid="pone.0089198-Remmen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089198-Celebi2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In a study by de Feijter et al., medical students reported being torn between the acquisition of skills through practicing on real patients and delivering safe patient care, which led to an avoidance of performing tasks such as prescribing <xref rid="pone.0089198-deFeijter2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Medical students and novice graduates are only rarely supervised by experienced staff <xref rid="pone.0089198-Howley1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089198-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Since young doctors have to perform ward rounds and patient chart review from day one of their graduation, medical education should address patient chart review and common patient hazards. In this study, we simulated the medical routine through complex patient management problems, thus we refer to the lessons as &#x0201c;problem-based training&#x0201d;. We did not use the checklist used in patient safety research but concentrated on common and easy to detect patient hazards instead.</p><p>Using a randomized, controlled cross-over-study, we investigated whether a structured problem-based patient chart review training improves the identification of common patient hazards, that is, diagnostic problems, medication problems, inadequate monitoring, and nosocomial infections, independent of context during patient chart reviews by advanced medical students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>We conducted a prospective randomized trial with a cross-over design in order to identify potential superiority of the problem-based patient chart review training over the control intervention (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089198-g001">Figure 1</xref>). All 5<sup>th</sup> year medical students participating in the mandatory internal medicine class (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;123) were randomized into two equally large groups using a list of random numbers according to the following protocol: a list of five digit-random numbers was written down in three columns. Every student was assigned to one line, so that every student was pseudonymized with three random numbers, one for the first, one for the second and one for the third assessment. If the second digit of the first random number was odd, the student was assigned to the intervention &#x02013; control group, if the second digit was even, he or she was assigned to the control &#x02013; intervention group. For the rating, all assessment-patient charts were ordered according to the random numbers. The first rater rated them from top down, the second from bottom-up.</p><fig id="pone-0089198-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0089198.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study design.</title><p>R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Randomization of 123 5<sup>th</sup> year medical students, O&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Observation (review of a fictional patient chart with twelve common patient hazards), X&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Intervention (training on patient chart review and patient safety), C&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Control-Intervention (ultrasound and Skills lab-training).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0089198.g001"/></fig><p>One group (intervention &#x02013; control group, IC) received 15 hours of training in patient chart review and patient safety followed by a 15-hour control-intervention on abdominal ultrasound and skills-lab training.

This was the conceptual framework for the patient chart review-training. The first assessment on patient chart review, which was done before any intervention, served as the concrete experience. Reflection and formation of abstract concepts was supposed to be facilitated by the theoretical input and discussion of the cases during the patient chart review training.

The effect was partly context-independent, so it was possible to train the students on a case with advanced cancer and the students were able to apply the skill to a case with atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism. The main reason for this phenomenon might be, that we taught the students to look for patterns that may impose patient hazards, and most of these patters do not necessarily require context-specific knowledge (i.e. check every drug for adequate dosing) or refer to knowledge already covered during previous classes (e.g. drug-drug-interactions taught in their pharmacology classes). In addition, the raised awareness for patient safety may have had an influence on the way the students review the patient charts.</p><p>Moreover, the students improved most when they had the problem-based patient chart review training, but also identified more patient hazards after the control intervention only.</p><p>This corresponds with a previous study on prescription errors, where the ability to critically appraise medication and to modify it to a specific clinical context was improved independent of context with a problem-based training <xref rid="pone.0089198-Celebi4" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In a previous study we investigated whether clerkships or previous training improve the identification of patient hazards during patient chart review and found that clerkships alone did not have an effect, while students, who reported to have performed at least one patient chart review themselves, identified significantly more patient hazards than students who had never performed a patient chart review <xref rid="pone.0089198-Celebi3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. So the improvement after the control-intervention might actually be an improvement due to the practice in patient chart review during the observations. While the students might be able to solve the tasks when presented with bare facts, finding the patterns in a patient chart bursting with information constitutes a much bigger challenge, which reflects the daily work of physicians in a more realistic manner.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Since study participation was voluntary and the interventions and assessments lasted two weeks, we had to exclude 28% of the students due to missing data, so there might be a distortion in the study sample. The students only reviewed fictional standardized patient charts, not real patient charts. While we tried to balance the patient hazards carefully, the students might have stopped looking for problems after identifying several patient hazards, since they did not expect so many patient hazards in one patient chart. In addition, we cannot exclude that the students IC group discussed the problem-based patient chart review training with the CI-group at any point, although we asked them not to.</p><p>While the medical students were blinded to the study question and the study design, the instructor was not. The identification is only a procedural outcome and it has yet to be proven that the identification of patient hazards can actually avert patient harm. We cannot exclude that a simple lesson on patient safety alone might also have improved the ability to identify patient hazards, since the students received this lesson during the patient chart review training.</p><p>Further research is warranted on the ability of medical students and novice graduates to read patient charts and to identify patient hazards and whether the training has an effect on patient safety.</p><p>In conclusion, a problem-based patient chart review training and patient chart review practice together improve the skills of advanced medical students in identifying patient hazards during patient chart review and thus might probably contribute to patient safety.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0089198-Chapman1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Chapman NE (2001) From behind closed doors.
