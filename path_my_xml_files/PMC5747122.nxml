The current medications for DSPN are not entirely satisfactory. Preliminary studies indicated that the Chinese herbal TangBi Formula may alleviate signs and symptoms and improve the velocity of nerve conduction in patients with DSPN. This study was designed to determine if Chinese herbal medicine used in combination with conventional treatment is more effective than conventional treatment alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">We are conducting a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial as a means of assessing the therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment. A total of 188 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a treatment group (TangBi Formula plus mecobalamin) and a control group (placebo plus mecobalamin). The test period lasts 6&#x000a0;months, during which all of the patients will be given standard medical care as recommended by established guidelines. The primary outcome will be development of differences in changes in clinical symptoms and signs in patients and changes in Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score (MDNS) between the two groups before and after treatment. The secondary outcome will be changes in nerve conduction velocity and in single clinical signs and symptoms. Safety assessments and adverse events will also be evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">We postulate that patients with DSPN will benefit from therapy that includes TCM.

China has the largest number of people with diabetes (109.6 million) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. An epidemiological survey done in China shows that, among adults in China, the estimated overall prevalence of diabetes is 10.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Diabetic individuals have higher rates of premature death, functional disability, and coexisting illnesses than their healthy counterparts. During its clinical course, diabetes may be accompanied by several other microvascular and macrovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Some of the most serious and deleterious complications of diabetes, such as foot ulcers, are associated with diabetic neuropathy. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) is the most common neuropathic complication of diabetes. Up to 50% of patients with neuropathy experience symptoms, including burning pain, stabbing sensations, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and deep aching pain, which typically becomes worse at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The end-stage complications of neuropathy, such as foot ulceration and amputation, are associated with a dramatic increase in health care costs and a decrease in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Painful neuropathic symptoms can interfere with sleep, decrease quality of life, and increase psychosocial distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Currently, the treatment for DSPN chiefly includes diabetic management via tight glucose control and pain relief for neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Medications such as narcotic analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, phenothiazines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids have all been used with limited success. Adverse effects such as drowsiness, lethargy, and unsteadiness are frequent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">In their search for more effective treatment strategies for DSPN and ways of slowing the overall progression of the disease, many patients in China seek help using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is one part of TCM and has a long history of use in China. CHM treatments for diabetes, including DSPN, include both oral and topical medications, used alone or in combination with Western conventional medicine. Several randomized clinical trials have suggested that CHM can alleviate symptoms, improve motor conduction velocity (MCV) and sensory conduction velocity (SCV), and delay the progression of DSPN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">A meta-analysis of 18 randomized clinical trials including 1575 cases of DSPN demonstrated a beneficial effect of TCM on clinical symptoms. In that analysis, treatment groups showed significant differences from control groups, without any serious side effects (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, a subsequent meta-analysis of ten randomized controlled studies established that there is insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy of CHM for the treatment of DSPN because of the pronounced clinical heterogeneity of the included studies and small sample sizes of the included trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">TangBi Formula consists of five herbal granules, namely <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic> (Huangqi), cassia twig (Guizhi), <italic>Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort</italic> (Chuanxiong), <italic>Radix Paeoniae Alba</italic> (Baishao), and <italic>Caulis Spatholobi</italic> (Jixueteng), that have been used to treat DSPN at the Outpatient Department of Guang An Men Hospital of the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine for nearly three decades. Relevant case reports have demonstrated that TangBi Formula alleviates the signs and symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and improves NCV measured by electromyogram (EMG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">For all of these reasons, the efficacy of TangBi Formula in patients with DSPN is worth investigating because of the pleiotropic effect. In the present study, we assumed that TangBi Formula in addition to conventional treatment may be more efficacious than conventional treatment with respect to the alleviation of the signs and symptoms of DSPN and improvement in NCV as indicated by EMGs. If successful, the study may provide an evidence-based complementary therapeutic approach to slow or prevent the clinical progression of DSPN in patients. In this protocol, we detail the overall study design and approach. This project was supported by the Special Scientific Research Fund of Traditional Chinese Medicine Profession of China (grant number 201507001-11), and it was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03010241; registered on 2 January 2017).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p id="Par25">This clinical trial is designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group project.

The following factors may affect or bias the results: (1) blood glucose levels, (2) existing treatment measures, and (3) the conditions under which EMG is determined. These influencing factors are addressed as follows. For factors influencing blood glucose levels, a randomized, double-blind study design will be used to ensure consistency across the two groups. Administration of methycobal can reduce the psychological effect on patients and increase patient compliance. EMG specialists should be trained consistently, and the standards for fixed EMG should be established as a standard operating procedure for this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Outcome measurements</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p id="Par67">

</p><p id="Par72">Each center has a designated EMG specialist to ensure the accuracy of EMG reading. Electromyographic detection is to be performed using Neurocare-C electromyography (Neurocare Center Co., Shanghai, China) and evoked potential instruments to determine MCV and SCV of the bilateral median nerve, ulnar nerve, common peroneal nerve, and tibial nerve. The room should be kept quiet, and the temperature should remain at about 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Skin temperature must remain between 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and hyperthermic treatment should be provided to patients with low body surface temperature. SCV is determined using the reverse method, which means proximal stimulus and remote reception. The sensory waveform is derived from the average deconvolution by machine automatically. SCV value is the measured distance (between receiving point and the stimulus point)/incubation. MCV is determined in the corresponding distal muscles. The corresponding nerve branch is superstimulated to elicit two action potentials: far end and near end. MCV is the distance between two points/difference in incubation between the two points. The NCV normal value refers to the clinical electromyography standard for the median nerve and ulnar nerve with MCV&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;45&#x000a0;m/second and SCV normal values&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;47&#x000a0;m/second individually.

The number of subjects evaluated at the end of each group is kept as consistent as possible before the start of the study. Second is the per-protocol set (PPS), in which all of the factors are in accordance with the research plan; patients show good compliance, using 80&#x02013;120% of the prescribed dose; the CRF contains the details of the case; and the main variables can be determined.

The aim of DSPN treatment is to decrease symptoms and reduce the risk of hospital admission, raise quality-of-life standards, and reduce the incidence of disability. Recently, the approach to therapy has been focused on symptomatic relief. TCM has a history of use in China going back several thousand years. Some types of TCM therapy, such as Tang-tong-fang, have been shown to be beneficial in patients with DPN, a common complication secondary to diabetic microvascular injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Reports have shown that TCM has had some success in the treatment of DPN. Some studies concentrate on nerve repair and regeneration, signaling pathways, neurotrophic factor, free radicals, and so forth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], but there is less clinical research on the interaction of DSPN with TCM.
