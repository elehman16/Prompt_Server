However, specific interventions based on the modification of health beliefs to promote adherence have not been applied in na&#x000ef;ve HIV-infected subjects.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>Prospective randomized 48-week study to evaluate the efficacy of a psychoeducative intervention based on health beliefs to promote adherence in a sample of na&#x000ef;ve HIV-1-infected men who started antiretroviral therapy. Participants were randomized to follow three intervention visits to promote adherence with the use of projective drawing techniques, Life-steps and Motivational interview (Intervention Group; GI) or to continue with the routine care (Control Group; GC). Adherence was assessed through self-report and drug plasma levels. Mann-Whitney nonparametric test, w2 or Fisher exact test were used to compare variables.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>Participants were 40 men with a median (IQ) age of 35.2 (30.2&#x02013;44.8) years, CD4 cell count at the study entry of 316 (229&#x02013;539) cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and HIV-RNA VL of 65.000 (22.500&#x02013;250.000) copies. The infection route had been mainly MSM (90%). QD and BID ARV therapy was prescribed in 29 (72.5%) and 11 (27.5%) subjects. Seven patients (2 in GI; 5 in GC) were lost to follow-up. At week 48, 100% of subjects in GI and 60% in GC had 100% adherence (p=0.01). In GC, 26% and 14% of subjects had &#x02265;95% and &#x0003c;95% adherence, respectively. No differences were found in adherence regarding QD or BID therapy. All subjects except for 3 had VL &#x0003c;25 copies at week 48.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>High adherence was observed in the majority of this group of na&#x000ef;ve HIV-infected men who initiated their first antiretroviral therapy. However, all subjects following the intervention had 100% adherence after one year of follow-up. A psychoeducative intervention based on the modification of health beliefs may be a useful strategy to promote adherence in na&#x000ef;ve HIV-infected patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
