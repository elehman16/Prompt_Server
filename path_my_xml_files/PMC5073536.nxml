Focused ultrasound examination (f-US) of the heart and lungs has proven to increase the diagnostic accuracy in these patients. In this protocol of a randomised multicentre trial, we study the effect of f-US of the heart and lungs in patients with respiratory problems performed by emergency physicians (EP) as soon as the patient arrives to the emergency department (ED).

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;29</xref> Most of these studies proved a high diagnostic accuracy when using an f-US alongside standard diagnostic testing compared to standard diagnostic testing alone. Some even found that the diagnostic accuracy of certain pulmonary diseases was superior when it was assessed using f-US compared to a chest X-ray examination.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> One single centre study found a significant increase in diagnostic accuracy as well as in correctly prescribed treatment at 4&#x02005;hours after the patient&#x02019;s arrival to the ED. This was made by adding an f-US of the heart, lungs and deep veins to standard clinical testing of patients with respiratory problems.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Unfortunately, the results from these studies are not directly transferable to daily clinical practice as most of them are designed as single centre studies and some even performed by single investigators highly skilled in f-US.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

To this we added the risk of investigators pausing inclusion due to busy shifts, holiday, sick leave or maternity leave or even dropping out of the project prior to completing their inclusion rates.</p><p>We here ended with a need for 20 investigators and an inclusion time of 15&#x02005;months, including 3&#x02005;months, for a local initiation of inclusion in the participating centres.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment of investigators</title><p>Investigators are found via MR&#x02019;s network of ultrasound enthusiasts and by oral presentations of the study on conferences and meetings among physicians and researchers of emergency medicine in Denmark. Once a potential investigator proved interest in participating in the study, MR supplied him or her with documents about the expected tasks as investigator, a description of the protocol, agreements on affiliation on the final product and a questionnaire regarding: their level of education, their attachment to the ED, their ultrasound skills, a description of the type of ultrasound equipment in the ED and the availability of this.</p><p>If the investigator fulfilled the basic requirements and still wished to become an investigator, MR contacted the management of the ED, by email, to ask for permission to initiate the trial in their department.

Once the authorisation from the department leaders was attained, we agreed on a date for the educational programme, regarding the database and the ultrasound protocol.

Missing data will be handled by the use of the statistical method multiple imputation.</p><sec id="s2l1"><title>Data analysis of primary end point</title><p>To determine whether there is a difference in the proportion of patients with a correct/incorrect presumptive diagnosis between the intervention group and the control group, we will use a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or the Fischer exact test.</p></sec><sec id="s2l2"><title>Data analysis of secondary end points</title><p>To compare the intervention group with the control group, we will use the following tests: for the comparison of means, the Student's t-test; for the comparison of medians, the Mann-Whitney test; and for the comparison of proportions, the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or the Fisher exact test. A two-sided significance level of 5% will be applied to all tests.</p><p>To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the primary presumptive diagnosis, the 4-hour presumptive diagnosis and the f-US, we will calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and the diagnostic accuracy with 95% CI based at a binominal distribution. To assess the interobserver agreement on the f-US results between investigators and the ultrasound specialists, we use the Cohen&#x02019;s &#x003ba; coefficient. Data analysis will be conducted using STATA Release V.14.0 (Stata Corp) including professional statistical advice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Data management</title><p>Data specified in the study protocol will be directly documented and securely stored in the password protected database assigned for this study in REDCap OPEN, SDU. REDCap is a secure web application designed to support data capture for research at which the University of Southern Denmark has its own secure database access.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The project manager is responsible for the database construction in cooperation with a data manager from OPEN (SDU) as well as for data acquisition, storage, monitoring flow and validation.</p><p>In this database, each patient receives a unique identification number securing patient identity. The investigators will only gain access to this database to withdraw a randomisation number and to enter data regarding the inclusion/exclusion, basic values upon arrival, f-US findings and the primary presumptive diagnoses.</p><p>Additional clinical data will be available from the electronic patient records in which there is no information on the randomisation number or f-US findings. Basic characteristics will be entered into the database by the project manager. Data regarding the blinded audit of the medical records will be entered into the database by the auditors who have no access to other data entry forms than those regarding the blinded audit. A data monitoring committee was not used. All the data reported are linked to each specific investigator and data reporting are monitored by project manager, MR, on a weekly basis.</p><p>F-US findings will be stored on secured external hard drives where patients will be entered by their unique identification number to secure patient identity and to enable a blinded audit by the specialists in f-US. Only the patient&#x02019;s informed consent for participation and non-blinded f-US findings are on paper format. No interim analysis or end point adjustments are planned. The final decision to end this trial before sample size is attained will be made by agreement between the project manager, MR, and her supervisors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The f-US is a method of investigation which has no known adverse effects. It will be performed in accordance with the local hospital guidelines. To avoid deprivation of a diagnostic tool in the control group, we have taken the following precaution for all included patients because f-US is gaining ground in few of the participating EDs and because the f-US findings are blinded in the control group: in case any f-US rises suspicion of a life-threatening condition, the f-US findings will immediately be non-blinded to the EP in charge of the patient (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx2">box 2</xref>).

The investigators represent the general level of expertise in f-US nationwide. The sample size is powered to detect a clinically significant improvement in the proportion of patients with a correct diagnosis and the blinded journal audit is strengthened by inclusion of f-US findings in the assessment of the final diagnosis.</p><p>The study has limitations: the investigators are recruited via MR&#x02019;s network of ultrasound enthusiasts. These doctors work in Danish EDs and they use ultrasound as part of their daily diagnostic procedures, but they cannot represent all doctors in the EDs. Furthermore, there is a risk of selection bias since patients are not consecutively enrolled. There is also a risk of non-blinding of f-US results before the primary or the 4-hour presumptive diagnosis has been attained since the investigators often hold the treatment responsibility. The study is not powered to investigate for differences in morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first multicentre trial in the EDs to investigate whether an f-US in the hands of the EP can increase the proportion of patients with a correct diagnosis as well as the proportion of correctly initiated treatments on patients with signs of respiratory problems at 4&#x02005;hours after their arrival to the ED. This trial holds the potential to develop evidence-based optimisation of early diagnostic accuracy in these patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>MR would like to thank associate professor M Brabrand, MD, PhD and H Sheta, MD for their time spent on critical and professional inputs during the idea development of this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CBL, ATL, GB and MR contributed to the conception and design of the study.
