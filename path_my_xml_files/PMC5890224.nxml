influences the effects of gait training in patients with chronic stroke. [Subjects and
Methods] A total of 28 patients with chronic stroke were evenly divided into experimental
and control groups. Initial evaluation of the subjects was conducted by Timed Up &#x00026; Go
(TUG) and 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT). Each patient in both groups received daily,
30-minute gait training on sandy ground and firm ground, five times each week, for a total
of six weeks, after which reevaluation was conducted. [Results] In TUG, both groups showed
significant improvement after the intervention. In 6MWT, only the experimental group
achieved significantly increased distance after the intervention. However, there was no
between-group difference. Improvement in dynamic balancing ability depends on repeated
gait training rather than differences in the ground environment. However, gait endurance
showed a difference depending on the types of ground, regardless of repeated gait
training. [Conclusion] This can be attributed to the fact that gait training on sand
requires use of more diverse muscles. Hence, we can confirm the potential of sand as a new
material for training ground when attempting to improve walking ability, particularly gait
endurance, among patients with chronic stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Gait training</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Sand gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with stroke experience many challenges after the onset. Approximately 60% of
patients with stroke suffer from weakened motor ability, and about half of patients with
stroke require assistance from other people in their daily lives. Most are capable of
limited participation in social or work activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the most serious challenges is
diminished balancing ability and decrease or loss of walking ability, resulting from the
loss of control<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Walking ability does not simply refer to movement of the body. From the perspective of the
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), walking in
patients with stroke should be assessed by integrating disability, activity, participation,
and quality of life<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gait training that
simply aims at restoring patients&#x02019; ability to walk is insufficient. For most patients, the
goal is not simply walking, but achieving walking ability that allows them to return to
active participation in the community. Hence, recovery of walking ability is the primary
goal when planning treatment for patients with stroke<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, there are a number of approaches aimed at enhancing walking ability in patients
with stroke. However, most previous literature involves intervention schemes that do not
duplicate the actual walking environment encountered by patients in everyday life. Thus, an
approach to gait training that involves a varied ground environment is necessary.</p><p>Gait training on unstable ground instead of firm ground requires more diverse movement in
the ankle joint as well as large muscle strength<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Using such environmental characteristics can induce greater ankle
mobility and improvement of proprioception. The increased proprioception is effective for
enhancing walking ability, as it increases muscle strength and balancing ability in the
affected-side ankle of patients with stroke<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study chose sand ground instead of firm ground as a new
environment for gait training.</p><p>Virtually none of the previous studies used sandy ground for rehabilitating patients with
chronic stroke. However, several studies used sand as a training method for improving
athletic performance in athletes.</p><p>A study that implemented plyometrics training on sand as a means of improving athletic
performance, such as jumping and sprinting among football players, reported improved
athletic performance, including jumping and changing directions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reported that muscle injury is less likely
when training on sand versus firm ground, due to the characteristics of sand<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Binnie et al. reported that eight-week sand
training was effective in improving Maximal Oxygen Uptake (VO2max) and that self-awareness
of pain and fatigue during training were lower on sandy ground than firm ground<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study attempted to determine the
effects of the walking ability by applying the sandy ground to gait training for patients
with chronic stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 30 subjects participated in this study, two of whom were discharged from the
hospital during the intervention period, making the total number of research subjects for
the experiment 28.</p><p>After explaining the purpose of this study to the patients with chronic stroke who were
hospitalized for treatment, those who submitted voluntary consent and expressed their
willingness to participate were randomly assigned to the experimental group or control
group. The patients who were capable of independent walking, including those who used a
walking aid and had no musculoskeletal disease or cognitive problem, were selected as the
research subjects.</p><p>This study received Institutional Review Board approval from Daegu University
(1040621&#x02013;201507-HR-003&#x02013;02).</p><p>The walking ability of the two groups was evaluated before the experiment by Timed Up &#x00026;
Go evaluation and 6-Minute Walking Test. The two tests were implemented on different days,
so that they did not affect the other&#x02019;s results. Through the data collected, the homogeneity
of the two subject groups was confirmed. During the daily 30-minute gait training, which
occurred five times each week for a total of six weeks, the control group received gait
training on firm ground and the experimental group received gait training on sand. The
control group performed gait training on regular, firm ground, inside a treatment room, with
shoes on. The thin shoes was worn to prevent foot damage by friction of the floor. The
experimental group performed gait training on sand, inside a treatment room, with bare feet.
The sandy ground was specially made at a width of 1 meter, a length of 5 meters, and a depth
of 30 centimeters.</p><p>No restrictions were put on the walking methods of either group, so that each individual
could use the walking habits and strategy that he/she relearned after the occurrence of
stroke. If necessary, the use of a walking aid, such as a cane, was allowed. Interventions
other than walking were prohibited, to exclude additional training influences aside from the
environmental characteristics of the walking ground.</p><p>To evaluate walking ability, TUG was measured three times, and the average of the three
values was used. TUG is an assessment tool that evaluates dynamic balancing ability. It has
a proven reliability, with intra-rater reliability of r=0.99 and inter-rater reliability of
r=0.98<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>6MWT was measured only once, due to the characteristics of the subjects, and the subjects
were encouraged to make their greatest efforts during the measurement. The 6MWT is also a
tool that evaluates gait endurance among hemiplegic patients or those with cardiopulmonary
disease. It has proven validity and reliability when applied to patients with stroke<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As the collected data were not in normal distribution, data were statistically analyzed
through a non-parametric test. Within-group comparison before and after the intervention was
conducted by Wilcoxon signed rank test and between-groups difference, according to the
intervention scheme, was analyzed by Mann Whitney U test. All data were statistically
analyzed using SPSS version 20.0, where significance level was set at less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In TUG, both groups showed a significant difference after the intervention. In 6MWT, only
the sandy ground training group showed a significant difference after the intervention.
However, neither variable showed a statistically significant between-group difference before
or after the intervention (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristic of the subject (n=28)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (6/8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (5/9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.0 &#x000b1; 10.0<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.3 &#x000b1; 10.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162.4 &#x000b1; 5.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.8 &#x000b1; 7.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.5 &#x000b1; 8.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.9 &#x000b1; 15.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Onset time (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.0 &#x000b1; 13.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.1 &#x000b1; 10.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemi side (right/left)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>M &#x000b1; SD: Mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> and <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of walking ability evaluation before and after the intervention

improving walking ability in patients with chronic stroke.</p><p>In the TUG evaluation of dynamic stability, both groups showed decreased performance time
after the intervention. However, there was no between-group difference. This implies that
the repeated gait training increased dynamic stability, regardless of the difference in the
ground.</p><p>In 6MWT, which evaluated gait endurance, only the sandy ground training group showed a
significant improvement. This implies that sandy ground training is more effective at
enhancing gait endurance than firm ground training. Improvement of gait endurance is
determined by diverse physical factors, including muscle strength, muscle endurance, and
cardiopulmonary endurance. Similar to the results in Yi&#x0011f;it et al., it is conjectured that
muscle strength and muscle endurance of the calf and thigh improved after the sandy ground
training<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, Davies and
Mackinnon reported that maximal oxygen uptake, heart rate, and ventilation volume of oxygen
and carbon dioxide increased during walking on sand<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Assuming the same distance, this implies that walking on sand
induces more use of cardiopulmonary function than other ground conditions. In this study, it
is conjectured that the repeated gait training on sand improved not only muscle strength and
muscle endurance, but also cardiopulmonary function, compared to training on firm ground.
This ultimately enhanced gait endurance.</p><p>This study did not directly assess the mobility of the affected-side ankle joint of the
hemiplegic patients. However, it is conjectured that training on sand induced enhancement of
ankle function of the hemiplegic patients, consequently improving their balancing and
walking. Impellizzeri et al. examined the improvement of jumping function of volleyball
players after training on sand. According to their study results, players have to thrust
their ankle more forcefully when jumping on sand, as their feet slip on sand. In this type
of situation, more joint mobility and muscle groups are used, due to the stretch-shortening
cycle of the muscles surrounding the ankle. This increases the angular velocity of the
ankle, improving the jumping function<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Our study did not implement high-level motion, such as jumping, due to the characteristics
of the subjects. Nevertheless, gait training on sand improved ankle mobility and nerve roots
control, thanks to the stretch-shortening cycle of the muscles surrounding the affected-side
ankle joint, which is difficult to voluntarily control. This generated mobility that is
necessary for walking, which consequently helped gait endurance. Pinnington and Dawson
reported that training on sand causes lower accumulation of lactic acid and reduces the
metabolic fatigue that results from muscle activity<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. As their study used healthy male adults as a sample, the research
subjects differed from our study. Nevertheless, it is conjectured that similar physiological
characteristics that appeared during walking in their study, which experimented with
different walking environments, manifested in our study as well. Hence, training on sand can
diminish muscle fatigue, which is expected to relatively increase gait endurance.</p><p>This study has several limitations, one of which is that we could not collect data on
actual difference of muscle strength and joint mobility of the affected-side ankle between
firm ground and sand. Moreover, we could not check whether more muscle activity was actually
induced on sandy ground. Hence, future studies are required to examine the actual change in
muscle activity during gait training when using firm ground and sand. Also, there may be
differences according to the training of barefoot walking in the experimental group and the
wearing of the sneakers during the gait training of the control group. Therefore, future
studies need to be compared under the same conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, considering that repeated gait training can induce improvement of dynamic
balancing ability, regardless of the type of ground, repeated gait training is necessary for
patients with stroke. Repeated gait training can improve dynamic balancing ability, as long
as patients can walk, regardless of whether they walk in a correct way or walk well.</p><p>In the case of gait training that aims at improving gait endurance, repeated gait training
on sand is more effective than on firm ground.</p><p>This study is the first research that applied gait training on sand to patients with
chronic stroke. The study proposes the possibility of a new approach involving gait training
on sand for a variety of subjects, including patients with stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Muren</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>H&#x000fc;tler</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Functional capacity and health-related quality of life in
