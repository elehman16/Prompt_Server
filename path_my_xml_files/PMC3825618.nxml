The candies were consumed 4 times during 1.5 consecutive days. Compared to the placebo group, the test groups&#x02019; saliva had significantly reduced mutans streptococci as an immediate effect. These results suggest the use of heat-killed <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671 in suckable candies as a method to reduce mutans streptococci in the mouth and, thereby, caries risk.

While there is some indication that caries is a multi-microbial disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], mutans streptococci are considered the predominant caries inducing microbial group with special importance in early colonization in children, and caries is associated with increased prevalence of mutans streptococci in the dental plaque biofilm adherent to teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Mutans streptococci use teeth as primary colonization sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Prevention of their re-adhesion to the plaque by specific co-aggregation with <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671, promoting their oral clearance, could thus provide a strategy to reduce a key caries risk factor, benefiting oral health without generalized non-specific oral floral disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The pasteurized and spray-dried <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671 had been added as the active ingredient in its commercially available form (Lactobacillus pro-t-action<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, BASF Future Business GmbH, Ludwigshafen, Germany). The dosage of <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671 in the candies was confirmed from the sodium content of the candies as measured by atomic spectrometry. Briefly, the candies were produced by mixing, then boiling, all ingredients (except flavoring agents and <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671) until achieving a homogeneous melt. The melt was then cooled to 80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, whereupon flavor and <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671 were added, while mixing. This hot melt was pressed into forms, cooled, and packaged as candies. Basic ingredients for the test candies were isomaltitol, maltitol, water, sucralose, and mint oil. Test and placebo candies were identical in weight (2.5&#x000a0;g), size, color, and flavor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design and Subjects</title><p>A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, in vivo study was done with 3 study arms: placebo, test group 1 (1&#x000a0;mg <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671/candy), and test group 2 (2&#x000a0;mg <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671/candy). Study subjects (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;60) gave informed written consent consistent with ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines. This study was conducted at a single center in Berlin, Germany. As the trial was not a clinical trial, an ethical committee did not need to be considered, and the trial was not registered, as at the time of the trial in Germany, it was not customary for pilot-type trials to be registered.</p><p>This clinical trial was designed as a pilot to gain information regarding the treatment effect. Although there was not enough data for a sample size calculation, the trial proceeded with a sample size of 20 subjects per study group. The randomization procedure was a block randomization of 10 blocks with a block size of 6. Randomization was performed beforehand and the resulting allocation was recorded in the allocation lists. The participants those administering the treatment and those evaluating the results were blinded to the group assignment.</p><p>Subjects were excluded if under current treatment for oral or pharyngeal inflammation, restorative, gingival/periodontal, or oral surgical problems, brushed their teeth more than three times daily, used antibiotics or had dental hygiene treatment in the past 6&#x000a0;weeks, used full artificial dentures, were currently pregnant or lactating, had history of alcohol abuse or drug addiction, or had German language difficulties. Inclusion criteria were good health, age over 18, and written consent. There was no preselection screening of subjects for baseline levels of mutans streptococci.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Test Schedule</title><p>The study was conducted according to the protocol and was performed over two successive days. Subjects were not to perform any oral hygiene activities or consume coffee, tea, wine, probiotic foods (such as yoghurt or cheese) from the evening prior to the first study day until completion of the study 1.5&#x000a0;days later. They were instructed to expectorate one mL of saliva (R-1) into a sterile 15-mL polyethylene (PE) tube, without any mechanical or taste stimulation, upon rising. This sample (R1) was to be transported to the study site within 1&#x000a0;h. At the study site, a second saliva sample (Pre-1) was collected before candy use. All subjects were then randomized to one of three treatment groups (placebo, test 1, or test 2) and were instructed to consume a single assigned candy piece by sucking, until fully consumed, and to refrain from chewing. The assigned candies were provided in packages coded so as to keep subjects and investigators blind. Immediately (no later than 10&#x000a0;min) after consuming the candy, the subjects collected another saliva sample (Post-1). Subjects who had removable partial dentures wore them throughout all study procedures.</p><p>Each subject consumed 3 more candies, one at a time, during the day, 10&#x000a0;min after each unsupervised meal, and was instructed not to exchange candies with other study participants.</p><p>On day 2, all subjects again collected a saliva sample upon rising (R-2), and another saliva sample (Pre-2) was collected at the study site before sucking another identically coded candy. A final saliva sample (Post-2) was collected within 10&#x000a0;min after consumption of this candy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sampling and Sample Analysis</title><p>Except for the unsupervised saliva samples collected early in the mornings upon rising, all samples were collected on-site, under supervision by trained clinical staff. The samples were kept at room temperature and transported to the microbiology facility, and processed within a maximum of 2&#x000a0;h of collection, which had been established in pretests to give reliable and reproducible results (CFU). They were homogenized by sonication (15&#x000a0;min, ultrasonic bath Bandelin Sonorex GT120), vortexed, and a 0.5&#x000a0;mL volume of each was transferred into a sterile PE tube, diluted with 4.5&#x000a0;mL phosphate-buffered saline, and re-vortexed. One milliliter aliquot of 1:100 and 1:500 dilutions was spread in duplicate onto selective TSY20B agar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The TSYB medium which was used for the detection and quantification is selective for mutans streptococci (<italic>S. mutans, S. sobrinus,</italic> etc.). The medium contains Bacitracin, which is an antibiotic selective for mutans streptococci among other bacteria. The plates were incubated anaerobically at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;days and CFU/mL of saliva determined.

The mean relative difference in the number of mutans streptococci before (Pre-1) and after (Post-1) candy consumption was calculated for all three groups, for day one [Post-1 vs. Pre-1] and day two [Post-2 vs. Pre-2]. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (SPSS for Windows, Release 19, LEAD Technologies, Inc.). Values of <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 were considered significant.

This reduction is significant on two consecutive days for the higher concentration consumed and it is seen as a trend for the lower concentration candies. The data are consistent with those of Lang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that in vitro, even when heat-killed and incubated with saliva, these bacteria cause specific co-aggregation with mutans streptococci in planktonic suspension and with those of Tanzer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] that these heat-killed bacteria when eaten with the highly cariogenic diet of rats already colonized by mutans streptococci reduce their levels on the teeth, reduce caries experience, and appear to foster clearance from the mouth. Thus, the present pilot human data support our understanding that these bacteria, even when heat-killed and contained in a sugar-free candy vehicle, foster specific co-aggregation with mutans streptococci in planktonic suspension in saliva and, thereby, an increased probability that they will be cleared from the mouth. We think it remarkable that this effect was observed after exposure to only five pieces of candy containing 1 or 2&#x000a0;mg of dead <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671 consumed in 1.5&#x000a0;days.</p><p>This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled in vivo study demonstrated immediate short-term reductions on salivary mutans streptococci levels through the consumption of <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671 in candies. Test subjects were not preselected according to their mutans streptococcal levels in the oral cavity. While this represented &#x0201c;real-life conditions,&#x0201d; it did probably contribute to statistical variation. Future studies are planned with larger populations with more homogeneous mutans streptococcal level subjects.</p><p>Incorporation of <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671 into sugar-free candies is but one possible form of application of pro-t-action<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Additionally, sugar-free candies stimulate saliva flow, a benefit to oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We could not observe any significant decrease in mutans streptococcal counts by saliva flow per se. Rather, the slight, albeit non-statistically significant reduction of salivary mutans streptococci in the placebo-candy-using group is probably attributable to the Hawthorne effect in which the mere participation in a study can change study participant behavior if subjects believe the investigators are interested in a particular outcome of such behavior, familiar in the dental clinical research literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Release of <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671 into saliva from sugar-free candies, leading to co-aggregation with mutans streptococci, with resultant increased probability of swallowing rather than re-attachment to the teeth or plaque biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] is a plausible explanation for the reduction in the prime&#x02014;albeit not sole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]&#x02014;caries pathogen in humans&#x02019; saliva.</p><p>Heat-killed <italic>L. paracasei</italic> DSMZ16671 has the potential to offer a method for selective reduction in mutans streptococci, thereby positively influencing the oral microbiota, without adding new or additional risk factors, as might be the case with the addition of live lactobacilli, especially those without ability to specifically co-aggregate with mutans streptococci.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded by BASF New Business GmbH.
