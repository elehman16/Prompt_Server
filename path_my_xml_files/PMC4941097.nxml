Both intervention groups attended educational meetings with information about back pain based on a non-injury model. A peer adviser was selected from among their colleagues. The outcome was days of sick leave at the individual level at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, adjusting for previous sick leave at the unit level. As a result of similar effects on sick leave, the two intervention groups were merged (<italic>n</italic>=646) and compared with the control group (<italic>n</italic>=211). The predictors were different levels of belief in back pain myths, pain-related fear, helplessness/hopelessness and low back pain. <italic>Results:</italic> The intervention group had significantly less days of sick leave at the three month (4.9 days, <italic>p</italic>=0.001) and six month (4.4 days, <italic>p</italic>=0.016) follow ups compared with the control group. At three months, a low level of pain-related fear was the only predictor for the intervention effect (8.0 less days of sick leave, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). <bold><italic>Conclusions:</italic> A workplace educational back pain intervention had an effect on sick leave for up to six months.

Despite much research, there is little evidence about the prevention of LBP [<xref rid="bibr3-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It seems to be difficult to prevent LBP, but research has shown that it is possible to prevent the consequences of LBP, such as sick leave, fear of movement or injury, and inactivity [<xref rid="bibr3-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore it is important to prevent these negative consequences of LBP [<xref rid="bibr3-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Brief interventions based on a non-injury model (NIM) with the aim of preventing the consequences of LBP have shown success in increasing the return to work (RTW) in clinical populations [<xref rid="bibr4-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr6-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and in reducing sick leave among employees [<xref rid="bibr7-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The NIM was proposed by Indahl et al. [<xref rid="bibr4-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and is in line with the European Guidelines for Prevention in Low Back Pain [<xref rid="bibr3-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to the NIM, the spine is considered to be a strong structure and pain is seldom a sign of injury or disease caused by strain, but rather a functional disturbance [<xref rid="bibr4-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Interventions based on the NIM are effective with respect to RTW among patients with LBP for a substantial proportion of participants [<xref rid="bibr3-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr6-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More information about possible predictors for the effect of such interventions in preventing sick leave will provide valuable knowledge for future interventions.</p><p>For those who are already on sick leave as a result of LBP, fear avoidance beliefs, a low internal health locus of control and a negative expectancy of recovery are negative predictors for a RTW [<xref rid="bibr6-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Fear avoidance beliefs are associated with sick leave, even when controlling for LBP, previous sick leave, age and work environmental factors [<xref rid="bibr11-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, evidence from non-clinical populations is scarce and it is therefore of interest to explore whether beliefs and expectations are valid as predictors of remaining at work in a non-patient population.</p><p>This study explored this issue in a sample of Norwegian employees who participated in atWork, a cluster randomized controlled trial of a workplace intervention based on the NIM. The aim of atWork is to prevent and manage the negative consequences of LBP in a population of municipal employees and it proved to be effective in reducing sick leave at the group level at the one year-follow up [<xref rid="bibr8-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This study contributes data at the longitudinal individual level on sick leave among employees who participated in atWork and who consented to the gathering of individual data.</p><p>Changing misconceptions about LBP and enabling employees to cope with back and neck pain in the workplace are the core aims of atWork. The Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress (CATS) [<xref rid="bibr12-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] is therefore an important theoretical framework for the intervention. CATS defines coping, which is essential for health, as the acquired expectancy that most or all responses lead to a positive result. Hopelessness (a negative response outcome expectancy) and helplessness (no response outcome expectancy), on the other hand, are associated with sustained activation, which may have major implications for health [<xref rid="bibr12-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of atWork on sick leave at the individual level and to investigate whether belief in back pain myths, pain-related fear, helplessness/hopelessness and LBP predict the effect of the atWork intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section2-1403494816653854"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="section3-1403494816653854"><title>Participants and procedures</title><p>All employees in two Norwegian municipalities were invited to participate in the atWork intervention in the period 2008&#x02013;2010.

The effect of the intervention on sick leave at the unit level and details of the procedure and interventions have been published elsewhere [<xref rid="bibr8-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As the intervention was carried out in workplace units, a cluster randomized design was chosen. A total of 125 work units (clusters) in the municipalities were randomized into three groups: (a) educational meetings and peer support; (b) educational meetings, peer support and access to an outpatient clinic; or (c) a control group that received treatment as usual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494816653854">Figure 1</xref>).

A peer adviser was selected from among the employees in each work unit. The peer adviser was a colleague who received a brief education regarding back pain and was able to assist colleagues with information and support to increase their likelihood of staying at work. In addition, in the intervention group with access to an outpatient clinic, the peer adviser could, if needed, directly refer the employee to the clinic. The control group did not receive any intervention. The control group and the intervention groups were free to receive treatment as usual from their general practitioners and the Norwegian health care system.</p><p>At baseline, 1746 employees responded to the questionnaire, a response rate of about 50%. Together with the baseline questionnaire, the participants received a consent form asking for permission to collect register data on sick leave from the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). Only data from employees providing such consent were included in this study (<italic>n</italic>=795). Participants with missing data on their workplace unit (<italic>n</italic>=94) were also excluded because this information was necessary to determine which group the participants were randomized to. The two intervention groups were combined into a single intervention group because few workers attended the outpatient clinic and the result from either intervention was similar with respect to sick leave. Consequently, 646 participants (mean&#x000b1;SD age 44.2&#x000b1;10.81 years; 86% women) constituted the intervention group and 211 participants (mean&#x000b1;SD age 43.1&#x000b1;11.62 years; 88.2% women) constituted the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494816653854">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section4-1403494816653854"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study followed the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Norwegian Regional Ethics Committee in Western Norway (REK vest, ID 6.2008.117).

The available data were based on the sickness payment database from NAV. In cases where the employees were listed as sick for more than 16 days, these 16 days were also included in the data material.

There was an effect on sick leave the first six months during the intervention.</p><p>This is in line with, and expands on, the findings by Odeen et al. [<xref rid="bibr8-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] by showing individual effects among those consenting to the gathering of individual data and also showing exactly when the effect occurred during the first year. Our results regarding the short-term effects are also in accordance with a previous similar intervention study among patients with LBP [<xref rid="bibr5-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, effects on RTW are found for up to five years in a clinical population [<xref rid="bibr6-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In a clinical setting, the message is tailored to fit individual needs, which might result in a stronger effect than in the atWork study, which is designed to reach all employees present at work. The effect of atWork on sick leave is still important because population-based preventive interventions often require long-term implementation for an effect to occur [<xref rid="bibr22-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, low scores on pain-related fear predicted the effect of the intervention. This result is in accordance with a recent systematic review of back pain interventions, which showed that high fear avoidance beliefs at baseline were associated with poor treatment outcomes in terms of more pain and/or disability and less RTW [<xref rid="bibr10-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also in line with this study, Staal et al. [<xref rid="bibr23-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that workers with scores equal to or above the median on fear avoidance beliefs at baseline RTW more slowly after participating in a graded activity intervention than those with scores below the median.</p><p>While expectancies are generalized, pain-related fear represents specific beliefs regarding fear of movement or (re)injury when in pain, which might explain why pain-related fear was the only significant predictor in this study. In a previous qualitative study, participants in an educational intervention similar to atWork emphasized trust in professionals and improved understanding as important aspects contributing to their coping with their disorders [<xref rid="bibr24-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Strong pain-related fear can hamper confidence in professionals and the information they receive from the intervention. Furthermore, the NIM might be more conceivable for employees with low pain-related fear. For employees with low or moderate scores on pain-related fear, atWork might provide the reassurance they need to be able to stay at work despite pain. Employees with strong and deep-rooted pain-related fear may need something else, e.g. more extensive, multidisciplinary treatment than those provided in atWork, or an intervention targeting pain-related fears, including their performance of practical tasks. Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing avoidance, catastrophizing and disabling beliefs among patients with LBP [<xref rid="bibr25-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but might also have a negative effect on disability for individuals with low scores on fear avoidance [<xref rid="bibr26-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><sec id="section14-1403494816653854"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A major strength of the current study is that the outcome was measured by registry data on sick leave that are considered to be highly accurate and thus to reduce the risk of measurement errors. The sample is relatively large and, as a result of the sample diversity regarding workplace size and work tasks, the possibility of group-specific effects and localization effects were reduced. The high predominance of women in the sample (87.2%) is representative of the municipality sector in Norway [<xref rid="bibr27-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A further strength of the study is that all unit types (e.g. kindergartens and nursing homes) were represented in the sample and there was no systematic dropout from any unit type on responses to the questionnaire.</p><p>This study contributes to increasing our knowledge about the effects of a workplace-based, low-cost, low-threshold sick leave intervention. Municipal employees have a relatively high sickness absence compared with employees in the private and state-level public sectors [<xref rid="bibr28-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This study addresses one of the sectors with the highest rates of long-term sick leave.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the lack of a published protocol. The low response rate of about 50% might increase the risk of non-response bias and limit the validity of the findings. It would have been relevant to investigate whether men and women showed different effects of the intervention, but the low number of men in the study could not justify such analyses. Caution should therefore be made when generalizing to private sector employees and to men.</p><p>In cases where employees are listed as sick for 16 days or less, sick leave is not registered in NAV and was thereby missed in this study. Although we were most interested in long-term sick leave as a result of its negative consequences, both for the individual person and for society, it would have been interesting to see how the intervention affected short-term sick leave. As a result of data protection issues, information about the diagnoses for which the individual participants were listed as sick was not available. However, there is a high degree of comorbidity in subjective health complaints [<xref rid="bibr29-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and a huge variation in which diagnosis the general practitioner chooses when presented with the same patient [<xref rid="bibr30-1403494816653854" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], making the specific diagnoses less relevant in this setting.</p><p>A further limitation of this study is that we cannot exclude the possibility of confounding variables because the unit of randomization was different from the unit of analysis. However, adjustment for sick leave the year before the intervention and for the clustering of data within the unit of randomization justifies the analyses. Some of the subgroups were small. This resulted in wide confidence intervals, which also indicated a low power for these analyses.</p></sec><sec id="section15-1403494816653854"><title>Implications</title><p>Knowledge of which individual people will benefit from workplace interventions is important for authorities in focusing such interventions. Excluding workers with high levels of pain-related fear seems unrealistic as well as unethical. The intervention has a preventive approach towards all employees present at work. More knowledge of the characteristics of individuals high scores on pain-related fear, and why these people do not respond to interventions such as atWork, is needed. Future studies should explore mediational effects, i.e. whether expectancies and beliefs change as a result of the intervention, and whether these changes predict the effect on sick leave.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section16-1403494816653854"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The atWork intervention had an effect on days of sick leave at the individual level in the first six months during the intervention and low levels of pain-related fear predicted the effect. There was no difference in the effect of the intervention between individuals high and low scores on helplessness and hopelessness, belief in the back pain myths and LBP. As the effect of atWork on sick leave was limited to the first six months, indicating a need for repetition of the intervention message, the educational part of atWork should be tested in primary health care and considered implemented as a part of regular practice in primary care if the results are positive.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Trial registration <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, registration number: NCT00741650.
