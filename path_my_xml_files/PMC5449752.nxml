Background</title><p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to a group of individuals who have cognitive impairments that are of insufficient severity to constitute dementia [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which is a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Amnestic MCI (aMCI) is the most common subtype of MCI syndrome, which is defined as a significant impairment in episodic memory with no impairment in activities of daily living [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In an interventional study of patients meeting Petersen's criteria for aMCI, 16% progressed to dementia each year, 99% of whom received an AD diagnosis [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence, MCI, in particular aMCI, is generally recognized in many cases to represent a prodromal stage of AD [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and is a treatment target for AD [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The ultimate aim of AD therapy is to stop or slow down the disease progression. However, the well-studied conventional treatments for AD are generally considered to be symptom-relieving rather than disease-modifying; with that cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) treatment for mild to moderate AD may reach peak benefit for cognitive improvement at 3 months but drop below baseline level at 9 months [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Patients with moderate to severe AD receiving stable doses of both donepezil and memantine experienced limited cognitive improvement [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The use of herbal therapy in the treatment of dementia started from The<italic> Complete Work of Jingyue</italic> published in China in 1624, which contains the earliest known description in the world of an herbal therapeutic strategy for dementia [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This herbal capsule (shenwu capsule) is one kind of a lot of herbal therapies that also improved memory and cognitive symptoms in patients with aMCI in a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase II trial [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The aim of this phase III trial was to further evaluate the effects and safety of the herbal capsule, over 6 months, on cognition and memory in patients with aMCI.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Chinese-speaking adults 55 to 80 years of age, weighing between 45 and 90 kilograms, living in the community were eligible to participate. All patients were recruited from memory clinics in China. The patients were required to meet the diagnostic criteria for MCI as developed by Petersen et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The following were the operational criteria (Chinese version) for inclusion in the aMCI group at screening: (1) memory complaints that were corroborated by an informant, (2) abnormal memory function as assessed by Chinese version of the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (AMIPB) Logical Memory Delayed Story Recall (DSR) subtest score &#x0003c;10.5 for age (cutoff scores: &#x02264;11.15 for 50 to 60 years old, &#x02264;10.55 for 61 to 75 years old, &#x02264;8.1 for 76 to 85 years old.) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], (3) normal general cognitive function as determined by a clinician's judgment based on a structured interview with the patients (a Mini-Mental State Examination: MMSE of 24 to 30 score for education) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], (4) no or minimal impairments in activities of daily living as determined by a clinical interview with the patient and an informant (an Activities of Daily Living: ADL &#x0003c; 16 score) [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and (5) being not sufficiently impaired, cognitively and functionally, to meet the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as judged by an experienced AD research clinician. In addition, they were judged to be at stage 2-3 of the Global Deterioration scale (GDS) [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], to have a score of &#x02264;12 of the Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAMD for 17 items) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and &#x02264;4 on the Hachinski Ischemia scale (HIS) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and to have no or mild medial temporal atrophy (MTA) or hippocampal volume atrophy on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These operational Petersen criteria for inclusion in the aMCI group were modified from the criteria used in one of our previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and are largely consistent with those used in previous donepezil MCI studies [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The subjects were required to have adequate vision and hearing to participate in the study assessments.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: an MMSE score of &#x02264;19 for illiteracy, &#x02264;22 for primary school, or &#x02264;26 for middle school, evidence of a focal brain lesion, a previous head injury with loss of consciousness or immediate confusion after the injury, a history of significant cerebrovascular disease, a central nervous system infarct or infection, focal lesions of clinical significance on a computerized tomography scan or MRI, any history of a major psychiatric disorder including DSM-IV-defined psychosis, major depression, bipolar disorder, or alcohol or substance abuse [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], documented evidence of an active gastric or duodenal ulcer within the previous 3 months, a history of active malignancy or prostate cancer within the preceding 24 months, a chronic or acute renal, hepatic, or metabolic disorder, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus, a neurologic disease that might affect cognition such as AD, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, normal pressure hydrocephalus, epilepsy, cerebral tumor, and toxic metabolic encephalopathy, a history of hypersensitivity to clinical drugs including anticonvulsant, antiparkinsonian agents, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, cholinomimetics, vitamin E, ginkgo biloba extract, or any other drugs that can affect memory, or participating in any other clinical studies within the past 30 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Study Design</title><p>Subjects enrolled in this clinical trial were assigned at a ratio of 2&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to the herbal group and the donepezil group. The sample size was determined based on a previous report [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. According to that report, the improvements in the patients who received donepezil treatment at 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;mg/day was 3.3 (&#x000b1;4.7) points on Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The sample sizes of 168 for the herbal group and 84 for the donepezil group were estimated based on changes in ADAS-cog scores of 1.5 points, with a power of 80% at a 0.025 significance level (single side). Because of the greater rate of discontinuation (22%) in this study, the sample size was increased to 216 for the herbal group and 108 for the donepezil group.</p><p>In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-placebo, parallel-controlled phase III trial, total 324 were randomly assigned to the herbal group or the donepezil group. The patients entered a 2-week placebo run-in period, and all patients received a MRI scan before being randomized and then were randomized (2&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to receive 24 weeks of treatment with either (a) herbal capsule (5 capsules/time, 3 times/day) and a placebo that was identical to donepezil tablets (<italic>n</italic> = 216) or (b) donepezil (5&#x02009;mg/day) and a placebo that was identical to herbal capsules (<italic>n</italic> = 108). Active drug was supplied in an herbal capsule (shenwu capsule) containing a 451&#x02009;mg extract from<italic> Panax ginseng</italic> (4.24%), radix polygoni multiflori (21.28%),<italic> Epimedium brevicornum</italic> Maxim (14.89%),<italic> Acorus tatarinowii</italic> Schott (14.89%), chuanxiong (14.90%), and lobed kudzuvine root (29.80%). Another active drug was a donepezil 5&#x02009;mg tablet. The placebo medications were identical to the active medications. The herbal capsules were supplied by the sponsor, the Northern China Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (Hebei province, China). The donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept) was supplied by Eisai, Inc.</p><p>Randomization was stratified according to the study sites using the SAS statistical software (version 6.12). The randomized code was generated by a central randomization schema by statistics. The subjects, investigators, and sponsor were blinded to treatment allocation.</p><p>We followed up with all patients who were enrolled. Study visits take place at screening (day 1 clinic visit), at mid-study (week 12), and at the endpoint of treatment (week 24). Patients who completed the 24 weeks of the study were followed up 24 weeks after withdrawal.</p><p>This study was undertaken in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines for good clinical practice. The study protocol was approved by the medical ethics boards of the study institutions where the principal investigators worked. Nine institutions of national drug clinical trials participated in this study. All patients and their caregivers provided written informed consent.</p><p>All treatments were documented, including the name of drug, the daily dose, the reason for its use, and the date of termination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Efficacy Measurements</title><p>The primary efficacy outcomes measured cognition. The secondary efficacy outcomes measured memory. Cognition was assessed with the ADAS-cog [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and memory was evaluated with the DSR [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The ADAS-cog was designed specifically to evaluate the severity of cognitive dysfunctions characteristic of AD patients and includes 11 items. Among these items, memory, orientation, language function, practical ability, and attention are evaluated. The score on the ADAS-cog ranges from 0 to 70 points, with 0 points indicating no impairment and 70 points indicating severe impairment of cognition.</p><p>The secondary efficacy measures were the logical memory subtest, which was used to evaluate the memory of a patient and is often used not only as a screening tool, but also as a secondary efficacy measure in clinical trials of MCI [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Inclusion of the delayed recall condition of a story memory task enhanced the overall accuracy of distinguishing MCI from normal aging (sensitivity = 92.2%; specificity = 94.7%), and this clinical measure was found to have a positive predictive value (PPV) of around 85% [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The DSR Chinese version from the AMIPB also has higher sensitivity (90%) and specificity (80%) for screening MCI or very mild AD (CDR = 0.5) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Safety Assessments</title><p>Information on adverse events and compliance in the donepezil and herbal therapy groups was collected during all of the postbaseline study visits (week 1 and every 3 months until the end of the study) and via additional telephone conversations with caregivers at week 2 and every month until the end of the study. The safety assessment included (1) examinations of general physical vital signs including breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure, (2) electrocardiography (ECG), (3) laboratory testing, and (4) documentation of any adverse events that occurred including the type of event, when it occurred, its duration, treatment measures, the likely relationship between the tested drugs and the adverse events (positive, probable, possible, and not related), and the severity of the event (mild, moderate, and severe).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Statistical Analysis and Power Calculations</title><p>The statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software. In the randomized trial, the analyses for efficacy were conducted in two patient populations: the intent-to-treat population (ITT) and the fully evaluable population (FE). The ITT population includes every subject who is randomized. Primary and secondary efficacy analyses were conducted using last observation carried forward (LOCF) methods for missing data. The FE population included patients who completed 24 weeks of the medication with good compliance and with complete data. The safety sample included all subjects who received at least one dosing and at least one safety evaluation. The therapeutic window for efficacy evaluation was extended to include 7 days after the last dose of a study drug.</p><p>The changes from baseline on the ADAS-cog and DSR were determined as an efficacy measurement by application of covariance analysis that controlled for the baseline score and center effect. We compared the demographic variables between the two groups using a <italic>t</italic>-test for age and weight and Fisher's test for education and race. The reported prevalence of adverse events between the two groups was compared by Pearson's chi-square test. All <italic>p</italic> values were two-tailed, and all analyses were significant if the <italic>p</italic> value was &#x02264;0.05. The analyses of safety were conducted in the safety population.</p><p>This phase III study is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01451749">NCT01451749</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>Nine study sites in China were used to examine the patients from September 1, 2008, to May 3, 2010. Of the 1112 subjects screened in these nine sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), 613 subjects were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria, withdrew consent (79 subjects), or were lost to follow-up (96 subjects). A total of 324 eligible subjects were randomized into the herbal capsule (<italic>n</italic> = 216) or the donepezil tablet group (<italic>n</italic> = 108) and received at least one dose of the study medication. One subject in the herbal therapy group and one subject in the donepezil group did not meet the inclusion criteria, 215 subjects were allocated to the herbal therapy group, and 107 subjects were allocated to the donepezil group. Of these 322 patients, 44 discontinued their treatment before week 24. The remaining 184 subjects in the herbal therapy group and 94 in the donepezil group completed the study. Premature discontinuations were because the subject did not complete the follow-up (14 patients in the herbal therapy group and 5 patients in the donepezil group), adverse events occurred (2 patients in the herbal therapy group), or a protocol violation occurred (14 patients in the herbal therapy group and 7 patients in the donepezil group). In two cases, the subjects refused to explain the reason for their withdrawal (one in each group).</p><p>The demographic characteristics of the subjects at baseline are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. Baseline demographic characteristics were similar in the two groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to age, sex, race, education, or baseline neuropsychological and cognitive test scores (e.g., MMSE, GDS, and HAMD). At the end of the study, there was no significant difference in compliance between the herbal therapy (92.6%) and the donepezil group (95.3%) (Fisher's test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.474).</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1.

It should be noted that data were available only from a very small sample, and the results may not be representative of the overall outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Safety and Tolerability</title><p>During the study, 18.5% (39/216) of patients reported adverse event in the herbal therapy group and 57.4% (62/108) of patients reported adverse events in the donepezil group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>). The prevalence of probable and possible adverse events in the herbal therapy group was similar to that in the donepezil group (Chi-square test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.259). The most frequent adverse events assessed as probably related to the study medication in the herbal therapy group were thirst (6.5%) and sore throats (4.2%). The prevalence of diarrhea (0%), nausea (2.1%), and insomnia or abnormal dreams (2.3%) in the herbal therapy group was significantly lower than the rates of 12.5% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), 16.7% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and 16.7% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), respectively, in the donepezil group. Two patients who received herbal therapy discontinued the study because of adverse events or intolerance. All of the adverse events were mild to moderate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>), and there were no severe adverse events in either of the two treatment groups. No significant changes from baseline were observed in vital signs, physical examination findings, ECG status, or laboratory values between the two treatment groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>At present, there are no approved treatments for MCI. Studies have shown that donepezil significantly improves ADAS-cog scores, which measures cognition [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Herbal therapy capsule is the first traditional Chinese herbal medicine evaluated in approved clinical trials for the treatment of MCI and the mild to moderate dementia in AD by the State Administration of Food and Drugs of China. The aim of this 24-week, donepezil-controlled phase III trial was to further evaluate the effectiveness of herbal therapy as a traditional Chinese herbal monotherapy for patients with aMCI.</p><p>MCI represents an intermediary stage between normal cognition and mild dementia. At present, the diagnosis of MCI relies on objective measures such as MMSE and LMS scores. In this study, we used the Chinese version of these operational criteria for inclusion in the aMCI group. The mean MMSE score in this group was 27 points, which is similar to findings in previous studies [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This indicates that the Chinese version of the operational criteria for aMCI is reliable.</p><p>In this study, treatment with 15 capsules of herbal therapy per day produced a significant improvement in ADAS-cog scores, with a decrease of 4.19 points from baseline in patients with aMCI, which was not significantly different than the decrease in the donepezil group. According to previous studies, an improvement of 3.3 points or more in ADAS-cog scores with antidementia therapy would be considered a clinically significant effect [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This study shows that herbal therapy has similar clinical benefits on MCI to donepezil.</p><p>Episodic memory is the first and most severely affected cognitive domain and is also a core feature of the diagnosis of AD or aMCI [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The herbal-treated group showed significant improvements on secondary DSR measures of memory compared to baseline (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) that were compared to those seen in the donepezil group.</p><p>The herbal therapy and donepezil were safe and well tolerated. The frequency of adverse events differed greatly between the herbal therapy and donepezil groups. 57.4% of the subjects reported at least one adverse event in the group that received donepezil at 5&#x02009;mg/day for 24 weeks. In contrast, only 18.0% of subjects reported experiencing at least one adverse event in the herbal therapy group. The most frequent adverse events assessed as probably related to the study medication in the herbal therapy group were thirst, sore throat, insomnia or abnormal dreams, and nausea. These occurred at significantly lower rates than in the donepezil group.</p><p>There are some limitations of this study. First, there was no placebo group. As all subjects knew that they were being treated with one of two drugs, and all of the individuals who assessed the patients knew this as well, our results may have been influenced by a positive response bias. Second, the sample size was relatively small. Third, period of follow-up was relatively short. Hence, further studies with a placebo group, a large scale, and a long-term follow-up must be conducted to fully evaluate the efficacy of herbal therapy in patients with MCI.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this phase III study provides evidence of a possible therapeutic effect of herbal therapy in patients with aMCI. Compared to baseline, herbal therapy produced significant improvements in ADAS-cog measures of cognition and DSR measures of memory in both the ITT population and FE population. Moreover, the herbal therapy was generally safe and well tolerated in this study up to 24 weeks of treatment. We suggest that herbal therapy may be an effective therapy for the patients with MCI. Further studies should be conducted using long-term therapeutic interventions to investigate whether the herbal therapy delays the progression from MCI to dementia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Xuewen Wang (B.S., Drug Clinical Trial Centre of Shanghai University of Chinese Medicine) for overseeing the clinical operation and Yinhua Wang (M.D., Peking University First Hospital) for ADAS-cog assessment training of the clinical investigators in this phase III study.
