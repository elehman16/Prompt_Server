children with CP between six and ten years of age. Gait and balance were evaluated
three times: Evaluation 1 (before the stimulation), Evaluation 2 (immediately

consisting of the application of low-intensity monophasic electrical current to the
scalp. The electrical current flows from the electrodes and penetrates the skull,
reaching the cerebral cortex. Although most of the current is dissipated among the
overlying tissues, a sufficient amount of current reaches the structures of the cortex,
modifying the membrane potential of the cells and modulating cortex activity<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. It has been suggested that the effects of tDCS
stem from persistent changes that resemble long-term potentiation and can lead to
enhanced synaptic efficacy<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>There has been an increase in the number of studies stating that tDCS applied to the
motor cortex can be used for the treatment of neurological disorders in children, such
as cerebral palsy (CP)<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. CP results in diminished
activation of the central nervous system during the execution of movements<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. A reduction in motor cortex excitability in
children is associated with poor motor development<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Neurophysiological analyses have revealed global alterations in cortex
excitability in children with CP, with a reduction in the activation of corticospinal
and somatosensory circuits<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The reduction in
somatosensory activation may be the neurological basis for poor tactile, proprioceptive
and kinesthetic awareness in children with CP<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.
While there is no cure for the brain lesion associated with this condition, sequelae can
be minimized through neurorehabilitation methods<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Studies involving functional magnetic resonance in children with CP have
demonstrated that rehabilitation resources are capable of promoting the activation of
the primary motor cortex<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, which is an important
area of the brain capable of facilitating cerebral reorganization<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>Ninety percent of children with CP exhibit impaired gait due to diminished cortex
excitability, excessive muscle weakness, abnormal joint kinematics, and diminished
postural reactions<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Moreover, inadequate
postural control limits motor development in these children<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>Kaski et al.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> found that anodal tDCS induces
changes in the excitability of the motor cortex referring to the lower limbs, with
improvements in both balance and gait. The hypothesis of the present study is that a
single session of anodal tDCS applied to the primary motor cortex in children with CP
can momentarily potentiate motor patterns through the enhancement of cortex excitability
and activation of corticospinal circuits. The authors believe that the facilitation of
cortical excitability of the primary motor cortex may enhance motor control and velocity
of motor responses in children with CP. In CP, deficits in spatiotemporal gait
parameters and postural stability are notorious and generate a functional impairment of
the child. Additionally the evaluation of the static balance and gait analysis are
consecrated and scientifically valid techniques. For these reasons, the stabilometry and
analysis of spatio-temporal parameters of gait were selected as outcomes of this study.
The expected outcomes are an increase in gait velocity and reductions in the oscillation
of the center of pressure (CoP) during standing in the anteroposteior and mediolateral
directions. However, the changes would likely be lost after a few minutes due to the
limitation of tDCS to a single session.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a single session of tDCS
applied to the primary motor cortex regarding immediate changes in spatiotemporal gait
and oscillations of the CoP during standing in children with CP classified at levels I
to III of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>The present randomized, sham-controlled, cross-sectional study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) was carried out in compliance with the ethical standards

</p><p>Children with a diagnosis of spastic CP were recruited from specialized clinics. The
inclusion criteria were classification at levels I, II and III of the GMFCS<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, independent gait for at least 12 months, age
six to ten years, and degree of understanding compatible with the procedures proposed.
The following were the exclusion criteria: having undergone any surgical procedure or
neurolytic block in the previous 12 months, orthopedic deformity, epilepsy, metal
implants in the skull or hearing aids. Following the application of the eligibility
criteria, 20 children were selected for the study.</p><p>The participants were randomized into the experimental and control groups based on the
order of inclusion into the study. A randomization list was generated using blocks of
six (for every six participants, three were randomly allocated to each group) and four
(for every four participants, two were randomly allocated to each group) to minimize the
risk of imbalance in the size of the groups.</p><p>The procedures were carried out in a single day. Following Evaluation 1 (pretreatment
evaluation/ before stimulation), the children received 20 minutes of either active
(experimental group) or sham (control group) tDCS. The children received tDCS at rest
and seated comfortably. A responsible therapist accompanied the stimulation session.
Evaluation 2 (post-treatment evaluation/after stimulation) was performed immediately
following tDCS and Evaluation 3 (twenty minutes after stimulation) was performed after
20 minutes of rest. Three researchers carried out the procedures - two performed the
evaluations and one performed the tDCS. The evaluations and tDCS were carried out in
separate rooms to ensure the blinding of the examiners. Only the researcher in charge of
the application of the tDCS was aware of the allocation of the children to the
experimental and control groups.</p><sec><title>Transcranial direct-current stimulation</title><p>tDCS is the application of a low-intensity direct current on the scalp using two
electrodes (anode and cathode). A sufficient amount of current penetrates the
overlying tissues and reaches the structures of the motor cortex, modifying the
neuronal membrane potential. Anodal stimulation enhances cortex excitability. The
tDCS device (Soterix Medical Inc., USA) included two non-metallic sponge surface
electrodes measuring 5 &#x000d7; 5 cm<sup>2</sup> and moistened with saline solution. The
children in the experimental group received anodal stimulation of the primary motor
cortex and those in the control group received placebo transcranial stimulation. The
anode was positioned over the primary motor cortex of the dominant hemisphere
following the 10-20 international system of electrode placement for
electroencephalography<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the cathode
was positioned in the supra-orbital region contralateral to the anode. The current
was applied to the primary motor cortex for 20 minutes, during which the children
remained seated. The tDCS device has a button that allows the operator to control the
intensity of the current. Stimulation was gradually increased until reaching 1 mA and
gradually reduced in the final 10 seconds. For sham stimulation, the electrodes were
positioned in the same manner and the stimulator was switched on for 30 seconds. This
procedure gave the children in the control group the initial sensation, but they did
not receive electrical stimulation for the remainder of the session. This is
considered a valid control procedure in studies involving tDCS<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation procedures</title><p>The evaluation of spatiotemporal gait variables (gait velocity, cadence, step length,
stride length and step width) was performed using the SMART-D 140<sup>(r)</sup>
system (BTS Engineering, Italy) with eight infrared cameras, the SMART-D INTEGRATED
WORKSTATION<sup>(r)</sup> with 32 analog channels and a synchronized video system.
After the determination of the anthropometric measures (height, mass, lower limb
length, distance between the femoral condyles or diameter of the knee, distance
between the malleolus or diameter of the ankle, distance between the anterior iliac
spines, and thickness of the pelvis), passive markers were placed at specific
reference points directly on the skin for the evaluation of each segment of the body.
The markers were placed over C7 and the sacrum as well as bilaterally over the
acromion, anterosuperior iliac spine, greater trochanter, femoral epicondyle, femoral
wand, tibial head, tibial wand, lateral malleolus, lateral aspect of the foot at the
fifth metatarsal head and at the heel (only for static offset measurements), as
described by Davis et al.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. The Davis
marker-set was chosen as the protocol of choice to acquire the movement of lower
limbs and trunk based on Ferrari et al.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.
After the child was familiarized with the process, at least six trials were performed
along a 5-meter catwalk at a pace self-selected by each child. Three consistent
trials of each lower limb were considered for analysis. All readings were performed
by the same experienced researcher to ensure the reliability of the data collection.
In the present study, only spatiotemporal and kinematic gait variables were
identified and computed. The following spatiotemporal parameters were analyzed:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>velocity (m/s): mean velocity of progression;</p></list-item><list-item><p>cadence: number of steps in a time unit (steps/min); </p></list-item><list-item><p>stride length (m): longitudinal distance between successive points of heel
contact of the same foot;</p></list-item><list-item><p>step length (m): longitudinal distance between the point of initial contact
of one foot and the point of initial contact of the contralateral foot;</p></list-item><list-item><p>step width (m): distance between the rear end of the right and left heel
centerlines along the mediolateral axis;</p></list-item><list-item><p>stance phase: % of gait cycle that begins with initial contact and ends at
toe-off of the same limb.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Mean and standard deviation values of gait velocity, cadence, step length, stride
length, and step width were used for the statistical analysis.</p><p>Static balance was evaluated with the use of a force plate (Kistler model 9286BA),
which allows stabilometric analysis through readings of oscillations of the CoP. The
acquisition frequency was 50 Hz, captured by four piezoelectric sensors positioned at
the extremities of the platform, which measured 40 &#x000d7; 60 cm. The data were recorded
and interpreted using the SWAY software program (BTS Engineering) integrated to and
synchronized with the SMART-D 140<sup>(r)</sup>. The child was instructed to remain
in a quiet standing position on the platform, barefoot, arms alongside the body, gaze
fixed on a point marked at a distance of one meter at the height of the glabellum,
with heels aligned and an unrestricted foot base. The children classified at level
III of the GMFCS<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> used their usual gait assistance device,
which was positioned off the force plate. The platform used has dimensions
(600X400X35mm) that do not require the child to make great postural adjustments to
position the gait assistance device off the platform. The children were instructed to
keep the assistance device off the platform. The positioning of the device should
allow a comfortable posture. The exact location of the device was marked on the floor
with a white ribbon. The positioning was used in the three Evaluations to allow same
condition assessment and comparative analysis<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>Readings of displacement from the CoP on the X (anteroposterior) and Y (mediolateral)
axes were performed under two conditions: eyes open and eyes closed. Three
acquisitions of 30 seconds were obtained for each condition and the average of the
acquisitions was used in the statistical analysis. The outputs of the force platform
allowed us to compute the CoP time series in the anteroposterior direction and the
mediolateral direction. The output of the platform was processed to compute
quantitative parameters in the time domain. The anteroposterior and mediolateral
coordinates of the CoP trajectory underwent post-acquisition filtering using a
low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz. In the analysis, we identified and
computed the range of CoP displacement in the anteroposterior direction (RANGEAP
index) and the mediolateral direction (RANGEML index), expressed in mm<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the adherence of the data to the
Gaussian curve. Parametric distribution was demonstrated, the data were expressed as
mean and standard deviation values. To verify the effect of transcranial stimulation
(active and placebo) over the three Evaluations in each group, intragroup analysis
was performed. Intergroup analysis was performed to verify a possible effect obtained
by the experimental group (active stimulation). With these goals, two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used with the Bonferroni post hoc test, considering the
variables: anteroposterior oscillations (open and closed eyes), mediolateral
oscillations (open and closed eyes), and spatiotemporal gait parameters (gait
velocity, cadence, step length, stride length, and step width). The level of
significance was set to 0.05. The data was tabulated and processed using Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, v.19.0).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty children with CP were randomly allocated to the experimental group (active tDCS
applied to the primary motor cortex) or control group (sham tDCS). No statistically
significant differences between groups were found regarding the baseline data (age,

rehabilitation due to its potential in optimizing the results of physical therapy<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The authors of the present study were curious
about the possible effects of tDCS performed in an isolated fashion regarding changes in
postural stability and whether children would be able to tolerate the current. No
previous studies were found addressing the effects of tDCS on postural control and gait
in children with CP. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to determine
the immediate effect of a single session of tDCS applied to the primary motor cortex in
children classified at levels I to III of the GMFCS. To enhance the validity of the
study, the experimental group (active tDCS) was compared to a control group (sham tDCS)
and double-blind procedures (participants and examiners) were employed.</p><p>Three-dimensional gait analysis<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and stabilometry<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> are considered fundamental assessment tools
for the adequate quantification of the effects of interventions aimed at improvements in
gait and static balance. These sensitive methods allow the identification of small
changes within a short span of time and were therefore selected for the present study.
The experimental group exhibited significant differences in the evaluations after the
application of active tDCS regarding gait velocity and oscillations of the CoP in
comparison with the evaluation held prior to stimulation.</p><p>The present study offers important findings. The experimental group exhibited an
increase in gait velocity immediately following tDCS, but this increase was not
maintained for more than 20 minutes after the end of the stimulation. Although this was
a cross-sectional study involving a single session of tDCS, the results suggest that the
momentary increase in cortex activation may have exerted an influence on motor control
and gait. As the primary motor cortex was only stimulated for 20 minutes during rest,
the authors did not expect the changes to be maintained in medium or long term. However,
the findings could encourage future studies to combine tDCS with motor rehabilitation
therapies to determine whether this technique can assist in improving gait and postural
control in children with CP.</p><p>Gait velocity has an important relationship with the cadence. However, in this study
there was an increase in walking velocity without increasing cadence. The authors
believe that this fact can be explained by an increased step length.</p><p>Analyzing a population of elderly individuals (n=9) with leukoaraiosis, an ischemic
lesion of the cerebral white matter that results in gait and balance disorders, Kaski et
al.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> found that a single session of anodal
stimulation in combination with gait and balance training had repercussions in the form
of improvements in gait velocity, stride length, step length variability, and balance.
In a study by Kaski et al.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 30 healthy
individuals received either active or sham tDCS to either the primary motor cortex or
prefrontal cortex prior to walking on a moving platform (a mobile sled moved with a
maximum velocity of 1.4 m/s). The group that received active tDCS exhibited an increase
in gait velocity. Thus, anodal stimulation was capable of inducing changes in the
excitability of the motor cortex of the lower limbs, thereby potentiating locomotion
control. All of these previous findings underscore the potential of anodal stimulation
of the motor cortex regarding the facilitation of motor recovery.</p><p>Balance deficit resulting in frequent falls is one of the most limiting aspects of
CP<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Regarding oscillations of the CoP, two
important findings were identified in the present study: 1) the similarity in the
results with and without visual restriction; and 2) although a small number of
participants were classified at level III of the GMFCS (three per group), the effects
apparently involved these children, who require gait-assistance devices.</p><p>Visual compensation is an important aspect of postural stability. In children with CP,
oscillations are greater with eyes closed due to the lack of visual compensation. The
results suggest that there was a momentary improvement in postural stability. Although
there are no studies that address the effects of tDCS on static balance, the authors
believe that greater effectiveness of the proprioceptive system may have resulted from
the stimulation of the cortical area. Thus, the motor responses were effective in
minimizing the oscillations with visual restriction. Similar results on the effect size
of the oscillations of the CoP, with and without visual restriction, are observed only
with more dynamic interventions, such as the use of ankle-foot orthoses<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>.</p><p>All clinical effects observed following the application of tDCS are directly related to
cortex modulations resulting from stimulation dependent on the polarity of the current.
Anodal stimulation increases cortex excitability, favoring the depolarization of the
neuronal membrane, whereas the cathode has an inhibitory effect through the
hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. A number of studies have demonstrated that
tDCS is successful in achieving these effects, but some papers suggest that anodal
stimulation applied to the primary motor cortex seems to have an effect that is
dependent on the learning task and the formation of memory. These neurophysiological
aspects and the clinical findings described in the results and discussion sections of
this paper suggest that tDCS may be an important tool for potentiating the effects of
neuromotor rehabilitation. Although the present investigation has limitations, such as
not being a prospective study and not involving a broader stimulation protocol,
important preliminary findings are described herein<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Such findings can offer a direction for the development of further
studies that address the use of tDCS in combination with physical therapy to treat
locomotion and postural disorders in children with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the present findings, a single session of tDCS applied to the primary motor
cortex in children with CP was capable of causing significant reduction in
anteroposterior oscillation with eyes open and eyes closed and in mediolateral
oscillation with eyes closed in comparison with the control group (tDCS sham). Moreover,
increases in gait velocity, step length, and stride length were also observed after
stimulation. However, the results were not maintained for more than 20 minutes after the
end of stimulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>For the financial support from the Brazilian fostering agencies: Conselho Nacional de
