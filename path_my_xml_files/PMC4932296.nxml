Interventions aimed at developing skills in lifelong physical activities may provide the foundation for an active lifestyle into adulthood. In general, school-based physical activity interventions targeting adolescents have produced modest results and few have been designed to be &#x02018;scaled-up&#x02019; and disseminated. This study aims to: (1) assess the effectiveness of two physical activity promotion programmes (ie, NEAT and ATLAS) that have been modified for scalability; and (2) evaluate the dissemination of these programmes throughout government funded secondary schools.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study will be conducted in two phases. In the first phase (cluster randomised controlled trial), 16 schools will be randomly allocated to the intervention or a usual care control condition. In the second phase, the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (Re-AIM) framework will be used to guide the design and evaluation of programme dissemination throughout New South Wales (NSW), Australia. In both phases, teachers will be trained to deliver the NEAT and ATLAS programmes, which will include: (1) interactive student seminars; (2) structured physical activity programmes; (3) lunch-time fitness sessions; and (4) web-based smartphone apps. In the cluster RCT, study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6&#x02005;months (primary end point) and 12-months. Muscular fitness will be the primary outcome and secondary outcomes will include: objectively measured body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, flexibility, resistance training skill competency, physical activity, self-reported recreational screen-time, sleep, sugar-sweetened beverage and junk food snack consumption, self-esteem and well-being.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has received approval from the University of Newcastle (H-2014-0312) and the NSW Department of Education (SERAP: 2012121) human research ethics committees.

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Yet, 80% of adolescents worldwide are failing to achieve the amount of physical activity needed to enhance health-related fitness.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Of concern, there have been global secular declines in cardiorespiratory<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and muscular fitness<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> among young people, which have coincided with a rise in youth obesity.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Although the importance of cardiorespiratory fitness<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and a healthy body composition<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> have been established for some time, recent evidence has demonstrated the unique health benefits of achieving and maintaining adequate muscular fitness.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Consequently, a recommendation to participate in &#x02018;muscle strengthening&#x02019; physical activity (eg, resistance training) now appears in youth physical activity guidelines in a number of countries.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref></p><p>Schools are ideally placed to promote health-related fitness and physical activity in adolescent populations, as young people spend 6&#x02013;7&#x02005;h per day for 40&#x02005;weeks of the year in schools, most of which have the facilities, equipment, qualified staff and curriculum to deliver health promotion interventions.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Indeed, these settings have the potential to help students meet the recommended 60&#x02005;min of daily MVPA and develop the knowledge, skills and confidence to be physically active into the future.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, schools are less likely to prepare young people for a lifetime of physical activity if their focus remains solely on traditional, competitive team sports and games.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Such activities may be enjoyable for some and are indeed an effective way for young people to engage in MVPA, particularly for those with the requisite level of skill competency to be successful. However, team sports and games may not have strong carry over effects into adulthood, as many young people drop out of sport during adolescence.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Moreover, adolescents have identified a desire to try a variety of non-traditional activities, including weight training and fitness classes.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Considering the lack of emphasis on alternative physical activities within traditional physical education (PE) and school sport programmes,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> many young people may leave school ill-equipped to maintain a physically active lifestyle beyond the schooling years.</p><p>Lifelong physical activities &#x0201c;are typically performed individually or in small groups, involve minimal structure and minimal physical contact, are characterized by varying levels of intensity and competitiveness, and may be easily carried into adulthood and old age&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These activities can contribute substantially to adult physical activity. Indeed, health and fitness activities such as resistance training rank among the most popular sports and physical activities regularly performed by western adults.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Although these activities are popular in relative terms, the overall prevalence of participation remains quite low. For example, just one in five adults in the USA report &#x02018;exercising with equipment&#x02019;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and only 17% of Australian<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and 14% of English<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> adults regularly engage in &#x02018;fitness/gym&#x02019; and &#x02018;health and fitness&#x02019; activities, respectively. Clearly, for some, health and fitness activities can form an integral part of an active lifestyle during adulthood. However, in addition to common barriers such as time and cost, many adults may feel they lack the competence to participate in these activities effectively.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Given the capacity for schools to provide students with the skills and confidence to engage in lifelong physical activities,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> there is a clear rationale for school-based interventions that address adolescents' current and future physical activity needs.</p><p>Despite the potential for schools to influence students' health behaviours, previous school-based physical activity interventions have had mixed success and a number of limitations have emerged in the literature.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> First, few interventions have included strategies and components designed to promote muscular fitness, as recommended in national physical activity guidelines. Second, previous interventions have often been developed for &#x02018;all&#x02019; students using a &#x02018;one size fits all&#x02019; approach, regardless of their age and sex. Sex has emerged as a consistent moderator of school-based interventions, suggesting that subgroups such as males and females may benefit from different intervention strategies and sociocultural intervention tailoring.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Third, previous interventions have often failed to include implementation strategies, which may contribute to poor intervention fidelity and null findings.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Finally, the majority of interventions have been evaluated in small-scale efficacy trials and very few have been designed to be &#x02018;scaled-up&#x02019; and disseminated.</p><p>Schools can help address the global pandemic of physical inactivity by employing a multicomponent approach that includes quality PE, physical activity within and beyond the school day, staff involvement, as well as family and community engagement.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Such an approach should include evidence-based programmes that can be implemented within an overall health promotion framework. The Nutrition and Enjoyable Activity for Teen Girls (NEAT)<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref> and the Active Teen Leaders Avoiding Screen-time (ATLAS)<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> programmes were developed specifically to support school-based physical activity promotion and obesity prevention efforts for girls and boys, respectively. The NEAT and ATLAS programmes reduced screen-time<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and improved body composition,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> muscular fitness,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> resistance training skill competency,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and well-being<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> in low-active adolescents. However, similar to other school-based interventions, the original NEAT and ATLAS programmes included a large number of intervention strategies, making them difficult to implement more broadly without the ongoing support of the research team.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Using process evaluation data<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and feedback from the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Education, the programmes were refined to allow for implementation in typical secondary school settings. Therefore, the aims of this two-phased study are to (1) determine the effectiveness of the revised NEAT and ATLAS programmes in 16 schools using a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT); and (2) evaluate the dissemination of these programmes throughout government-funded secondary schools in NSW, Australia over a 12-month period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>In the first phase of the study, the revised NEAT and ATLAS interventions will be evaluated using a cluster RCT. The intervention will target females and males in year 9 (third year of secondary school) in 16 coeducational, government-funded secondary schools in NSW Australia. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (April/June, 2015) and will be repeated postintervention at 6&#x02005;months (October/December, 2015) and again at 12-month follow-up (April/June, 2016). Muscular fitness (primary outcome) and other study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6&#x02005;months (primary end point) and 12&#x02005;months. In addition to these assessments, accelerometer-measured physical activity will be assessed at 3&#x02005;months (mid-intervention) to determine the effect of the intervention on physical activity during programme implementation. The design, conduct and reporting of this RCT will adhere to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Schools will be randomised to the NEAT and ATLAS intervention group or a wait-list control group for the 12-month study period. Schools in the control group will participate in usual practice (ie, regularly scheduled PE and co-curricular school sport) during the study period.</p><p>In the second phase of the study, the RE-AIM framework<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> will be used to evaluate the dissemination of the interventions (ie, Reach into the student population, Effectiveness in changing student outcomes, Adoption based on teacher training and initiation of program delivery, Implementation fidelity, and Maintenance of student changes and program delivery beyond initial implementation). The research team will develop &#x02018;train the trainer&#x02019; materials to enable dissemination of the NEAT and ATLAS interventions throughout government-funded secondary schools in NSW, Australia. The dissemination phase will not include a control group.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Sample size calculations have been based on estimated effect sizes for the primary outcome of muscular fitness assessed using the 90&#x000b0; push-up and standing long jump tests.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Although the health benefits of muscular fitness are now well established,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> there is a lack of consensus regarding the clinical significance of changes in muscular fitness in young people. Based on our previous studies, we anticipate an effect size of d=0.4 for muscular fitness (adjusted between-group difference of &#x0223c;2 repetitions).<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> In accordance with CONSORT guidelines,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> our power calculations were adjusted for the clustering of effects at the school level. We adjusted for clustering using a correction factor of [1+(m&#x02212;1)&#x000d7;ICC], where m=participants per class and ICC=the intraclass correlation coefficient. Assuming an average class size of 20 participating students, two classes per school and an ICC for muscular fitness of 0.09,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> the correction factor is 2.7 (ie, 1+(<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02212;1)&#x000d7;0.09). Allowing for an expected 10% loss to follow-up at 6&#x02005;months and a further 10% loss at 12&#x02005;months, the required sample size to achieve 80% power with &#x003b1; levels set at p&#x0003c;0.05 is 640 students from 16 schools (16 intervention classes and 16 control classes). The study will be adequately powered to detect significant between-group differences at the primary study end point (6&#x02005;months) and at follow-up (12&#x02005;months).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The RCT will be conducted within 16 eligible government-funded secondary schools located within the Hunter, Central Coast and Sydney regions of NSW. To identify eligible schools, our research team will use the NSW Department of Education website &#x02018;School Locator&#x02019; function to identify Government secondary schools within approximately 50&#x02005;km of the University of Newcastle and the University of Sydney. Eligible participants will be adolescent males and females in year 9 attending 1 of the 16 recruited schools who do not have an injury or illness that would affect participation in a physical activity and resistance training programme. The programmes will be implemented within schools by members of the teaching staff at each school, who may be PE teachers or teachers of other subject areas. Female and male teachers will facilitate the NEAT and ATLAS programmes, respectively.</p><p>In the dissemination phase, all secondary schools in NSW will be eligible to participate and the programme will be open to students in years 9 and 10. The dissemination of the NEAT and ATLAS programmes will begin in October, 2015 (as requested by the department of education) and continue until October 2017. During this phase, the research team will aim to deliver two professional learning workshops per school term, resulting in a total of 16 workshops over the dissemination period. Overall, the research team will aim to recruit and train 240 teachers (ie, 15 teachers per workshop) to deliver the NEAT and/or ATLAS programmes in their schools.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Blinding and randomisation</title><p>In the cluster RCT, recruitment and baseline data collection will be conducted prior to randomisation, thereby concealing group allocation, and attempts will be made to blind research assistants to group allocation at the postintervention and follow-up time points (however, this is not always possible in school-based cluster RCTs). Following baseline data collection, schools will be match-paired based on size, geographical location and socioeconomic status (SES). Schools within each pair will then be randomised to either the intervention group or the wait-list control group by a researcher not involved in the current study using a computer-based random number producing algorithm. As such, schools randomised to the intervention condition will deliver both the ATLAS and NEAT programmes during the study period, whereas schools in the control condition will not deliver either programme until the completion of the 12-month study assessments. In the dissemination phase there will be no control group.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Intervention</title><p>Following the research evaluation of the NEAT<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref> and ATLAS<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> programmes, the lead investigator was approached by the NSW Department of Education to develop a sustainable intervention model that could be disseminated across secondary schools in NSW. The Department of Education determined that the original NEAT and ATLAS programmes were too intensive and not sustainable without the support of the research team. Feedback from the Department of Education and examination of process evaluation data were used to guide the modification of intervention strategies. The following changes were made: (1) increased focus on resistance training (NEAT and ATLAS); (2) removal of nutrition workshops (NEAT), as these were considered too expensive and resource intensive; (3) removal of parent newsletters (NEAT/ATLAS) because they were not read extensively by parents/care givers; (4) text messaging strategy replaced with smartphone app (NEAT) to minimise cost; (5) removal of pedometer component (NEAT/ATLAS), as participant usage was low in NEAT and ATLAS; and (6) structured physical activity programme duration reduced to 10&#x02005;weeks (NEAT/ATLAS) from 40&#x02005;weeks (NEAT) and 20&#x02005;weeks (ATLAS) to fit within one school term.</p><p>A summary of the revised NEAT and ATLAS implementation strategies and four gender-targeted intervention components is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010448F1">figure 1</xref>. The following evidence-based implementation strategies will be used to ensure that the intervention is delivered as intended:<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> (1) recruitment of school champions; (2) professional learning workshop for teachers; (3) provision of teacher handbook, session resources and fitness equipment; and (4) physical activity session observation and feedback.

The models will be used to assess the impact of treatment (intervention or control), time (treated as categorical with levels baseline, 6 and 12&#x02005;months) and the group-by-time interaction, using random effects to account for the clustered nature of the data. Although randomisation will occur at the school level, our statistical analyses will be adjusted for the clustering of effects at the class level. This is because our intervention will be delivered to students in classes and school-based studies have demonstrated that clustering at the school level is negligible after accounting from clustering at the class level.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>
<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref> Mixed model analyses are consistent with the intention-to-treat principle, assuming the data are missing at random. The validity of this assumption will be explored by assessing relationships between missing and observed values of covariates and previous outcomes. Multiple imputation and/or pattern mixture modelling will be considered as a sensitivity analysis if the dropout rate is substantial. Three potential moderators (ie, sex, household SES, and initial weight status) will be explored using linear mixed models with interaction terms and subgroup analyses will be conducted if p&#x0003c;0.1.<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> Hypothesised mediators of physical activity and sedentary behaviour change will be examined using multilevel linear analysis and a product-of-coefficients test that is appropriate for cluster RCTs.

School Principals, teachers, parents and students all provided informed written consent prior to enrolment. It is not expected that participants will be at any greater risk of adverse events than they would be when participating in other types of school-based physical activity. However, the teacher handbook includes a section for teachers to report any injuries or adverse events that may occur. Any amendments to the study protocols will be publicly available via the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Trial number: ACTRN12615000360516). Data management procedures will be conducted by DRL and JS. All entered data will be de-identified using participant codes and will be stored electronically in a password protected drive at the University of Newcastle. Quality checks of entered data will be completed by JS (ie, range checks). Access to the final trial dataset will comply with the conditions of the ethics committee approval and will be at the discretion of the lead CI, DRL. The findings of the RCT and dissemination studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and all participating schools in the RCT will receive a report outlining the study findings at the conclusion of the trial.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors contributed intellectually to the study design and research methodology, or will be directly involved in the collection and management of data.
