Obesity predisposes to co-morbidities like hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemias, thus substantially rising healthcare expenditure.

Group 1 received orlistat 120 mg three times a day and group 2 received placebo three times a day. Weight, waist circumference, BMI, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL were measured at baseline and then at 8<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> week. ADR reported by patients were recorded. For safety evaluation various hematological and biochemical parameters were assessed. Z test was used for analysis of data.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>Compared to placebo, orlistat caused significant reduction (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in weight (4.65 kg vs 2.5 kg; orlistat vs placebo, respectively), BMI (1.91 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs 0.64 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and waist circumference (4.84 cm vs 2 cm), cholesterol (10.68 mg vs 6.18 mg) and LDL level (5.87 mg vs 2.33 mg).

The following categories of patients were excluded: patients with endocrinologic obesity; patients using other medications that can alter body weight or lipid levels; patients with clinically significant cardiovascular; respiratory or hepatobiliary disorder; chronic diarrhea and pregnant and lactating women.</p><p>Total 80 patients were enrolled in the study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomized into two groups of 40 patients each. Group 1 patients received orlistat 120 mg three times a day, 1 hour before breakfast, lunch and dinner.

In the same visit, irrespective of group allotted, all the patients were educated about the importance of lifestyle changes including healthy dietary habits and exercise in weight reduction and maintenance. Patients were given information about nutritional value of various foods and few simple exercises for decreasing and maintaining near normal body weight. Their compliance for lifestyle change advice was checked through verbal questions at each visit. Biochemical examinations assessed were Hb, total leukocyte count (TLC), serum creatinine, SGPT SGOT at baseline and at the 24th week of study period.</p><p>The efficacy of drugs was assessed by primary efficacy parameters i.e. body weight (kg), body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and waist circumference (in cm measured at midpoint between the lower border of rib cage and iliac crest).

Previous studies like Bakris <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] found 5.3% reduction, Broom <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] showed reduction of 5.8% while Lindgarde <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] found of 5.9% weight reduction. It has been proved that a weight loss of 5&#x02013;10% of initial body weight has been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] so orlistat has an advantage in this regard.</p><p>In the present study, the absolute reduction in cholesterol concentration was 10.68 mg/dl, which is comparable to results of previous studies; Davidson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] showed mean reduction of 12 mg/dl, Finer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] found mean reduction of 11.6 mg/dl. In present study LDL concentration was reduced by 5.87 mg/dl, which is in accordance with the previous studies; Derosa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] showed mean decrease by 7.8 mg/dl, Goley <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] reported mean fall in LDL concentration by 3.9 mg/dl while Finer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] found mean reduction of 4.2 mg/dl.</p><p>We observed no significant change in triglyceride and HDL level, also there was no significant effect on random blood glucose level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in orlistat-treated group. This findings correlate with the previous studies carried out by Finer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Davidson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Goley <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, orlistat was well tolerated and adverse drug reactions were mostly gastrointestinal like loose stools, oily stools/spotting, abdominal pain and fecal urgency and these were significantly more common in orlistat-treated group compared to placebo group reflecting its mechanism of action. Orlistat did not produce any adverse impact on the Hb, TLC, serum creatinine, SGPT and SGOT. This again indicates a good safety profile of orlistat.</p><p>Efficacy of orlistat has been demonstrated in diverse group of obese patients including adolescent, adults with metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetics, type 2 diabetic. Patients with binge eating disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, postmenopause, depression or heart failure have been shown to derive modest benefit.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Since the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents is increasing at alarming rate, the beneficial effects of orlistat in this group are encouraging and represent a potentially promising treatment modality in conjunction with lifestyle changes for obese adolescents in future. Orlistat is known to reduce the incidence of development of diabetes in prediabetics, this effect is desirable as prevention of diabetes is definitely a more cost effective option compared to its treatment.</p><p>It is widely known that any long-term weight reduction program involving any strategy has two phases: initial weight reduction followed by stabilization. Initial phase of around 9 months is of rapid weight loss followed by weight stabilization even with continuation of the same therapy. As the present study was of 6 months it may well be a part of the initial rapid weight reduction phase which may stabilize afterwards, emphasizing the need for longer duration studies to check for any sustained or incremental effect on weight reduction and to look for any detrimental effect on any organ system apart from gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>In India the cost of orlistat 120 mg three times a day comes up to <graphic xlink:href="IJEM-15-99-g004.jpg" position="float"/> 105/-, which may seem to be quite high but well-designed pharmacoeconomic analyses have shown that it is a cost-effective treatment option for obese patients with or without diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>It is known that even moderate weight loss achieved by healthy diet and adequate exercise with or without adjuvant pharmacotherapy significantly reduces the obesity associated co-morbidities and future complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] In the present study, we observed that placebo group patients also showed improvement in all the efficacy parameters under consideration, which might be because of the lifestyle changes adopted by the patients.</p><p>Given the burden of obesity and its comorbidities on the healthcare system of developing country like ours, it follows that pharmacotherapy that reduces morbidity and mortality from obesity-related complications may provide economic as well as health benefits.</p><p>Thus from the present study it can be concluded that orlistat is an effective and well-tolerated antiobesity drug, which can be employed as an adjunct to therapeutic lifestyle changes to achieve and maintain optimal weight.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors wish to acknowledge
