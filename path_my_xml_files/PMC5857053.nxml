European adolescents study has shown that a higher cardiovascular health is associated with lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and healthier hepatic profile (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Strong relation of elevated ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels with most cardio-metabolic risk factors is documented in adolescents at national level (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Changes in liver function tests are observed in obese patients with MetS, especially in ALT level. Moreover, insulin resistance, one of the suggested pathogenic mechanisms of MetS, is shown to be an independent influencing phenomenon on liver function tests in obese youth (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Healthier life style in terms of diets and physical activity improves MetS components (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Observational studies conclude that consumption of milk, yogurt, and other dairy products, might be associated with a reduced risk of weight gain and obesity as well as of cardiovascular disease, and these findings are, in part, supported by randomized trials (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Camel milk consumption has been advised for hyperglycemia control by some traditional medical disciplines. It has been studied in a number of animal and human diabetic populations and some favorable results are described (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Camel milk supplementation ameliorated serum biochemical and immunohistochemical measurements that altered after diabetes mellitus induction in albino rats (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In some societies who consume camel milk as a major dietary resource, diabetes mellitus prevalence is reported to be very low (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In type-2 diabetes mellitus patients, camel milk has reduced glycemic indices such as FBS, HbA<sub>1</sub>C Insulin resistance, etc. as well (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The overall composition of camel milk is responsible for its benefits, and some effects might be attributed to the insulin content and its probable influences on insulin resistance/sensitivity. The insulin in camel milk may be present in nanoparticles that could pass the gastric acid, or it may contain &#x02018;insulin-like&#x02019; small molecules (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A review study showed that camel milk is highly nutritious and safe for consumption by children (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In all parts of the world where camel lives, its milk is traditionally fermented in order to be more sustainable, nutritious and health-promoting and to have better digestibility of the milk proteins. Fermentation is the process of converting carbohydrates to acid by using bacteria (probiotics) (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Chal or Shubat is the homemade fermented camel milk (FCM) by a semi-continuous or fed-batch fermentation process in Turkey, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and by Turkmens in Iran. For the first time a kind of pasteurized FCM similar to Chal has been produced industrially in Iran, which was used in this study. It is reported that pasteurization does not affect the chemical composition of camel milk (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Limited experience exists on the association between fermented dairy intake and risk of MetS; and to the best of our knowledge there is no published information about the effect of FCM consumption on MetS or its features. This study aimed to investigate the effect FCM on anthropometric, liver enzyme and metabolic features of MetS in adolescents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec2"><label>2.</label><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and registration</title><p>This study is a double blind, two treatments - two periods (2&#x000d7;2) crossover, randomized controlled clinical trial. It was scientifically and ethically approved by review boards of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) (approval code: 193059). It was registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.irct.ir">www.irct.ir</ext-link>), one of the primary registries of the World Health Organization. The trial identification number is IRCT201508081202N2.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 11-18-year-old adolescents with MetS. MetS was defined according to de Ferranti et al. (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), fasting blood sugar (FBS) modified as IDF, as having at least three of these: 1) fasting triglycerides &#x02265; 100 mg/dL; 2) HDL&#x0003c;50 mg/dL, except in boys aged 15 to 19 years, in whom the cut point was&#x0003c;45 mg/dL; 3) fasting glucose &#x02265;100 mg/dL; 4) waist circumference &#x0003e;75<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and gender; and 5) systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;90<sup>th</sup> percentile for gender, age, and height. They were identified through screening the overweight/obese adolescents referring to the clinic of the Child and Growth Development Research Center, IUMS, and the private practice offices of principal investigators. Inclusion criteria were as follows: being Iranian,11-18 years old, having MetS, healthy otherwise, without use of supplements or chemical or herbal medications at least 4 weeks prior to the trial commence, no smoking, not being under any dietary regimens or physical activity programs, no history of allergies to dairies, signing informed consent form by at least one parent and by adolescent. Exclusion criteria consisted of occurrence of any serious illnesses, not consuming trial products for more than three consecutive or seven interrupted days, not willing or not being able to continue.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Considering 90% statistical power, two-tailed type-one error rate as 5% for detecting at least a standardized effect size of 1 for main study outcomes. According to Agrawal et al. (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) the sample size was calculated to be 22.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Randomization and treatment allocation</title><p>The biostatistician supervisor, who was not aware of participants&#x02019; condition, randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either type A dairy during period 1 followed by type B dairy during period 2 (AB sequence) or the reverse (BA sequence). Random allocation was done by randomization software using stratified, based on age group and sex, blocks of size 2.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Intervention and blinding</title><p>The eligible adolescents were recalled by phone and invited to refer to the clinic in a pre-determined day. The researcher put the adolescents in the two above mentioned sequences based on the randomization list. Necessary instructions was explained again and informed consent forms were completed. The researcher and adolescents knew that participants may receive FCM or diluted cow&#x02019;s yogurt (DCY) (Doogh) but no one knew which of the A and B products is FCM or DCY. The intervention was consumption of 250 ml of type A dairy /day (at evening for better tolerability) for eight consecutive weeks in one sequence and the same amount and duration of consumption of type B in the other one. After a wash out period of 4 weeks (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), the participants were crossed between dairies and each participant consumed the other type of dairy for another 8 weeks. FCM was the test and DCY was the control product as an assumption. Every participant took 4-6 sealed door 1-liter bottles to home for the first 16-24 days and was supplied continuously thereafter. Both products were purchased from one factory located in a northern Iranian city, manufactured under maximally similar conditions as possible, were completely alike in physical appearance and opaque bottling, differing only in their labels (A or B). Their dietary constituents which were determined blindly by private and university food analysis laboratories are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. The fermentation process of DCY was done by ordinary yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). Then yogurt was diluted by water and adding some salt to produce DCY. Lactobacilli were used as part of the production of FCM.</p><p>The only person who knew the exact content of bottles labeled as A or B was the factory manager. Participants&#x02019; houses were scattered around the city and they were not in contact with each other. The researcher was in contact with the factory manager in all the study duration, provided the dairy needed for every 2-4 weeks, and delivered them to participants at their homes or at the clinic. The adolescents were asked to bring back the empty bottles.</p><p>All participants were encouraged to have healthy lifestyle, and we gave them a pamphlet explaining about proper diet and physical activity habits.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Measurements</title><p>All following measurements were done in the week prior to, as well as the week after each period (4 measurements for every adolescent). Anthropometric measures consisted of height, weight, waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC). Weigh was measured with less clothing by a calibrated scale (QF-2003A; China) to the nearest 0.2 Kg and height, waist and hip were measured with a standard strip meter to the nearest 0.5 centimeters; measurement of barefoot height was done in standing position adjacent to a straight wall. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (Kg) divided by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). Before and after each period, the subjects referred after overnight fasting to a specific clinical laboratory who was collaborated in order to take their blood samples and prepare serums for measuring total cholesterol (CHOL), low density lipoprotein - cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein - cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Serums then were kept frozen at -20 centigrade. Lipid profile and liver function tests were measured by Roche - Hitachi 911 Chemistry Analyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). None of the laboratory staff were aware of the kind of dairy used by referring participant. A three - day - food record (one holiday and two usual days) was completed by participants at the week prior to each period. The nutritional data of these records were calculated manually based on standard tables and transformed to participants&#x02019; intakes by Nutritionist 4 software modified for Iranian foods (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A transcultural adapted physical activity scale (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) was completed at the same times. The mean score of ten items of this scale (ranging 1-5) was considered as the physical activity score of participants.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Dietary constituents of two types of dairies consumed by the intervention and control groups</title></caption><table frame="border" rules="all"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">Constituent</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">FCM</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">DCY</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Total protein (g/100g)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.42</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Total fat (g/100g) </td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.67</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.45</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Saturated fat (g/100g fat)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trans fat (g/100g fat)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.47</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Total carbohydrate (g/100g)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.08</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Fat free solids (g/100g)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.84</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.45</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Iron (mg/kg)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0083</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0083</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Potassium (mg/kg)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Sodium (mg/kg)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2500</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Magnesium (mg/kg)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">87.8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Calcium (mg/kg) </td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">927.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1270</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Vitamin C (mg/kg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.27</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.27</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Vitamin D (mg/kg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Under 1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1">FCM: fermented camel milk, DCY: liquid cow&#x02019;s yogurt</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-6-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Normality of continuous data was evaluated using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Q-Q plot.

ratio. It showed non-significant positive influence on serum lipids as well.</p><p>The obese/overweight adolescents who meet the MetS criteria have significantly higher rates of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) and higher liver enzymes levels compared to non-MetS ones (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our study participants were overweight or obese with MetS and some of them showed elevated liver enzymes.</p><p>It is likely that overweight children with MetS have had increased genetic susceptibility to unhealthy diet consequences compared to their non-MetS counterparts (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The current evidence supports the effect of dietary interventions for the management of NAFLD/ liver enzymes levels in children (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Studies on nutrition programs, Mediterranean diet and the combination of diet and exercise have provided a potential for improvement in serum ALT activity and/or liver fat content or prevention of NAFLD (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Animal studies by Hamad et al, Kim et al and Chen et al have shown the favorable effects of kinds of dairies or their derivatives on NAFLD and liver enzymes: whey (a kind of milk protein) has significantly reduced hepatic triglycerides and liver enzymes ALT and AST in rats, and kefir was reported to modulate gut microbiota and mycobiota in mice, which prevents obesity and NAFLD via promoting fatty acid oxidation, and to improve NAFLD by inhibiting the lipogenesis pathway (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Nabavi and coworkers have reported that probiotic yogurt consumption improves hepatic enzymes, total cholesterol and LDL-C levels in adults with NAFLD (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our study findings as lowering liver enzymes (and serum lipids) are in accordance with those studies. Meantime this study has not resulted in unfavorable effects on most of the other cardio-metabolic risk factors. However, our dairy intervention results are in contrary to Manheimer and colleagues&#x02019; meta-analysis findings (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). According to their work, Paleolithic diet, the ancient-time like dietary recommendation to exclude grains, dairy, and nutritional products of industry resulted in greater short-term improvements in metabolic syndrome components than did guideline-based control diets. As the authors emphasize, it is less clear whether the avoidance of whole grains and dairy products is essential for the optimal control of metabolism and future studies should examine the impact of avoiding them on health.</p><p>Available animal and human investigations on camel milk and its derivatives are mostly in diabetic subjects. Meena et al have reported that camel milk ameliorates hyperglycemia and oxidative damage in type-1 diabetic experimental rats (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Manaer and colleagues showed that shubat has significant hypoglycemic potential in type 2 diabetic rats and may modulate lipid metabolism and protect renal function in them (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Agrawal and coworkers have searched the effects of camel milk consumption on patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple studies. All the studies have resulted in promising effects in terms of better glycemia control, reduction of insulin doses and controlling of microalbuminuria (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Ebaid et al reported that camel milk whey protein improves pancreatic cell structure and function in diabetic rats (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Korish et al have shown that camel milk ameliorates the biochemical and cellular features of experimental NAFLD (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Our study findings resemble to Korish et al. observations on liver enzymes and serum lipids and Manaer et al observations on serum lipids.</p><p>Kadooka and co-workers (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and Takano et al have shown the favorable effects of fermented milk on BMI and abdominal adiposity including visceral fat (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Andrade and colleagues also have reported that women taking fermented milk with a baseline mild hypercholesterolemia have shown a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol. HDL cholesterol was also reduced by the test product (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Our findings, though non-significant, are in accordance with these studies in relation to obesity measures and serum lipids. Parnami et al. have also shown that Indian fermented milk fortified with probiotic bacteria and inulin improves serum lipids (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In contrary to our findings, Ostadrahimi and co-workers reported that serum lipids levels did not show significant change with fermented milk consumption (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>Our main intervention has been an especial kind of milk (camel milk) product. Many of our finding may be attributed to the nature of camel milk in addition to its fermented status. The concomitant decrease of serum lipids and lesser increase in weight and BMI of adolescents (though non-significant) may have mediated the favorable alterations in their liver enzymes. All of the possible effects and side effects of FCM and their explanatory mechanisms need to be investigated in future studies.</p><sec id="sec4-1"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p>The study was conducted under maximally achievable blinding and randomization. Its cross-over design made the cases and controls matched. It used natural products which are domestic, can be publicly advised and added to routine dietary regimens though FCM is rather expensive. The achieved sample size may has resulted in non-significance of some observed favorable effects. We recruited as much as possible participants. Due to effects of maturity processes in adolescents, seasonal manufacturing difficulties of FCM and the issues related to laboratory kits, the time between the first and the last subject&#x02019;s entrance could not be more expanded. The daily amount and length of consumption of dairies are two other probable factors in this regard. However, both had been determined based on previous studies with camel milk, products sustainability, and adolescents&#x02019; compliance. Our study did not include liver imaging.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec5"><label>5.</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>According to the observed favorable effects of fermented camel milk on liver enzymes, it may be considered as a dietary supplement in related circumstances. Furthermore, effects on anthropometric and lipid levels should be confirmed in subsequent studies. The observed side effects were constipation and probable allergic reaction in two of participants. A third one did not like the taste.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement:</title><p>This study was funded as a PhD thesis of IUMS under the grant number of 193059.
