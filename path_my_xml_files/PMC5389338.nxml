The N-ALIVE trial was planned as a large prison-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of Naloxone-on-release (NOR) in the prevention of fatal opiate overdoses soon after release (30% reduction in the first 4-weeks; 20% in weeks 5&#x02013;12) <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The N-ALIVE <underline>pilot</underline> trial (ISRCTN34044390) was a randomized feasibility study to test the main trial's assumptions on recruitment of prisons and prisoners, and also the logistics for ensuring that randomized participants received their N-ALIVE pack on release <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. See Meade et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> for how delivery of the N-ALIVE protocol was achieved in 16 prisons in England.

The N-ALIVE pilot trial had undertaken to notify the Research Ethics Committee and participants if we had reason to believe that the N-ALIVE pilot trial would not proceed to the N-ALIVE main trial.</p><p>The start of Scotland's National Naloxone Policy (NNP) in January 2011 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, with funding for both NOR and community-based take-home naloxone (THN), had pre-empted the N-ALIVE trial's planned randomization in Scottish prisons. The primary outcome for Scotland's science-led NNP-evaluation <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> was a 20%&#x02013;30% reduction in the proportion of opioid-related deaths (ORDs) with a 4-week antecedent of prison-release. As the proportion had been 10% in 2006&#x02013;2010, Scotland's NNP had 80% power to discern reduction to 7% in 2011&#x02013;13, as upper target; or to 8% in 2011&#x02013;15, as lower target.</p><p>In this paper, we describe how external data for the third year of before/after evaluation of Scotland's NNP, a related public health policy <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, were anticipated by eliciting prior opinion about the Scottish results in the month prior to their release as official statistics <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. We then describe how deliberations by N-ALIVE's Trial Steering-Data Monitoring Committee (TS-DMC) on N-ALIVE's own interim data, together with those on NOR from Scotland, led to the decision to cease randomization in the N-ALIVE pilot trial and to recommend to local Principal Investigators (PIs) that NOR be offered to already-randomized prisoners who had not yet been released <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>To be ready to act promptly, we had elicited expert opinion about the Scotland's forthcoming results <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> in order to focus on the most probable scenarios for TS-DMC's decision-making. Unscheduled interim analysis was also undertaken of the N-ALIVE pilot trial's own data from returned prisoner self-questionnaires, specifically on the extent of NOR's administration intramuscularly to the ex-prisoner for whom it had been prescribed versus to another person.</p><p>We begin, therefore, with a brief history of formally eliciting prior opinion to inform the design and monitoring of RCTs funded by the UK's Medical Research Council (MRC); and some early accounts of DMC deliberations. The back-story on the NALoxone InVEstigation (N-ALIVE) follows, which puts our elicitation in context, and sets the scene for deliberations and decisions by the N-ALIVE's TS-DMC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>On elicitations for randomized trials funded by the Medical Research Council and deliberations by Data Monitoring Committees</title><p>The earliest example of formally eliciting prior opinion to inform trial design was &#x0201c;place your bets&#x0201d; about the mortality of surfactant-treated very premature babies (aged 25&#x02013;29 weeks) in a RCT funded by MRC in the mid-1980s <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Following the early termination by the investigators of this neutron therapy trial, a decision later ratified by a specially-convened post-hoc DMC, the MRC required all of its RCTs to have a properly constituted DMC.</p><p>In 1994, Spiegelhalter, Freedman and Parmar <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> formalized Bayesian approaches to RCTs. Their Bayesian design and monitoring of the CHART trials included a description of how prior elicitation of clinicians' opinion could be used to form &#x0201c;enthusiastic&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;sceptical&#x0201d; prior distributions <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

In this scenario, there is potentially a two-thirds chance that the ex-prisoner's NOR is administered to another person so that contamination between N-ALIVE's randomized groups could be substantially higher than 20%: and especially so if, in addition, there is assortative mixing of recently-released prisoners.</p><p>Contamination was assessed in the N-ALIVE pilot trial by asking participants who were returned to prison to complete a returned prisoner self-questionnaire (RPSQ). The questionnaire asked participants about overdose soon after release, and whether naloxone was administered before the arrival of an ambulance; and also about their presence when someone else overdosed, and whether naloxone was administered before the arrival of an ambulance <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Pre-emption of N-ALIVE's randomization by National Naloxone Policies (NNPs) in Scotland and Wales</title><p>The decision in spring 2010 by Scotland's Minister for Safety and Communities to introduce Scotland's NNP from January 2011 pre-empted N-ALIVE's randomization in Scotland <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Scotland became the first country in the world to have a funded public health policy of NOR for at-risk prisoners and THN for community-based opioid users.

We then detail the TS-DMC's deliberations in October and November 2014.</p><p>The N-ALIVE pilot trial's emerging data on ORDs (now maximally for 2800 participants; versus 56,000 required to demonstrate NOR's a priori plausible effectiveness <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>) were highly unlikely to achieve a sufficient signal-noise ratio on effectiveness and so a joint TS-DMC had been appointed (which DA chaired). Membership included N-ALIVE's three co-principal investigators (JS, MKBP, SMB). The TS-DMC's independent chair and membership would, we hoped, form the nucleus of the main trial's DMC.</p><p>Prior to October 2014, the main business of the N-ALIVE pilot trial's TS-DMC had been to support the recruitment of a sufficient number of prisons in England; to deliberate on reasons for fewer prisoners with a history of heroin injection being identified by our prison-based N-ALIVE workers than anticipated by the number of prisoners engaged in drug treatment in 2005/06 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; and to engage governors in promoting their security staff's acceptance that our assigned N-ALIVE packs should be held with the prisoner's valuables <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Our TS-DMC members had not expected to confront critical ethical decisions on whether to cease randomization in the N-ALIVE pilot trial. However, from the outset, their responsibilities did include the review of external evidence and recommending whether the pilot trial should continue to the N-ALIVE main trial.</p><p>The TS-DMC did not take formal action on NNP's interim data for 2011&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2012 on prison-release ORDs, see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>, which had decreased significantly (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) from 9.8% (193/1970) in 2006&#x02013;2010 to 7.0% (58/829) in 2011&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2012 as the wide confidence interval and NNP's before/after design warranted only a watching brief. Moreover, by the end of October 2013, the N-ALIVE pilot trial had received fewer than 70 of its own RPSQs.</p><p>In October 2014, however, TS-DMC members were faced by external data which required tense and careful deliberation. Prior elicitation of expert opinion had served to sensitize members to the sorts of decision that might have to be made.

The TS-DMC was also made aware of commissioners' plans for prisons in the North West region of England to issue NOR to eligible prisoners; and that, if funding for the N-ALIVE pilot trial was not to be extended beyond March 2015, randomizations would have to cease by the end of December 2014 to allow time for 12-weeks&#x02019; follow-up and an orderly closure of the N-ALIVE sites.</p><p>The TS-DMC minutes recorded that, following the release of the third year of results on Scotland's NNP <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> on 28 October 2014, a teleconference would be organized to decide the course of action for N-ALIVE. In practice, the TS-DMC chair asked that the TS-DMC's initial deliberations be conducted by email as an analytical summary of Scotland's 3-year results for 2011&#x02013;2013 had to be prepared. Also, in view of the late registration of coroner-referred deaths in England and Wales, information on ORDs in Wales and England by death-year, rather than by the year of death-registration, were needed to set Scotland's ORDs in context <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>As Scotland's 3-year results coincided with one of the three cells in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> wherein lay 50% of the prior belief, the elicitation exercise had served mainly as reassurance that prior beliefs and realization were not at odds.

The fairness of continued randomization when a resource such as NOR is scarce or restricted is a strong argument, both scientifically and ethically.

But, because the TS-DMC was considering a major action, the TS-DMC chair needed to communicate with the absent members (JP and JRR) as soon after the meeting as possible to check if they were in agreement. If not, a further teleconference should be arranged with the full TS-DMC.</p><p>Considerations a) and b) were deciding factors: we estimated that at least half the administrations of NOR in the N-ALIVE main trial would be to some-one other than the ex-prisoner for whom NOR had been prescribed. Even without NOR-administered contamination of the N-ALIVE control group, the number to be randomized in the N-ALIVE main trial would be excessive (over 150,000). Worse, substantial contamination, in excess of 20%, could not be ruled out and so the main trial could not go ahead.</p><p>The N-ALIVE pilot trial's TS-DMC decided, on the basis of a) and b), that randomization should cease in the N-ALIVE pilot trial on 8 December 2014. Because of the strength of the evidence from Scotland's NNP (since peer-reviewed <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>) and the WHO Guidelines published on 5th November 2014 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, the TS-DMC recommended to local PIs that, once randomization ceased, all randomized participants who remained in prison should be offered NOR (ie those who had been allocated to control as well as those assigned to NOR). Submission to the Research Ethics Committee was made on 21 November 2014, which notified its approval on 1 December 2014 of the TS-DMC's recommendations and N-ALIVE's updated information for participants on the basis for its decisions (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/our_research/research_areas/other_conditions/studies/n_alive/" id="intref0010">http://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/our_research/research_areas/other_conditions/studies/n_alive/</ext-link>).
