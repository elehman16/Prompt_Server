This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee at each site and was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All subjects provided written informed consent.</p><p>Subjects were stratified by age group (&#x0003c;45 vs &#x02265; 45 yrs) and were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive bimatoprost 0.03% twice daily (BID), bimatoprost 0.03% once daily (QD), or vehicle BID for 7 months of treatment. Randomization was managed through automated interactive voice/web response systems. In all 3 treatment groups, subjects were instructed to apply study medication twice daily, once in the morning (AM dose) and once in the evening (PM dose). In the bimatoprost QD group, the AM dose consisted of vehicle with the PM dose consisting of bimatoprost 0.03%. In the bimatoprost BID group, both the AM and PM doses consisted of bimatoprost 0.03%. In the vehicle group, both the AM and PM doses consisted of vehicle. Treatment group assignment was masked to both the subjects and the investigators throughout the study.</p><p>The total duration of study participation from the screening visit was approximately 9 months, with a total of 11 visits: at screening (Day &#x02212;21 to &#x02212;7), Day 1 (baseline), Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (or early study discontinuation), and at Month 8 posttreatment follow-up. Eyebrow stencils were used to standardize both the application of the study medication and the area of grooming. Subjects were instructed to groom their eyebrows outside the treatment area, as delineated by the stencil, with scissors or tweezers only; grooming within the eyebrow treatment area was prohibited. The stencil was also used as a guide to determine the area of study medication application.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible subjects were female or male, aged 18 years or older with eyebrow hypotrichosis, defined as either a Grade 1 or 2 on the Allergan Global Eyebrow Assessment (GEBA) scale with photonumeric guide. The GEBA instrument is a validated 4-point scale used to grade fullness of the eyebrows (1 = very sparse, 2 = sparse, 3 = full, and 4 = very full).</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they had an uncontrolled systemic disease or any known disease, infection, or abnormality in the eyebrow area or hair shaft. Subjects with systemic diseases, including all types of alopecia areata, which could prevent hair growth or produce abnormal growth were excluded, along with subjects with substantial permanent eyebrow loss due to overgrooming; any skin pigmentation/depigmentation, tattoos, moles, scars, or other characteristics within the eyebrow area that could confound evaluation. Subjects who used permanent injectable fillers in and around the eyebrow area within 12 months; or systemic treatment within 12 months of screening with agents that may affect hair growth were excluded, as were subjects who had undergone any facial surgery (e.g., brow lift) or eyebrow extension within 3 months of screening. Subjects who used temporary or semipermanent eyebrow fillers or eyebrow tint, dye, or bleaching within 2 months of screening and female subjects who were pregnant, nursing, or planning for a pregnancy during the study were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Study Endpoints</title><p>Efficacy and safety were assessed posttreatment at Week 1, at Months 1 through 7 (or on early discontinuation), and at the Month 8 follow-up visit. The primary efficacy endpoint was the investigator's assessment of the subject's overall eyebrow fullness at Month 7 using the GEBA scale. The primary efficacy variable was defined as the proportion of subjects with at least a 1-grade increase (improvement) in the GEBA grade from baseline at Month 7. Secondary efficacy endpoints at Month 7 included subjects' eyebrow fullness (mm<sup>2</sup>) and darkness (intensity units [IU]; negative values are representative of eyebrow darkening) as measured using Digital Monitoring System Image Analysis (DMSIA). Subject satisfaction with eyebrow treatment at Month 7 was measured by item 6 of the 9-item Eyebrow Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Follow-up version). Assessments could range from 1 (very satisfied) to 5 (very dissatisfied). Safety measures included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital sign measurements (i.e., blood pressure, pulse rate, and urine pregnancy test), and laboratory tests (i.e., thyroid-stimulating hormone and ferritin) and hematology values.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>To have statistical power to evaluate the primary efficacy variable, a sample size of 348 was proposed, with a 1:1:1 randomization ratio to study groups. Accounting for an attrition rate of 15%, 295 subjects were anticipated to complete the study. Assuming a 25% vehicle response rate based on the primary efficacy endpoint and a 2-sided Type 1 error of 0.05, a sample size of 348 with a 1:1:1 randomization ratio for bimatoprost BID, bimatoprost QD, or vehicle was chosen to detect a difference of 20%, 22%, and 25% in favor of bimatoprost BID, with a statistical power of 86%, 92%, and 97%, respectively. Efficacy analyses reported here were performed on the intent-to-treat population, defined as all randomized subjects. The GEBA and ESS Item 6 grades were analyzed using a pooled point estimate for the treatment difference, based on the Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel method, stratified by age group.

To control the Type 1 error rate for multiple secondary endpoints, a serial gatekeeping approach was used based on the importance of the secondary variables: eyebrow fullness, eyebrow darkness, and ESS Item 6.

Subject satisfaction at Month 9 with eyebrow fullness/thickness and darkness/color was higher in the bimatoprost group than that in the vehicle group. No AEs were reported. In another study of 27 subjects with eyebrow hypotrichosis, bimatoprost increased eyebrow growth from baseline, as measured by hair diameter.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Contact dermatitis occurred in 3 (11.1%) of the 27 subjects.</p><p>Although subjects in both bimatoprost groups in this study reported greater satisfaction with the effects of treatment than did subjects in the vehicle group, subjects in the bimatoprost BID group had the highest proportion of satisfied subjects at all time points. This observation could reflect the numerically higher treatment responses on the GEBA scale and DMSIA in the bimatoprost BID group compared with the bimatoprost QD group.</p><p>In this study, bimatoprost 0.03% applied to the eyebrows once or twice daily was safe and well tolerated in this population. Overall, no new safety signals were encountered in this study compared with long-term use of bimatoprost for treatment of glaucoma and intraocular hypertension<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> or for treatment of eyelash hypotrichosis.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The most commonly reported TEAEs were similar across all treatment groups. A total of 4 subjects were discontinued from the study because of AEs, and the serious AEs that occurred in 7 subjects were considered by the investigator to be not related to study treatment. The overall incidence and severity of TEAEs reported with bimatoprost in this study is comparable with that seen in studies of bimatoprost applied to the eyelashes to treat eyelash hypotrichosis.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In those studies, TEAEs were typically mild to moderate, and the incidence of severe or serious AEs and discontinuations due to TEAEs were relatively low. The most common TEAEs reported after eyelash application were ocular, such as conjunctival hyperemia, eye pruritus, pinguecula, eye irritation, dry eye, and erythema of the eyelid. The incidence of ocular TEAEs in this study was low compared with that in the eyelash studies; this difference may be related to eyebrow application occurring further from the eyes than eyelash application. Treatment-emergent adverse events such as skin hyperpigmentation, iris hyperpigmentation, or conjunctival hyperemia, reported at a low incidence in eyelash hypotrichosis studies, were not seen in this study.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>A limitation of this study is the use of stencils. Although this was required to standardize the areas of grooming and treatment across subjects and visits, it does not mirror use in the home environment.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrate that bimatoprost 0.03% is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment for hypotrichosis of the eyebrows in this population. Improvements in eyebrow growth and subject satisfaction appeared within 1 to 2 months and were sustained throughout study treatment. The safety profile of bimatoprost in this study is in line with that shown in previous large, controlled studies of bimatoprost for treatment of eyelash hypotrichosis. Based on these results, additional studies on the use of bimatoprost for the treatment of eyebrow hypotrichosis are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by Allergan plc.
