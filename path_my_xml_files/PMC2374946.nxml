Ondansetron disintegrating tablets (ODT), an oral freeze-dried formulation of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist, are well-tolerated and have been shown to reduce chemotherapy-induced vomiting. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of the ODT in preventing postoperative vomiting (POV) in children undergoing strabismus repair. Healthy children aged 4&#x02013;12 years of age were administered a 4 mg ODT 30 minutes prior to the induction of general anesthesia. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia were standardized; each child received acetaminophen and ketorolac pre-emptively for analgesia. This study group was compared with a historical control group who received a placebo in previously conducted identical trials of POV. The 35 children included in this study were compared with 31 controls. The incidence and severity of POV and use of rescue antiemetics were significantly lower in children who received ODT compared with placebo (p &#x02264; 0.001). The acute complete response (ie, no emesis and no rescue antiemetics in 24 hours) was 76% in the ODT group compared with 16% in the controls (p &#x02264; 0.001). Results suggest that ODT given preoperatively reduces the incidence and severity of POV in children undergoing strabismus surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pediatrics</kwd><kwd>postoperative</kwd><kwd>vomiting</kwd><kwd>ondansetron</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in children varies from 5% to 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baines 1996</xref>). The etiology is complex and multifaceted, including patient-related factors, type of surgical procedure, choice of anesthetic agents, and postoperative management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Sung 1996</xref>). Children undergoing strabismus surgery are particularly prone to PONV. Postoperative vomiting (emesis) is the forceful expulsion of gastrointestinal contents through the mouth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Kovac 2000</xref>) and is mediated by a variety of neurotransmitters including serotonin which binds to serotonergic (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptors located both peripherally on the vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Borison 1989</xref>). The serotonin receptor antagonists (including ondansetron, dolasetron, granisetron, and tropisetron), purportedly block the effects of serotonin in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, nucleus tractus solitarius, and vagal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Wadibia 1999</xref>). These antiemetic agents have been shown to reduce chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, as well as PONV. Intravenous (IV) ondansetron administered in doses ranging from 40&#x02013;200 mcg/kg has been extensively studied for prevention of PONV in children undergoing strabismus surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bowhay et al 2001</xref>).</p><p>An innovative freeze-dried ondansetron oral disintegrating tablet (ODT) was developed to allow for disintegration on the tongue with dissolution and rapid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of water (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://us.gsk.com/"/>). The active ingredient in ODT is the racemic form of ondansetron, and a 4-mg ODT contains 4 mg of ondansetron base. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Davidson and colleagues (1999)</xref> have demonstrated equivalency of ODT 8 mg to oral ondansetron 8 mg in highly emetogencic chemotherapy. The pharmacokinetic data suggests that ondansetron is readily and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Roila and Del Favero 1995</xref>). In children undergoing highly emetogenic chemotherapy, ODT (4&#x02013;8 mg) showed similar efficacy for complete control of emesis compared with IV ondansetron; 93% versus 92% respectively, and was considered safe, well tolerated and cost effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Corapcioglu and Sarper 2005</xref>). In children undergoing adenotonsillectomy, a fixed dose of 4 mg ODT resulted in the number needed to treat (NNT) = 2.86 with a relative risk reduction for PONV of 50%. Additionally, the ODT was found to be acceptable in taste with 87% of patients willing to take the medication in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cohen et al 2005</xref>). The properties of ODT make it a potentially useful agent in children who cannot swallow water or pills during the perioperative period. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the efficacy of ODT in reducing the incidence and severity of POV in children undergoing outpatient strabismus surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Approval from the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB) and written informed consent from a parent or legal guardian was obtained for this prospective, observational, historically controlled study. Healthy children aged 4&#x02013;12 years of age, ASA I-II, scheduled to undergo strabismus surgery were recruited. Those with a history of cardiac, hepatic, renal or neurological impairment, prior severe PONV, known sensitivity to 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists, and requirement for premedication were excluded.</p><p>Preoperatively, each child received an oral dose of acetaminophen (15 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) followed by a 4 mg ODT 30 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia. Acceptability of the ODT was scored using a 4 point scale (1 = readily, 2 = reluctant, 3 = held down, 4 = refused). General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane via facemask. A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. Ketorolac (0.5 mg&#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was administered following placement of the IV intraoperatively. At the completion of the surgery, the stomach was aspirated via an oral-gastric tube and the LMA was removed at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Strict adherence to the protocol were maintained by research personnel who were present the entire time of the surgical procedure.</p><p>Postoperatively, children were observed for any episode of POV or retching. Two or more episodes of vomiting or retching were treated with metoclopramide 0.15 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> IV as a rescue medication. Pain was assessed using the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) observational pain scale and children with scores &#x02265;4 were treated with morphine sulfate 0.05 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> IV titrated per routine practice. Parents were telephoned the day after surgery to assess further POV, treatment and potential adverse effects. Additionally, parents rated their satisfaction with the prevention and treatment of POV as 1 = very dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = satisfied, 4 = very satisfied.</p><p>Historical placebo controls from previous studies of POV conducted at the same institution using the same identical anesthetic technique and research protocol were used for statistical comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Munro et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Wagner et al 2003</xref>). These studies were placebo controlled studies of POV in children undergoing strabismus surgery. Patients were randomized to IV dolasetron in a fixed dose and weight based dose versus IV sodium chloride or oral granisetron compounded in strawberry syrup versus strawberry syrup alone each in equivalent volumes. For the purposes of analyses, the severity of POV was classified as mild (1 episode), moderate (2 episodes), or severe (3 or more episodes). Additionally, the primary efficacy measure was an acute complete response (ACR) which was defined as no emetic episodes or rescue antiemetic medication use within 24 hours of ODT 4 mg administration. Categorical data such as ACR, and the incidence and severity of PONV were compared using chi-square with Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests as appropriate. Patient age, weight, and other parametric data were compared using unpaired t-tests. Data are reported as mean + SD or n (%) with p values of &#x0003c;0.05 considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 49 children were enrolled in the study.

Additionally, severe PONV occurs with a frequency of 1%&#x02013;3% and may result in unanticipated hospital admission leading to increased institutional costs. A recent multi-center study involving 1257 children aged birth-14 yrs old showed that strabismus surgery was an independent risk factor for postoperative vomiting. Of all risk factors it was the most significant with an OR of 5.2 similar to other reported incidences of up to 87%. Findings from this study demonstrate that prophylactic administration of ODT in a fixed dose of 4 mg reduced the incidence and severity of PONV in young children undergoing strabismus surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Eberhart et al 2004</xref>). Additionally, recent studies suggest that ODT is similarly useful for the prevention of PONV in children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cohen and colleagues (2005)</xref> compared 4 mg ODT versus placebo in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy. Although patients also received intraoperative dexamethasone, the ODT group experienced significantly less vomiting and the ODT was readily accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cohen et al 2005</xref>). In adult patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gan and colleagues (2002)</xref> evaluated the ODT in patients undergoing outpatient gynecological laparoscopy with general anesthesia. Patients received 4 mg of IV ondansetron at induction and either 8 mg ODT or placebo prior to discharge. The ODT group experienced less severe nausea and fewer episodes of vomiting after discharge from PACU compared with the placebo group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gan et al 2002</xref>). A study in craniotomy surgery patients also evaluated the postoperative administration of the ODT in an 8 mg dose compared with placebo as rescue therapy for PONV. Patients who received the ODT required less rescue therapy with metoclopramide than did the placebo group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hartsell et al 2005</xref>). It appears that the ODT formulation may be efficacious for both the prevention and treatment of PONV in adults and possibly children.</p><p>The antiemetic efficacy of ODT has also been demonstrated previously for both radio-therapy, and chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Davidson et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">LeBourgeois et al 1999</xref>). A study in patients receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy compared 8 mg of oral ondansetron (OT) to 8 mg of ODT given twice daily for 3 days. The ODT was found to be equivalent to the OT for control of emesis with 89% of patients finding the taste acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Davidson et al 1999</xref>).</p><p>Although there remains an ongoing debate over the appropriate timing of administration of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Madan and colleagues (2000)</xref> found no difference in efficacy between groups of children who received 0.1 mg/kg ondansetron IV at induction versus the end of strabismus surgery. It appears that in pediatric strabismus surgery, the time of administration of ondansetron is not related to efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Madan et al 2000</xref>). Data suggest that ondansetron is completely and readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Roila and Del Favero 1995</xref>). The time to reach peak concentration is between 0.5 to 2 hours with an approximate 160 liter volume of distribution and 70 to 76% plasma protein binding. The elimination half-life averages approximately 3.8 &#x000b1; 1 hour and is extensively metabolized primarily through hydroxylation with subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation.</p><p>Many factors contribute to POV that were not controlled for such as the use of reversal agents, hydration status, etc. Ideally, alternative methods of anesthesia and analgesia could potentially lower the emetogenic potential in this population or the addition of other antiemetics such as dexamethasone in combination with the ODT. Ondansetron and dolasetron demonstrated comparative efficacy when used in combination with dexamethasone for POV prophylaxis in children undergoing tonsillectomy surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Sukhani et al 2002</xref>). Studies have also shown that the combination of metoclopramide with ondansetron was no more effective than ondansetron alone in children undergoing strabismus surgery. Hence the addition of metoclopramide in a prophylaxis regimen for PONV is probably not warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Kathirvel et al 1999</xref>). The ODT offers a unique, cost effective, formulation of a 5HT3 agent that is readily acceptable and safe in the pediatric surgical population. Additionally, while PONV is unpleasant for the child, it can also be disturbing to the parents and actually increase their time spent nursing the child in PACU.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>One important limitation of this study is the use of historical controls. It was felt that the use of a placebo control &#x02013; in the case of children undergoing a known highly emetogenic surgery &#x02013; was unethical given the known risks. Additionally data obtained from previous studies within the same institution provided a fairly equal distribution of matched controls that could be used for comparison. Although faculty and staff performing the surgeries had changed, the use of research personnel to ensure compliance with the identical protocols was critical.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ODT is a readily acceptable form of a 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist that can be safely used in children undergoing strabismus surgery for the prevention of POV. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate its utility in other types of pediatric surgeries with high incidences of POV and also its effectiveness as a rescue agent in the PACU.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a grant from GlaxoSmithKline Inc.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baines</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postoperative nausea and vomiting in children</article-title><source>Paediatr Anaesth</source><year>1996</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>7</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8839082</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Borison</surname><given-names>HL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Area postrema: chemoreceptor circumventricular organ of the medulla oblongatA</article-title><source>Prog Neurobiol</source><year>1989</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>351</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2660187</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bowhay</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>May</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Rudnicka</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A randomized controlled trial of the antiemetic effect of three doses of ondansetron after strabismus surgery in children</article-title><source>Paediatr Anaesth</source><year>2001</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>215</fpage><lpage>21</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11240881</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>IT</given-names></name><name><surname>Joffe</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Hummer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Ondansetron oral disintegrating tablets: acceptability and efficacy in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2005</year><volume>101</volume><fpage>59</fpage><lpage>63</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15976206</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Corapcioglu</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Sarper</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A prospective randomized trial of the antiemetic efficacy and cost-effectivenes of intravenous and orally disintegrating tablet of ondansetron in children with cancer</article-title><source>Pediatr Hematol Oncol</source><year>2005</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>103</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15804995</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b6"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Rapoport</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Erikstein</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Comparison of an orallly disintegrating ondansetron tablet with the conventional ondansetron tablet for cyclophosphamide-induced emesis in cancer patients: a multicenter, double-masked study.
