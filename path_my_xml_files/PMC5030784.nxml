This randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare change in body mass index (BMI) <italic>z</italic> score after 6 months. Children 8 to 16 years with a BMI greater than the 85th percentile were randomized to standard of care nutrition counseling versus intervention with standard nutrition counseling including portion control tool training for the family. Measures were completed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Fifty-one children were randomized to control and 48 to intervention. Mean age was 11 years (SD = 2.2). Mean BMI <italic>z</italic> score was 2.7 (SD = 0.4). Forty-five percent were male (n = 45). Follow-up at 6 months was 73.7% (73/99). Although no differences were seen between the groups, there was a significant decrease in BMI <italic>z</italic> score between baseline and 6 months within each group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pediatric</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>management</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd><kwd>portion size</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2333794X16669014"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity has become an increasing public health problem.

A computer-based random number sequence generator was used to create the random allocation. Sequentially numbered sealed envelopes were used to conceal the sequence until participants were assigned. The random allocation sequence was generated by a research assistant, while enrollment and assignment of participants to groups was done by the research coordinator. Participants and care givers were not blinded to the intervention since they were instructed on use of the portion control tools.</p><p>Both groups received a 1-hour session of standard nutrition counseling from a registered dietitian regarding healthy eating habits, appropriate portion sizes, and based on the Canada Food Guide. The intervention group received an additional 10 to 15 minutes counseling on how to use a calibrated dinner plate and breakfast cereal bowl for the child and adults in the family as a means of dietary portion control.</p><p>The portion control tool used was a commercially available dinner plate and breakfast bowl that has been previously described.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333794X16669014" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> A child plate and adult male and female plates were available.

Blood pressure was measured with a calibrated, automated machine and using the average of 2 measurements (Dinamap V100, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). Fasting lipids, glucose, and alanine aminotransferase were analyzed using the Roche Cobas 6000 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and insulin was analyzed using the Abbott Architect (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL).

This sample size assumes a standard deviation in the BMI <italic>z</italic> score of 2.5. Given an anticipated dropout rate of 20% and an anticipated rate of 5% of families that would include siblings where only one could be analyzed to preserve sample independence, the enrollment target was set at 116 patients (58 in each arm). Over a 4-year period, a total of 99 participants were enrolled. Recruitment was discontinued when a dedicated pediatric weight management clinic became available at the Alberta Children&#x02019;s Hospital as an option for families.</p><p>Data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat (with last observation carried forward for missing data) and per-protocol analysis (&#x02265;80% compliance with recommendations as measured by self-report from monthly research coordinator phone calls).

Although no differences were seen between the groups, each group did have a significant decrease in BMI <italic>z</italic> score between baseline and 6 months, which indicates that the nutritional counseling in addition to the regular follow-up in the study resulted in weight loss for the children. In this group of obese/overweight children, the use of portion control tool failed to replicate the finding in an adult study, which found that this portion control tool was more effective for weight reduction in those with type 2 diabetes and obesity and that the portion control tool also enabled patients with type 2 diabetes to decrease their hypoglycemic medications.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333794X16669014" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The differences in findings between these 2 studies could be due to the participants involved. For example, there are differences in food consumption behavior between children and adults. Children often have little control over the food that is available to them in the home, how food is prepared, and when meal times are offered. In order to address the family impact in this study, parents were also given adult-specific portion control plates in the intervention group and were counseled on healthy eating habits for the entire family. However, the role of the family in the eating habits of the child may have influenced levels of adherence to the protocol when compared to the adult study.</p><p>A limitation of this study was the short duration of 6 months. The adult study was also 6 months in duration.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333794X16669014" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This may have limited the ability to see long-term changes in BMI <italic>z</italic> score in this population. Since the study participants were recruited from clinics at the Alberta Children&#x02019;s Hospital, community physician offices, pharmacies, and health clinics, the population may have been biased toward children that would be seeking medical attention. Compliance with using the portion control tool was not optimal and this may also have limited the effect on change in BMI <italic>z</italic> score in children, although the compliance was similar to the previous study by Pedersen et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333794X16669014" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> which did show differences. The frequency of in-person contact in this study was also a limitation. Phone calls were conducted monthly to assess compliance, but regular monthly office visits may have improved compliance and effect of the intervention. Adherence was not specifically collected for the child and the parent since the phone calls were made to the parent and they were asked to comment on the overall family adherence. In addition, parental anthropometric measures were not captured in this study; it would have been interesting to note these characteristics, whether parents experienced weight loss during the trial period, and whether changes in parental BMI was associated with changes in their child&#x02019;s BMI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section15-2333794X16669014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In our study, addition of a portion control tool to standard nutritional counseling did not result in a significant change in BMI <italic>z</italic> score after 6 months compared to standard nutrition counseling.
