and whole-body vibration exercises on bone density in elderly female nursing home
residents who had difficulty exercising outdoors and had not consumed milk. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty seven elderly women aged 70 or older from 3 nursing homes located in
Incheon, Korea participated in the study. The experimental group (n=13) carried out
whole-body vibration exercises and drank lactose-free milk, while the control group (n=14)
continued to live their ordinary nursing home lives. Weight, BMI, T-scores, and Z-scores
were compared between the experimental and control groups after 12 weeks. [Results] The
comparison of changes in weight and BMI in the control group before and after the 12-week
experiment found no statistically significant differences. However, bone mineral density
was significantly different, with the T-score significantly decreasing from &#x02212;2.99 to &#x02212;3.48
and the Z-score decreasing from &#x02212;1.87 to &#x02212;2.58. The other comparisons of physical changes
in the control group before and after the 12-week experiment found no statistical
significance. [Conclusion] The results indicate that regular consumption of lactose-free
milk and performing whole-body vibration exercises can delay the progression of bone
density loss in older adults in nursing homes; adequate exercise and calcium intake could
eventually help prevent fractures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lactose-free milk</kwd><kwd>Bone density</kwd><kwd>Whole-body vibration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Developments in medical technology and the improvement of economic conditions have resulted
in increased life expectancy around the world, with the percentage of people aged 65 or
older also increasing in every country<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Such changes&#x02015;the rise in the relative size of the elderly population, the improvement in
income levels, living conditions, and medical technology&#x02015;have led to an increased interest
in osteoporosis, one of the leading conditions affecting elderly women. Osteoporosis is a
condition involving low bone mass and weak bone structure that makes bones more likely to
break, which decreases quality of life and increases mortality among elderly women. In this
context, osteoporosis has become one of the main healthcare issues faced by an ageing
population<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Aging causes the gradual loss of such bone tissues, and increases the risk of
fractures<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The risk of fractures is
higher in women than in men, as 13% men aged 50 or older are likely to break bones, but 40%
of women in the same age bracket are at risk of fractures<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies have found that bone mineral density (BMD) is correlated with calcium intake
levels<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, but calcium deficiency is actually caused when there is an increase
in the amount of serum calcium, such as through intestinal calcium absorption, and there are
insufficient levels of osteolysis for bone regeneration or compensation for a loss of
calcium. Therefore, calcium absorption and excretion amounts as well as the amount of
calcium intake are considered to be important because each of them can cause bone loss.
Likewise, it cannot be stated that calcium intake is the sole factor that is correlated with
bone mineral density. However, to prevent further bone loss, regular calcium intake is
required<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There have been a number of studies that have demonstrated that calcium intake delays bone
loss, therefore preventing osteoporosis. However, many elderly Koreans are reluctant to
consume milk, as some of them have lactose intolerance, while others are not accustomed to
drinking milk<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another way to treat
osteoporosis among elderly citizens is to alter their lifestyle so that there will be a
decrease in the reduction of bone mass, such as through an increase in exercise. At present,
it is unclear how effective exercise is in improving bone health, but exercise is known to
stimulate bone loading, build muscles, provide the skeleton with mechanical stress, and
promote osteoblast activity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study was conducted to examine the effects of lactose-free milk intake and
whole-body vibration exercises on bone density in elderly female nursing home residents who
had difficulty exercising outdoors and did not regularly consumed milk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects in the study were thirty elderly women aged 70 or older living in 3 nursing
homes located in Incheon, Korea. The subjects were explained and agreed on the research
ethics and signed a written consent form approved by the local ethics committee. The
experimental group carried out whole-body vibration exercises and drank milk, while the
control group continued to live their ordinary lives in their nursing homes.</p><p>Lactose-free milk (Maeil Co., Ltd.) was given to all subjects in the experimental group in
case any were lactose intolerant. The subjects in the experimental group consumed 190&#x02005;ml of
milk (400&#x02005;mg of calcium) per day and carried out in a standing position on a whole-body
vibration exercises using a whole-body vibrator (Model 1310, Egojin Co., Gyeonggi-do, South
Korea) that generated vibration at a speed of up to 3,200&#x02005;rpm for 5 minute. To prevent any
accidents while exercising, the subjects used walking aids and were accompanied by
researchers at all times. The experiment lasted for 12 weeks, and, of the 30 subjects who
started the experiment, 3 subjects were discharged from their nursing homes during the
experiment period or failed to continuously consume milk and were excluded from the study.
Therefore, the data of 27 subjects (14 in the control group; 13 in the experimental group)
were used.</p><p>First, each participant&#x02019;s height was measured. Then, their weight and body mass index (BMI)
were measured with the InBody H20B (InBody Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea). To assess BMD,
both T-scores and Z-scores were measured with the SONOST 3000 (OsteoSys, Seoul, South
Korea), which uses quantitative ultrasound. To minimize the influence of measured values,
correction was conducted using a QC phantom before each measurement, and each BMD
measurement was made at the patient&#x02019;s right calcaneus. All statistical analyses were
performed with SPSS (version 21.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For a non-parametric test to
compare the differences between two independent groups (control and experimental) before the
experiment, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. For comparisons of the two groups before and
after milk intake and whole-body vibration exercises, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used. The significance level was set at 0.05 or less.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of participants (N=27)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SD</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85.79</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.09</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.828</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85.08</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.72</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">148.21</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.87</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.174</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">144.50</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.65</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.08</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.44</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.801</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.73</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">BMI </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.89</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.446</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.67</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.28</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">T-score</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2.99</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.63</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.556</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;3.12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.56</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Z-score</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;1.87</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.94</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.502</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2.11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.86</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap> shows the age, height, weight, BMI, T-scores, and Z-scores measured before the

Korea introduced long-term care insurance for the elderly in 2008. With the number of
elderly nursing home residents also going up, maintaining their health is quickly becoming a
major healthcare issue<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nursing home
residents are generally at advanced ages, and more than 50% of them suffer from chronic
diseases including hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis. The living conditions of nursing
homes tend to cause them to engage in fewer physical activities, meaning their physical
strength weakens and their osteoporosis worsens. For these reasons, elderly people in
nursing homes can be classified as those at a high risk of experiencing injuries from a
fall<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falls in the elderly result in fractures, and low bone density
increases the risk of fractures<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, the continuous management of osteoporosis for the elderly in nursing homes is
necessary<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study tracked
changes in BMI and BMD in an experimental group (elderly women in nursing homes who consumed
milk and performed indoor whole-body vibration exercises) and a control group (elderly women
in the same facilities who followed ordinary daily nursing home programs).</p><p>In a study by Kim et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, elderly women
who were provided with milk for 4 months showed significantly higher BMD than elderly women
who were provided with no milk. In the present study, both the experimental group and the
control group saw their T-score and Z-score decrease after the 12-week experiment in which
the experimental group drank milk and performed whole-body vibration exercises. The BMD
values of the control group decreased significantly, but the decrease in the BMD of the
experiment group was not statistically significant. The findings of the present study, which
examined elderly female nursing home residents who experienced less physical activity than
non-elderly women, are consistent with the previous study that demonstrated the effect of
milk intake on changes in BMD.</p><p>According to a study by Gil et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>,
outdoor exercise has more positive effects on the increase in bone density than indoor
exercise, as exposure to the sun helps skin cells create vitamin D. The subjects of the
present study were nursing home residents aged 70 or older, however, so they underwent
whole-body vibration exercises indoors. The drop in the BMD in the experimental group, which
performed whole-body vibration exercises, was significantly minor compared to the control
group.</p><p>Both the experimental group and the control group showed no significant changes in weight
and BMI after the 12-week-long experiment. However, the experimental group increased an
average of 1.36&#x02005;kg and the control group lost 0.04&#x02005;kg, indicating that the consumption of
milk, a source of protein and calcium, delays age-driven weight loss. This is consistent
with the findings of other studies that have demonstrated correlations between weight/BMI
and BMD<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The limitations of the present study are that only one region&#x02019;s nursing facilities were
used, and the number of subjects in the experimental and control groups was small because
only those who had no problem performing their daily activities could participate.
Furthermore, among multiple variables that may affect bone density, only calcium intake from
milk and full-body exercise were analyzed. In addition, bone density was measured through
quantitative ultrasonography; although this method is relatively simple compared to
quantitative computed tomography or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), the results are
controversial, with some studies supporting their significance<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and others
arguing that the results may be insignificant, depending on gender and age<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, additional studies using DEXA are needed to ensure accuracy
of the experiment. However, considering the growing elderly population and increased use of
nursing homes, the findings of this study are expected to provide comprehensive guidance for
measures to delay the progression of bone density loss among older adults in nursing
homes.</p><p>The present study investigated the effects of milk intake and whole-body vibration
exercises on the BMD and BMI in female nursing home residents aged 70 or older. The group
that drank milk and performed whole-body vibration exercised was not significantly different
from the control group considering body weight and BMI (p<italic>&#x0003e;</italic>0.05).
However, bone density (T-score and Z-score) remained unchanged in the experimental group,
but significantly decreased in the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>In conclusion, the continuous consumption of lactose-free milk and performing whole-body
vibration exercises can delay the progression of bone density loss in older adults in
nursing homes; adequate exercise and calcium intake could eventually help prevent
