Yet, the transfer of procedural skills acquired in skills laboratories into clinical practice has rarely been investigated. We conducted a prospective, randomised, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate, if students having trained intravenous (IV) cannulation in a skills laboratory are rated as more professional regarding technical and communication skills compared to students who underwent bedside teaching when assessed objectively by independent video assessors and subjectively by patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology and Principal Findings</title><p>84 volunteer first-year medical students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Three drop-outs occurred. The intervention group (IG; <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;41) trained IV cannulation in a skills laboratory receiving instruction after Peyton's &#x02018;Four-Step Approach&#x02019;. The control group (CG; <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40) received a bedside teaching session with volunteer students acting as patients. Afterwards, performance of IV cannulation of both groups in a clinical setting with students acting as patients was video-recorded. Two independent, blinded video assessors scored students' performance using binary checklists (BC) and the Integrated Procedural Protocol Instrument (IPPI). Patients assessed students' performance with the Communication Assessment Tool (CAT) and a modified IPPI. IG required significantly shorter time needed for the performance on a patient (IG: 595.4 SD(188.1)s; CG: 692.7 SD(247.8)s; 95&#x00025;CI 23.5 s to 45.1 s; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.049) and completed significantly more single steps of the procedure correctly (IG: 64&#x00025; SD(14) for BC items; CG: 53&#x00025; SD(18); 95&#x00025;CI 10.25&#x00025; to 11.75&#x00025;; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004). IG also scored significantly better on IPPI ratings (median: IG: 3.1; CG: 3.6; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.015;). Rated by patients, students' performance and patient-physician communication did not significantly differ between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Transfer of IV cannulation-related skills acquired in a skills laboratory is superior to bedside teaching when rated by independent video raters by means of IPPI and BC.

Traditionally, the triad of knowledge, skills and attitudes <xref rid="pone.0032831-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> required for medical practice has been imparted in the course of bedside teachings in a hospital ward <xref rid="pone.0032831-Cooke1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Providing an opportunity for the demonstration of clinical procedures through teachers as well as their observation and ultimately independent performance by students, ward-based teaching and medical clerking essentially draws upon the instructional principle of &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0032831-Dent1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite the fact that bedside teaching has always been deemed an indispensable and valuable method of teaching <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kroenke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, its role is declining in medical schools <xref rid="pone.0032831-LaCombe1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Technological, economic and regulatory changes have led to a considerable reduction in bedside teaching opportunities for medical students and young doctors <xref rid="pone.0032831-Issenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Practising on real patients is a problematic ethical issue, particularly where it involves the training of invasive procedures <xref rid="pone.0032831-Ziv1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition, the quality of ward-based training is often impaired by lack of supervision through physicians and frequent assignment of students to routine activities of limited educational value <xref rid="pone.0032831-vanderHemStokroos1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Schrauth1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Basic clinical skills acquisition on wards occurs in a rather &#x0201c;haphazard&#x0201d; fashion and frequencies of performance of such skills differ widely among students <xref rid="pone.0032831-vanderHemStokroos1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Two recent studies <xref rid="pone.0032831-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> showed that up to a quarter of American third-year medical students and up to a fifth of American medical fourth-year students never had performed basic clinical skills such as phlebotomy, arterial blood sampling and peripheral IV catheter insertion. Yet, mastering these procedures is considered to be essential for medical students <xref rid="pone.0032831-Elnicki1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In order to bridge the gap between expectations and actual learning experiences on the wards, structured and &#x0201c;proficiency-based&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0032831-Aggarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> teaching interventions, such as skills training sessions in simulators, have been increasingly integrated into medical curricula over the past decades <xref rid="pone.0032831-Issenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Ziv2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Today, skills laboratories have taken on a central role in the training of procedural skills such as IV cannulation, urethral catheter insertion or physical examination.

It can be structured and standardized employing different instructional approaches such as Rodney Peyton's &#x0201c;Four-Step Approach&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0032831-Peyton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Krautter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> or &#x0201c;Mental Training&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0032831-Immenroth1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. At the end of each session, students are provided with educational feedback, an inherent feature of simulation based medical education (SBME) <xref rid="pone.0032831-Issenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-McGaghie1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, enabling them to reflect on their performances. In skills laboratories medical students commonly train clinical procedures among each other <xref rid="pone.0032831-Nikendei1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, together with Standardised Patients (SPs) <xref rid="pone.0032831-Barrows1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> or by using manikins or (part)-task-trainer models <xref rid="pone.0032831-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The effectiveness of medical skills laboratories has been demonstrated by several works and is widely recognized. In a systematic review, Lynagh et al. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Lynagh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> concluded that skills laboratory training enhances procedural skills performance compared to standard or no training when assessed by simulator performance. On undergraduate educational level, skills laboratory training leads to better results in written skills tests <xref rid="pone.0032831-Remmen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and to improved performance of basic clinical skills in OSCEs <xref rid="pone.0032831-Bradley2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Jnger1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This effect can be demonstrated regardless of whether the preceding skills laboratory training is lead by faculty staff or by trained medical students that serve as peer teachers <xref rid="pone.0032831-Weyrich1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Weyrich2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Yet, the transfer of procedural skills acquired in skills laboratories to actual clinical practice remains the subject of an ongoing discussion. Remmen et al. assumed that skills training provides a better preparation for clinical clerkships <xref rid="pone.0032831-Remmen2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and leads to an increase in the number of clinical procedures performed on ward <xref rid="pone.0032831-Remmen3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Neither of the studies, however, assessed the actual quality of skills performed on patients. Frequently, a pressing need for well-designed studies to further investigate this topic of &#x0201c;translational research&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0032831-McGaghie2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> has been enunciated <xref rid="pone.0032831-McGaghie1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Lynagh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Lynagh et al. reported that only 20 out of 44 studies, that were included in their review, respond to the question, if improvements in performance on medical simulators in fact translate to improved clinical performance. Eight of these 20 studies, however, used animal models to demonstrate the transfer. The remaining twelve studies that assessed the transfer of simulator performance to clinical performance on real patients, focused on postgraduate training of either endoscopic or laparoscopic surgery skills only, with many of them being weakened by methodological flaws such as small sample size or failure to report on the method of randomisation or blinding technique.</p><p>Up till today, there is an apparent lack of evidence of the transfer of skills laboratory training of procedural skills on undergraduate medical educational level. We therefore conducted a prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind trial to answer the question: Are students having received a training of intravenous (IV) cannulation in a skills laboratory setting perceived and rated as more professional regarding technical and communication skills compared to students who underwent bedside teaching when assessed 1) objectively by independent video assessors and 2) subjectively by patients?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial to investigate the transfer of skills laboratory training of procedural skills at undergraduate medical education level (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032831.s001">Checklist S1</xref>).

Recruitment of participants took place among first year medical students within their first week of term. All first-year medical students enrolled at Heidelberg University in the winter term of 2009, aged 18 to 30 years, who agreed to participate were included into the study prior to the randomization procedure. Criteria for exclusion from the study were previous training as a paramedic or nurse and previous experience in performing technical procedures such as taking blood samples, IV cannulation or intramuscular injections. Information about these exclusion criteria was obtained by means of a questionnaire, which was handed out to the students within the first week of term.</p><p>Additionally, group characteristics (baseline data) such as age (years), sex (female/male), previous education in a healthcare related or medical profession other than paramedic or nurse (i.e. physiotherapy, dental assistant, etc.), completed nursing electives and civil service (i. e. &#x0201c;compulsory paid community service&#x0201d;, which represented an alternative to military service in Germany until suspension of conscription in 2011) were obtained by means of a questionnaire.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Patient sample</title><p>With regard to the reduced availability of patients on the wards and the fact, that IV cannulation of a patient constitutes an invasive clinical procedure, which always requires an indication, volunteer students acting as patients were recruited for this study. This decision was also made to ensure the practicability of the planned study. Accordingly, 84 volunteer students were recruited among second- and third-year students.</p><p>Criteria for exclusion from participation in the study were intake of coagulation-inhibiting medication and/or regular intake of steroids, known existence of a chronic infection such as hepatitis B, C or HIV or state of acute illness. Volunteer students were allowed to refuse disclosure of personal details regarding the above mentioned chronic infections. In this case, however, a participation in the trial was no longer possible. Volunteer students, who were regular smokers, who suffered from coagulopathies and/or diabetes, and/or had received organ transplantation were also excluded from the study. All criteria were applied in order to minimize risks of potential harm for both, students and volunteer students acting as patients. All volunteer students were blinded to the study design and the participants' allocation to the intervention or control group. In addition, 14 fifth-year volunteer students were recruited to act as patients in the bedside teaching sessions of the CG. These 14 fifth-year volunteer students were used for demonstration purposes by the physician only. All 95 volunteer students, who acted as patients in the study received a written role-play instruction as well as detailed written information on the purpose of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Acquisition of data</title><p>The trial was conducted over a three-week period at the beginning of term at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.

Additionally, IV catheter insertion-related ratings of self-efficacy were obtained.</p><p>The Kolb Learning Style Inventory was used to investigate the different learning styles among students. It is built upon the theory of experiential learning <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kolb1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and is designed to define an individual's specific learning preference. Kolb <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kolb2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> assumed that the process of grasping new information and experience was based on two dialectally related modes: Concrete Experience (CE) - Abstract Conceptualization (AC), and Reflective Observation (RO) - Active Experimentation (AE). The LSI consists of 12 items that ask respondents to rank four sentence endings that refer to the four above mentioned different learning modes. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kolb2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> Ranking is done on a four-point Likert scale (4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0201c;most like me&#x0201d; to 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0201c;least like me&#x0201d;).</p><p>The Jefferson Scale of Empathy <xref rid="pone.0032831-Hojat1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> assesses empathy among physicians, medical students and health professionals as a multidimensional concept. Since the assessment of students' IV cannulation skills after the intervention included ratings of their empathy towards the patient during the procedure, the Jefferson Scale was used to assess these empathy skills pre-interventionally within the student sample. The scale consists of 20 items that are answered on a seven-point Likert scale. Ten of these items with positive factor structure coefficients are directly scored on a scale ranging from 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; to 7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;. An example of a directly scored item is: &#x0201c;A physician who is able to view things from another person's perspective can render better care.&#x0201d; The other ten items have large negative factor structure coefficients and are reverse scored on a scale ranging from 7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; to 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;. An example of a reverse-scored item is &#x02018;Emotion has no place in the treatment of medical illness.&#x02019; A higher score on the scale indicates greater empathy. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Hojat1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>
</p><p>The General Self-Efficacy Scale was designed to assess perceived self-efficacy in the event of adversity and stressful life events <xref rid="pone.0032831-Schwarzer1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.

The GSE was used to investigate the students' self-efficacy and motivation prior to the intervention.</p><p>IV catheter insertion-related ratings of self-efficacy were obtained from all students before the teaching sessions by means of a questionnaire that contained five statements on the topic of IV catheter insertion, e.g. &#x0201c;I am able to insert an IV catheter on a patient&#x0201d;. These statements were rated on a six-point Likert scale (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;I completely agree to 6&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;I completely disagree).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Skills laboratory training</title><p>The intervention group (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;41) trained IV cannulation in a skills laboratory receiving instruction according to Rodney Peyton's &#x02018;Four-Step Approach&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0032831-Peyton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Krautter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

The part-task-trainer model allows for the puncture of multiple veins, e.g. the cephalic vein, the basilic vein and the median cubital vein.

Lessons were held for groups of three students with a physician &#x02236; student ratio of 1 &#x02236; 3. The experienced ward physicians demonstrated insertion of a peripheral IV line on students, who volunteered as patients. The physicians were supposed to act as role models for the correct technical execution of the procedure, for the patient-physician communication and for the adequate care of the patient's needs. Students were asked to watch the demonstration attentively. Ward physicians as well as students were dressed in white coats during the teaching session. No flip-charts, black boards or computers were used to visualise the contents of teaching.

All participants had a maximum of three attempts of IV cannulation. The total amount of time needed for a finally successful cannulation was recorded.

For this purpose students' technical and communication skills were assessed objectively by independent video assessors and subjectively by patients by means of binary checklists and global rating forms. Prior to the intervention, students were carefully selected according to predefined criteria of in- and exclusion. No significant differences in relevant socio-demographic variables were detected between the two study groups. Students who had received training of IV cannulation in a skills laboratory setting, scored significantly better in binary checklist ratings and on global IPPI ratings <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kneebone1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Practising IV cannulation in a skills laboratory setting also resulted in a significantly shorter time needed for the performance on a patient and students of the intervention group demonstrated significantly more successful attempts of IV catheter insertion. Rated by patients, students' procedural performance and patient-physician communication did not significantly differ between the two study groups.</p><p>The superior results of binary checklist ratings <xref rid="pone.0032831-Regehr1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and IPPI global rating forms <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kneebone1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> indicate, that students, who had trained IV cannulation in a skills laboratory not only performed significantly more single-steps of the procedure correctly, but also were perceived as more professional in terms of technical and communication skills compared to students of the control group. The detected effect size for IPPI ratings <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kneebone1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> was small to medium.</p><p>The differences in checklists and global rating forms between the intervention group and the control group seem to indicate a directly observable difference in the students' clinical performance particularly when regarding the results of the clinical overall rating, which are reflected in the last item of the IPPI <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kneebone1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> &#x0201c;Overall ability to perform the procedure (including technical and professional skills)&#x0201d;: Decisively more students, who were trained in a skills laboratory setting, were rated as being clinically &#x0201c;borderline&#x0201d; compared to the bedside teaching group, whereas &#x0201c;incompetent&#x0201d; students were by far less frequent. These clinical ratings validate the observed effects in this study.</p><p>Up till today, only few studies have dealt with the transfer of procedural skills acquired in medical skills laboratories. These studies primarily refer to the performance of endoscopic or laparoscopic surgery skills compared to standard or no training. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Lynagh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> In a comparative meta-analysis McGaghie et al. <xref rid="pone.0032831-McGaghie3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> showed only recently that SBME with &#x0201c;deliberate practice&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0032831-Ericsson2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> is superior to traditional clinical medical education in the acquisition of laparoscopic surgery skills, advanced cardiac life support, cardiac auscultation skills, hemodialysis catheter and central venous catheter insertion skills and thoracentesis skills. In our study, we demonstrated that even basic procedural skills such as IV cannulation can be successfully transferred from a simulated setting into clinical practice. Referring to this, our results show that training IV cannulation in a skills laboratory enhances the quality of the procedure performed on a patient and simultaneously leads to a decrease in the amount of time needed for the procedure in comparison to bedside teaching.</p><p>In a BEME systematic review, Issenberg et al. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Issenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> outlined simulator validity and feedback as key features of medical simulations, &#x0201c;that lead to most effective learning&#x0201d;. These features may also have contributed to the observed results in our study. In this study, validity of the skills laboratory training was improved by means of role-play. Role-playing enhances the realism of technical skills training and leads to better patient-physician communication during the sessions as demonstrated by Nikendei et al. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Nikendei2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> for doppler-sonography and gastric tube insertions training sessions. Regarding feedback, it is little surprising that the students, who had trained IV cannulation in the skills laboratory, stated that they benefited significantly more from the feedback given by the skills laboratory teachers compared to the control group. Since the students of the control group did not perform IV cannulation on their own before their first attempt on a patient, they did not receive specific feedback about their own performance. The importance of feedback for effective learning was demonstrated by Ericsson et al. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Ericsson3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and emphasized by Issenberg et al. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Issenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and McGaghie et al. <xref rid="pone.0032831-McGaghie1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> for the concept of SBME.</p><p>Furthermore, the method of instruction seems to play an important role in the course of effective learning <xref rid="pone.0032831-Krautter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The fact that the intervention group required significantly shorter time for a superior performance of IV cannulation on a patient, implicates, that the intervention group was able to recapitulate the procedure's single steps faster and more accurately. This corresponds with the students' statement after the skills laboratory teaching sessions, who said that they felt significantly more capable to memorize the learning contents in particular compared to the control group. This effect might be explained by the known advantage of Peyton's &#x0201c;Four-Step Approach&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0032831-Peyton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> compared to a standard instruction, which has only recently been demonstrated by Krautter et al. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Krautter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In this study, students who had undergone skills laboratory training of gastric tube insertion according to the &#x0201c;Four-Step Approach&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0032831-Peyton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, scored significantly better on IPPI ratings <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kneebone1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and global communication rating scales than students who had received skills laboratory training with a standard instruction method. When asked to perform gastric tube insertion self-dependently on a manikin, the intervention group needed, comparable to our study, significantly less time for the performance. The authors attributed this effect in particular to the third step of Peyton's &#x0201c;Four-Step Approach&#x0201d;, which is thought to facilitate memory consolidation through the concept of &#x0201c;motor imagery&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0032831-Gentili1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Contrary to our study, however, the transfer of gastric tube insertion into clinical practice was not investigated by Krautter et al. <xref rid="pone.0032831-Krautter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Our results are validated by reliability measures of binary checklist ratings and global rating forms obtained in the objective video rating. Both instruments showed a high to very high inter-rater-reliability. In line with the literature, inter-rater reliability was higher for binary checklist ratings than for global IPPI ratings <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kneebone1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This confirms that checklists allow for a more standardized and more reliable evaluation of the technical performance of a student <xref rid="pone.0032831-Newble1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, whereas global ratings constitute a more summative measure <xref rid="pone.0032831-Regehr1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Global rating scales are superior in measuring higher levels of clinical competence, expertise and professionalism <xref rid="pone.0032831-Regehr1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Hodges1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, students' procedural performance and patient-physician communication did not significantly differ between the two study groups when rated by students acting as patients. This effect might be explained by the fact that &#x02013; contrary to the video raters &#x02013; our &#x0201c;patients&#x0201d; were neither specifically trained, nor were they experienced raters. More importantly though, since each student who acted as a patient encountered only one student during the study, the &#x0201c;patients&#x0201d; were unable to compare their personal experience of having an IV cannula inserted into their veins with the performance of other students. Additionally, based on their personal experience with IV cannulation as medical students, the students acting as patients may have rated the students' performance more benevolently than real patients: It might have reminded them of their own struggles and fears when they had to insert an IV line into a patient's arm for the first time.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations of this study should be mentioned. This study assessed the effectiveness of IV cannulation skills training and its transfer into clinical practice only. We assume that our results can be applied to technically related techniques which require venipuncture, such as taking blood samples or blood cultures. The generalisability of the results with regard to less related techniques should be evaluated by future studies.</p><p>All 84 students, who took part in the study, were volunteers. As such they might have had a different disposition, for example in terms of motivation or enthusiasm towards certain training models than compared to the population at large.</p><p>Since the control group was not allowed to practise IV cannulation prior to the first self-dependent procedure on a patient, the superior results of the intervention group seem unsurprising. This methodological approach, however, is consistent with the clinical reality of &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d;. In order to ensure that every student received the same amount of attention from the teacher, we arranged for the duration of the teaching session and the teacher : student ratio to be the same in both study groups.</p><p>Due to the post-test design of this study, no conclusion can be made as to the participants' performance of IV cannulation before the intervention. In light of the study's exclusion criteria, the participants' minimal medical knowledge and low pre-interventional self-efficacy, it can be assumed, that the students' abilities to perform IV cannulation were equally limited. A pre-post-test design would not have been suitable due to ethical reasons with uninstructed students performing IV cannulation on patients. In addition, a pre-interventional capture of the students' IV cannulation performance would already have been a training of this skill.</p><p>After two unsuccessful attempts, students had to perform the third try on a part-task-trainer model due to ethical aspects. Our video raters, however, assessed students' performance globally as an overall rating of all attempts needed.</p><p>In this study, third-year medical students acted as patients, who, based on their own experience with IV cannulation, may have rated students' performance differently compared to real patients.</p><p>Students, as well as volunteer students acting as patients were aware of being videotaped, which might have influenced their behaviour to some degree. Due to limited camera angles and low definition, raters encountered difficulties in identifying some of the details of the 25 items listed on the binary checklist. However, we consider this problem to be negligible, since the amount of identifiable items was equally high for both raters.</p><p>Due to the lack of validated German versions of the IPPI <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kneebone1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and the CAT <xref rid="pone.0032831-Makoul1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, we used self-translated versions of the instruments. German translations of the IPPI <xref rid="pone.0032831-Kneebone1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, however, have been used in several internationally published studies <xref rid="pone.0032831-Krautter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032831-Weyrich1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> on the acquisition of clinical skills, and interrater-reliability was high for both instruments in our study.</p><p>Finally, although the group sample size of <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;42 was sufficient to measure the effect of skills laboratory training compared to bedside teaching when rated by independent video raters, it may possibly have failed to detect more marginal differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the results of our study showed that training of IV cannulation skills acquired in a skills laboratory is superior to bedside teaching when rated by independent video raters by means of IPPI scales and binary checklists. Skills laboratory training enables students to perform IV cannulation faster, more accurately and more professionally on students acting as patients in terms of technical and communicational aspects than bedside teaching. These results can be attributed to the didactic approach of the skills laboratory training session in combination with the students' possibility of practising IV cannulation independently in a safe environment before the first actual performance on a patient. Training IV cannulation in a skills laboratory thus leads to an improvement in patient safety and better medical care. Our results underline the importance of an implementation of structured and proficiency-based teaching interventions for the training of invasive procedures on all levels of difficulty, not only in residency programmes, but also in undergraduate medical education programmes. Future studies should address the durability of skills acquired through simulation based training with long-term follow-ups of participants. Furthermore, researchers should investigate how concomitant clinical supervision affects the transfer of procedural skills from a simulated setting into clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0032831.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0032831.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The authors have no support or funding to report.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0032831-Epstein1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
