However, the effects of behavior change interventions on obesity prevention are inconclusive if objective indicators of weight loss such as the body mass index are the main outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These inconclusive effects stem from the fact that changes in body mass index may poorly reflect dynamic changes in body composition taking place in adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In fact, using body mass index as an indicator of body composition may lead to severe classification errors because adolescents classified as overweight may have large bone and muscle mass [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, overweight prevention interventions for adolescents should target the changes of body composition and its major components, such as fat mass, as well as the behavioral mediators of changes in body composition, such as physical activity and diet change [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159125.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>There are well-documented associations between indicators of changes in body composition such as total body fat and behavioral mediators such as physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159125.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In particular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) predicts total body fat in a general population of adolescents, but the relationships are negligible for physical activity of light intensity [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although body fat is expected to increase across adolescence, reviews of longitudinal research suggested that MVPA has a protective effect against a higher body fat gain [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recognizing existing evidence for health benefits and prevention of excessive weight gain, the World Health Organization [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] recommended that adolescents should accumulate at least 60 min of MVPA per day.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Self-Efficacy, Planning, and Physical Activity</title><p>Social cognitive theory is one of the approaches most frequently used as a basis for interventions targeting obesity prevention and PA among adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In particular, self-efficacy as a key predictor within social cognitive theory has been shown to be a proximal, consistent, and strong predictor of variance in PA and interventions based on the construct have been shown to be effective [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159125.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Self-efficacy is defined as beliefs about the ability to act upon one&#x02019;s intention to engage in a particular behavior (e.g., participation in MVPA), regardless of barriers (e.g., feeling tired; [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Those beliefs are directly related to the maintenance of PA and relapse prevention [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Research has shown that self-efficacy is one of the most consistent predictors of a smaller decline in MVPA across adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Systematic reviews of self-efficacy interventions for adults suggest small to moderate effects on PA [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, long-term effects of brief self-efficacy interventions on adolescents&#x02019; PA (including MVPA) are inconclusive [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159125.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Implementation intentions or planning [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] is another theoretical approach focusing on mechanisms responsible for the attainment of behavioral goal in health contexts including PA [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The action planning approach assumes that cues-to-action should make reference not only to &#x02018;when&#x02019; and &#x02018;where&#x02019; the behavior should be enacted, but also to &#x02018;how&#x02019; it should be done [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whereas coping plans focus on how the behavior should be done if barriers arose [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Forming action and coping plans is related to PA in correlational and experimental studies conducted among adults [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159125.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Much less is known about the influence of planning interventions on adolescents&#x02019; PA.</p><p>In sum, self-efficacy and planning are the key &#x02018;building blocks&#x02019;, often used in interventions addressing health behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Longitudinal correlational studies have provided evidence for the assumption that self-efficacy and planning operate in concert when predicting PA [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, to our knowledge there is no evidence that a combination of self-efficacy and planning would result in substantially larger changes in MVPA, compared to interventions targeting self-efficacy only or planning alone [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The current study aims to address this gap by developing an intervention assessing the main and interactive effects of intervention techniques based on these constructs in a factorial design.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Mechanisms Explaining Effects of Self-Efficacy and Planning Interventions</title><p>Planning and self-efficacy interventions may operate through specific mechanisms. For example, effects of self-efficacy interventions were mediated by a change in self-efficacy but not mediated by a change in the use of planning [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The evaluation of underlying mechanisms may be achieved using a mediation analysis, testing whether assignment to the intervention condition explains change in MVPA indirectly, through a change in the psychological variables matched to the intervention&#x02019;s behavior change techniques. Unfortunately, research on behavior change interventions rarely provides explicit tests of the underlying mediating mechanisms. Analyses of the effects of any theory-based psychological mediators explaining the effects of interventions on weight-related outcomes and PA measured at long-term were conducted in less than 25% of trials accounting for the mediators [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Without specifying and testing for the underlying mechanisms, even a well-designed study cannot be informative of <italic>how</italic> an intervention worked [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>We identified only four studies comparing the effects of planning and self-efficacy interventions, with two testing the mediating role of social cognitive variables. Compared to a self-efficacy intervention, a planning intervention turned out to be more effective in determining long-term changes in adolescent smoking [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The study did not test the potential cognitive mediators. Luszczynska et al. [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that both self-efficacy and planning interventions affected fruit and vegetable intake at 12-month follow-up, but energy-dense food intake changed only in the self-efficacy group. Respective social-cognitive variables mediated the effects on behavior. Guillaumie, Godin, Manderscheid, Spitz, and Muller [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found that effects of three interventions (planning, self-efficacy, and a combination of planning and self-efficacy) on fruit and vegetable intake, evaluated at the 3-month follow-up, were mediated by planning but not by self-efficacy. Guillaumie, Godin, Maderscheid, Spitz, and Muller [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] also showed that the same three interventions influenced fruit/vegetable intake at 6-month follow-up, but not at 12-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Combining Intervention Components</title><p>Although there is a large body of evidence for the effectiveness of multi-component interventions which use multiple sessions [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it remains unclear which of the components are responsible for behavior change and whether there is any redundancy across the components. Furthermore, it is unknown whether combining two effective components would result in a substantially larger effect, over and above single-component interventions. The evaluation of superiority of a multi-component intervention over one-component intervention should be conducted controlling for the forms of delivery. Among delivery aspects, the length of the intervention is consistently related with weight-related and behavioral outcomes such as PA [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, the conclusive evidence may be obtained if the interventions targeting single or multiple social cognitive variables use a similar delivery protocol and have the same duration.</p><p>So far, only two studies [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159125.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] compared the effects of self-efficacy, planning, and combined self-efficacy + planning interventions. The studies are not conclusive regarding the mediating mechanisms and applied only self-report measurement of outcomes. Thus, the effects and underlying mechanisms of the single-component and combined interventions require further and more thorough testing.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>The Effects of Built Environment, Providing Opportunities for MVPA</title><p>Besides the effects of social cognitive variables on behavior-related outcomes, social-cognitive theory [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] highlights the role of environmental factors. Social cognitive variables, behaviors, and environment are in continuous and reciprocal relationships and all three of them have to be accounted for to fully explain individual&#x02019;s functioning [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Systematic reviews indicated that the built environment is among the predictors of excessive weight gain indicators in adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In particular, built facilities providing opportunities for PA in close proximity to the school environment have a positive effect on adolescents&#x02019; MVPA [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Built PA facilities are associated with the greatest odds of engaging in frequent bouts of MVPA [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The evidence for the interaction effects of self-efficacy (or control-related social cognitive variables) and built PA facilities on PA is inconclusive [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interaction effects of built environment and planning intervention on PA were not analyzed. However, research has indicated that psychosocial interventions focused on PA and dietary change among adolescents were more likely to produce significant effects if combined with changes in built environment, in particular, built PA facilities [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, the presence of such facilities may enhance the effects of self-efficacy or planning interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>The Present Study</title><p>This longitudinal experimental study tested the effects of three brief interventions, each using a single or combination of sets of behavior change techniques to change theory-based social cognitive variables: (1) prompting the formation of plans, (2) prompting self-efficacy beliefs, and (3) prompting planning + self-efficacy relative to an active &#x02018;education only&#x02019; control group. The intervention and control group procedures targeted an increase of MVPA and a concomitant improvements in body composition in adolescents aged 14&#x02013;18 years. It was hypothesized that participants assigned to the interventions would exhibit a smaller increase in body fat at 14-month follow-up compared to controls. We also investigated whether the combined planning + self-efficacy intervention would have larger effects on the main outcome (body fat) than single-component interventions. Second, it was hypothesized that the effects of the intervention conditions on body fat at the 14-month follow-up would be mediated by their respective social cognitive and behavioral constructs: self-efficacy and planning at T2 (Mediator 1), and by MVPA at T3 (Mediator 2). We expected that the effects of the interventions including the planning component (i.e., planning intervention and self-efficacy + planning intervention) would be mediated by planning, whereas the effects of the interventions including the self-efficacy component (i.e., self-efficacy intervention and self-efficacy + planning intervention) would be mediated by self-efficacy. Finally, we explored whether the effects of the intervention (both direct and indirect effects, via their respective psychological variables and MVPA) on body fat would be moderated by a specific component of the built environment: the presence of built PA facilities located in close proximity of schools.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were adolescents (<italic>N</italic> = 1217; <italic>M</italic> age = 16.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.70, age range 14&#x02013;18 years), 58% were girls, and 98% were of White ethnicity.

Informed written consent was also obtained from all adolescents included in the study. All students received information about the study aims and the procedures. In particular, the study was introduced as promoting moderate and vigorous physical activity and healthy body weight and composition. The aim referring to the change of body fat was not disclosed. Participants who were concerned or distressed by these issues were invited to contact the experimenters after the respective wave of data collection (i.e., a consultation with a clinical psychologist was available).

This procedure was chosen to facilitate the data collection taking place concurrently in several locations. However, it relied on repeating the first 50 digits of the generated sequence in each classroom, and therefore resulted in unequal group sizes.</p></sec><sec

PROCESS permits the conduct of multiple mediator analysis in linear multiple regression models while accounting for covariates (T1 MVPA, T1 body fat, T1 mediators, T1 intention, age, and gender). We conducted multiple mediation analyses with sequential mediators (social cognitive variables at T2 as mediators in the first sequence; MVPA at T3 as mediators in the second sequence). Results of analyses are presented using two types of coefficients. A regression coefficient for each parameter is provided (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159125.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159125.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Furthermore, PROCESS estimates the indirect effect coefficient (<italic>&#x003b8;</italic>) for each indirect pathway (through respective mediators) between the independent variable (the group assignment) and the dependent variable (body fat at T3). The independent variables were coded as 1 (for self-efficacy as the mediator: the self-efficacy group and the self-efficacy + planning group; for planning as the mediator: the planning group and the self-efficacy + planning group) or 0 (the control group). Moderated mediation was conducted with PROCESS to test whether the indirect and direct effects observed in the mediation models were moderated by built PA facility (coded as 1 or 0).

This was indicated by values of conditional indirect effects of self-efficacy (built facility present: &#x003b8; = 0.08, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.28; built facility absent, &#x003b8; = -0.01, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, 95% CI: -0.08, 0.04), and MVPA (built facility present: &#x003b8; = -0.07, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.09, 95% CI: -0.28, 0.07; built facility absent: &#x003b8; = -0.10, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.08, 95% CI: -0.29, 0.03). However, the direct effect of the group assignment on body fat (T3) was moderated by the presence of built facilities. In particular, the conditional direct effect was not significant in the absence of built facility &#x003b8; = -0.47, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.38,95% CI: -1.22, 0.27, but it was significant when built facility was present, &#x003b8; = -1.50, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.45, 95% CI: -2.38, -0.62.</p><p>A similar pattern of findings was observed when the moderating effects were investigated in the model with planning (T2) as the mediator. Results showed no direct effect of built facilities on body fat at T3, <italic>B</italic> = -1.68, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.02, 95% CI: -3.68, 0.32. The indirect effects of the group assignment on body fat (T3) were not moderated by the presence of built facilities. This was indicated by the non-significant values of conditional indirect effects of planning (built facility present: &#x003b8; = 0.09, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.08, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.31; built facility absent, &#x003b8; = 0.01, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.11), and MVPA (built facility present: &#x003b8; = -0.07, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.28, 0.02; built facility absent: &#x003b8; = -0.11, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.30, 0.01). However, the direct effect of the group assignment on body fat (T3) was moderated by the presence of built facilities for MVPA. The conditional direct effect was not significant in the absence of built facilities &#x003b8; = -0.31, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.38, 95% CI: -1.06, 0.44, whereas it was significant when built facilities were present, &#x003b8; = -1.56, SE = 0.45, 95% CI: -2.45, -0.67.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Discussion</title><p>This longitudinal study offers an insight into the effects and mechanisms of three brief interventions using two different sets of behavior change techniques, and their combination, designed to control an increase of body fat in adolescents. Overall, the effects of the interventions on body fat were small. In general, an increase of body fat of 0.6% to 0.8% was observed from T1 to T3 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0159125.t002">Table 2</xref>) in intervention participants, but the increase in the control group was 1.6%. The difference between intervention and control groups is substantial and similar to 1% of body fat changes found in other PA and nutrition interventions delivered to overweight individuals [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>One of the key issues addressed in this study refers to the potential superiority of combining two sets of intervention techniques targeting two social cognitive predictors of physical activity (self-efficacy and planning) over interventions addressing only one set of techniques (either self-efficacy or planning). Our findings indicate that in terms of weight-related outcomes at follow-up, the effects of the combined components were equal to those of the individual components alone. The similarity in the effects may be attributable to aspects of interventions that were common to each of the intervention groups [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These aspects could include, but are not limited to the intervention format, method of delivery, length of the intervention, method of implementation, skills of the implementers, and the support offered in the intervention setting. While a strength of the current study was to hold these aspects constant across intervention conditions so that the groups differed only in the sets of behavior change techniques relevant to each condition and addressed psychological constructs (i.e., presence or absence of self-efficacy or planning), it is possible that the presence of other very similar aspects across the conditions may have &#x02018;washed out&#x02019; any potential for differences attributable to the intervention techniques.</p><p>In line with good practice guidelines for behavior change interventions [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we tested potential mediators of the intervention effects. Our findings suggest that the effects of interventions may be explained by the appropriate underlying mechanisms, which include processes of fostering self-efficacy or the use of planning (for similar patterns see [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). So far, only one study tested the mediating mechanisms of planning + self-efficacy intervention [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our research and the study by Guillaumie et al. [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] used different behavior change techniques to enhance self-efficacy. This difference may explain why the two studies yielded different effects of the mediator (self-efficacy beliefs). In particular, behavior change techniques referring to mastery experience were absent in the study by Guillaumie et al. [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Mastery experience and self-persuasion may be among the most important sources of self-efficacy for PA [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The direct effects of the interventions on body fat (T3) depended to the presence of newly built PA facilities in the school environment. The findings are in line with good practice recommendations which suggest that behavior change interventions should account for changes in individuals&#x02019; cognition but also in the individuals&#x02019; physical environment [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the results indicate that built environment did not operate through perceptions of self-efficacy or the use of planning (as the indirect effects of the group assignment on body fat at T3 were not moderated by built environment). Future research should measure and analyze alternative indirect pathways through which the built environment affects body fat gain. Such pathways may account for perceived accessibility or feasibility of the environmental structures, their perceived attractiveness and features that encourage sport and fitness [<xref rid="pone.0159125.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159125.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>There are several limitations of this study. Although this randomized controlled trial had a longitudinal design, the main and secondary outcomes were measured only once following the intervention. Evaluating body composition at T2 would additionally allow to estimate short-term effects of the intervention. Besides collecting post-study unstandardized reports from experimenters, we did not conduct a detailed measurement and analysis of adherence to protocol and its feasibility. Future research needs to investigate the feasibility factors which may explain implementation and delivery processes. The moderating role of the built PA facility should be generalized with extreme caution as our measure of differences in built environment referred to only one type of facility. The design of the study does not allow for concluding how the characteristics of the built environment influenced the study outcomes. The measurement of MVPA was based on self-reports whereas accelerometry would offer higher validity.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that self-efficacy, planning, and self-efficacy + planning interventions had effects on body fat that were similar in size relative to the control group. The effects on adolescents&#x02019; body fat (and MVPA) measured at 1-year follow-up were small. The interventions had preventive effects on body fat gain and the findings may be translated to approximately 1% of the difference between intervention and control groups. The effects of the interventions on body fat may be attributed to the changes in underlying psychological constructs and MVPA. Finally, the interventions had direct effects on body fat only if a built PA facilities (team sports such as soccer, basketball) were present in the near-school environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159125.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist, TIDieR Checklist, and Additional Supplementary Material (the Protocol).</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0159125.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0159125.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organization.
