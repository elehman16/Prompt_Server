HEYMAN was a 3-month intervention, targeted for young men to improve eating habits, activity levels and well-being. Intervention development was informed by a participatory research model (PRECEDE-PROCEED). Intervention components included eHealth support (website, wearable device, Facebook support group), face-to-face sessions (group and individual), a personalised food and nutrient report, home-based resistance training equipment and a portion control tool. Outcomes included: feasibility of research procedures (recruitment, randomisation, data collection and retention) and of intervention components. Generalized linear mixed models estimated the treatment effect at 3-months for the primary outcomes: pedometer steps/day, diet quality, well-being and several secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A 7-week recruitment period was required to enrol 50 young men.

For many, this time is marked by major life changes including moving away from the family home, starting and completing further education, beginning employment or unemployment, co-habiting with peers or a partner, getting married and/or becoming a parent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such transitions can adversely impact on health-related behaviours, including greater use of alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], poor eating habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and reduced physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is a concern as habits in young adulthood commonly track into mid-adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and worsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For instance; the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) prospective cohort study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3538) found that 75% of young adults aged 18&#x02013;30 years either reduced the number of healthy lifestyle factors (i.e., non-smoking, low alcohol, healthy diet, active, or healthy BMI) or remained unchanged when followed-up 20&#x000a0;years later in middle-age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. If adverse behaviours continue or escalate they can be detrimental to the physical and/or mental health of young men and set them on an adverse health trajectory as they progress through adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, young adulthood is an ideal time to target improvements in these health-related behaviours in order to prevent or delay serious mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and future chronic disease risk such as cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Recruiting, engaging and retaining young men into health-related interventions is an important yet challenging aspect of health research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A number of reasons have been suggested regarding challenges to engaging young men including; perceived irrelevance given current life-stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], less likely to live in a fixed location, long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], competing time demands which take priority (i.e., study, work, socialising, relationships, family obligations and/or parenthood) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, previous health programs&#x02019; have failed to account for the sociocultural values and preferences of young men in informing recruitment strategies and developing intervention components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Difficulties associated with recruitment and retention may explain why young men are under-represented in health programs and why there is a lack of evidence to guide development of effective health-related interventions for young men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The current evidence base is predominantly made up of health-related interventions that include both sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and all ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], but the heterogeneity in psychological, social, and physical differences between sexes and age groups, highlight the need for gender and age-specific health research and behavioural programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A recent systematic review of SNAPO (Smoking, Nutrition, Alcohol, Physical activity or Obesity) interventions in exclusively young men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] found few interventions targeting young men (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) and over half (6 out of 10) demonstrated significant positive short-term intervention effects. However, the review highlighted various limitations of studies including; only short-term outcomes reported, high risk of bias and difficulties in reaching and/or retaining this population group. Also none of the studies were specifically targeted or tailored to young men. The review concluded that more high quality studies are required that include young men in program design in order to personalise programs to their needs, interests and barriers, and to improve understanding of how to successfully engage them in effective health-behaviour change interventions.</p><p>A process evaluation of such studies can obtain vital perspectives from young men and is an integral component of intervention research to inform the design and implementation of future personalised interventions for this demographic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of health-related interventions in young men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], a detailed process evaluation may help to identify and understand participants views of the program, how participants engage with and use the different intervention components and which treatment modalities are feasible and acceptable to young men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In particular, process evaluation results can provide valuable insights into why an intervention fails or has unexpected outcomes or unintended consequences, or why a successful intervention works and how it can be optimised for a future RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Understanding these aspects can help to overcome the difficulties apparent with reaching and retaining young men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Following baseline measurement, young men were individually randomised to the HEYMAN group (commenced HEYMAN intervention immediately) or the waitlist control group (started HEYMAN after a 3-month delay). The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Number ACTRN12616000350426. The design, conduct and reporting adhered to the guidelines as outlined by Thabane and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

The development of HEYMAN is based on guidance from a community based participatory research model; PRECEDE-PROCEED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This model includes the target audience in developing the intervention to enhance program effectiveness and ensure that their individual needs and interests are accounted for, a strategy which should also improve reach, retention and engagement of young men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To align with the PRECEDE aspects of the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], a number of steps were taken to understand the social, epidemiological, behavioural and environmental assessments for this population group when developing HEYMAN. Formative research with young men was conducted to identify perceived motivators and barriers for healthy eating and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and to identify their preferences for intervention content and delivery medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In addition, the program was informed by best practice guidelines for diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], theoretical guidelines from an integrated framework of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Self Determination Theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and evidence from effective health-related interventions in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Height was measured to 0.1&#x000a0;cm on a portable stadiometer (model BSM370; InBody, Cerritos, CA). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using height and weight data. Waist circumference was measured to 0.1&#x000a0;cm using a non-extensible steel tape measure. Energy intake (kJ/day), serves of fruits and vegetables and proportion of energy from alcohol, and energy-dense, nutrient poor (ED-NP) foods were measured using the validated Australian Eating Survey FFQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (composite measures), resting heart rate and augmentation index were measured using an automatic sphygmomanometer (Pulsecor Cardioscope II, Pulsecor Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) under standardised procedures. Participants were seated for five minutes before the first blood pressure measurement and a rest period of two minutes between measures was used. Blood pressure was measured three times. An additional two measurements were taken if the blood pressure or resting heart rate values fell outside of the acceptable ranges (i.e. systolic within 10&#x000a0;mmHg, diastolic within 10&#x000a0;mmHg and resting heart rate within 5&#x000a0;bpm), with the mean of the two most consistent measures used.

The research procedures (recruitment, randomisation, data collection and retention) and intervention components (program usage, attractiveness, comprehension, usability, support, satisfaction and ability to persuade) were generally feasible and acceptable. In addition, the current study aimed to estimate the HEYMAN treatment effects on improving pedometer steps/day, diet quality and well-being (<italic>primary outcomes</italic>) and a number of lifestyle, psychological, anthropometric and physiological measures (<italic>secondary outcomes</italic>). Overall, results indicated that the research procedures and study protocol were adequate to proceed to a full scale RCT, with some modifications required. The HEYMAN program also demonstrated potential for positively impacting on a number of health outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Feasibility</title><p>Challenges associated with recruiting young men have been widely acknowledged and explain the scarcity of lifestyle behaviour interventions in this population group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The current study was successful in recruiting 50 young men over a seven-week period. The current study demonstrated high retention rates with 94% (47/50) returning at the 3-month follow-up, which is particularly promising given previous interventions have demonstrated difficulties in retaining young men. A recent systematic review highlighted that only three of 10 health-behaviour interventions in young men met the criteria for adequate retention (defined as a dropout of &#x02264;20% for &#x02264;6-month follow-up or &#x02264;30% for&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;6-month follow-up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, a significant strength of the HEYMAN program was development based on guidance from a participatory research model (PRECEDE-PROCEED), where formative research with young men informed program development, design, messaging and delivery. Thus recruitment materials and program messages were focussed around young men&#x02019;s individual preferences and addressed perceived motivators and barriers (e.g., focusing on fitness and strength). Also branding and graphic design throughout the program materials reflected young men (e.g., images of young men) and other male engagement strategies were used (e.g. sensitive use of humour) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This is likely to have increased the appeal of the program and ultimately enabled successful recruitment and retention. One issue requiring modification for the full scale RCT was with the exclusion criteria, which meant a large proportion of young men who required assistance with improving health behaviours could not take part. Particularly, many were identified as having poor eating habits but exceeded national recommendations for physical activity guidelines and thus were excluded. Adapting the eligibility criteria to include young men who fail to meet national recommendations for <italic>either</italic> dietary behaviours <italic>or</italic> physical activity rather than both, could address current challenges in recruiting larger numbers of young men in total and in a shorter time period.</p><p>Randomisation to start HEYMAN immediately or after a 3-month wait was shown to be feasible and generally acceptable to participants. As expected, controls reported to be less satisfied with allocation but there were no differences in drop-out at 3&#x000a0;months and almost all of controls were retained (23/24). To maximise retention of control participants, participants were informed of incentives for returning to the follow-up session, including a voucher to cover travel expenses and free exercise equipment at program commencement. Future research with young men could adopt similar techniques to prevent attrition.</p><p>Within a single assessment session, the number of instruments used to measure outcomes should be minimised to prevent excessive participant burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The considerable number of outcomes measured within the HEYMAN pilot was intensive. Despite this, retention through the trial remained high. The strategy of providing participants with self-report measures to be completed at home was effective and helped to minimise participant burden.</p><p>Young men reported the intervention was acceptable and were generally satisfied with most program components. A strength of the HEYMAN program was the use of socio-culturally relevant content and strategies when presenting and delivering intervention messages to young men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In further support of this, 83% of participants selected either &#x02018;agree&#x02019; or &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; for the appropriateness of the HEYMAN program because it was clearly designed for young men. Also the use of behaviour change theories and responses from formative work with young men to inform overall development further strengthened the program. The individualised face-to-face session ranked highest (or joint highest) for support, attaining goals, comprehension and satisfaction. This was to be anticipated since the benefits of this method have been illustrated in other interventions. For example, a review of 10 studies indicated that the most effective physical activity interventions were those that offered both individual and group support and using a tailored approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Similarly, a review of 21 studies established the benefits of individual dietary counselling on reducing saturated fats and increasing intake of fruit and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p>Young men demonstrated reasonable compliance and acceptability with most of the eHealth components of the program including the website and Jawbone&#x02122; wearable device, and associated UP app. This was expected given the high level of engagement with technology in this population group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. There were a total of 544 website views during the 3-month intervention period and process evaluation data revealed all participants had used the website. A comparable healthy lifestyle intervention in young adults (including 39% young men) demonstrated lower engagement, with less than half (43%) of participants reported to have used the website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Declining website usage as the intervention progresses is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. To maintain engagement with the HEYMAN website, new online content was introduced regularly throughout the program, which appeared to be effective as website views remained consistent, with views in week one (90 website visits) comparable to week seven (77 website visits) and week 11 (75 website visits). Despite frequent visits to the HEYMAN website, the average duration was short (one minute and 42&#x000a0;s). This may be due to the brief content on some pages that was linked out to other resources, so time spent on each page may not be a true reflection of engagement. Total views of the featured website videos were low, which suggests that alternative ways of relaying this information (i.e., during the individualised sessions) may be more acceptable.</p><p>Objective data for the Jawbone UP was available for 21 participants and all had used this during the intervention. On average, step counts were uploaded for 48 out of the available 65&#x000a0;days, equating to around 74% of the available time period. Usage in this current study appears to be slightly higher when compared to a similar study with middle-aged Australian men which identified 59% of the sample to have used the Jawbone UP during the 20-week intervention, with step counts uploaded for 69% of total time period (average of 96 out of 140&#x000a0;days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. A substantial expense was providing all individuals with the Jawbone&#x02122; wearable physical activity tracker. The financial burden associated with this may affect the scalability of the full scale HEYMAN with a large sample. If sufficient funds are not available, some modifications could be applied to the full scale RCT including; replacing the Jawbone&#x02122; component with a smartphone device as many young adults already use a smartphone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and many of these have built-in step-trackers. Alternatively, the program could employ a &#x02018;bring your own device&#x02019; plan for those who already use wearable devices. We are unaware if participants will demonstrate corresponding satisfaction and acceptability scores with these alternative options. However, these options will still enable goal-setting and self-monitoring of physical activity on a lower budget.</p><p>Even though all participants joined the Facebook group and engaged with the content (average of 20 views per post and 75% reported reading the weekly posts), the compliance and acceptability was much lower for the Facebook group as a social support tool. Only one participant posted to the Facebook discussion group with the remaining posts by the moderator. This is consistent with a similar targeted program for men which reported engagement with social forums/discussion groups as low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. However a recent weight loss program with young adults (including 29.7% young men) found Facebook to be the primary modality for delivery of dynamic content at the group level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The context of Facebook was utilised as a social support tool via a number of challenges and targeted campaigns. For example; facilitators challenged participants to not eat candy for two weeks. Participants publicly accepted the challenge by posting on Facebook for their friends to see. Participants then posted methods used to meet the goal and the facilitator provided feedback on methods, encouraged self-monitoring, and prompted goal review. Subsequently, the facilitator and each participant&#x02019;s social network provided social support and accountability through posts, comments, or likes until the campaign ended. Therefore, Facebook may not have been used to its full potential in HEYMAN by both intervention deliverers and participants. As a result the low acceptability may not be due to the technology itself, but due to the method of presenting the content. Therefore future versions of HEYMAN could consider alternative methods of social support through Facebook.</p><p>In moving forward, measures of technology usage should not be seen as the only determinant of engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. If a participant used/visits an eHealth component, it does not mean they are engaged by it. Therefore, multiple measures of engagement, including iterative, in-depth mixed methods research is required to fully understand and address issues affecting user engagement and to fully determine what constitutes &#x02018;effective engagement&#x02019; i.e., engagement associated with positive interventions outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p><p>Although the weekly group face-to-face sessions ranked highly for supportiveness, motivation, comprehension and attaining goals, average attendance was low (31.3%), particularly when compared to another targeted health program for middle-aged men which reported average attendance as 86% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. However this study by Hooker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] only included group based face-to-face sessions as the sole delivery mode. HEYMAN included different intervention components to relay information and resources across different mediums (i.e., exercises in the group sessions could also be accessed on the website and completed at home). This approach coincided with previous formative research in young men who expressed their preference for being able to access multiple delivery mediums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and acknowledged the need to address key barriers to PA and healthy eating including; &#x0201c;busy lifestyles&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;lack of time&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Due to the greater variety of options, participants may have chosen different delivery modes to suit their lifestyles. Despite the low attendance, 71% of participants reported being very satisfied or satisfied with the session content. The attendance levels were sporadic throughout the program with many citing work and study commitments for non-attendance, despite young men previously expressing preference for this delivery mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The group based face-to-face sessions had a fixed time slot, but in progressing to the full scale RCT, greater flexibility may be required to enhance attendance, for example, communicating with potential participants to establish the most convenient days and times for sessions and possibly opening up alternative days and times to run the sessions. Also, given the high attendance, acceptability and satisfaction with the individualised one-to-one sessions, future versions of HEYMAN could trial more individualised sessions and fewer group based sessions. But in doing this, researcher burden will be increased and therefore delivery via video consultations using software such as Skype, Google Hangout or other programs could also be considered.</p><p>The TEMPlate&#x02122; dinner disc to guide portion sizes at meal times demonstrated low acceptability and satisfaction. Although most used the disc initially (66.7%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16), none used it daily. Open responses citing reasons for non-use were mainly centred around the inconvenience and impracticality for many types of food. Especially for foods that could not be &#x02018;deconstructed&#x02019; to align with the sections on the plate. As a result, this component should be removed in future trials and portion size education via the website, apps or in face-to-face sessions trialled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Estimation of treatment effect</title><p>Although this pilot RCT was not designed to be powered to detect between-group differences in outcomes, a number of significant results were still observed. This indicates the potential effectiveness of a future fully powered RCT. Moderate (<italic>d</italic> &#x0003e;0.50) to large (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.80) effects were observed for changes in MVPA, vegetable serves, energy from ED-NP foods, weight, percent weight loss, waist circumference, BMI, body fat mass, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio. There were no significant intervention effects observed for any of the primary outcomes for pedometer steps/day, diet quality or subjective well-being. However, the medium effect size for ARFS diet quality score (<italic>p&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;0.08, <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48) is promising. Greater improvements were observed when compared to a study of overweight and obese adults in an online weight loss RCT, at 3-months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The ARFS diet quality score focuses on variety within the core (healthy) food groups recommended in the Australian Dietary Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. When examining ARFS subscales in the current study (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>), future interventions should encourage a greater variety of foods within the core food groups of wholegrains, vegetables, meat, vegetarian alternatives and dairy products. Also, despite significant reductions in ED-NP foods in the intervention group, the percentage of total energy intake from these foods was still much higher than the recommended maximum limit of 15% of total energy intake, based on consuming up to 3 servings per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Future interventions should provide a greater focus on strategies to reduce ED-NP intakes. The difference in number of steps between intervention and control (1012.7 steps per day) was less than results from a meta-analysis of eight RCT&#x02019;s, which reported a between group difference of 2491 steps per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. However, two participants in the HEYMAN intervention group had serious injuries at follow-up measurement, which impeded their level of activity and may have contributed to the smaller differences between groups.</p><p>There was a small effect (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.11) on subjective well-being score from the satisfaction with life scale. Also effect sizes were small for all secondary psychological measures. Potential reasoning for this may be due to over half of the sample being University students (62%) and the follow-up measures closely followed an examination period. A previous study has indicated that studying for examinations, undertaking examinations and receiving examination results were the highest causes of psychological distress among University students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p>For several outcomes including diet quality, pedometer steps and psychological measures, small but positive changes were observed by the control group. For that reason, the overall treatment effect may have been underestimated. These improvements may occur in response to undergoing baseline assessment, due to participants&#x02019; awareness of being involved in an experimental trial, or anticipation of receiving active treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Also most positive changes for controls were observed in outcomes with self-report measures, which are subject to social desirability bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and therefore self-reported behaviour changes in controls may reflect unreliable reporting, rather than actual behaviour changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although significant between group differences were identified for a number of health outcomes at 3-months, these results are indicative rather than conclusive. Given this was a pilot trial, the sample was purposely small, with low power and prevents any conclusions being made regarding the generalisability of findings. The short duration of the trial also limits the interpretation of these findings. Future versions of the HEYMAN program could include longer follow-up to assess long terms effects. The use of self-report measures also introduces reporting bias and an error in the objective Jawbone data meant that data was only available for 65 out of the 84&#x000a0;days. Despite best efforts to recruit a diverse sample of young men, there was an over-representation of those with higher education levels and in full-time study. In addition, participants were de-identified for the Google Analytics data to determine website usage, therefore we could not separate data by completers and drop-outs. The assessment for retention (i.e., those completing follow-up measures) may be considered a limitation as some participants may have attended and completed follow-up measures but not completed the intervention (i.e., non-usage attrition).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Young adulthood is an ideal time to intervene on health behaviours in order to prevent or delay serious mental and/or physical health problems. However, young men have been under-represented in interventions to improve health behaviours, and the few that have been carried out have experienced problems with reaching and retaining them. Participatory-based interventions such as HEYMAN, which involve young men in the program design and match program content and messages to their expressed preferences, needs and barriers, has the potential to overcome limitations previously identified. Findings from the current pilot study demonstrated sufficient feasibility in terms of research procedures, including recruitment, retention, randomisation and data collection to justify progress to a full scale RCT, with some minor amendments necessary. To improve overall acceptability, engagement and satisfaction, modifications are required including; changing the composition of face-to-face sessions with an increased number of individualised sessions and greater flexibility in the time and days for group based sessions. Some adaptations to the Facebook content is required and including portion size education across a number of delivery mediums. The lessons learnt from the current pilot study provide key insights into working with young men. Results demonstrated that HEYMAN has the potential to successfully facilitate some lifestyle changes and improve a number of health behaviours in young men.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Additional files</title><p>
