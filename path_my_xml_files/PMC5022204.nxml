By leveraging a unique collaboration between Texas AgriLife Extension (a federal, state and county funded educational outreach organization) and the University of Texas School of Public Health, the Texas Grow! Eat! Go! Study (TGEG) modeled the effectiveness of utilizing existing programs and volunteer infrastructure to disseminate an enhanced Coordinated School Health program. The five-year TGEG study was developed to assess the independent and combined impact of gardening, nutrition and physical activity intervention(s) on the prevalence of healthy eating, physical activity and weight status among low-income elementary students. The purpose of this paper is to report on study design, baseline characteristics, intervention approaches, data collection and baseline data.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study design for the TGEG study consisted of a factorial group randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which 28 schools were randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment groups: (1) Coordinated Approach to Child Health (CATCH) only (Comparison), (2) CATCH plus school garden intervention [Learn, Grow, Eat &#x00026; Go! (LGEG)], (3) CATCH plus physical activity intervention [Walk Across Texas (WAT)], and (4) CATCH plus LGEG plus WAT (Combined). The outcome variables include student&#x02019;s weight status, vegetable and sugar sweetened beverage consumption, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Parents were assessed for home environmental variables including availability of certain foods, social support of student health behaviors, parent engagement and behavior modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Descriptive data are presented for students (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1369) and parents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1206) at baseline. The sample consisted primarily of Hispanic and African American (53&#x000a0;% and 18&#x000a0;%, respectively) and low-income (i.e., 78&#x000a0;% eligible for Free and Reduced Price School Meals program and 43&#x000a0;% food insecure) students. On average, students did not meet national guidelines for vegetable consumption or physical activity. At baseline, no statistical differences for demographic or key outcome variables among the 4 treatment groups were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The TGEG study targets a population of students and parents at high risk of obesity and related chronic conditions, utilizing a novel and collaborative approach to program formulation and delivery, and a rigorous, randomized study design.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>School garden intervention</kwd><kwd>Physical activity intervention</kwd><kwd>JMG</kwd><kwd>LGEG</kwd><kwd>WAT</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Low-income children</kwd><kwd>Hispanic</kwd><kwd>African American</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011-68001-30138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warren</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000880</institution-id><institution>Michael and Susan Dell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008746</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25 CA57712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heredia</surname><given-names>N.

In 2011&#x02013;2012, 34&#x000a0;% of children ages 6 to 11 were overweight or obese, and 18&#x000a0;% were obese. Among Hispanic children of the same age, these figures were 46&#x000a0;% and 26&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Specific to Texas, Hispanic child (ages 2&#x02013;19) obesity rates range from 20&#x000a0;% - 30&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Several behaviors have been shown to impact students&#x02019; weight status, including fruit and vegetable consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], engagement physical activity (PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and sedentary behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Because parents are the main gatekeepers to younger children&#x02019;s dietary and PA behaviors, several parental behaviors are also important for maintaining and decreasing a student&#x02019;s weight status, including increasing access and availability of vegetables at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], limiting availability of SSB at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] providing social support for PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], limiting student&#x02019;s sedentary activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], preparing food together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and eating meals together with their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and doing PA with their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>School interventions can play an important role in the prevention of childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Schools are uniquely positioned to have a positive impact on students&#x02019; knowledge and behaviors related to nutrition and PA by creating a healthy environment. In addition, schools can provide an effective way to reach parents, who are otherwise often difficult to reach. Although school-based nutrition and PA interventions have shown significant effects on students&#x02019; behaviors, few school-based interventions have incorporated multiple strategies such as gardening, nutrition, and PA components into one intervention.</p><p>School-based interventions using gardening as a key component are a promising approach to addressing healthy eating and student&#x02019;s weight status. Recent studies of garden-based approaches in schools show successful engagement of students and parents, including minority students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and students living in limited resource households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Garden-based interventions consistently demonstrate their ability to increase knowledge and preference for vegetables among students. However, evidence indicating positive impacts on actual dietary behaviors and child weight status is mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Only one study has found a significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) following a gardening intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Therefore, further research using large-scale studies is needed to examine if garden-based programs can effectively impact students&#x02019; BMI levels.</p><p>School-based PA interventions are one method to increase children&#x02019;s PA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In addition to the more traditional interventions that focus on changing the curriculum, PA interventions focusing on non-curricular activities such as classroom breaks, system-wide school changes and family components can also be impactful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. By focusing on non-curricular strategies, these types of interventions can help address the common barriers to school-based PA interventions, which include lack of time during school hours due to the need to teach standardized test focused lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, in regard to reducing BMI, results of these types of PA programs are mixed. Further research must be conducted to determine the impact of non-curricular PA interventions on students&#x02019; behavior and weight status.</p><p>A combination of nutrition, gardening, and PA interventions in schools can theoretically work synergistically to improve health behaviors in students and weight status of students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, there is a gap in the literature with regard to the impact of such combined interventions, because they are logistically difficult to implement, involving expertise in a variety of specialties; are very resource intensive; and because people still tend to think in intervention silos. To address this gap, the Texas Grow! Eat! Go! (TGEG) study was developed to assess the independent and combined impact of gardening, nutrition and PA intervention(s) on the prevalence of healthy eating and PA behaviors and weight status among low-income elementary students and parents. In particular, TGEG pioneered the collaboration between existing Extension resources and evidence-based Coordinated School Health (CSH) programming to deliver a uniquely comprehensive and coordinated intervention. Using a factorial group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 28 low-income elementary schools, effects of the different combination of interventions were evaluated. The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to describe the intervention protocol, research design, and details of the data collection protocol used in the TGEG Study and 2) to present selected baseline data for participating students and parents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The TGEG intervention study was funded for a 5-year period starting in 2011. The study design consisted of a factorial group RCT in which 28 schools from geographically separate areas of Texas were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In Texas, all elementary schools are required by state policy to implement a specific Texas Education Agency-approved CSH program (TEC &#x000a7;38.0141). To ensure comparability of the participating study schools, the researchers recruited schools that had selected the Coordinated Approach to School Health (CATCH) program (described more fully in the Methods section) as their CSH program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Accordingly, the four treatment groups included (1) CATCH only (<italic>Comparison</italic>), (2) CATCH plus a school garden intervention (<italic>Learn, Grow, Eat&#x000a0;&#x00026; Go!</italic> or <italic>LGEG</italic>), (3) CATCH plus a PA program (<italic>Walk across Texas</italic> or <italic>WAT</italic>), and (4) CATCH plus LGEG plus WAT (<italic>Combined</italic>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3453_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The goal of the TGEG study was to measure the impact of the different combinations of interventions on key outcome variables related to healthy eating, PA and student weight status among 3rd grade students and their parents. Our hypotheses stated that students and parents in the combined treatment group would score higher on key outcome variables compared to students in the single intervention groups and the comparison group. A split cohort design was used to implement the study (i.e. cohort 1 began in the 2012 school year and cohort 2 in the 2013 school year). Data collection for cohort 1 occurred during the fall of 2012, spring and fall of 2013 and spring 2014. For cohort 2, data collection occurred fall 2013, spring and fall 2015 and spring 2015. The TGEG pilot study, which was conducted in 2011&#x02013;2012, assessed project feasibility and provided data on best practices for combining the multiple interventions, on appropriate implementation and data collecting practices, and on appropriateness of the data collection tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>The key student outcome variables included objectively-measured BMI, and self-reported variables including (1) vegetable preference, (2) vegetable exposure, (3) vegetable consumption, (4) SSB consumption, (5) moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and (7) sedentary behaviors. The key parent outcome variables included (1) home availability/accessibility of vegetables, (2) home availability of SSB, (3) parental emotional social support for increasing PA, and (4) parental support for decreasing sedentary behavior.

AgriLife Extension was established (Smith-Lever Act, 1914) to disseminate research from Land Grant Universities in the U.S. (created by the Morrill Act, 1862) to agricultural producers and their families. Cooperative Extension Services exist in all 50 states and provide an untapped resource for providing effective health interventions for families across the nation. By building upon the existing programs and volunteer networks provided by the Texas A&#x00026;M AgriLife Extension Service, the TGEG study served as a demonstration of a novel and effective partnership which may provide a blueprint for effective replication nationally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Description and implementation of interventions</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Coordinated School Health (CSH) program</title><p>As mentioned above, all schools participating in our study were required to have selected the CATCH program as their CSH program. CATCH (Coordinated Approach To Child Health) is a school-based health program designed to promote physical activity and healthy food choices and prevent tobacco use. CATCH transforms a child&#x02019;s environment, culture, and society by coordinating child health efforts across all aspects of the educational experience: classroom, food services, physical education, and family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. CATCH vocabulary (e.g., &#x0201c;Go, Slow, and Whoa!&#x0201d; foods) and philosophy were incorporated in both LGEG and WAT in order to integrate the interventions. At the beginning of the school year, all study schools were provided with the CATCH Coordination Kit and a training session on CATCH to ensure uniformity in delivery across schools. However, the study staff did not provide any additional assistance with the implementation of CATCH. Measurement of CATCH implementation fidelity was built into the process evaluation protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>The Learn, Grow, Eat&#x000a0;&#x00026; Go! (LGEG) Intervention</title><p>To create the LGEG intervention, a Junior Master Garden program, entitled the &#x0201c;Health and Nutrition from the Garden,&#x0201d; was modified significantly to include SCT-based strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] targeting psychosocial variables and our key behavioral outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The new LGEG intervention includes school gardens for each participating classroom, a classroom curriculum, a student garden journal, and Family Story reading activities. Students grew vegetables throughout the year and participated in vegetable recipe demonstrations. Students also took home English and Spanish recipe cards (which featured kitchen math activities). Family Stories included reading assignments for students to complete at home with the parent/guardian. The stories paralleled the classroom curriculum, featured four of the vegetables, and used consistent messages to model small steps a family can take to be healthy. All lessons were aligned with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) as well as the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) Performance Standards. For this study, LGEG was implemented throughout the school year in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade classrooms.</p><p>At the beginning of the school year, all participating 3<sup>rd</sup> grade teachers at LGEG or Combined schools attended a five-hour training session. This session included an overview of the intervention, activities to familiarize the teachers with intervention components, introduction to local Extension partners, the Teacher Intervention Activity Log and the research/data collection tools. The local AgriLife Extension educators, Master Volunteers and TGEG Project Specialists provided support for the garden installation, the vegetable tasting and conducted the related vegetable recipe demonstration for each classroom. Throughout the year, teachers worked with AgriLife Extension agents, Master Volunteers, and other volunteers to implement the LGEG intervention. The TGEG local Extension Project Specialists provided the coordination and technical assistance throughout the year. The process evaluation assessed each school&#x02019;s implementation of the specific LGEG components.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The Walk Across Texas (WAT) intervention</title><p>WAT is a best-practice PA program developed by AgriLife Extension and includes multiple program components designed to establish the habit of regular PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. For the TGEG study, components of the WAT program included a kick-off event, a classroom team competition to walk 832 miles per class in eight weeks, a home family bonus miles form, and an end-of-program celebration. In addition, each teacher was asked to perform two classroom activity break lesson plans during each week throughout the program. All lessons were aligned with the TEKS as well as the STAAR Performance Standards. Weekly English and Spanish newsletters featuring both healthy PA and eating tips were added to enhance family engagement through messaging and parent&#x02013;child activities. Students also took home a Walking Bingo Activity Card to encourage family outdoor activities in their community.</p><p>At the beginning of the school year, all participating 3<sup>rd</sup> grade teachers at WAT or Combined schools attended a three-hour training session. Each training session included an overview of the intervention, activities to familiarize the teachers with intervention components, an introduction to local Extension partners, the Teacher Intervention Activity Log and the research/data collection tools and plan. Throughout the year, either classroom teachers, Parent Support Specialists or PE teachers implemented the WAT intervention. The TGEG Project Specialist provided technical assistance throughout the year. Process evaluation assessed each school&#x02019;s implementation of the specific WAT components.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Recruitment of schools</title><p>The setting for this study included low-income elementary schools. Inclusion criteria of the schools included: 1) classified as a Title 1 (defined as schools with at least 40&#x000a0;% of student population living in low-income households); 2) located within one of the study&#x02019;s geographical areas of Texas; 3) implementation of CATCH as a CSH program; 4) school commitment at the district, principal, and teacher level. Admission to individual public schools in the U.S. is usually based on residency. A large portion of school revenues come from local property taxes, and hence are dependent on how wealthy or poor these localities are. Thus, public schools vary widely in the resources they have available per student, resulting in large differences in school quality, class size, and curriculum from one district to another. These geographical differences are often compounded by residential segregation of minorities. Therefore, when conducting research studies in U.S. schools, it is important to have specific inclusion criteria for percent of children living in low-income households.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomization of schools</title><p>For both years, the four schools in each geographic region or county site were randomized to treatment by the project PI listing the elementary school name on an index card &#x00026; folding the card to conceal the school name.

Exclusion criteria includes: 1) being on a special diet (i.e. a diet which would limit the consumption of certain foods due to medical or religious beliefs such as a ketogenic or gluten-free diet), and 2) primary language not English or Spanish. Inclusion criteria for the parents were: 1) ability to read in English or Spanish, and 2) parent/caretaker of a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade child. The study packets contained a cover letter, active consent forms (both parent and child), a media release form (in case a child was featured in a picture to be posted on the TGEG website), and a Parent Survey. Parents could agree to let their child participate without participating themselves. Students received a small incentive at each data collection period (e.g. rulers, lunch bags, measuring spoons).

Specifically, 16 schools (four per school district) in the 2012&#x02013;2013 school year, and 12 schools (four per school district) in the 2013&#x02013;2014 school year were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups. Of the 28 participating schools, eight were located in north central Texas, eight schools were on the southern coast, eight in east central and four in central Texas. The varied locations provided a diversity of cultures and growing conditions for the school gardens. All schools were classified Title I, with 85&#x000a0;% of the students across all schools eligible for the Free and Reduced Price School Meals program (range: 61&#x000a0;% &#x02013; 99&#x000a0;%).</p><p>Participation rates varied by school with student participation ranging 24&#x000a0;% to 90&#x000a0;% of 3<sup>rd</sup> graders per school, with a mean participation rate of 56&#x000a0;%. Our study goal of recruitment of 50 students per school was met in 56&#x000a0;% of the schools. In 64&#x000a0;% of the schools we were able to recruit at least 40 students. However, some of the participating schools had fewer than 50 eligible students per school and, therefore, it was impossible to reach our recruitment goal.</p><p>Sociodemographic data are presented for students (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1326), parents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1206), and households (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1206) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Across all treatment groups participants were ethnically diverse and low-income. Overall, 52&#x000a0;% of parents reported being Hispanic and 18&#x000a0;% African American; 26&#x000a0;% of parents reported speaking mostly Spanish at home. A high percentage of parents reported participation of their child in the Free and Reduced Price School Meals program, a commonly used proxy for poverty, which is substantially higher than the statewide participation rate of 60&#x000a0;% in 2012&#x02013;13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In addition, 43&#x000a0;% of parents reported being sometimes or almost always food insecure. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> also points to the presence of some sociodemographic differences across treatment conditions, particularly with regard to the distribution of ethnicity and language. Most of these differences derive from a larger proportion of Hispanic in the LGEG group. Overall, missing data for the sociodemographic variables was within a reasonable range. One exception is the large percent missing for the student race/ethnicity measure. Student race/ethnicity information was imputed from parent reports of race/ethnicity, but because not all parents chose to respond to the parent questionnaire, there is a larger than expected number of missing data for this variable.</p><p>Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> present baseline data on key outcomes, including weight status prevalence among students, and distributions of secondary behavioral outcomes.

Specifically, the intervention materials needed to address specific socioeconomic, home environment, and cultural issues that could potentially influence dietary and PA behaviors of the participants. In addition to tailoring the interventions to our population, all study materials needed to be available in both English and Spanish and during data collection, there was a need for bilingual trained data collection staff.</p><p>In order to increase potential for adoption of the interventions upon completion of the study, the interventions were implemented using existing Texas AgriLife Extension resources. For example, county-based AgriLife Extension agents and trained Extension volunteers assisted with the building of the gardens and vegetable exposure activities. Trained AgriLife Extension educators and volunteers supported garden installation and maintenance and food exposures in participating school districts. Using the existing national Extension network increases the possibility of expanding implementation of the interventions across the state and nation.</p><p>While this study was ambitious, it has notable limitations. The nature of the intervention constrained us to randomize conditions at the school-level. With 28 schools, it was not possible to achieve perfect balance of all covariates across conditions. To limit the possibility of unobserved confounding resulting from such imbalance, we collected data on a large variety of parent and student covariates. Another limitation is the young age of the study population. The availability and scope of empirically tested measures suitable for the reading and comprehension skills of third-grade children is low; hence, we were limited to using very simple measures of behaviors to ensure validity in response. However, BMI, our primary outcome, is objectively measured. Related to the young age of our target population is the limitation that our evaluation measures did not include all the relevant SCT constructs, even though SCT was used to develop the strategies included in the interventions. Although we measured some SCT constructs (please note that in this paper we only mention our main outcome variables; additional variables were included in the instruments), because of the need to limit the number of items on the surveys, we were unable to include all SCT constructs which were targeted through the strategies. Despite these limitations, this is an important study, examining the impact of scalable school-based programs on healthy eating and PA on children at an age when such programs are acceptable and feasible. The study&#x02019;s design, a factorial group RCT with 4 different groups, enhances the internal validity of the study. In addition, the relatively large and diverse sample will contribute to the generalizability of the results of this study. Lastly, the inclusion of existing networks for implementation will enhance the potential of dissemination of the TGEG interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The TGEG study is an on-going study assessing the independent and combined impact of gardening, nutrition and PA intervention(s) on the prevalence of healthy eating and PA behaviors and weight status among low-income 3rd grade students and parents. Compared to other school-based interventions, the TGEG study is distinguished by its factorial RCT study design, its large sample size, the high percentage of Hispanic participants and low-socio-economic status study population (a population at particular high risk for obesity), its inclusion of both nutrition and PA as targeted behaviors, and its ecological approach to changing the school environment to support healthy outcomes. Additional data collections have been completed and are being analyzed on dimensions related to program implementation variation. Findings to date relate to the feasibility and challenges of the intervention, as well as provide information on the demographics, diet and activity behaviors, and weight status of 3<sup>rd</sup> grade children from an ethnically diverse, low-income population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CATCH, Coordinated Approach to Child Health; CSH, Coordinated School Health; F&#x00026;V, Fruit and vegetables; LGEG, Learn, Grow, Eat &#x00026; Go!; PA, Physical Activity; RCT, Randomized Control Trial; SCT, Social Cognitive Theory; SSB, Sugar Sweetened Beverages; TGEG, Texas Grow Eat Go!; WAT, Walk across Texas.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Texas GROW!
