About 95% of these patients suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Besides life-style changes, conventional diabetes therapy relies mainly on long-term pharmacological treatment. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, most patients eventually require insulin therapy [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Initially mainly performed for weight loss, bariatric surgery remarkably leads to an improvement and even remission of T2DM before significant weight loss has occurred [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In light of this potential, indications for classical obesity surgery are expanded and new techniques implemented, although sufficient animal research is not available at present. The Diabetes Surgery Summit Consensus Conference (New York, 2008) strongly urges more research in this area with emphasis on efforts to advance pathophysiological understanding [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The current hypotheses of T2DM remission after obesity surgery are based on the foregut and hindgut theories. According to the hindgut hypothesis, fast delivery of nutrients to the terminal ileum leads to the secretion of incretins [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Today, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) are thought to be the pathophysiologically relevant incretins in this context [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Glucagon-like peptide 1 is known to stimulate insulin release from pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells and inhibit secretion of glucagon from &#x003b1;-cells. Glucagon-like peptide 1 further improves peripheral insulin sensitivity and promotes &#x003b2;-cell proliferation [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Peptide YY lowers gastric and small intestinal motility, resulting in a longer mouth-to-caecum transit time. Peptide YY 3-36 further suppresses appetite and promotes weight loss [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The foregut hypothesis, claiming that bypassing the first part of the intestine will lead to reduced secretion of anti-incretins, is pathophysiologically less well characterized to date.</p><p>Initially designed as weight loss surgery, an ileal transposition (IT) was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats by Koopmans <italic>et al</italic>. after having observed notably reduced food intake after jejunal-ileal bypass [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The operation physiologically evokes hormonal alterations due to stimulation of enteroendocrine GLP-1 and PYY-secreting L-cells, which are located at a higher concentration in the terminal ileum [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Aim</title><p>As the development of the IT operation progresses, the operative technique needs to be more clearly defined.

The aim of the current study was to establish a long segment IT (distal 50% of the ileum, approx. 20 cm) in the diabetic obese Zucker rat, investigating body weight, glucose control and changes in GLP-1 and PYY secretion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0003"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S20004"><title>Diets and animals</title><p>Eleven to twelve-week old male diabetic obese Zucker rats (Crl:ZUC-<italic>Lepr</italic>

Anaesthesia was induced and maintained using isoflurane 2% (Abbott GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Wiesbaden, Germany) and oxygen flow at 2 l/min under spontaneous breathing. After a midline incision of 4-5 cm to gain abdominal access, the total length of the small intestine was determined (86.1 &#x000b1;6.47 cm, <italic>n</italic> = 20). Thereafter, Bauhin's valve was identified and the first transection was conducted approximately 5 cm orally. To account for interindividual differences, the length of the transposed segment was defined as one-quarter of the total length of the small intestine (&#x0223c; distal 50% of ileum). Therefore, the second division of the ileum was performed 20 cm (21.5 &#x000b1;1.6 cm, <italic>n</italic> = 20) orally to the first transection. All anastomoses were performed as interrupted end-to-end extramucosal anastomoses using Prolene 6/0 (Ethicon), as described earlier by our research group [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>For IT, the first anastomosis was subsequently formed as an end-to-end ileoileostomy in order to restore ileal continuity, excluding the transposed segment.

Postoperative analgesia was ensured via subcutaneous carprofen (Rimadyl, Pfizer, Switzerland) injection (4 mg/kg) at the beginning of the operation. Animals were fasted on day 1 after the operation with free access to tap water. Oral food was continuously increased to free access until day 6 (3, 6, 10, 15 g rat chow on day 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively) [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S20007"><title>Oral glucose tolerance test and blood collection from tail vein</title><p>In total, four OGTTs were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).

Subsequently, a mixture of a biotinylated specific GLP-1 antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated GLP-1 antibody was added to form a &#x0201c;Streptavidin&#x02013;Biotin-Antibody&#x02013;GLP-1(7-36)&#x02013;HRP-conjugated-antibody&#x0201d; immunocomplex after incubation. For detection, each well was incubated with a substrate solution and measured in a microplate reader. For PYY (3-36), goat anti-rabbit IgG-coated microplates were used (DRG Instruments GmbH, Marburg, Germany). Determination was based on a competitive immunoreaction between sample PYY and biotinylated mouse PYY with a specific PYY (3-36) rabbit anti-mouse antibody. Detection was based on HRP substrate reaction. High-range rat insulin ELISA was a solid phase two-site enzyme immunoassay using HRP reaction for detection (DRG Instruments GmbH, Marburg, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="S20009"><title>Final blood collection from the aorta and portal vein</title><p>Blood sampling from the aorta and portal vein (PV) was conducted at 21 days post surgery.

Widely accepted, IT overall leads to an amelioration of glucose control based on enteroendocrine hormone stimulation [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Inter-study comparison of single effects of IT is, however, limited since the study design varies considerably and the postoperative time-point of data sampling is particularly relevant due to rapid incretin secretion changes within the first postoperative months. In this respect, Wang <italic>et al</italic>. noted a continuous increase of fasting GLP-1 levels after IT over a time period of 6 months [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the current study, a long segment transposition was performed with analysis concentrating on immediate postoperative changes.</p><p>In University of California at Davis type 2 diabetes mellitus (UCD-T2DM) rats Cummings <italic>et al</italic>. found a 3-fold increase in stimulated GLP-1 and PYY secretion 1 and 3.5 months after surgery. Furthermore, fasting PYY levels were elevated 8-fold in IT animals [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although a quantitative rise in GLP-1 secretion is well established for most animal models, Patriti <italic>et al</italic>. could not record a such a change in glucose-stimulated GLP-1 secretion following IT in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, demonstrating a more prolonged GLP-1 response to oral glucose than in sham-operated animals [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Culnan <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a similar experiment in Zucker rats comparing a short (10 cm) IT group with sham-operated animals over an 8-week observation period. Analysing incretins in postoperative week 7, GLP-1 plasma levels were elevated 3-4 fold in this model. After long segment IT, GLP-1 secretion was already elevated 3-fold 2 weeks after transposition. Therefore, the changes in GLP-1 serum levels reported by Culnan <italic>et al</italic>. were reached 5 weeks earlier, indicating a benefit for long segment IT [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Simultaneous analysis of GLP-1 in aorta and portal vein indicate a partly elevated enteric GLP-1 secretion for fasted animals also. This effect, however, is counterbalanced due to the large first-pass effect known for GLP-1, leading to equal peripheral GLP-1 levels in the fasting state [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Accordingly, fasting glucose levels remained unchanged in IT and sham animals.</p><p>In contrast to GLP-1, fasting PYY levels were also elevated after long segment IT, and glucose could not further increase PYY secretion. Taking into account that GLP-1 and PYY are co-localized in over 80% of L-cell granules, it seems plausible that the mechanism of secretion is similar [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Possibly a change in granule composition occurs after IT, indicating alternate regulations of PYY and GLP-1. Cummings <italic>et al</italic>. noted significantly elevated PYY mRNA expression in the transposed segment, whereas proglucagon mRNA, a precursor of GLP-1, remained unchanged, indicating PYY regulation at an earlier level [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Studies show consistent amelioration of glucose control following IT as a result of increased incretin production, yet the quantity of changes reported again varies considerably. Cummings <italic>et al</italic>. note only a moderate reduction in AUC of 17%, performing an OGTT 1 month after IT [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For GK rats, Patriti <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a significant decrease of the AUC compared to sham animals 45 days postoperatively. The fact that glucose control was still equal for IT and sham animals 30 days postoperatively in the same study again indicates that the effect of IT increases in the first postoperative months [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the parallel trial examining Zucker rats, Culnan <italic>et al</italic>. revealed a 60% reduction of the AUC after OGTT in IT animals 7 weeks postoperatively [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Long segment IT led to amelioration of glucose control as early as 2 weeks postoperatively. Restrictively, improvement of glucose control was noted only compared to preoperative measurements. Blood collection from the tail vein led to largely altered, yet reproducible glucose curves. Although blood sampling was performed under general anaesthesia, this effect was most likely due to operative stress resulting from the venesection. Certainly, blood collection and OGTTs should be conducted separately in future trials in order to exclude this confounder.</p><p>Insulin levels were determined in IT and sham animals as a direct mediator of glucose control. Interestingly, previous analysis of insulin and insulin action in diabetic animals revealed that the GLP-1 effect after IT mostly relies on improved peripheral insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although GLP-1 is known to directly stimulate insulin secretion, insulin levels remained unchanged or even decreased after IT, as previously demonstrated for Zucker rats [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In our model, transposed animals presented with a 20-30% reduction of insulin secretion compared only to preoperative controls. Apparently, operative trauma and postoperative food restriction still exert a large effect on glucose control during this short observation period. Sham animals hence also presented with partly improved glucose tolerance, therefore diminishing statistical significance when comparing insulin and glucose parameters between sham and IT animals in this early postoperative time frame.</p><p>Weight change after IT remains controversial. Initially, IT was considered to achieve similar effects to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More recent IT studies in different rodent models, however, consistently reveal no impact of IT on body weight [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our data suggest an impaired weight regain for IT animals in the immediate postoperative period. However, weight curves overall proceed virtually in parallel, thus calling a major impact of IT on body weight into question. The IT group's impaired capacity to regain body weight after surgical trauma seems plausible, since fat resorption is limited after IT due to a truncated enterohepatic cycle, and PYY is known to suppress appetite [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, long segment IT could be established in Zucker rats. Quantitatively large increases in GLP-1 and PYY secretion were detected early after the operation, consequently leading to rapid glucose control. Changes in GLP-1 secretion and glucose control were similar to Culnan's analysis in Zucker rats, but were detected considerably earlier. It remains to be determined whether adaptive alterations, as suggested by Wang <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], lead to an additional increase in incretin production in our model, thus clearly demonstrating a superiority of the long segment transposition. Interesting questions regarding the adaptive capacities of the transposed segment as well as pathophysiological changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity remain. Certainly, considerable research is essential before we will be able to safely perform an isolated ileal transposition in humans, since it proves to be a complex metabolic operation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Olivia Sick and Silke Hempel for assistance in statistics and ELISA measurements.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Sicree</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmet</surname><given-names>PZ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2010 and 2030</article-title><source>Diabetes Res Clin Pract</source><year>2010</year><volume>87</volume><fpage>4</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19896746</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>National diabetes information clearing house (ndic) national diabetes statistics</collab><year>2007</year><comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetesniddknihgov/DM/PUBS/statistics/">http://diabetesniddknihgov/DM/PUBS/statistics/</ext-link></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Campos</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treating the whole patient for optimal management of type 2 diabetes: considerations for insulin therapy</article-title><source>South Med J</source><year>2007</year><volume>100</volume><fpage>804</fpage><lpage>11</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17713307</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0004"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thaler</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Cummings</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Minireview: hormonal and metabolic mechanisms of diabetes remission after gastrointestinal surgery</article-title><source>Endocrinology</source><year>2009</year><volume>150</volume><fpage>2518</fpage><lpage>25</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19372197</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0005"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rubino</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Schauer</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name><name><surname>Cummings</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The diabetes surgery summit consensus conference: recommendations for the evaluation and use of gastrointestinal surgery to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus</article-title><source>Ann Surg</source><year>2010</year><volume>251</volume><fpage>399</fpage><lpage>405</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19934752</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0006"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rubino</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Gagner</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Potential of surgery for curing type 2 diabetes mellitus</article-title><source>Ann Surg</source><year>2002</year><volume>236</volume><fpage>554</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12409659</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0007"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nauck</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Unraveling the science of incretin biology</article-title><source>Eur J Intern Med</source><year>2009</year><volume>20</volume><issue>Suppl 2</issue><fpage>S303</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19580949</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0008"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ballantyne</surname><given-names>GH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Peptide yy(1-36) and peptide yy(3-36): Part I.
