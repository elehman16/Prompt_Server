Twenty-three players from two teams in the Under Fifteen Basketball Excellence category participated in the study. Participants were divided into two training groups: balance training (BAL, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11) and isotonic training (ISO, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12).

All of the tests were performed in sustained bipodalic and monopodalic (both right and left) positions. The results showed that players who participated in balance training for 12&#x000a0;weeks, compared to players who trained with isotonic machines, exhibited a significantly increase in balance (bipodalic 28.3&#x000a0;%; right 41.4&#x000a0;%; left 45.8&#x000a0;%; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) and muscular power (bipodalic 8.1&#x000a0;%; right 13.5&#x000a0;%; left 12.5&#x000a0;%; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) as measured through a vertical jump.

From the literature, an evidence-based relationship between balance ability and the risk of injury is clear. In fact, studies have demonstrated that systematic training in a balance training program would be effective in reducing the risk of injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It was observed that when balance training was implemented during competitive season, the occurrence of injury rate was reduced by 38&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>However, the link between balance ability and athletic performance is not fully clear and required further evidence. There are, in fact, very few studies that specifically investigated balance training as approach to improving performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Because of growing scientific knowledge, the role of neuromuscular training has become better known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, it has been used in combination with balance training in different sports, such as basketball, soccer and gymnastics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Balance can be defined as the ability to maintain the body&#x02019;s centre of gravity over the base of support and results from neuromuscular actions in response to continuous visual, vestibular and somato-sensory feedback.</p><p>In recent years, balance training has become a very popular addition to more standard athletic training programme in many sports. Basketball, for example, requires the players to habitually address physical contact and various situations involving balance instability, such as basketball-specific accelerations and decelerations, changes in direction, penetrations into the defensive perimeter, boxing out, dribbling and defence position recovery. These actions are often performed in a very limited space and require very fast movement, high coordination ability and appropriate strength.</p><p>Disequilibrium can be found in every specific movement of basketball, such as in the twisting movement of feet (particularly the pivot foot), jump shots as well as offensive and defensive rebounds. Hence, further investigation of the most suitable balance training protocols for basketball is warranted.</p><p>In basketball, the standard strength takes a leading role in training; strength training allows players to improve their physical abilities and athletic performance and, therefore, their outcomes during games and to prevent injuries.</p><p>In particular, the vertical jump is one of the most frequently repeated actions. Among vertical jumps, the countermovement jump (CMJ) is skill in basketball, and it is also the technique most frequently used as an evaluation test of the physical condition of the lower limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>It is important to note that several studies have demonstrated that balance training can be used to improve performance related to postural control as well as to improve physical and athletic activities such as the time on the ball, the shuttle run and the vertical jump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A neuromuscular training program that is focused on core stability, specifically the lower extremity strength, would affect the performance of an athlete in the Star Excursion Balance Test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A study on collegiate women athletes showed that 10&#x000a0;min of unstable surface training 4&#x000a0;days a week would improve the single-leg squat and the 1-min sit-up test performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Further studies compared the effects of balance training to other strength training methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Among them, the effect of plyometric training on muscular power, strength, balance and landing force has been compared to the effect of balance training, suggesting that both plyomentric and balance training increase neuromuscular power and control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which included athletes of different sports, balance training was demonstrated to reduce muscular strength imbalances between the legs and to be effective for gaining muscular strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effect of 12&#x000a0;weeks of balance training to 12&#x000a0;weeks of traditional strength training using leg press and leg extension isotonic machines in young basketball players. To do so, this study evaluated the training-induced effects on balance and vertical jump outcomes, which is a basketball-specific action.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>In the present study, a longitudinal, parallel and controlled design was used.

At the end of each specific training intervention, post-testing occurred 12&#x000a0;weeks after pre-testing. In post-testing, the same procedures and sequences were used as in the pre-testing.</p><p>After a revision of the test protocols and the survey procedures, subjects participated in a standard warm-up consisting of 5&#x000a0;min of jogging at a comfortable speed followed by 2&#x000a0;min of static stretching of the lower extremity muscles. This warm-up procedure was selected to avoid any variation in the usual warm-up of the players. A balance test was performed first, while the countermovement jump test was performed after. Sustained bipodalic and monopodalic (both left and right) positions were evaluated.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Balance test</title><p>Balance ability was evaluated through the balance test using the Libra board (Easytech, Prato, Italy). This instrument (42&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;42&#x000a0;cm, weight 2.7&#x000a0;kg) consists of a balancing board with a wide antislip area. A Libra board is connected to a personal computer, and balance ability can be assessed with appropriate software (Libra software, version 2.2). The wide support area of the Libra board consists of three&#x000a0;interchangeable&#x000a0;plugs, making it possible to have different degrees of structural difficulty (40&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;high; 24&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderate; 12&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;easy). Subjects were asked to fixate on a point on the wall, in the eye plane, at a distance of 3&#x000a0;m. A moderate degree of difficulty was set, with the board plug placed at 24&#x000a0;cm.</p><p>The balance test was performed using the Libra board on the lateral plane in three stance positions, including bipodalic and monopodalic (both left and right) positions. Three trials per position were executed, with each position held for 30&#x000a0;s and a rest of 30&#x000a0;s between successive trials. The mean result of the three trials was used as the test outcome. The Libra board software returns the outcomes in arbitrary units. The scores range between 0 and 100, and the better results are closer to 0. The same instrument and the same protocol have been used in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Countermovement jump test</title><p>The muscular power of the lower limbs was assessed using Bosco&#x02019;s procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], specifically the countermovement jump test (CMJ) with a free arm-swing, which is performed under three different conditions, namely, bipodalic and monopodalic (both left and right) positions. Subjects started from an upright standing position, and they were instructed to flex their knees (approximately at 90&#x000b0;) as quickly as possible and then to perform a vertical jump as high as possible, with a free arm-swing. The test was performed using the Optojump system (Microgate, Bolzano, Italy), an optical infrared validated device that can assess the height of a vertical jump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

This scenario ensured that all of the participants started the specific training protocols of the study in equal physical and athletic conditions.</p><p>The significant improvements that the BAL group achieved in the vertical jump (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) emphasise a higher muscular strength outcome than at pre-testing, as expressed in natural actions such as jumps. That could depend on improvement in the intra- and inter-muscular coordination of the knee extensors.</p><p>The findings of our study agree with other similar studies. In fact, significant improvements in the vertical jump abilities have been found in similar studies on balance training. Kean et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], Myer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and Taube et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] examined recreationally active females, young females practicing different sports and winter sports athletes, respectively, and all three of these studies obtained the same results with respect to jump abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the main difference between the aforementioned and our investigation involves the period during which these studies were performed. In Taube et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], balance training was performed at the beginning of the pre-season training, whereas in Myer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it was performed during an off-season period.</p><p>Thus, some of the differences between our and previous studies may be given to the study&#x02019;s particular period of implementation, the sport and the participants.</p><p>Compared to the BAL group, the ISO group did not show a significant improvement in the vertical jump (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). In contrast to our results, Heitkamp et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] found some muscular strength improvement in two groups that underwent, respectively, balance training and strength training with leg curl and leg press machines. However, in that study, muscular strength was evaluated on the Cybex Norm Isometric System to derive the isometric maximum strength; whereas in our study, the height of the vertical jump was evaluated. Therefore, these differences could result from the fact that the actions performed on the Cybex would be similar to the actions performed on isotonic machines. This represents a different scenario from the vertical jump because of the reuse of the elastic component that occurs in the specific action.</p><p>Referring to balance ability, the BAL group showed a significant improvement (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) in the sustained bipodalic and monopodalic positions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).</p><p>These results are in accordance with the findings of several other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Thus given the young age of our subjects, balance training appears to be a notable method for improving the vertical jump.</p><p>The most interesting and unexpected results concern the significant improvement (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) that the ISO group attained in the left leg monopodalic balance test (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). We can speculate that this difference may result from the fact that players used the left foot for takeoff as the preferred foot in layups. The repetition of this action under unstable conditions, as usually happens in the challenges during the match, might have generated some proprioceptive mechanisms, inducing the ISO group to improve only its left leg balance ability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study show that performing 30&#x000a0;min of balance training twice a week for 12&#x000a0;weeks induces a significant improvement in balance and vertical jump scores, both in sustained bipodalic and in monopodalic positions. For this reason, aside from being a valid training method to prevent basketball injuries, balance training using unstable boards is an effective training method for improving balance and the vertical jump, which is a basketball-specific action that frequently occurs in that sport. This may especially be the case when balance training is performed by young amateur athletes. This scenario is a very inexpensive and efficacious training method that every basketball coach should consider.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hubscher</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Zech</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfeifer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansel</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Vogt</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Banzer</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neuromuscular training for sports injury prevention: a systematic review</article-title><source>Med Sci Sports Exerc</source><year>2010</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>413</fpage><lpage>421</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19952811</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zech</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hubscher</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Vogt</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Banzer</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansel</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfeifer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neuromuscular training for rehabilitation of sports injuries: a systematic review</article-title><source>Med Sci Sports Exerc</source><year>2009</year><volume>41</volume><fpage>1831</fpage><lpage>1841</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181a3cf0d</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19727032</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McGuine</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><name><surname>Keene</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of a balance training program on the risk of ankle sprains in high school athletes</article-title><source>Am J Sports Med</source><year>2006</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>1103</fpage><lpage>1111</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1177/0363546505284191</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16476915</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Hrysomallis C (2011) Balance ability and athletic performance.
