Our target in this study that performed in interventional method is an evaluation of sufentanil and paracetamol effect on postoperative pain control in patients undergone craniotomy surgery at Urmia Imam Khomeini Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Totally, 45 patients between the ages 18 and 65 were studied. The effect of sufentanil and paracetamol medicines in pain management, hemodynamic stability, and side effects compared with control group that were receiving morphine (subcutaneous [SC]) in 3 groups of 15 people at time 0, 2, 4, 12 and 24-h were evaluated.

Evaluations show these patients suffer from moderate to severe pain due to inadequate analgesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Sedation and analgesia are used for patient especially when mechanical ventilation is applied. Certain diseases, surgery, trauma, invasive monitoring, intubation and nursing interventions are only a part of the disturbing factors for patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In addition to the distressing issues mentioned above, inadequate treatment of pain can lead to stressful responses such as tachycardia, increased body oxygen consumption, increased coagulability property, suppression of the immune response, increased metabolic rate and internal activity of catecholamines.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Analgesia and inadequate sedation increase intracranial pressure (ICP), high blood pressure, restlessness, and vomiting that may increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage or other neurological complications.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>According to several studies, there is frequency dispersion in methods of pain control in these patients. Opioids relieve this pain well but may result in respiratory depression and hypercapnic leading to cerebrovascular vasodilatation and increased ICP. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are alternative to opioids but may lead to cerebral hemorrhage due to interfere with platelet function.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The method of craniotomy and pain control should be selected in such a way that maintains patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) with a minimum of interference and neurologic examination as it is possible.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Despite analgesic effects, opioids have side effects such as retentive neurologic symptoms, increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub> due to hypoventilation followed by ICP increase, nausea, and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Controlling pain and anxiety in these patients reduces ICP, hemodynamic changes and the incidence of nausea and vomiting, which reduces the risk of cerebral hemorrhage and neurologic complications.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] For detection and characterization of pain, patients should be constantly evaluated. One of the acceptable methods for pain assessment in ICU and is based on the patient's own statements. In addition to recording vital signs, information about pain, its location, quality and intensity of pain should be recorded and evaluated. Pain evaluation can be done through visual analog scale (VAS).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In this study, it is attempted to propose medicine and method for pain control in these patients, which controls the pain and anxiety of the patients and has minimum side effects such as changes in blood pressure, heart rate (HR), ICP, consciousness level, nausea, and vomiting; and neurologic examination is also possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was done as intervention and target population included patients undergoing craniotomy surgery in Imam Khomeini Hospital in Urmia.

Premedication in all patients was done as follows: With 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, 3 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl, anesthetic induction 2 mg/kg propofol, 0.5 mg/kg atracurium and 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine.

Nair and Rajshekha conducted a study on 43 patients with GCS 15 and age above 16 years who undergone craniotomy and were accepted in ICU. Oral paracetamol was administered for postoperative analgesia that developed suitable analgesia in only 26% of patients. Remaining patients complained of moderate to severe pain.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In our study, paracetamol (IV) had the poorest quality of pain control. In the study by Rahimi <italic>et al</italic>., 27 patients were divided into two groups of 13 and 14 members. First group received only narcotic, while the second group also benefited from cyclooxygenase-2. Second group used less narcotics compared to the first group, and the first group received more narcotics and experienced more VAS and had longer hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In our study, paracetamol alone is not adequate for pain control, while using narcotic improved quality of pain control that is consistent with the findings in this study. Verch&#x000e8;re <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study on 64 patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In the mentioned study, 8 patients were assigned in the paracetamol group, which received 30 mg/kg paracetamol 1 h before anesthesia and then every 6 h. The other group including 29 patients received paracetamol and tramadol. This group received 1.5 mg/kg tramadol before operation ends. Third group received paracetamol with nalbuphine. VAS was controlled in times of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24-h. Analgesia was inadequate in the group receiving only paracetamol,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] findings in the current work showed that it was no sufficient to use only paracetamol for pain control.</p><p>Findings in the current work show sufentanil, with maintaining optimal hemodynamics and analgesia with effects of sedation and lack of respiratory status drop and GCS of patients, can be a suitable drug for pain control after craniotomy operation. Results suggest a significant difference in VAS among the groups. Paracetamol group had the highest VAS. O<sub>2</sub> Sat reduction was not observed among the groups. Only in 5 patients O<sub>2</sub> Sat 90% was observed. Comparing HR, there was a significant and highest amount seen in the paracetamol group. Most percent of nausea and vomiting was seen in the morphine group. Lowest rate of nausea and vomiting was observed in the paracetamol group. GCS change between the groups was not significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Results of the current work showed sufentanil compared to morphine (which is routinely used for controlling pain after craniotomy operation) has better pain control, lower vomiting and nausea, and better hemodynamic stability. Although paracetamol has the lowest rate of vomiting and nausea, it has lowest pain control quality and the highest rate of using adjuvant drugs, which is not recommended for pain control after Craniotomy operation. Thus, sufentanil, with maintaining optimal hemodynamics and analgesia with effects of sedation and lack of respiratory status drop and GCS of patients, can be suitable drug for pain control after craniotomy operation and it is recommended to be investigated further.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cottrell</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Yong</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postoperative and intensive care including head injury and multisystem sequelae.
