Daily blood pressure variations, calculated from ambulatory blood pressure recordings, are increasingly being considered as significant contributors to such end organ damage and cardiovascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Frattola et al 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kikuya et al 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Parati 2005</xref>).</p><p>In a study of 1542 subjects, a significant linear relation was noted between cardiovascular mortality risk and daytime systolic blood pressure (SBP) variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kikuya et al 2000</xref>). In addition, in several studies, 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements were more sensitive predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than conventional office BP measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Ohkubo et al 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Verdecchia et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Staessen et al 1999</xref>). Thus, regression of LVH, which has been associated with improved cardiovascular prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Anon. 2004</xref>), may be more closely correlated with reductions in ambulatory BP than with reductions in office blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Omboni et al 1998</xref>).</p><p>The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is implicated in the development of hypertension and LVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Matsumura et al 2006</xref>). Consistent with this understanding, meta-analyses have found that RAAS inhibitors are more effective than other types of treatment in reducing left ventricular mass (LVM) ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Schmieder et al 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Klingbeil et al 2003</xref>). As diuretics have been shown to reduce ventricular diameter and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to reduce wall thickness, an ACE inhibitor combined with a diuretic may be more effective than an ACE inhibitor alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 1992</xref>). Indeed, first-line combination perindopril/indapamide has been shown in the 52-week PICXEL study to be more effective in reducing LVM and office BP in patients with LVH than treatment with ACE inhibitor monotherapy enalapril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Perindopril/indapamide treatment has also been shown to reduce 24-hour ambulatory BP and smooth BP profiles in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mallion et al 2004</xref>). Consequently, to investigate further the effect of perindopril/indapamide on 24-hour BP variations in patients with LVH and to assess further the differences between first-line combination therapy perindopril/indapamide and monotherapy enalapril, ambulatory BP was monitored in a subset of patients enrolled in the PICXEL study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is an ancillary study of the previously published, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, PICXEL study performed from June 1999 to March 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gosse et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 2005</xref>). This analysis will focus on materials and methods pertinent to this substudy, which was prospectively designed to measure ambulatory BP.</p><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>Patients enrolled in the PICXEL study (n = 679) were given the option to participate concomitantly in this ancillary study. No additional or specific entry criteria were specified. The main inclusion criteria for PICXEL were essential systolic and diastolic or isolated systolic hypertension (140 mmHg &#x02264; sitting SBP &#x0003c;210 mmHG) and LVM index ([LVMI] &#x0003e;120 g/m<sup>2</sup> for men and &#x0003e;100 g/m<sup>2</sup> for women). The main exclusion criteria were severe hypertension (diastolic BP [DBP] &#x02265;115 mmHg and/or SBP &#x02265;210 mmHg), and secondary or complicated hypertension (with the exception of LVH).</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>As in PICXEL, after a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients received either combination perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg or enalapril 10 mg once a day for 52 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gosse et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 2005</xref>). Dose adjustments to combination perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg or enalapril 20 mg and then to combination perindopril 8 mg/indapamide 2.5 mg or enalapril 40 mg were requested if BP was not controlled. Adjustments were based on office BP measurements and specific predefined criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gosse et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 2005</xref>). Adjustments took place at office visits at weeks 6, 12, 24, and 36. Treatment compliance was assessed during the double-blind treatment period by counting returned unused capsules.</p></sec><sec><title>Ambulatory BP</title><p>Patients were fitted between 8 AM and 11 AM with a non-invasive automated blood pressure recorder at baseline (week 0), week 24, and study end (week 52). Use of a recorder that met the validation requirements of the British Hypertension Society and/or American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation was recommended. Drug intake took place within 30 minutes after fitting. Recordings were performed every 15 minutes during the daytime (7 AM to 10 PM), every 30 min during the night-time (10 PM to 7 AM), and for at least 25 hours.</p><p>To ensure data quality, all ambulatory BP recordings were blindly reviewed by a central ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) committee. The prospectively established validation criteria were: ambulatory BP needed to have been recorded for &#x02265;25 hours after dosing; &#x02265;75% of each recording was eligible for analysis; no two consecutive hourly average blood pressure values were missing; both 2nd to 8th and 23rd to 24th averages were present; &#x02265;2 valid measurements per hour over the daytime period and 1 per hour in the night-time period were available; a baseline recording and at least 1 post-baseline recording was available. The following artifacts were systematically excluded: any DBP &#x0003e; SBP; SBP &#x0003c;60 mmHg; SBP &#x0003e;250 mmHg; DBP &#x0003c;40 mmHg; DBP &#x0003e;150 mmHg; a blood pressure differential (SBP &#x02013; DBP) &#x0003c;10 mmHg with a SBP &#x0003e;110 mmHg. Non-valid recordings could be repeated within a week.</p><p>Daytime, night-time, and 24-hour means were calculated for ambulatory SBP, DBP, and PP. Pulse pressure was defined as SBP &#x02013; DBP. Two-hourly means, global trough/peak ratio, and global smoothness index were also calculated. The trough (minimum treatment effect/highest BP) was defined as the 12th 2-hourly mean (just before the next dose). The peak (maximum treatment effect/lowest BP) was defined as the lowest reading from the 2nd to the 5th 2-hourly mean. The smoothness index was defined as the mean of the hourly mean changes from baseline to study end divided by its standard deviation.</p></sec><sec><title>Other variables</title><p>Echocardiography was performed at week &#x02212;4, week 0, week 24, and week 52 (Wend). Patients were examined in the left lateral supine position after 15 minutes of rest. Left ventricular mass, end-diastolic left ventricular internal diameter (LVIDd), end-diastolic left ventricular posterior wall thickness (PWTd), and end-diastolic interventricular septal wall thickness (IVSTd) were measured. Echocardiograms were read by the Central Echocardiography Committee using a I&#x000f4; 3.2 unit (I&#x000f4;DP, Paris, France). Data presented are the results from the final central blinded reading.</p><p>Office SBP and DBP were measured by mercury sphygmomanometer at each visit according to the European Society of Hypertension guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>The safety assessment was based on the incidence of adverse events among all the patients participating in the PICXEL study.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>This ancillary study was exploratory; no sample size estimate was performed.

Effects of treatment with perindopril/indapamide vs enalapril on ambulatory parameters and sphygmomanometer BPs were compared using an analysis of covariance (&#x003b1; = 2.5% with a 95% confidence interval [CI]). Analyses were adjusted for the baseline value and used the last observation post-baseline. The significance of the changes from baseline in ambulatory parameters and sphygmomanometer BPs was tested in each group, without adjustment, using the last observation post-baseline and a one tailed Student&#x02019;s t-test for dependent samples (&#x003b1; = 2.5% with a 95% CI).</p><p>The between-group differences perindopril/indapamide vs enalapril on LVMI were compared after adjustment for baseline value and gender using an analysis of covariance (&#x003b1; = 5% with a 95% CI).

Complementary analyses were performed to assess between-group differences in LVMI at baseline (using a two-sided Student&#x02019;s t-test; &#x003b1; = 5%) and to compare dose increases between groups (using a Chi-square test).</p><p>The multiple linear regression was performed using a stepwise selection method.</p><p>The statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 8.2 and Statgraphics version 5.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and revised in Somerset West in 1996 and in Edinburgh in 2000.

The efficacy population of 127 subjects was defined as all randomized patients who took as least one dose of studied treatment with a valid ABPM at M0 performed before M0 visit and at least one valid ABPM post-baseline. The efficacy population was made up of 65 perindopril/indapamide-treated patients and 62 enalapril-treated patients. Study groups were well balanced in terms of demographics and baseline characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Patients were on average 55 &#x000b1; 9 years of age; 11% presented with a complication other than LVH such as retinopathy or hypertensive encephalopathy, 68% had a family history of hypertension; and most patients (88.2%) had received at least one previous treatment for hypertension. No clinically relevant differences were observed between groups for baseline office and ambulatory BP measurements and for baseline LVMI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). There were significant relationships between baseline LVMI and ambulatory SBP, DBP, and PP (correlation coefficients from 0.20 to 0.30, p &#x0003c; 0.05). Relationships between baseline LVMI and office SBP and PP were non-significant (correlation coefficients less than 0.12, NS) and significant only for office DBP (correlation coefficient 0.20, p &#x0003c; 0.05). Multiple linear regression shows that factors with an impact on baseline LVMI are sex (p &#x0003c; 0.0001), nocturnal mean SBP (p = 0.0018) and BMI (p = 0.1190) (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.23, p &#x0003c; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographics, baseline blood pressure measurements<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">a</xref> and echocardiographic parameters<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-2">b</xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perindopril/indapamide<break/>n = 65</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Enalapril<break/>n = 62</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Demographics</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">&#x02003;Age, years</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55 &#x000b1;

These data, which were, overall, consistent with those recorded in the ambulatory BP REASON substudy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mallion et al 2004</xref>), suggest that perindopril/indapamide has a sustained, antihypertensive effect that attenuates blood pressure over a full 24 hours. In addition, the data suggesting a decrease in LVH, as measured by LVMI, are consistent with those recorded in the main PICXEL and in the REASON echocardiography study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">De Luca et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Twenty-four-hour monitoring provides a snapshot of the effect of treatment on BP variations over the course of a day. Several studies have suggested that these fluctuations contribute significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Frattola et al 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kikuya et al 2000</xref>). A treatment that reduces the difference between BP troughs and peaks is likely to improve cardiovascular outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Parati 2005</xref>). A high smoothness index (&#x02265;1), for example, has been correlated with positive changes in carotid artery wall thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Rizzoni et al 2001</xref>). Results of this study showed that perindopril/indapamide treatment reduced BP peaks and troughs and smoothed the BP curve (smoothness index &#x02265;5) compared with baseline. Although this study was not designed to assess cardiovascular outcomes, the decrease in LVMI suggests an improvement in cardiovascular health.</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that office and ambulatory PP and SBP are independent predictors of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Verdecchia et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Franklin et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Millar et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Staessen et al 1999</xref>). This understanding of hypertension together with the data presented here suggest that perindopril/indapamide, by its greater control of SBP and PP (ambulatory and office), may reduce cardiovascular risk more significantly than enalapril.</p><p>In this study, not only was first-line combination therapy with perindopril/indapamide more effective than monotherapy with enalapril, but fewer perindopril/indapamide-treated patients required dose increases. These data are consistent with the fact that monotherapies are often less effective than combination therapies in achieving BP control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dickerson et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hansson et al 1998</xref>). Enalapril, as monotherapy, does not target as many pathways and feedback mechanisms as ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination therapy with perindopril/indapamide. In comparative clinical trials, the combination perindopril/indapamide was more effective than atenolol, losartan, amlodipine, or enalapril monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chanudet and de Champvallins 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Mogensen et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">De Luca et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mallion et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Mourad et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this ancillary study, patients were comparably distributed among treatment groups and baseline characteristics were similar. The small variations noted between groups were neither statistically significant nor considered clinically relevant. The difference between the ambulatory and office BP measurements can be explained by the subjective nature and the observed bias of office measurements which tend to be higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bobrie et al 2005</xref>). Lastly, with the exception of LVMI, which was lower in this ancillary study, baseline characteristics were similar to those in the overall PICXEL study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Because the correlations between changes in ambulatory BP and in LVMI were significant in the enalapril group and non-significant in the perindopril/indapamide group, the effect of perindopril/indapamide on LVMI seems to be not only pressure dependent. Different mechanisms can be postulated to explain the changes relatively independent from BP reduction in the perindopril/indapamide group. These mechanisms include the LV functional and structural improvement with perindopril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Grandi et al 1995</xref>). Another mechanism involving indapamide has been discussed in the main PICXEL study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dahl&#x000f6;f et al 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data suggest that perindopril/indapamide has a sustained antihypertensive effect that decreases 24-hour and daytime SBP and PP as well as decreasing LVMI more effectively than enalapril.
