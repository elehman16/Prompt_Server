Naturally, successive publications with longer follow-up have larger numbers of deaths.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Despite these explanations, the allegations have persisted.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It also has been argued that the appropriate endpoint should be all-cause mortality, which is described as free from bias in cause of death ascertainment. The call for all-cause mortality ignores the fact that an intervention for a single cause of death cannot be expected to prevent death from all causes. It also either overlooks the sample size requirements to measure a statistically significant difference in all-cause deaths associated with a disease-specific intervention, or judges this not to be a problem. One commentator has argued that to evaluate breast screening using all-cause mortality, &#x02018;a trial of 1.2 million women would suffice&#x02019;, presumably (emphasis on &#x0201c;suffice&#x0201d;) regarding this as a readily achievable figure.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec5-0969141316631375"><title>Overdiagnosis</title><p>Overdiagnosis, of both invasive disease and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is increasingly cited as a serious risk associated with mammography screening programmes.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> While these programmes aim to detect breast cancer early, in order to reduce mortality and morbidity from breast cancer, it is argued that they cause significant harm by finding cancers that do not need to be found. Overdiagnosis is usually defined as the detection of cancers, through screening, that would never have developed symptoms, and therefore never would have been diagnosed or been a threat to life during the patient&#x02019;s life time, had she not participated in screening. It is argued that the diagnosis of non-progressive cancers results in unnecessary treatment and associated psychological effects that would not otherwise have been experienced in the absence of screening. Specifically in the Two-County Trial, G&#x000f8;tzsche claimed an overdiagnosis rate of 33%.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Theoretically, overdiagnosis could occur in one of several ways: when the preclinical, screen-detected cancer is progressive but the person dies prematurely of another cause before the time at which symptoms would have occurred; if the growth rate of a truly progressive cancer is not rapid enough to give rise to symptoms during the person&#x02019;s life time; if the cancer stops growing and becomes indolent for some reason; or due to regression of the cancer, as is claimed by some.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Of these four possibilities, it is challenging to measure the first three with confidence, and there is very little sound evidence of the fourth.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Overdiagnosed cancers are pathologically confirmed cases, that is, they exhibit all the features by which pathologists classify cancer. They are distinct from &#x0201c;false positives&#x0201d; which are suspicious lesions that are found not to be malignant after further investigation. There are currently no markers that can distinguish overdiagnosed cases from those which would have become symptomatic in a woman&#x02019;s life time. Hence it is not possible to directly observe overdiagnosis. In essence, overdiagnosis is an epidemiological concept related to the apparent excess in breast cancer incidence that occurs following screening.</p><p>Estimating the level of overdiagnosis is complex.

In particular, in the design of population-scale screening trials, practicability of different randomization strategies and dealing with issues of lead time are important issues. From early in the evolution of the Two-County Trial results, the issue of the potential influence of cluster randomization on outcomes has been taken seriously. It was observed in the first publication of the breast cancer mortality results that &#x02018;the excess variation resulting from randomization being at the community rather than the individual level was negligible&#x02019;,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> however, it was the Two-County investigators themselves who first noted and published the age imbalance,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> whereby the ASP was slightly older on average than the PSP. Concerns about cluster randomization always are more focused on the risk of biases that lead to type 1 errors, although in this instance, it was noted that if the age imbalance had any effect at all on the primary result, it would be expected to bias it <italic>against</italic> screening, as breast cancer incidence and mortality increase with age.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>From 1992, the Two-County Trial investigators repeatedly published conservative estimates to take account of the cluster randomization, and the results have remained virtually unchanged, i.e. a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality in the ASP, of the order of 30%.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Of particular interest is the analysis published in 2000 by Nixon et&#x000a0;al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> which used Bayesian hierarchical modelling to fit variation between and within clusters. Dr AB Miller, who has frequently expressed scepticism about mammography screening, wrote in 2004 that he found this analysis, &#x02018;particularly compelling in largely dealing with the cluster randomization issue&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Perhaps more pertinently, in 2003, we noted that the important issue was whether the cluster randomization had introduced an imbalance in underlying rates of breast cancer mortality between ASP and PSP.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We found no evidence of this, but nonetheless reanalyzed the results, adjusting for breast cancer mortality in the 10 years prior to the trial, and found the same result, a substantial and significant approximate 30% reduction in breast cancer mortality in the ASP. We also performed an analysis adjusting for prior breast cancer mortality in the randomization clusters, that is, adjusting for a potential difference between ASP and PSP clusters in baseline breast cancer mortality, and still observed a significant 27% reduction in mortality in the ASP.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Two summary points are important. First, cluster randomization is a legitimate methodological strategy, although more challenging than individual randomization, due to the requirement that the clusters produce similar groups for comparison. The secondary analyses performed on these data do not support conjectures that the positive findings in the Two County Trial are in doubt due to alleged vagaries in the randomization.</p><p>In relation to the issue of closure screening in the PSP, the initial trial results published in 1985 pertained almost entirely to the period <italic>before</italic> invitation to screening of the PSP, and showed the same results as later analyses of longer follow-up, which include deaths from breast cancer arising during closure screening.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Thus, fears that the screening of the PSP was in some way anticonservative, have been shown for many years to be misplaced. Despite accumulation over the years of analyses, a recent paper<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> has again challenged the Two-County findings, based on the assumption that the cluster randomization and the closure screen of the PSP biased the results in favour of screening, with no mention of previous analyses excluding the closure screen, taking account of the cluster randomization, or methodological investigations that showed that the fears of bias were unwarranted.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The main thesis of this recent paper<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> is based on the incorrect assumption that, immediately after a period of screening, incidence and mortality should be equal to that in a population that has never been screened. In fact, screening in one period will reduce incidence and mortality in the years immediately following, largely due to the shift in the period of diagnosis (i.e. lead time), as has been observed in trials and in service screening.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>We recently published a paper reviewing methodological strategies in screening trial design, highlighting the degree to which all strategies with a fixed number of screening rounds and a post-screening follow-up period introduced different levels of bias against measuring the effect of screening. We found that a closure screen of the PSP gave the least biased result (albeit still conservative), and most closely approximated the approximately unbiased, but often impractical design, in which screening in the ASP and usual care for the PSP continued for a long period.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec8-0969141316631375"><title>Cause of death ascertainment</title><p>In 1989, the first mortality update of the Swedish Two-County Study published the details of determination of cause of death.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Briefly, if there were clinical, histological, or autopsy evidence of distant metastases, and <italic>no</italic> clear evidence that the metastases originated from a non-breast primary tumour, breast cancer was recorded as the cause of death. If the patient died of another cause, but not from a proven non-breast malignancy, but had local or regional breast cancer, or an asymptomatic distant metastasis present at death, then the death was recorded as from breast cancer. Otherwise, the death was recorded as from other causes. The classification as death from breast cancer of intercurrent disease death with breast cancer present is likely to have been conservative, as women in the ASP with asymptomatic breast cancer would be more likely to have the disease diagnosed due to the screening.</p><p>In the same paper, we investigated the issue of a potential difference in classification of cause of death between the ASP and PSP.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> If such a difference existed, it would be manifested as a significant difference between ASP and PSP in rates of death from other causes among breast cancer cases, as only those with breast cancer diagnosed can be classified as having died from the disease. For example, if there were a subjective tendency to ascribe deaths in breast cancer cases in the ASP as from other causes, there would be an excess rate of death from other causes in breast cancers in the ASP. No such difference was observed. The analysis was repeated with further follow-up in 1992,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and again, no significant difference was observed.</p><p>The issue was revisited in 2002, when we noted again that only those with breast cancer can die from the disease, and used this fact to demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality among breast cancer cases in the ASP compared with the PSP without classifying cause of death.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Thus, the mortality benefit was established without reliance on cause of death classification. Indeed, we found a significant all-cause mortality reduction of 13&#x02013;19%, depending on the method of lead time adjustment.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> It is also worth noting that the Swedish overview published an excess mortality analysis that similarly avoided classifying cause of death, and found, essentially, the same result as when explicitly using breast cancer death as the endpoint.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, in collaboration with the Swedish Overview, the Two-County investigators compared the cause of death, as determined by the local endpoint committee, with cause of death as classified in the Swedish overview.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> All disagreements were investigated to establish the cause of disagreement. The authors concluded: &#x02018;The vast majority of these pertained to a disagreement in inclusion/exclusion and not to disagreement in determination of cause of death.&#x02019; For example, the original trial defined eligibility on the basis of year of birth, whereas the overview used exact age. The results vindicated the original trial endpoint committee&#x02019;s classification of cause of death. Despite this, in their paper on the closure screen of the control group, Autier et&#x000a0;al. again raised this issue,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> with no reference to publications providing evidence that the concern is misplaced.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>There is a minority view that all-cause mortality is an appropriate endpoint for cancer screening trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This view is mistaken, as can be seen from the following example. There is currently considerable interest in the possibility of ovarian cancer screening, and the ovarian cancer mortality results of the UK Trial have recently been published.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Let us consider the implications of all-cause mortality as an endpoint in evaluation of ovarian cancer screening. Ovarian cancer is responsible for approximately 4% of all deaths in a typical middle-aged female population. Suppose that the effect of the offer of ovarian cancer screening were to reduce ovarian cancer mortality by 20%, without affecting deaths from other causes. In a very large trial with 100,000 all-cause deaths expected in the control group, the expected number of deaths in the study group would be 99,200 (0.04&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100,000&#x02009;=&#x02009;800 fewer ovarian cancer deaths). Thus the all-cause mortality relative risk would be 0.992 with a 95% confidence interval (CI)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9834&#x02013;1.0008. That is, even with 100,000 expected all cause deaths in each arm, the variation in mortality from other causes in this example completely swamps the beneficial effect of screening. A study with 300,000 all cause deaths expected in each arm would, arguably, be powered for this effect, but it means that to evaluate ovarian cancer screening with an all-cause mortality endpoint, a trial with 12 million women is needed, 6 million in each arm, and follow-up such that 5% in each arm die from any cause. This demonstrates that all-cause mortality is an impractical, inefficient, and unaffordable endpoint in a trial of an intervention which can only be expected to affect a single (minority) cause. Thus, the effect of ovarian cancer screening on all-cause mortality is essentially unverifiable. The answer is surely to have death from ovarian cancer, or the sequelae of screening or treatment for ovarian cancer, as the endpoint, and to adopt very rigorous cause of death determination policies, with a high rate of autopsy if necessary.</p><p>The use of all-cause mortality is sometimes advocated on the grounds of objectivity. While human judgement is required in all areas of medicine and health, it might be observed that its use distrusts and discards so many things that we know. These include the fact that only those with a cancer can die of it, only those irradiated can have a radiation-induced disorder, and so on. The way to effective evaluation is to use our knowledge when designing and running trials, not to throw it away on the assumption that proper safeguards cannot be implemented and regularly reviewed.</p><p>It is worth noting that, if a statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality (in those with and without the relevant disease) were the universal criterion by which medical interventions were assessed, in all likelihood, there are very few preventive public health interventions that would satisfy this criterion.</p></sec><sec id="sec9-0969141316631375"><title>Overdiagnosis</title><p>In 2003, we published estimates from the Two-County Trial, and from a number of service screening sources, of the division of DCIS into progressive and non-progressive disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Results indicated that the majority of DCIS cases would have progressed to invasive disease if left untreated.</p><p>In 2005, in collaboration with the Gothenburg breast screening trial, the Two-County Trialists published estimates of overdiagnosis using the observed data in the trials to estimate rates of diagnosis of non-progressive (i.e. overdiagnosed) cancers, adjusting for progression rates and screening sensitivity in non-overdiagnosed cancers.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The latter estimates separate overdiagnosis from additional incidence due to lead time, while ensuring that overdiagnosed cases are not included in the estimation of lead time.

In terms of DCIS, an excess incidence of around one per thousand recruits in the ASP was balanced by a deficit of similar size in invasive cancers, strongly suggesting that diagnosis of DCIS is preventing subsequent diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. Results from both trials were very similar.</p><p>We revisited the issue using 29-year incidence data from one county of the Trial in 2012.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> At the end of the 29 years, no excess incidence was observed in the ASP over the PSP, despite screening having started some years earlier in the ASP, and the latter having had around 100,000 more screening episodes than the PSP.</p><p>All the above suggest that overdiagnosis, and in particular non-progressive breast cancer, is a rare phenomenon. The UK Independent Review arrived at larger estimates from follow-up of the Canadian and Malm&#x000f6; trials, which had reported no screening of the control groups, and for which excess long-term incidence in the screened groups might be interpreted as overdiagnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, the UK review did not include the HIP trial, which also did not screen the control group, and which showed only a very small excess incidence at long-term follow-up.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In the Malm&#x000f6; trial, screening continued in the study group beyond the nominal screening age, and in those for whom screening stopped at age 70, and the excess incidence was only 1%.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>It should be acknowledged that much of the focus of overdiagnosis research and discussion in recent years has been on its presence in service screening with mammography, rather than in the trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr15-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> It should also be noted that, given the unobservable nature of overdiagnosis, there is still scope for further quantification with long-term follow-up of current screening programmes.

First, the concerns about design and analysis issues in the Swedish Two-County Trial have been answered repeatedly in the past, and there seems little point in further argument, or at the very least, argument that does not describe in detail why published explanations are insufficient to rule out these concerns.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Secondly, the arguments about cause of death determination seem similarly pointless, particularly in view of the observation above that all-cause mortality is essentially useless in evaluation of screening for most cancers, and indeed for most health interventions.</p><p>As a case study of reviving issues long after their resolution, perhaps the most egregious example is the recent paper by Autier et&#x000a0;al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> which raises again issues relating to the design feature of the closure screen of the PSP, potential imbalances between the ASP and PSP, and ascertainment of cause of death, with little acknowledgement that the questions posed have been repeatedly answered in previous publications, and makes a number of assumptions which a brief study of the literature would show are unwarranted. Specifically:

This argument forms the basis for the claim that the closure screen of the PSP has biased the results in favour of screening, but is incorrect because in the screening group a large number of cancers will have been screen detected in the intervention period, which otherwise would have been detected later, in the post-intervention period. Cancer detection rates in the screening group will thus be lower than the rates in the control group in the post-intervention period, at least in the early years. Breast cancer mortality will, therefore, also be lower. As noted above, lower incidence after screening has been observed in trials and service screening programmes,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and we have shown that the closure screen of the PSP is slightly conservative.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>Even if the argument of Autier et&#x000a0;al. against the closure screen of the PSP were accepted, their adjusted estimates are wrong, as they subtract the deaths from cancers diagnosed at that screen of the control group, but not those from corresponding cancers diagnosed contemporaneously in the study group. Of greater concern, the reduction in mortality from breast cancers prior to the closure screen of the control group has been in the public domain since 1985,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and was 31%, almost identical to that observed including the deaths from the closure screen and their counterparts in the study group.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0969141316631375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The argument that the smaller numbers of advanced cancers in the study group contemporaneously with the control group&#x02019;s closure screen somehow invalidates the design and analysis including such a closure screen again displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the influence of screening on incidence and mortality rates.
