This is a university teaching hospital with a mixed catchment area including some areas of high social deprivation. In the calendar year in which the study was carried out the accident and emergency department saw 61 819 patients of whom 3203 (5.2%) had a psychiatric coding. Of these, 996 (31%) had a self-harm coding. A convenience sample of patients admitted to the medical receiving ward in the hospital after an episode of self-harm was screened. It was not possible to screen consecutive admissions due to staff availability, patient self-discharge before assessment and refusal to be assessed. Patients were screened by age (18-65 years), for the presence of personality disorder and for alcohol and drug misuse. The only exclusion criterion for screening was if participants could not consent.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Measures</title><p id="P9">The three tools used for screening were:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Standardised Assessment of Personality Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> - a brief screening questionnaire that can be used in routine practice to determine the potential presence of a personality disorder</p></list-item><list-item><p>Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> - identifying the presence of an alcohol use disorder and providing an assessment of typical daily alcohol consumption</p></list-item><list-item><p>Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> - a questionnaire determining the presence of a drug use disorder.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Further assessment</title><p id="P10">Patients scoring three or more on SAPAS, with or without substance misuse, were invited to participate. After providing consent, participants were further assessed on the same day as screening or the day after they were discharged from hospital.</p><p id="P11">The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorder (SCID-II)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> was used to confirm the presence of personality disorder and determine specific diagnoses. The research assistant received SCID-II training and reliability was assessed using an actor. There was total agreement between expert and researcher on personality disorder diagnoses of patients.</p><p id="P12">Acts of Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (Acts DSH),<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a structured interview, was used to determine the number of self-harm events in the 12 months prior to the index self-harm episode. To determine the extent of current suicidal ideation and psychiatric symptoms, the Beck Suicide Ideation Scale (BSS)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> were completed.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Intervention: MACT or TAU</title><p id="P13">Manual-assisted cognitive therapy is a brief, 6-session, focused therapy designed to help patients develop a better understanding of their self-harming behaviour and to reduce distress by finding potential ways of resolving problems, including accessing appropriate mental health services. Sessions used a manualised approach and covered topics such as &#x02018;Understanding self-harm&#x02019; and &#x02018;What to do in a crisis&#x02019;. They took place at a location convenient for the participant, usually their local health centre. Treatment as usual (TAU) was referral to a community mental health team and included appointments from a psychiatrist and a community psychiatric nurse. In-patient treatment was given when required. Therapy was delivered to individuals in the community by two therapists, a doctoral-level clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist, both trained and supervised on a weekly basis in MACT by one of the authors of the manual (K.D.).</p><p id="P14">Patients were randomised to MACT or TAU using a random numbers table with an allocation ratio of 2:1 in favour of MACT.

No differences in service use in the 3 months after the index admission were noted between the groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">The aim was to determine whether it would be feasible to recruit a population of individuals with personality disorder, with or without substance misuse, to an RCT of MACT. In addition, we aimed to determine whether or not MACT would be an acceptable psychological treatment within this population following a self-harm act. In addition, we were interested in establishing the TAU for this population and to determine whether we could measure an appropriate treatment effect within this cohort.</p><p id="P24">As highlighted in the introduction, patients with personality disorder can be difficult to engage. Nevertheless, in this study, we were able to consent 20 patients within a 6-month recruitment window. In addition, 9 out of the 14 randomised to MACT attended four or more sessions. Therefore, in terms of population, we established that it would be feasible to recruit an appropriate cohort to a larger trial of MACT. In addition, we have some preliminary evidence that our MACT intervention was acceptable to this population. Those in MACT who attended between zero and three sessions were consuming more alcohol than those who attended at least four sessions. The numbers who attended 3-month follow-up in the latter group were lower (two out of five) than in the group who attended between four and eight sessions (eight out of nine). Although the numbers are small, it highlights the difficulties of engaging those with harmful drinking patterns and the need to intervene more assertively at the time of the self-harm episode.</p><p id="P25">In terms of outcome, the group randomised to MACT had significantly lower scores on suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety at 3-month follow-up, indicating that even with brief therapy important reductions in symptomatology are maintained at follow-up. In addition, we were able to establish TAU for this group and map out the typical service contacts for this cohort in the 3 months following an index episode of self-harm.</p><p id="P26">The study had several limitations. Most importantly, this was a small feasibility study with small numbers and funding for only a short follow-up period, hence the need to be cautious in drawing conclusions. Three months may have been too short a time frame to fully determine engagement in services after a self-harm episode, but an important reduction in symptoms was found with therapy. The sample was, by necessity, a pragmatic sample in that we did not have the resources to screen a consecutive sample. However, we have no reason to believe that our convenience sample is unrepresentative of patients admitted following a self-harm episode. The study suggests that it is possible to recruit, randomise, treat and follow up patients with suicidal behaviour and multiple comorbidities, including substance misuse. A larger, more definitive, study is necessary to determine more fully the clinical outcomes in this group of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Scottish Mental Health Research Network.
