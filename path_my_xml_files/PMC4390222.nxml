The result is gas trapping and increased residual volume (RV). During exercise, shorter expiratory times prohibit the expiration of the complete inspired volume from each breath causing progressive worsening of gas trapping, termed dynamic hyperinflation. Thus although bronchodilators can, to a limited extent, improve airflow obstruction, many patients remain breathless despite optimal therapy.</p><p>Reducing the volume of the hyperinflated lung to make it a better fit for its thoracic cavity is a sensible approach, particularly so if this is achieved by removing or shrinking the most diseased portions of the lung contributing the least to gas exchange. The most definitive way to achieve this is by surgically resecting the worst affected parts of the lung, known as lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). This approach is effective in selected patients with upper lobe predominant emphysema and low exercise capacity. However it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality even in this non-high risk subgroup of patients, [<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] though more modern surgical techniques and improvements in post-operative care have reduced complications and improved survival.[<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122656.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, a drive to develop less invasive methods to achieve the benefits of LVRS has resulted in some promising approaches. Bronchoscopically placed endobronchial valves have had success when targeting the most severely damaged lobe in heterogeneous emphysema, but have limited effect in the presence of collateral ventilation.[<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The use of sclerosants [<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or vapour [<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to shrink similar targets in heterogeneous disease has been proposed, with collateral ventilation not an impediment to success;[<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122656.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] however neither method has undergone evaluation in a large-scale randomised trial. In homogeneous disease, release of trapped gas through extra-anatomical airway stents has been shown to be feasible and safe; however, benefits were short lived due to stent occlusion.[<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The RePneu Lung Volume Reduction Coils (coils; PneumRx, Mountain View, CA, USA) are shape-memory nitinol devices implanted bronchoscopically using fluoroscopic guidance. They are straightened for deployment and gather up loose parenchyma as they revert to their original double-loop shape within the airway. Multiple coils implanted throughout a lobe achieve mechanical volume reduction through distribution of increased radial tension throughout the airway network, while tethering open small airways to prevent collapse. Effectiveness and a good safety profile have been demonstrated in two small cohorts of patients with heterogeneous emphysema.[<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122656.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] We conducted a randomised controlled crossover trial of 47 patients randomised in a 1:1 ratio to assess effectiveness and safety, enrolling patients with both heterogeneous and homogeneous disease.

A guide wire was carefully passed into the target subsegmental airway and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance, avoiding sharp changes of direction, to a distance still safely away from the pleural edge (&#x0003e;35mm). The delivery catheter was then advanced over the guide wire until the two were aligned. Fluoroscopically visible markers on the guide wire allowed coil sizing. The appropriate sized coil was prepared for deployment by extracting it directly into a straight deployment cartridge using specialised forceps. The cartridge was coupled to the delivery catheter and the coil advanced through the bronchoscope and into the target subsegment. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the coils were advanced until the distal tip reached the distal end of the delivery catheter, and the sheath was then pulled back, releasing the coil, which regained its pre-determined shape. Up to 14 coils were distributed evenly throughout the target lobe to achieve maximal regional tension in the treated area.

Patients experienced improvements in lung function consistent with reduction in gas trapping and airways obstruction, but not total lung capacity. This is in contrast with LVRS and lung volume reduction with endobronchial valves, where there is loss of lung parenchyma and reduction in TLC. Thus the mechanisms of action of the coils probably relate to prevention of dynamic airway collapse and reduction in gas trapping rather than leading to volume reduction <italic>per se</italic>. This effect has a greater impact on dynamic hyperinflation which is reflected in the improvements in exercise capacity.[<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>As with the 6MWD, there was a small trend back towards baseline in the reduction in RV and increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>, but values remained statistically and clinically significantly better than baseline 360 days post final treatment. Emphysema is a progressive disease and a gradual deterioration in lung function parameters over time is expected. Controlled data at 12 months post treatment is required to comment definitively on durability of benefit from coils. The Endobronchial Valves for Emphysema Palliation Trial (VENT) [<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported data on a randomised, controlled population of severe emphysema patients with similar baseline characteristics, undergoing optimal medical care, providing an estimate of functional decline expected in this patient group. In these control patients, median change from baseline to 6 months in 6MWD was -10.7 (-29.6 to 8.1) m, in SGRQ +0.6 (-1.8 to 3.0) points, and in absolute percent change in FEV<sub>1</sub> of -2.4 (-5.1 to 0.4). [<xref rid="pone.0122656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] These small but significant reductions are expected given the compromised status of patients at randomisation and the progressive nature of the disease. It is not possible to predict the rate of deterioration towards baseline in the efficacy outcomes beyond 12 months (completion of trial follow-up), and there is a need for longer-term controlled studies to establish the true magnitude of benefit of coil treatment in this patient group.</p><p>The overall SAE profile was acceptable given the benefits accrued, and compares favourably with the SAE profile and morbidity associated with lung volume reduction surgery. Although seven patients experienced SAE pneumothoraces (8.3% of procedures, 15.5% of patients) within the 360 day follow up period, none required surgical intervention and the majority resolved within 4 days with simple intercostal tube drainage. The pneumothoraces were evenly spread out amongst early, middle and late recruits to the study, making a &#x0201c;learning effect&#x0201d; an unlikely cause. Following treatment of the pneumothorax, these seven patients achieved a mean reduction in the SGRQ of -8.8 points, an increase in FEV1 of 0.09L, a reduction in the RV of -0.62L and increase in the 6MWD of 42.9m, 360 days following coil treatment. Hence the occurrence of a pneumothorax does not preclude benefit.</p><p>LVRS and other bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatments are most effective when disease is heterogeneously distributed with a clear anatomical target with worse disease. In this study of endobronchial coils, we recruited patients with both heterogeneous and homogeneous emphysema with both groups benefiting equally from coil treatment. The percentage split between heterogeneous and homogeneous disease in this cohort likely approximates the rates of heterogeneous vs. homogeneous disease in severe emphysema populations in the United Kingdom, and at present there is no alternative effective interventional treatment option for patients with homogeneous emphysema. Coil treatment appears particularly promising in light of its potential to treat this significant group of patients.</p><p>The median number of coils implanted per bilaterally treated patient was 18 (range 13&#x02013;27) coils in this study. There was no relationship between the number of coils implanted per patient and change in efficacy outcomes 360 days following treatment on univariate or multivariate analysis: Number of coils vs. &#x00394;SGRQ r<sup>2</sup> 0.083, p = 0.10; vs. &#x00394;RV r<sup>2</sup>&#x0003c;0.0001, p = 0.96; vs. %&#x00394;FEV<sub>1</sub> r<sup>2</sup> = 0.013, p = 0.53; and vs. &#x00394;6MWD r<sup>2</sup> = 0.02, p = 0.45).</p><p>One limitation of this trial is the cross-over design and potential for randomisation bias. There were no significant differences in changes in outcome measures between the original treatment group (n = 21) and the crossover group (n = 16) 360 days following treatment compared to baseline: &#x00394;SGRQ -7.13 &#x000b1; 11.91 vs. -4.75 &#x000b1; 16.50, p = 0.64; %&#x00394;FEV<sub>1</sub> 7.6 &#x000b1;22.9 vs. 10.3 &#x000b1; 23.5, p = 0.85; &#x00394;RV -0.28 &#x000b1; 0.82 vs. -0.36 &#x000b1; 0.72, p = 0.87; and &#x00394;6MWD 35.3 &#x000b1; 55.5 vs. 32.6 &#x000b1; 50.0, p = 0.67.</p><p>Evaluable data at 360 days were available for 35 of the 45 treated patients. Hence we examined whether there were differences in baseline values and outcomes when comparing the group that had 360 day follow-up assessments and the 10 patients who did not (5 deaths and 5 drop outs). There were no differences in baseline values and the primary efficacy outcome change in SGRQ was no different between these two groups at 90 days (&#x00394;SGRQ -4.3 &#x000b1; 14.2 vs. -7.8 &#x000b1; 18.7, p = 0.99) and 180 days (&#x00394;SGRQ -7.0 &#x000b1; 11.8 vs. -9.7 &#x000b1; 16.4, p = 0.68), making it unlikely that the drop outs positively biased the group 360 day outcome data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treatment with coils results in improvements in quality of life, exercise tolerance and lung function, which are sustained up to 360 days post treatment. Overall, the safety profile is acceptable particularly in view of the magnitude of benefit and in comparison with surgical and other bronchoscopic lung volume reduction techniques. The coil method may be particularly promising for patients with relatively homogeneous emphysema, who currently have no other treatment options, and appears to be effective across a diverse population of emphysema patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0122656.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0122656.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0122656.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Endobronchial coils for the treatment of severe emphysema with hyperinflation (RESET) trial study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0122656.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0122656.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
