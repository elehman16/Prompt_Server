Among free-living Japanese individuals, we carried out a randomized trial to clarify the effect of lifestyle modification for lowering urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio using a self-monitoring device.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was an open, prospective, parallel randomized, controlled trial. Ninety-two individuals were recruited from Japanese volunteers. Participants were randomly allocated into intervention and control groups. A month-long dietary intervention on self-monitoring urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio was carried out using monitors (HEU-001F, OMRON Healthcare Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). All participants had brief dietary education and received a leaflet as usual care. Monitors were handed out to the intervention group, but not to the control group. The intervention group was asked to measure at least one spot urine sodium-to-potassium ratio daily, and advised to lower their sodium-to-potassium ratio toward the target of less than 1. Outcomes included changes in 24-hour urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio, sodium excretion, potassium excretion, blood pressure, and body weight in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean measurement frequency of monitoring was 2.8 times/day during the intervention. Changes in urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio were &#x02212;0.55 in the intervention group and &#x02212;0.06 in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.088); respective sodium excretion changes were &#x02212;18.5 mmol/24 hours and &#x02212;8.7 mmol/24 hours (<italic>P</italic> = 0.528); and corresponding potassium excretion was 2.6 mmol/24 hours and &#x02212;1.5 mmol/24 hours (<italic>P</italic> = 0.300). No significant reductions were observed in either blood pressure or body weight after the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Providing the device to self-monitor a sodium-to-potassium ratio did not achieve the targeted reduction of the ratio in &#x0201c;pure self-management&#x0201d; settings, indicating further needs to study an effective method to enhance the synergetic effect of dietary programs and self-monitoring practice to achieve the reduction. However, we cannot deny the possibility of reducing sodium-to-potassium ratio using a self-monitoring device.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Key words: </title><kwd>lifestyle modification</kwd><kwd>potassium</kwd><kwd>self-monitoring</kwd><kwd>sodium</kwd><kwd>sodium-to-potassium ratio</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>OMRON Healthcare</funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>High dietary sodium (Na) and low dietary potassium (K) intakes are associated with adverse blood pressure (BP) levels and excess risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Epidemiological studies also demonstrated that there was a good correlation between Na/K ratios in 24-hour urine and BP.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The Na/K ratio has also been reported to be a superior metric to either Na or K alone in relation to BP and incident hypertension<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>; studies also report associations between Na/K ratio and CVD.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The World Health Organization (WHO) plans to reduce Na intake and increase K intake in the future.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, a conventional population approach does not seem sufficient<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>; fairly large gaps exist between the actual intakes and the recommended target levels among populations.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> An individual approach, such as self-monitoring of Na and K intake, is also necessary for the timely achievement of goals set by the WHO &#x02014; less than 2 g/day of Na by 2025.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> However, awareness and the actual practice toward individual intake goals remain poor; individuals who reported intakes while presumably consuming reduced and non-reduced salt diets showed similar levels of Na intake.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>The gold standard for estimating individual daily salt intake is 24-hour urine collection.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The amount of K excreted in 24-hour urine does not necessarily reflect absolute K intake, not as well as it does for Na, but it shows a good correlation with dietary K intake.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> However, 24-hour urine collection is neither easy nor practical for patients at clinics or in their homes. There is little evidence for dietary intervention to reduce Na and increase K based on a behavioral theoretical framework. Effective monitoring of adherence to the recommended dietary Na and K intake in hypertensive patients and general populations requires development of a convenient, cheap, and appropriate monitoring system. Thus, a new self-monitoring device for supporting Na reduction and K increase is needed. Nowadays, self-monitoring devices for urinary Na/K ratio gives individuals quick feedback of their urinary Na/K ratio.<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> However, the intervention effect of this self-monitoring device in supporting dietary behavior modification and changes in urinary Na/K ratio has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Thus, this randomized controlled trial was carried out to clarify the effects of lifestyle modification using a urinary Na/K ratio monitoring device among free-living Japanese individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study is an open, prospective, parallel randomized controlled trial.

Prior to this report, effect of self-monitoring and the association with dietary improvement remained unknown. We recruited healthy and hypertensive individuals in this study, since reducing Na/K ratio is essential for preventing hypertension and CVDs prior to clinical onset.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The main findings of this first study on self-monitoring Na/K ratio among healthy and hypertensive individuals included a trend towards larger reductions in urinary Na/K ratio observed in the intervention group. However, the effect of the self-monitoring device on the urinary Na/K ratio did not reach the accepted level of statistical significance on the pre-specified effect size (target reduction of 1 unit difference of Na/K ratio between intervention and control groups) under &#x0201c;pure self-management&#x0201d; (ie, without additional professional support) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.088). There were no significant reductions observed for Na and K excretions, BP, or body weight.</p><p>In earlier studies, researchers attempted to use dietary intervention as a way of evaluating the effects of an increased fruit and vegetable intake, while other groups used special diets, such as the DASH-sodium diet, in order to prevent non-communicable diseases.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Since most of these previous interventions showed positive effects,<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> international recommendations have advised increasing fruit and vegetable intake.<sup><xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Although dietary interventions with larger effects tended to depend on the intensity of the intervention, some of these intensive interventions can be very difficult and expensive to apply in outpatient practice.<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> As a way of balancing a lower effort and financial burden while maintaining an effective intervention, &#x0201c;pure self-management&#x0201d; using a self-monitoring device is one of the methods that could be used to help improve dietary habits. Positive effects have been demonstrated when using this technique in BP and glucose monitoring.<sup><xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Unfortunately, there are few tools that are capable of providing an easy and accurate measurement that can be used for self-monitoring the dietary habit. In this study, we used a newly developed urinary Na/K ratio monitor providing onsite accurate feedback within a minute that can be used to evaluate the intervention effect of &#x0201c;pure self-management&#x0201d; by healthy and hypertensive subjects.<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>In this present study, there was a larger reduction of the Na/K ratio for the &#x0201c;device + usual care&#x0201d; intervention group versus the &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; control group. However, the intervention effect for our participants was half of what we originally expected; the initial sample size was subsequently insufficient, which led to deficiency of power for detecting statistical significance towards the pre-specified target reduction on urinary Na/K ratio having a 1 unit difference in Na/K ratio between intervention and control groups. The baseline value of urinary Na excretion was close to our assumption; however, the urinary Na/K ratio was lower and the urinary K excretion was higher than initially expected. Since we are the first to report on the effectiveness of using a monitoring device for casual urinary Na/K ratio and could not find any previous intervention studies reporting dietetic education on Na/K ratio, it was difficult to estimate the baseline values and the effect size of the intervention precisely and calculate an appropriate sample size in this preliminary stage trial. We minimally referred to findings from observational studies to hypothesize the intervention effect in this study; however, the pre-specified target reduction in Na/K ratio set with our expectations might have been overambitious to achieve among free-living healthy and hypertensive Japanese individuals. &#x0201c;Pure self-management&#x0201d; works with individual&#x02019;s knowledge, skills, and motivation toward behavior change; however, it seemed difficult for Japanese study participants to achieve the level of Na/K ratio observed in Western countries. This discrepancy may be due to difficulties with food choice in local grocery stores, limited amount of vegetables and fruits available during the winter period, or because avoiding high-salt content foods might have been challenging with only a brief education. Since self-monitoring devices are different from therapeutic devices, urinary Na/K ratio monitor may be powerless without practical dietary programs which support individuals to acquire appropriate skills and practice lowering Na/K ratio effectively. Hence, the present null findings do not necessarily suggest that self-monitoring of the Na/K ratio is not an effective method for dietetic intervention. Recruiting participants from the general population, who have no special skill or experience using the device or performing &#x0201c;pure self-management&#x0201d;, may be one of the limitations of this study that had led to the observed weaker intervention effect. Thus, we cannot deny the possibility of reducing Na/K ratio using a self-monitoring device based on the present null findings. However, effective methods to enlarge the synergetic effect of dietary program and self-monitoring practices would be essential for lowering individuals&#x02019; Na/K ratios. Further research is needed to improve the intervention effect to achieve the reduction. If we recalculate the sample size based on actual effect size (target reduction of 0.5 unit difference of Na/K ratio between intervention and control groups), at least 147 participants in each group would have been needed to detect a significant difference between the intervention and control groups. However, the current results suggest that self-monitoring could potentially reduce the Na/K ratio with relatively little burden, as it can be easily implemented in normative daily practice.</p><p>Focusing on differences between the present study and previously reported dietary interventions may provide important clues on how to enhance the intervention effect.<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Introducing active advice from a nutritionist with appropriate timing may help individuals to better understand how they can properly improve their dietary habits.<sup><xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In this context, acquiring basic knowledge and skills for Na reduction and K increase might be one of the key factors to improve individuals&#x02019; confidence and enhance their motivation toward dietary improvements. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that, in combination with the conventional population approach, the individual approach (such as self-monitoring of the urinary Na/K ratio at home, brief expertise consultancy, and/or remote educational feedback systems providing useful feedback to individuals) may support the timely achievement of goals, such as that set by WHO of less than 2 g of Na per day by 2025.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>One potential limitation of this study is that participants were free-living middle-aged men and women. As such, the majority were not subjected to a diet with continuous salt reduction or a controlled diet. Hence, it is not known whether these findings are also applicable to the elderly and patients under continuous salt reduction practice.</p><p>In conclusion, the intervention effect of self-monitoring urinary Na/K ratio under &#x0201c;pure self-management&#x0201d; settings resulted in half of the pre-specified effect size between intervention and control groups and did not achieve the usually accepted level of statistical significance towards the pre-specified targeted reduction of the ratio (1 unit difference of Na/K ratio) in this first randomized trial. The pre-specified effect size for reducing Na/K ratio might have been overambitious rather than realistic; however, there might be a possibility showing no clinically important effect of self-monitoring urinary Na/K ratio under &#x0201c;pure self-management&#x0201d; settings. Further study is needed to explore an effective method to enhance the synergetic effect of dietary education program and self-monitoring practice to achieve reduction of the Na/K ratio.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was conducted by OMRON Healthcare Co., Ltd. in cooperation with the Department of Public Health, Shiga University of Medical Science under the quality control based on the Consort Checklist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sm01">eTable 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sm01">eFigure 1</xref>).
