Sixteen participants with COPD symptoms were randomly assigned to a hypoxia or control group and completed a 3-week intermittent hypoxia breathing program (five sessions per week, each consisting of three to five breathing cycles, each cycle lasting 3&#x02013;5 minutes with 3-minute breaks between cycles). During the breathing cycles, the hypoxia group received hypoxic air (inspired fraction of oxygen 15%&#x02013;12%), whereas the control group received normal air (sham hypoxia). During the breaks, all participants breathed normoxic room air. Arterial oxygen saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the normoxic and hypoxic/sham hypoxic periods. For each breathing cycle, changes from normoxia to hypoxia/sham hypoxia were calculated, and changes were averaged for each of the 15 sessions and for each week. Changes in arterial oxygen saturation were significantly different between groups in the course of the 3 weeks (two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures), with post hoc differences in weeks 1, 2, and 3. During the course of the intermittent hypoxia application, no between-group differences were detected for blood pressure or rate pressure product values. Changes in heart rate were significantly different between groups in the course of the 3 weeks (two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures), with post hoc differences only in week 3. Averages over all 15 sessions were significantly higher in the hypoxia group for heart rate and rate pressure product, and tended to be increased for systolic blood pressure. The applied intermittent hypoxia breathing program resulted in specific and moderate heart rate and blood pressure responses, and did not provoke a progressive increase in blood pressure during the hypoxic cycles in the course of the application.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>interval hypoxia</kwd><kwd>blood pressure</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular responses</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is defined as repeated episodes of hypoxia interspersed with normoxic periods.<xref rid="b1-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Physiological effects of IH on the cardiorespiratory system depend on the severity of hypoxia, the duration of a single hypoxic exposure, the relation of hypoxic and normoxic phases, the total time of the IH application and eventual concomitant stimuli during the hypoxic periods (eg, exercise, hypo- or hypercapnia).<xref rid="b2-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Among the broad variety of IH protocols in clinical and physiologic studies, repeated passive short-term (3&#x02013;5 minutes) hypoxic cycles (inspired fraction of oxygen [FiO<sub>2</sub>] 0.15&#x02013;0.09) with normoxic intervals have been applied in patients and healthy subjects by physicians of the former Soviet Union for many years.<xref rid="b3-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Recently, well-controlled studies confirmed the positive effects of IH application in elderly with and without coronary artery disease<xref rid="b5-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and in patients with various diseases,<xref rid="b6-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and proposed IH as a preventive and therapeutic tool even for patients with mild COPD.<xref rid="b6-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Although the authors reported that the IH application was well tolerated by all subjects without adverse effects, these studies focused on changes from the pre- to the postapplication period, and little is known on hemodynamic responses of COPD patients during the course of an IH breathing program.<xref rid="b6-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>For a safe application of IH, it is important not to provoke potentially dangerous hemodynamic responses during the repeated short-term exposures to hypoxia.

Parts of the project have already been published, and the recruitment of the study participants, including inclusion and exclusion criteria and the baseline examination are described in detail in our previous publication.<xref rid="b6-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In brief, the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University Innsbruck (Austria) and carried out in conformity with the ethical standards laid down in the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Eighteen female and male patients with symptoms of COPD volunteered to participate in the study and gave written informed consent. After baseline examination, the participants were randomly assigned in a single-blind fashion to the hypoxia group (HG) or the control group (CG) with sham hypoxia. In two study participants, complete measurements during all sessions of the IH application were not possible. Therefore, the present evaluation includes data of 16 study participants. Baseline characteristics and medication of the study participants of the HG and the CG are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-10-339">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Both groups completed a 3-week IH breathing program (HypoxyComplex HypO<sub>2</sub>; HypoMed, Moscow, Russia), comprising five sessions per week, each consisting of three to five breathing cycles, which was conducted at the Department of Sport Science of the University of Innsbruck, Austria (590 m altitude). The characteristics of the breathing program are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-copd-10-339">Table 2</xref>. The breathing sessions started in the late morning at least 1 hour after a usual breakfast, and participants performed no intense physical exercise for at least 1 hour prior to the breathing sessions. The breathing sessions started after about 10 minutes&#x02019; rest in a sitting position, and the complete breathing sessions were conducted in a sitting position. During the breathing cycles, the HG received hypoxic air (FiO<sub>2</sub> 15%&#x02013;12%), whereas the CG (sham) received normal air (FiO<sub>2</sub> 21%). Hypoxia and sham hypoxia were administered via air-cushion face mask directly connected to a T-valve to minimize dead space. The breathing cycles lasted 3&#x02013;5 minutes and were separated by 3-minute breaks, during which all participants breathed normoxic room air (FiO<sub>2</sub> 21%) without a face mask. The participants were advised not to change nutrition or exercise habits during the breathing program.</p><p>Heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) were continuously monitored during the sessions via a pulse oximeter (Hypoxia Patient Monitor; HypoMed) attached to a fingertip, and values were recorded at the end of the normoxic and of the hypoxic/sham hypoxic period of each breathing cycle. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured during the last 30 seconds of the normoxic and of the hypoxic/sham hypoxic periods of each breathing cycle using an automatic wrist blood pressure monitor (RX3 Plus; Omron, Mannheim, Germany). No measures were visible for the participants.</p><p>For data evaluation, changes (&#x00394;) between normoxia and hypoxia/sham hypoxia of each breathing cycle were calculated, and values of the three (week 1) to five (week 3) breathing cycles of each session were averaged. Therefore, the values of SaO<sub>2</sub> (&#x00394;SaO<sub>2</sub>), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (&#x00394;BPsys, &#x00394;BPdia), mean arterial blood pressure (&#x00394;MAP), heart rate (&#x00394;HR), and rate pressure product (&#x00394;RPP) represent mean differences from normoxia to hypoxia/sham hypoxia of each breathing session. These values were used for the descriptive presentation of the physiological responses in the course of the IH application. Mean values of each week were calculated (&#x00394;week-SaO<sub>2</sub>, &#x00394;week-BPsys, &#x00394;week-BPdia, &#x00394;week-HR, &#x00394;week-RPP) for the statistical analysis of FiO<sub>2</sub>-related differences between groups, and a two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures (week &#x000d7; group) was applied. If a significant interaction was found, post hoc unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests with Bonferroni correction were applied to find the source of difference. Additionally, averages over all 15 sessions (&#x00394;tot-SaO<sub>2</sub>, &#x00394;tot-BPsys, &#x00394;tot-BPdia, &#x00394;tot-MAP, &#x00394;tot-HR, &#x00394;tot-RPP) were calculated and compared between groups by unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests.

The applied IH protocol provoked a marked decrease in SaO<sub>2</sub> during the hypoxic cycles in weeks 1, 2, and 3. Although slightly increased, blood pressure values were not significantly influenced by the hypoxic periods. Heart rate was significantly increased during the hypoxic cycles, and increases were dependent on the degree of hypoxia. As a consequence of the hypoxia-induced modulations of blood pressure and heart rate, the rate pressure product was affected by the hypoxic cycles, and a significant difference between the HG and CG was detected for means over all 15 sessions.</p><p>The hypoxia-induced heart rate increase in the HG was relatively low, with a maximal &#x00394;HR of 5.3 bpm in sessions 8 and 15. &#x00394;tot-HR was (about 4 bpm) significantly higher in the HG compared to the CG. The observed heart rate responses were unsurprising, since acute hypoxic exposure has been shown to increase resting heart rate and cardiac output to counteract the reduced arterial oxygen content and to match oxygen delivery to the tissues.<xref rid="b14-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Additionally, acute hypoxia reduces peripheral vascular resistance, which may contribute to a heart rate increase via baroreflex.</p><p>With respect to individual heart rate responses, the maximal heart rate increase from normoxia to hypoxia/sham hypoxia was 13 bpm in both groups. The increase in &#x00394;HR over the course of the 15 breathing sessions might have been caused by lowered inspired fraction of oxygen from week 1 to week 3 that resulted in an SaO<sub>2</sub> decrease in the participants of the HG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-10-339">Figure 1</xref>). When compared to physical activity, eg, an endurance-training program, the applied IH program provoked heart rate increases in all participants that were below low-intensity exercise.</p><p>IH provoked only minor changes in blood pressure values, which did not differ between groups. On the one hand, normotensive subjects seemed not to respond with increased blood pressure to acute hypoxia, since the effects of the increased cardiac output are counteracted by peripheral vasodilation.<xref rid="b16-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> On the other hand, repeated exposures to hypoxia can increase sympathetic activation, with increased blood pressure responses in normoxia and during hypoxic exposures.<xref rid="b17-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Our results indicate that the increased cardiac output was compensated by peripheral vasodilation, resulting in nearly unchanged blood pressure, which is in line with the results of Fu et al.<xref rid="b18-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The reasons for the divergent effects of IH application on blood pressure parameters might be the different study populations (eg, patients, athletes, etc). However, it is more likely that the pattern of IH and the duration of application are responsible for the effects on blood pressure.<xref rid="b19-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>According to the heart rate and blood pressure responses, the rate pressure product was increased during the hypoxic cycles compared to sham hypoxia predominantly caused by changes in heart rate. From a practical point of view, the moderate increases in rate pressure product seem not to be a cardiovascular provocation and support the records of previous studies that the application of repeated hypoxic short-term exposures at rest are well tolerated by healthy and mildly diseased persons, even by patients after myocardial infarction.<xref rid="b5-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The present results are based on a relatively small sample size of patients with mild COPD. This is responsible for the relatively low statistical power. Although all participants had normal SaO<sub>2</sub> values, determined in the baseline examination,<xref rid="b6-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> it cannot be excluded, that these persons were already preconditioned by COPD-related hypoxic periods before starting the breathing program. Therefore, the results cannot be transferred to healthy subjects or patients with more severe COPD without limitations. The measurements were performed at the end of each breathing cycle. Due to the short circulation time from the lungs to the carotid bodies,<xref rid="b13-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> it might be possible that physiological responses were exaggerated during the first minute of the hypoxic cycles and were not detected by our measurements.</p><p>It has to be stated that IH was applied as a training period in this study setting. IH was present for about 20&#x02013;40 minutes per day and the application was limited to 3 weeks. In COPD patients with additional obstructive sleep apnea, the repeated hypoxic episodes during the night seem to be responsible for a higher hospitalization and mortality rate.<xref rid="b20-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In contrast, sleep-related oxygen desaturation in COPD patients without obstructive sleep apnea seems to have no detrimental effect.<xref rid="b21-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The applied IH protocol in this study differs from IH in obstructive sleep apnea in the duration of the single hypoxic periods, the duration of normoxic phases, concomitant hypocapnia instead of hypercapnia, and the limited duration per day and in total. These differences might be responsible for the positive effects of the applied IH protocol on exercise tolerance<xref rid="b6-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and for the mild heart rate and blood pressure responses observed in this study, which were in contrast to the detrimental effects of IH in obstructive sleep apnea patients.</p><p>In conclusion, the applied IH program resulted in specific heart rate and blood pressure responses, ie, a moderate increase in heart rate, during the hypoxic cycles. Although hypoxia was progressively increased from week 1 to week 3, the applied IH program seems not to provoke a progressive increase in blood pressure during the hypoxic cycles. Therefore, IH using repeated 3- to 5-minute cycles can be considered a mild stimulus accompanied by effective adaptations in patients with mild COPD.<xref rid="b6-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-copd-10-339" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, larger clinical trials including patients with various COPD stages are needed to assess the clinical utility of IH training in COPD patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>All authors contributed toward data analysis, drafting and revising the paper and agree to be
