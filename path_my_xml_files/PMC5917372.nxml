Laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) is becoming a standard procedure, but its acceptance is slow because of the difficulties in mastering the technique in particular intracorporeal suturing&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"> 3</xref>). In children, the main demonstrable advantage of LP is cosmetic. Retroperitoneoscopy is preferred by some but the need to use a 10 mm port to create the space somewhat diminishes this advantage&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"> 5</xref>). Also with the retroperitoneoscopic approach, the working space is limited, particularly in small children. For these reasons, there is a trend to prefer robotic assisted laparoscopic pyelopasty (RALP) because of the shorter learning curve (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, RALP is cosmetically inferior to an LP done with 3 mm working ports and its cost efficiency is debatable (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Most of the centres using minilaparoscopy (3 mm diameter, 20 cm length) in children use a transperitoneal approach (93,5%)&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In most cases this approach is done with the child in the supine position (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Here we report our method for mini LP using a tansperitoneal approach with the patient in the lateral flank decubitus as is often used for OP which we found technically advantageous. Our results in infants, children and adolescents are reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We reviewed retrospectively the records of children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who underwent transperitoneal minilaparoscopic pyeloplasty (MLP) at our institution from March 2012 until October 2017, both included.</p><p>Patient demographics, weight, form of presentation, and outcomes were recorded. Pre- and postoperative imaging studies were reviewed. Indications for MLP included: Progressively increasing hydronephrosis detected pre- or neonatally, worsening or <italic>de novo</italic> appearance of symptoms (mainly abdominal pain), repeated urinary tract infection (UTI), decreased differential function in renogram (40% or less), or repeatedly obstructed curves on the diuresis renogram (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Preoperative evaluation was assessed by the grading of hydronephrosis following the SFU classification&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and the anterior posterior pelvic diameter was measured on transverse posterior views on ultrasonography. In 45 patients MAG3 diuretic renogram was performed. Sixteen patients underwent MRI to accurate the diagnosis, three of them due to the additional presence of nephrolithiasis. The presence of crossing vessels was confirmed intraoperatively in 22 patients.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Method</title><p>Under general anaesthesia cystoscopy and retrograde placement of double J stent were performed in most cases. However some patients a retrograde stent had been placed preoperatively and others had antegrade placement of the stent (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). A retrograde uretero-pyelogram was performed as necessary. An indwelling bladder catheter was left inside to fill the pelvis if necessary. The patient was then placed in lateral flank position with the side to be operated up. All pressure points were protected with pads, and the patient was fixed to the table with cloth tape, allowing the table to be rotated during the surgery. The surgeon and the camera were placed in front of the patient&#x000a0;(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Flank position.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fsurg-05-00032-g001"/></fig><p>First a 5 mm trocar was placed for the camera at the site of the umbilicus by using open technique. Pneumoperitoneum was created and two 3 mm trocars were placed more laterally in the upper and lower quadrants of the abdomen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Additional ports were not needed in any patient. Twenty-centimetre-long, 3-mm-diameter instruments were used. Very few cases needed of percutaneous fixation of the pelvis using a 4/0 monocryl.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p> Trocars placement.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fsurg-05-00032-g002"/></fig><p>The UPJ was exposed after de colonic mobilisation (retrocolonic approach) in left sided cases. The hepatic flexure of the colon was mobilised for a right-sided approach as needed. Liver mobilization is rarely necessary given the position of the patient. Filling the bladder facilitates the dissection of the renal pelvis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3 F4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>. Following the resection of the stenosed segment and spatulation of the ureter along its lateral aspect, 2 sutures are placed and tied in the lower corner of the anastomosis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>.

Weight appeared not to be a limitation. The results for patients &#x02264;10 and &#x0003e;50 kg were comparable. Our approach allowed the use of 3 mm ports and short instruments in infants, children and adolescents or young adults up to 18 years old with the aim of facilitating the operation leaving minimal scars. Complications such as omental prolapse, through a port site after drainage removal in children require unfortunately general anaesthesia to be solved. Based on our experience, considering the low rate of complications which required a postoperative percutaneous drainage (one out of fifty-three operations) and the known complications related to the use of a surgical drain, we recommend its prophylactic use only in complicated cases (i.e., nephrolithiasis).</p><p>Open surgical dismembered pyeloplasty (Anderson-Hynes procedure) remains as the predominant treatment modality for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJ) in children (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Sukumurar et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) analysed the national trends of the various treatments for paediatric ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), over a total of 35,275 children. Although there has been a substantial increase in minimally invasive pyeloplasty after 2007, while RALP continues to increase its rates, those from LP appear to be stable since 2003.</p><p>Many studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"> 8</xref>) demonstrate that the complication rates are low in the three approaches (OP, RALP and LP) and validates their safety and feasibility. Furthermore Chan et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) proved that the benefits of laparoscopy are not only limited to older children but also apply for infants. However, they insist on the application of robotics.</p><p> The use of the RALP in paediatric urology is becoming more popular with the aim of overcoming the technical difficulties associated with the limited small space of the abdominal cavity in infants, or to the size of the instruments used through 3 and 5 mm ports, such as their length. The results of a recent study involving 6 surgeons, all of them with more than 5 years experience performing 62 procedures in a total of 60 patients showed a 91% of resolution of the hydronephrosis and 11% rate of complications (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, we must take in account the cost-efficiency of the RALP; including the need for an operation room at least 60 m<sup>2</sup>, back-up equipment in case of failures (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and the cosmetic results related to larger ports compared to the MLP.</p><p>Up to the present time there is a lack of standardized technique amongst institutions both for the laparoscopic pyeloplasty techniques (retroperitoneoscopy and transperitoneal approach) and the RALP in the paediatric patient.</p><p>Each method presents its advantages and inconveniences, and until now, none has shown clear superiority over the others. As the future goals of all the minimal invasive techniques should be minimizing the impact of the scars without losing safety and control, MLP offers a feasible technique with the most cosmetic advantages. The method of mini LP described here has proven efficient and safe. The flank position allows the use of short 3 mm instruments, with the attending advantage of easier suturing and minimal scars not only for infants under 12 months of age but also in patients over 50 kg of body weight.</p><p>Our study has several limitations because of its retrospective nature and the small number of patients belonging to different age groups. Nevertheless, in our experience the MLP in the flank position is a feasible, safe and successful approach not only for children and for infants, but also can be extended to young adults safely.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Ethik- Kommission des Landes Berlin (Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin), with written informed consent from all subjects.
