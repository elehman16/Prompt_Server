However, administration of oral drug with water 3 h before operation may cause problems especially if the patient requires general anesthesia for SE.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] These, clinical studies have shown that the vaginal route is superior to oral misoprostol in termination of first trimester pregnancies. Sublingual misoprostol in medical termination of pregnancy has been studied.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The buccal mucosa being very vascular and misoprostol tablet being soluble in water dissolves within 10-15 min of administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] This route is convenient to use, avoids vaginal administration and the ingestion of water before anesthesia (in case needed). A pilot study has shown that sublingual misoprostol with or without mifepristone is useful in first-trimester medical abortions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>The present study has few limitations as it was not a placebo-controlled trial, the number of patients was relatively less, repeat dose versus single dose, and pharmacokinetic parameters while comparing three routes were not studied, which are highly warranted to establish the comparative results of the present study. It can be concluded that sublingual misoprostol is an effective and favorable cervical ripening agent for first trimester abortion as compared to vaginal and oral dosage forms.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
