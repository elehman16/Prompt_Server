Robenacoxib is an NSAID with high selectivity for the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 isoform. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of an oral tablet formulation of robenacoxib in client-owned dogs undergoing soft tissue surgery. The study was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. A total of 239 dogs were included and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either robenacoxib or placebo. Each dog received an oral tablet administration of either robenacoxib, at a target dose of 2 mg/kg, or placebo once prior to surgery and for two additional days post-operatively. All dogs also received a pre-anesthetic dose of 0.2 mg/kg butorphanol (intravenous or intramuscular). Pain assessments were performed using the short form of the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale. Robenacoxib was compared to the placebo group on a success/failure basis. Treatment failure was defined as the need for rescue therapy to control post-operative pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Significantly (<italic>P</italic> = 0.019) more dogs administered robenacoxib were considered treatment successes (89 of 116, 76.72%) compared to dogs given placebo (74 of 115, 64.35%). The percentage of treatment failure was therefore 23.28% in the robenacoxib and 35.65% in the placebo group. The least squares mean total pain scores were significantly different between groups and in favor of robenacoxib at 3 and 5 hours (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and 8 hours post-extubation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Pain at the surgery sites (response to touch) was also significantly improved at 3, 5 and 8 hours post-extubation in dogs receiving robenacoxib versus placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). In addition, a significant overall improvement in posture/activity was revealed with robenacoxib having lower scores versus placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). No significant differences between the robenacoxib and placebo groups in the frequency of reported adverse events were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Robenacoxib by oral (tablet) administration was effective and well tolerated in the control of peri-operative pain and inflammation associated with soft tissue surgery in dogs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Analgesia</kwd><kwd>Dog</kwd><kwd>NSAID</kwd><kwd>Robenacoxib</kwd><kwd>Peri-operative</kwd><kwd>Soft tissue surgery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par79">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been proven to be effective in controlling post-operative pain in dogs when used either alone or in combination with opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Robenacoxib is an NSAID which produces highly selective inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 isoform of COX, and significantly inhibits COX-2 and spares COX-1 in vivo when administered orally at the recommended dosages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Robenacoxib has a fast onset of action, achieves maximal blood concentrations within 0.25&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;h after both oral and subcutaneous dosing, and has a high bioavailability (84% oral; 88% subcutaneous) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The dose and concentration-effect relationships for single oral doses of robenacoxib over the dose range 0.5&#x02013;8.0&#x000a0;mg/kg were established in a urate crystal-induced acute synovitis model in dogs; robenacoxib increased the weight-bearing and decreased pain and swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]<italic>.</italic>
</p><p id="Par15">The safety of robenacoxib was investigated in the dog in two randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies. Robenacoxib was administered orally once daily to healthy young beagle dogs at 0 (placebo), 10, 20 and 40&#x000a0;mg/kg for 1&#x000a0;month (Study 1) and at 0 (placebo), 2, 4, 6 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg for 6&#x000a0;months (Study 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Relative to placebo, no significant adverse effects of robenacoxib were recorded in either study for clinical observations, clinical chemistry and hematological variables, and macroscopic or microscopic lesions at necropsy. In Study 2, additional examinations identified no adverse effects of robenacoxib on buccal bleeding time, electrocardiographic and ophthalmoscopic examinations, urinalysis or stifle joint tissues. The lack of adverse events (AEs) at doses as high as 40&#x000a0;mg/kg versus recommended doses ranging from 1 to 4&#x000a0;mg/kg indicates a high safety index of robenacoxib in dogs, attributed to a combination of its high COX-2 selectivity and short residence time in the central compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In view of its pharmacological properties, robenacoxib has the potential to provide optimal peri-operative pain control in dogs. Previous studies investigated robenacoxib for the management of peri-operative pain and inflammation in dogs undergoing various surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

We hypothesized that robenacoxib administered prior to surgery and for two additional days post-operatively would have superior analgesic effects when compared to a placebo. Efficacy was measured by success/failure criteria based on pain assessments and the need for rescue therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par18">The study was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial at 11 companion animal veterinary clinics located at various geographic locations within the USA.

Aside from needing soft tissue surgery, dogs were clinically healthy and had acceptable clinical pathology results as determined by the Investigator. Dogs meeting any of the following exclusion criteria were not enrolled in the study: those that had a known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs or sulfonamide drugs; were being used for breeding, or were pregnant or lactating; were receiving anticonvulsant, behavioral or cardiac medications; were dehydrated or were receiving concomitant diuretic therapy; had existing cardiovascular, gastrointestinal tract, hepatic and/or renal dysfunction; had uncontrolled endocrine or systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or other systemic disorders (dogs requiring treatment for diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism had to be stabilized for at least 28&#x000a0;days prior to enrollment; stable status was documented by clinical pathology); within 14&#x000a0;days prior to enrollment had undergone invasive surgical procedures or procedures that would interfere with an accurate assessment of pain; had a concurrent painful condition other than the presenting condition, which could have interfered with pain assessments; had been treated with topical or systemic anti-inflammatory products such as NSAIDs within 14&#x000a0;days prior to enrollment, short-acting (systemic or local) corticosteroids within 30&#x000a0;days prior to enrollment or long-acting corticosteroids within 60&#x000a0;days prior to enrollment; had been treated with anesthetics, sedatives, tramadol or tranquilizers within 2&#x000a0;days prior to enrollment; exhibited aggressive or frightened behavior that would cause difficulty in clinical examinations, collection of clinical specimens or administration of treatments; had a known intolerance to the anesthetics used in the study or had received alternative forms of pain relief (e.g. acupressure, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, clinical therapy) within 14&#x000a0;days prior to enrollment. Dogs belonging to an employee of the sponsoring company or other animal health drug manufacturer, an Investigator or the Food and Drug Administration were also not eligible for enrollment in the study.</p><p id="Par21">Dogs meeting any of the following criteria after inclusion were withdrawn from the study: those that required pain intervention with a Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale - Short Form (CMPS-SF) score of &#x02265;6 (considered a treatment failure); exhibited an AE that compromised their ongoing treatment or the integrity of the study; were fractious and unable to continue in the study; received forbidden concomitant treatment; were affected by protocol deviation(s) that compromised the integrity of the study or a disorder that could have interfered with the evaluation of their response to treatment, or for any other reason as determined by the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor. Owners or Investigators could also decide to withdraw the dog for efficacy or safety reasons and the study could have been stopped by the Sponsor at any time point if required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Anesthesia and analgesia protocol</title><p id="Par22">All dogs were adequately hydrated prior to and during surgery. As an anesthetic pre-medication, all dogs received intravenous or intramuscular administration of butorphanol at a dose of 0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight after dosing with robenacoxib or placebo approximately 45&#x000a0;min prior to surgery. Agents including propofol, thiopental, sevoflurane and isoflurane were allowed to facilitate induction, maintenance and recovery from anesthesia. Local anesthesia was not permitted for any dog.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomization and treatment</title><p id="Par23">Dogs were formally included on Day 0 and allocated randomly to treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio in blocks of four in order of enrollment. Dogs were administered either the oral (tablet) formulation of robenacoxib (Onsior&#x000ae;, Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, USA) or placebo tablet (Elanco France, Huningue, France) once daily for 3&#x000a0;days. Robenacoxib was administered orally, as whole tablets (10&#x000a0;mg, 20&#x000a0;mg and 40&#x000a0;mg), at a target dose of 2&#x000a0;mg/kg of body weight (an inherent dose band of 2 to 4&#x000a0;mg/kg) once daily for three consecutive days. For the first dose, food was withheld overnight. For the second and third doses, robenacoxib was administered without food or with a small amount of food. The dose administered to each dog was calculated from the pre-anesthetic body weight measured at Day &#x02212;1 or Day 0. The first treatment was given approximately 45&#x000a0;min prior to surgery at the time of pre-anesthetic medication. Subsequent once daily treatments were given at approximately the same time each day. Re-dosing was performed if the dog vomited within 5&#x000a0;min of administration and the tablet was recognizable in the vomitus. If the dog vomited and the tablet was not recognizable, the dog was not re-dosed. The administration methods for the placebo tablet were the same as those described for robenacoxib tablets.</p><p id="Par24">The randomization list was computer-generated by the statistician using SAS/STAT&#x000ae; software (Version 9, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Blinding was accomplished by the identical appearance of the tablets (same formulation except that the placebo tablets had no active ingredient) and packaging in both groups, and in addition by separation of functions: a treatment administrator (i.e. dispenser) at each clinic was responsible for dispensation and administration of test items and reconciliation of used and unused products. All study site personnel were masked to treatment assignment except the dispenser.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Clinical examination and follow-up</title><p id="Par25">Clinical examinations were performed at enrollment, at scheduled study completion, in cases of early withdrawal, and for any animal which experienced a serious AE.

There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of dogs requiring rescue therapy (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.019) in favor of robenacoxib (23.28%) compared to placebo (35.65%). Furthermore, oral robenacoxib administration was well tolerated.</p><p id="Par61">The study was designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized, masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. The study was adequately powered as superiority of robenacoxib versus placebo was statistically proven for the primary outcome variable with a balanced 1:1 ratio of cases between the two treatment groups.</p><p id="Par62">All surgical procedures were performed by experienced surgeons from 11 clinics at different locations in the USA. Dogs enrolled were of various breeds and the types of soft tissue surgery performed are representative of cases in general practice. More female dogs were enrolled than male dogs due to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, i.e., including ovariohysterectomy but not castration (the later surgery type considered to be less painful) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Efforts were taken to minimize the pain potentially suffered by dogs receiving placebo. All dogs were hospitalized and received butorphanol as pre-anesthetic medication pre-operatively, there were relatively frequent obligatory observation time points and rescue (pain) therapy could be given any time at the veterinarians' discretion.</p><p id="Par63">It is generally accepted that surgery-associated pain is most severe in the early post-operative period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and then decreases with time as inflammation subsides and healing occurs. In several studies the duration of post-operative assessments did not proceed beyond 24&#x000a0;h after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or was considerably shorter, lasting only a few hours after tracheal extubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, it is recommended to start analgesic therapy before the potentially painful event rather than attempt to regain control of pain after it occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Depending on the surgery type, the perception of pain can be different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Interestingly, in our study the percentage of dogs requiring rescue therapy was highest after gastropexy in both groups indicating that pain was perceived to be more severe for this surgery type.</p><p id="Par64">Behavioral assessments were performed as accurately as manageable under practical field conditions, and pain assessments were made using the CMPS-SF. Dogs were hospitalized throughout the study and kept in a quiet location. The assessments for the primary outcome variable were based on the opinion of the clinician and not of the owner. To ensure interpretative consistency for pain assessments, the person selected to evaluate the efficacy variables was trained and was the same individual for each assessment from the Day 0 clinical baseline to study exit for a given animal. The CMPS-SF was selected as it is a validated composite scale for assessing acute pain in dogs in a hospital setting based on observations and behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, the&#x000a0;CMPS-SF provides guidance with regard to need for analgesia i.e. rescue therapy is required if the total score is 6 or greater. In this study, no case was judged by the Investigators to require rescue therapy with a CMPS-SF&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;6, although it was permitted at any time at the discretion of the Investigators.</p><p id="Par65">A limitation of the study was that analyses of the secondary outcome variables were challenging due to the unequal frequency of withdrawal of cases after administration of rescue therapy between the two groups, with the placebo group having more rescues within the first 8&#x000a0;h than those dogs treated with robenacoxib. The data were therefore analyzed using the LOCF method. The LOCF method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] has limitations, but was justified in this study since it was used for cases proactively withdrawn due to lack of efficacy and for a limited period (up to 8&#x000a0;h post-extubation).</p><p id="Par66">Robenacoxib, like other NSAIDs, decreases inflammation, but direct measurement of inflammation is generally not possible in clinical studies as the principle site of inflammation is frequently not visible. Inflammation was evaluated indirectly in our study as part of the CMPS-SF. Robenacoxib has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, evidenced from inhibition of swelling in model studies in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">The efficacy of various NSAIDs in peri-operative pain management has been investigated previously in clinical studies in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Comparison of results between studies is difficult due to different study designs, anesthetic procedures, concomitant drugs, NSAID treatment durations, types of surgeries as well as pain assessment methods. In a previous study, the efficacy of robenacoxib and meloxicam was investigated in dogs undergoing soft tissue surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The efficacy of robenacoxib was at least as good (i.e. statistically non-inferior) to the positive control, meloxicam. In that study, pain and inflammation were assessed subjectively by clinicians using the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale (GCPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; unweighted results were reported since weighting factors for the indices had not been published at the time the study was initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There were no specific criteria defined when rescue therapy should be used and no dog received such therapy. The effect of two other NSAIDs, administered as a single oral dose pre-surgery followed by 2&#x000a0;days post-surgery, for the control of pain and inflammation in soft tissue surgery in dogs was investigated in the following two studies. For firocoxib, superior efficacy versus a negative control was reported with a comparable design to our study and pain assessment using the&#x000a0;CMPS-SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The frequency of rescue therapy was 16.4% for the active and 50.0% for the negative control. For deracoxib, superior efficacy versus a placebo control was reported. The frequency of rescue therapy was 12.5% (2/16) compared to placebo 56.3% (9/16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However in that study, pain was assessed using a different method (GCPS). The incidence of rescue therapy (range 12.5 to 23.28%) in clinical trials testing NSAIDs in dogs undergoing soft tissue surgery indicates that pain is a complex phenomenon which may differ between individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and, although NSAIDs provide an important contribution to pain management, it is not surprising that NSAIDs alone may not produce optimal results. It is well established that optimal peri-operative pain management regimens should incorporate drugs from several classes i.e. multi-modal therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">Reported AEs, clinical pathology variables and results of clinical examinations by the Investigators indicated that oral administration of robenacoxib was well tolerated. The most frequently reported AEs were gastrointestinal tract disorders such as vomiting and diarrhea.</p><p id="Par69">Robenacoxib has a good safety index in healthy dogs, producing no biologically relevant toxicity at oral doses as high as 40&#x000a0;mg/kg daily for 1&#x000a0;month and up to 10&#x000a0;mg/kg daily for 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There was no evidence from this study of any toxicity of robenacoxib to target organs that are most sensitive to NSAID toxicity (gastrointestinal tract, kidney and liver). Although some statistically significant differences in clinical chemistry (BUN/creatinine ratio was higher in the robenacoxib group) and urinalysis (pH was higher in the placebo group) were found between groups, the means of all these variables remained within normal clinical ranges at the end of the study and findings were not considered to be clinically relevant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par70">Robenacoxib by oral (tablet) administration at a target dose of 2&#x000a0;mg/kg (an inherent dose band of 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;mg/kg) prior to soft tissue surgery and again once daily for up to two days after surgery was effective and well tolerated in the control of peri-operative pain and inflammation in dogs undergoing soft tissue surgeries.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Appendix</title><p id="Par78">
