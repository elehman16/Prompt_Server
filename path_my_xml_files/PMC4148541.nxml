Acute skin reactions are one of the most common side effects of radiation therapy, and prevention of this adverse event has been investigated in several studies. However, a clinically applicable, preventative treatment remains unavailable. It has been demonstrated that application of a low-power laser can promote tissue repair. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an indium gallium aluminum phosphorus (InGaAIP) laser operated at 660&#x000a0;nm in preventing radiodermatitis in women undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial. A total of 52 patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer (stages I to III) will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group to receive laser therapy (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26) or a control group to receive a placebo (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26). The laser or placebo will be applied five days a week, immediately before each radiotherapy session. Skin reactions will then be graded weekly by a nurse, a radiotherapist, and an oncologist (all of whom will be blinded) using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) developed by the National Cancer Institute and the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Patients will also answer a modified visual analogue scale for pain (a self-evaluation questionnaire). Primary and secondary outcomes will be the prevention of radiodermatitis and pain secondary to radiodermatitis, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The ideal tool for preventing radiodermatitis is an agent that mediates DNA repair or promotes cell proliferation. Application of a low-power laser has been shown to promote tissue repair by reducing inflammation and inducing collagen synthesis. Moreover, this treatment approach has not been associated with adverse events and is cost-effective. Thus, the results of this ongoing trial may establish whether use of a low-power laser represents an ideal treatment option for the prevention of radiodermatitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02003599?term=NCT02003599&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02003599</ext-link>.

Interventions to reduce this adverse side effect are needed since radiodermatitis may impact a patient&#x02019;s adherence to treatment, and, with increased severity, can lead to the discontinuation of a potentially curative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Acute radiodermatitis is a reaction caused by secondary skin exposure to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation impairs the ability of cells to proliferate quickly, and this leads to a skin reaction. This complex process involves DNA damage and changes in proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. At the tissue level, this injury to the skin includes basal cell destruction and depletion of skin cells. As the migration of basal cells to the skin surface is compromised by radiation, flaking of the skin develops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Initially manifesting as erythema between the first and fourth weeks of radiation treatment, this condition can progress to ulceration up to three months after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Known risk factors for radiodermatitis include total radiation dose, fractionation scheme, type of equipment used, volume of tissue irradiated (such as breast volume), and the radiosensitivity of the tissues involved. It is believed that patient-related factors, such as smoking habit, chronic diseases (including diabetes mellitus), and concomitant anticancer treatment can also interfere with skin reactions by affecting the healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Prevention of this adverse event has been investigated in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, there is currently no clinically applicable prophylaxis available. As suggested by the Cancer Care Ontario Guidelines, the efficacy of topical agents remains controversial as well, and there is not sufficient evidence to indicate a prophylactic regimen using these agents for radiodermatitis.</p><p>Bolderston <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] conducted a systematic review on the prevention and management of acute skin reactions related to radiation therapy. Unfortunately, the trials included in this systematic review were highly heterogeneous (the trials evaluated different kinds of treatments such as topical steroid creams, washing practices, sucralfate, Biafine cream, oral enzymes, amifostine, topical acid cream, aloe vera, chamomile cream, and dressings), and they concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support or refute specific topical or oral agents for the prevention or management of acute skin reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although various topical agents have been used to treat acute skin reactions, there is not sufficient evidence to establish a standardized recommendation for their application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In 2012, Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] performed a meta-analysis on the use of topical agent therapy for the prevention and treatment of radiodermatitis. They concluded that topical agents could not prevent or treat radiodermatitis, probably because the topical agents chosen did not address the pathophysiology of radiodermatitis. An ideal agent for the prevention of radiodermatitis would mediate the repair of DNA damage or promote cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>It was demonstrated that the cumulative effect of a low-power laser, when used at the appropriate dose, promoted tissue repair, possibly due to reduced inflammation and to the induction of collagen synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Specifically, laser treatment had a positive effect on injured fibroblasts by directly stimulating their growth, by affecting the expression of genes related to cell migration, DNA repair, ion channels, membrane potential, and cellular metabolism. It is hypothesized that the sum of these events contribute to ulcer healing through an increase in collagen synthesis, microcirculation, and suppression of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The application of a low-power laser for the prevention of oral mucositis is already well-established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, the application of laser treatments to patients with breast cancer has also been found to be safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and this method currently represents an option for treatment of lymphedema, a side effect of the surgical treatment of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis demonstrated that there are no side effects due to use of a laser during these treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Previously, only one study has investigated the use of photomodulation by using light emitting diodes (LEDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, breast cancer patients were treated with radiation therapy following a lumpectomy, and LED photomodulation treatments were administered immediately following intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). These photomodulation treatments were found to reduce the incidence of skin reactions having a National Cancer Institute (NCI) grading of 1, 2, or 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>When laser therapy was applied to oral mucositis secondary to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the incidence of grade 3 mucositis was reduced from 35.22 to 7.62% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that laser treatments may also represent a prophylaxis for radiodermatitis, particularly since there is currently no effective treatment for this side effect of radiotherapy. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial was designed to assess the effectiveness of laser therapy for the prevention of radiodermatitis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study aims</title><p>The primary aim is to evaluate whether an indium gallium aluminum phosphorus (InGaAIP) laser operated at 660&#x000a0;nm can minimize the occurrence of radiodermatitis in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy.

We were not able to find data from breast cancer patients to use in the sample size calculation, thus it was performed based on data from the study of Bensadoun <italic>et al</italic>., which used a low-energy He/Ne laser to prevent radiation-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These authors found not only a reduction in mucositis grade 3 (35.22% occurrence in control group versus 7.62% in laser group), but also a reduction in oral pain as assessed by patients, due to the preventive use of laser application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Female patients older than 18&#x000a0;years of age with a histological diagnosis of breast cancer (stages I to III) who underwent breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy without breast reconstruction with proposed adjuvant conventional radiotherapy according to the clinical protocol of Hospital do Cancer de Barretos (at full volume: &#x02018;hot spot&#x02019; &#x02264;115%, according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU)) will be enrolled in this trial.</p><p>All patients will undergo radiotherapy according to the radiotherapy protocol of Hospital do Cancer de Barretos.

In patients where this is not possible (patients radiating supraclavicular fossa), the nipple will be used as reference point for the center; and, in mastectomy patients, the midpoint between the tattoos will be used (as routine for radiation therapy, the patients undergoing radiation therapy in the hospital are routinely tattooed in two points, mid-axillary line and sternal; its midpoint roughly corresponds to nipple&#x02019;s localization).</p><p>Patients allocated to the intervention group will receive laser treatments using a Photon Laser III (DMC&#x02122;, S&#x000e3;o Carlos - SP, Brazil), approved by ANVISA (Ag&#x000ea;ncia Nacional de Vigil&#x000e2;ncia Sanit&#x000e1;ria) for medicinal purposes. This InGaAIP laser emits a pulsed 660&#x000a0;nm beam with contact, with an average output of 80&#x000a0;mW. The laser energy is 3&#x000a0;J, with a power density of 80&#x000a0;mW and a dose emission of 108&#x000a0;J/cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The distribution of the light beam in the marking will be on points with a radius of 1&#x000a0;cm. Clinical and demographic data will be collected before the first radiotherapy session, including schemes of chemotherapy, breast volume, smoking habit, chronic diseases, and concomitant anticancer treatment, as they are factors that can interfere with the development of radiodermatitis.</p><p>After the second week of radiotherapy, patients will be evaluated for radiodermatitis weekly, after the laser or placebo application. They will also complete a modified visual analogue scale for pain (a patient self-evaluation questionnaire, validated for use in Brazil) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Skin reactions and pain will be continue to be graded weekly until the end of treatment, and this evaluation will be independently performed by three previously trained evaluators: a nurse, a radiation oncologist, and an oncologist. The Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC 4.0), developed by the NCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] will be used as guidelines.</p><p>The CTC was first described in 1982 and the version we will is the 4.0. It classifies radiodermatitis in degrees: 1 (faint erythema or dry desquamation), 2 (moderate to brisk erythema; patch moist desquamation, mostly confined to skin folds and creases; moderate edema), 3 (moist desquamation in areas other than skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion), 4 (life-threatening consequences; skin necrosis or ulceration of full thickness dermis; spontaneous bleeding from involved site; skin graft indicated) and 5 (death) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Also in 1982, The RTOG developed the Criterion score for Acute Radiation Morbidity - Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria, to classify the effects of radiotherapy. This criterion identifies grades 0 (no change over baseline), 1 (follicular faint or dull erythema, epilation, dry desquamation, decreased sweating), 2 (tender or bright erythema, patchy moist desquamations, moderate edema), 3 (confluent, moist desquamation other than skin folds, pitting edema) and 4 (ulceration, hemorrhage, necrosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The visual analogue scale for pain was adapted and validated for use in Brazil by Ferraz <italic>et al</italic>.

Moreover, this adverse event can represent a significant source of pain or discomfort and can lead to limited daily activities, a decrease in quality of life, decreased patient adherence to treatment, or even an interruption of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Consequently, it is important that efforts be made to prevent radiodermatitis.</p><p>Low-power laser treatments have been well-established for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis and for the treatment of lymphedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, according to a recent meta-analysis on radiation-induced mucositis, low-level laser therapy at a dose of 2 to 3&#x000a0;J/cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] that was administered in daily applications, or at least three times a week, did not result in any adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Regarding lymphedema, a recent systematic review presented moderate to strong evidence that low-level laser treatments are effective for the management of this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For the 230 patients analyzed, a dose of 1 to 2&#x000a0;J/cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] per point applied, with several points covering the fibrotic area, reduced limb volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, Carati <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study with 61 patients who underwent mastectomy and then developed lymphedema. There were 28 patients in the placebo group and 33 patients in the treatment group. For the latter, a 904&#x000a0;nm RianCorp LTU 904H laser was applied to 17 points at 2&#x000a0;cm intervals (using a plastic guide) in the region of the axilla for each patient. For the placebo group, the laser unit was deactivated and no radiation was delivered. Moreover, this unit was indistinguishable from the active unit. The total energy applied was 1.5&#x000a0;J/cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and this treatment was found to reduce the volume of arm lymphedema in 31% of the patients that completed three months of this treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Despite all the training conducted for the grading of radiodermatitis, the CTC and RTOG&#x02019;s scales are dependent on observers, and this may lead to a grading bias. Unfortunately we cannot completely eliminate subjectivity in evaluating the radiodermatitis grade.</p><p>In the absence of clinical guidelines for the prevention of radiodermatitis, treatment of this side effect of radiation remains a challenge. However, based on the effectiveness of laser treatments for the prevention of oral mucositis, a clinical trial to investigate the beneficial application of laser treatments as a prophylaxis for radiodermatitis was established. It is possible that the results of this trial may provide a standard treatment for the prevention of acute skin reactions that develop following radiotherapy.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment began on April 2014, and it is ongoing.
