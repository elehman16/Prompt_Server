bands on respiratory function in children with cerebral palsy. [Subjects and Methods]
Fifteen children were divided into two groups: the experimental (n=8) and control (n=7)
groups. Both groups performed general exercises for 30 minutes per session, two times a
week during the intervention period. The experimental group performed an additional upper
extremity resistance exercise with elastic bands for 20&#x02013;30 minutes per session, twice
weekly for 8 weeks. Pulmonary function, and respiratory muscle and grip strength were
measured before and after the exercise. [Results] There was no significant difference in
forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, the ratio of forced
expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow before
and after the intervention in either group. The increment of maximal expiratory pressure
was significantly greater in the experimental group, compared with the control group. In
addition, grip strength was significantly increased in the experimental group after the
intervention than before. [Conclusion] We found that upper extremity resistance exercise
with elastic bands has a positive effect on expiration and improves grip strength in
children with cerebral palsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity resistance exercise</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy is characterized by impaired motor function and posture in children due to
prenatal or postnatal brain damage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Children with cerebral palsy not only have musculoskeletal deformities, including joint
contracture, shortened muscle, and muscle dystrophy, but also compromised respiratory
function such as reduced pulmonary volume due to weakness in respiratory muscles and
asymmetric chest growth, which can increase the rate of respiratory system infection and
mortality<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, respiratory muscles in the chest and abdomen do not
activate properly during respiration. As a result, they show abnormal respiratory patterns
where the inspiratory and expiratory muscles contract together during inspiration, instead
of the expiratory muscles relaxing when inspiratory muscles contract<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts excessively to
compensate for weakened respiratory muscles, which causes the chest to show a concave funnel
shape from the lower ribs expanding outward and the sternum collapsing, because they cannot
withstand the strong pulling force<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Moreover, inability to discharge foreign substances and secretions from the airway and
ventilation difficulties due to weakened respiratory muscles may cause pneumonia as well as
other respiratory complications<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Abnormal respiratory patterns and restricted chest movement in these children cause
irregular and rough respiration, which affects the respiratory muscles and pulmonary
function, leading to a gradual deterioration of their respiratory function if proper
prevention and treatment measures are not taken<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therapeutic interventions addressing weakened respiratory muscle
strength can build-up exercise tolerance and reduce shortness of breath<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In particular, respiratory muscle strengthening interventions in this patient population
predominantly target the respiratory muscles, such as trunk belts directly being applied to
respiratory muscles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, feedback respiratory
exercise using respiratory muscle training equipment<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and applying functional electro-stimulation on the rectus abdominis
muscle<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, to improve pulmonary
function in these children with restricted chest movement, it is necessary to not only
increase respiratory muscle strength, but also chest mobility.</p><p>Applying resistance during upper extremity flexion, abduction, and external rotation
activates major respiratory muscles, the diaphragm, and intercostal muscles<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as respiratory accessory muscles,
the pectoralis major, and serratus anterior<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, expanding the chest to affect respiratory
function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. To our knowledge,
interventions using elastic bands have been predominantly used to improve range-of-motion,
balance, and strength, and data are lacking on the effects of resistance with elastic bands
on the respiratory function of children with cerebral palsy<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies evaluating the impact of upper extremity resistance
exercise on the respiratory function of this patient population are also lacking.</p><p>The objective of our study was to examine the effects of upper extremity resistance
exercise using elastic bands on the respiratory function of children with cerebral
palsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>We evaluated children with cerebral palsy undergoing exercise therapy at a rehabilitation
social welfare center at &#x0201c;U&#x0201d; City in Korea. Children were eligible for study inclusion if
they had cerebral palsy with: 1) Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) grade
I&#x02013;III; 2) Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) grade I&#x02013;III; 3) did not receive any
other respiratory treatment; and 4) were capable of fully understanding and following the
instructions provided by the researcher to measure respiratory function. Overall, 15
children met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Eight children were
randomized to the experimental group and 7, the control group. The mean age, height, and
weight was 9.25 &#x000b1; 3.65&#x02005;years, 122.01 &#x000b1; 20.37&#x02005;cm, and 29.60 &#x000b1; 14.79&#x02005;kg in the experimental
group and 9.57 &#x000b1; 4.54&#x02005;years, 125.86 &#x000b1; 23.93&#x02005;cm, and 32.71 &#x000b1; 20.88&#x02005;kg in the control group,
respectively. No significant differences were found between the groups. Informed consent was
sought from the patients and guardians to participate in the study. All protocols were
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University of Pusan (CUPIRB-2015&#x02013;025).</p><p>A professionally trained therapist provided 8 weeks of neurodevelopmental treatment to
children in both groups, each session lasted 30&#x02005;min. Children in the experimental group
received an additional 8 weeks of upper extremity resistance exercise with elastic bands,
20&#x02013;30&#x02005;min per session, and 2 sessions weekly, concurrent with the neurodevelopment
treatment. The upper extremity exercise included an elastic band (Thera-Band<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>,
Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH, USA) and involved sitting in a chair without arm rests or a
back rest, with the knees of the child strapped together to prevent them from coming apart.
The patient grasp the elastic band fully expanding the chest by moving the upper extremity
in flexion, abduction, and external rotation direction without elbow flexion.</p><p>In weeks 1 and 2, the elastic band was set to stretch by 80% and 2 sets of 10 repetitions
per set were performed. In weeks 3 and 4, the elastic band was set to stretch 100% and 2
sets were performed. In weeks 5 and 6, 3 sets were performed, while in weeks 7 and 8, 4 sets
were performed. A 1-minute rest period was provided between each set and the exercise was
discontinued immediately if the participant experienced any breathing difficulties or
discomfort during the exercise. The exercise was performed with the same intensity for 10
repetitions using the band appropriate for the number of repetitive motions based on the
recommendations of the manufacturer. The therapist supervised the exercise and ensured that
the participants maintained proper posture and the direction of exercise was accurate, as
well as provided feedback regarding the accuracy of the exercise.</p><p>A spirometer (Pony Fx, CosmedSrl, Italy) was used to measure forced vital capacity (FVC),
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), maximal
inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and a hand grip
dynamometer (T.T.K.5401,Takei, Japan) was used to measure grip strength before and after the
intervention to each group. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). After the normality test, the results were analyzed using
non-parametric statistics. Differences within each group before and after the experiment
were analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, and differences in means between two groups
were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical significance levels were set to
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Comparisons of pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and grip strength between

respiratory function in children with cerebral palsy using elastic bands. We found that FVC,
FEV1, and PEF increased by 6%, 15%, and 23% in the experimental group, respectively,
although the trends were not statistically significant. The increase in FVC we observed may
have been attributed to increased muscle activity in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, a
respiratory accessory muscle, during resistance exercise with the elastic bands<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This in turn may have increased FVC,
increasing pulmonary volume by lifting the chest upward during inspiration<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. After the intervention, MIP and MEP
increased by 5% and 14% in the experimental group, respectively, whereas MIP and MEP
decreased by 8% and 20% in the control group. However, these changes were not statistically
significant. We believe this was the case because the children included in our study had
diminished muscle coordination from musculoskeletal deformities, chest asymmetry, and
weakened respiratory muscles.</p><p>However, the experimental group that received the intervention showed an increase in MEP,
whereas the control group showed a decrease in MEP; no significant change was seen between
the groups. We believe that the reason why MEP increased in the experimental group was due
to the activation of the rectus abdominis muscle as resistance exercise was performed with
the upper extremity while being lifted up. Stability in the trunk must be achieved to
perform the intervention, which involved flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the
upper extremity<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. To maintain trunk stability, the diaphragm, intercostal, oblique
abdominis, and rectus abdominis muscles must contract simultaneously, because these muscles
are responsible for expiration and inspiration<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. MEP decreased in the control group, which suggested that even
without direct intervention on the respiratory muscles, lack of interest in improving
respiratory function can have a future negative effect on the respiratory function and not
performing respiration-related exercise can cause rapid decrease in respiratory muscle
strength<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we believe that
continued respiratory physical therapy intervention is needed for the prevention and
improvement of respiratory issues in children with cerebral palsy. Moreover, increased
expiratory muscle strength during respiration can improve the act of coughing, which can
help discharge foreign substances and secretions from the airway, and to prevent pneumonia
and other respiratory complications<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study that investigated the correlation between grip strength and respiratory muscles
in the elderly, muscle strength was found to be positively correlated with MIP and MEP
(r=0.35, r=0.26), while the regression analysis results showed that grip strength was one of
the factors for MIP and peak cough flow (PCF)<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The experimental group showed a significant increase of 9% in grip
strength from pre- to post-intervention. Respiratory muscle strength is associated with
extremity muscles, and in particular, grip strength can represent the overall physical
strength<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Grip strength is affected
by the stability in the shoulder girdle near the shoulder joint. Stability in the shoulder
girdle is involved in chest movement during respiration and controls the intra-abdominal
pressure used by respiratory accessory muscles<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study that examined 17 children with cerebral palsy also
reported that grip strength was highly correlated with pulmonary function and respiratory
muscle strength<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. These data indicate
that increased grip strength in children with cerebral palsy activate respiratory accessory
muscles to have a positive effect on improving respiratory function.</p><p>Altogether, our results demonstrate that applying upper extremity resistance exercise with
elastic band activates respiratory accessory muscles, increases grip strength, and has a
positive impact on the respiratory function of children with cerebral palsy. However, since
the sample size was small and there were limitations in participant selection based on types
of cerebral palsy, continued studies and intervention with these issues resolved are needed
for improving the respiratory function of children with cerebral palsy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bax</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenbaum</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>Executive Committee for the Definition of Cerebral Palsy:
