Effective vector control via large-scale use of long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS) in combination with prompt and effective management of malaria cases, contributed largely to the malaria decline worldwide. However, residual malaria transmission caused by early evening and outdoor biting vectors is not covered by present vector control interventions [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172566.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, additional vector control tools such as topical repellents need to be evaluated to further advance malaria elimination [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172566.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>A large-scale cluster randomized trial (MalaResT project) was set-up to evaluate the epidemiological impact of topical repellents in addition to the existing vector control measures (LLIN only) in the province of Ratanakiri in Cambodia [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To achieve community protection, mass distribution and use of repellents was promoted in the intervention arm aiming to reduce the residual malaria transmission. For over 50 years, DEET has been the most popular insect repellent worldwide. More recently, a synthetic component, namely picaridin, has been developed and is now also endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this study, picaridin was chosen as the repellent for its safety profile and excellent efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172566.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, compared to DEET,[<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172566.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] it has a higher acceptability in terms of odor perception and does not affect plastic materials [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172566.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Besides a randomized trial showing no adverse neurologic, gastrointestinal, or dermatologic effects among pregnant women applying daily DEET and no adverse effects on survival, growth, or development at birth or at one year among their babies [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], safety information of commonly used repellents mainly comes from studies conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers from high income countries when used for personal protection [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172566.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We found no single study providing detailed safety information of repellent use when this is massively introduced in the community as part of a public health intervention. In contrast with earlier studies whereby short term exposure was assessed, the use of a topical repellent as a malaria control intervention implies daily skin application during an entire malaria season. Importantly, the tolerance and safety of the employed repellents might critically determine adherence to their use and hence also the effectiveness of the intervention. The aim of this study was to report on safety issues during the mass introduction of the picaridin repellent. Specifically, we report on the frequency of adverse reactions (ARs) reported individually in an expedited manner, and of perceived side effects reported per family during the two-weekly bottle exchanges.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study area and population</title><p>This study was part of a cluster randomized trial (MalaResT project), conducted in 113 hilly and mountainous villages in Ratanakiri province, eastern part of Cambodia, from January 2012 to December 2013.

An extensive reporting system was put in place to detect AEs associated with the use of the repellent, applied twice daily for an extended period of time. On a total of about 25,000 individual repellent users from the intervention arm, only 22 &#x02013;less than one in thousand&#x02014;ARs related to cutaneous repellent use and 11 cases of repellent abuse were reported.</p><p>The ARs related to topical use of the repellent occurred during the first few months after the introduction of the repellent in the population, and mostly during the first two weeks of use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172566.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Contact or irritant dermatitis is indeed to be expected within the first days or weeks of use, and individuals with such reactions generally discontinued repellent use. Inappropriate repellent use during the early stages of the project might have contributed to some of the ARs. As observed during field visits, some individuals continued, sometimes encouraged by their distributor to use the repellent despite skin reactions, and this apparently led to progressive worsening. Only 326 (5.6%) of families were recorded by the distributors to discontinue the use of the repellent during the trial.</p><p>Repellent abuse (either accidental or suicide attempt) is another concern for community level interventions. Children and particularly young boys were at risk for accidental ingestion of the product. All suicide attempts occurred in young women, which is in line with the fact that within the region, women are more likely to attempt suicide and to use less-violent methods [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172566.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The insect repellent DEET has been associated with neurotoxic effects such as seizures, although causality was difficult to demonstrate [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As to picaridin, no neurotoxicity or lethal effect have been reported in animal experiments and individual human experience [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172566.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our findings demonstrate that hallucinations and unconsciousness can occur after ingestion of high amounts of picaridin (2&#x02013;3 bottles, 200&#x02013;300 ml), but reassuringly this resolved completely with supportive treatment. There was one case of intentional abuse in a pregnant woman, who delivered a healthy baby. In animal experiments, maternal effects such as increased liver weights were observed with application of picaridin, but no toxic effects on the fetuses was detected [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In 2013, there was an intensification of the health promotion campaigns, and concurrently more perceived side effects were reported. Similarly, within each year, periods with more repellent use appeared to be associated with more perceived side effects and families reporting side effects also had a lower average repellent consumption. We note however that the increased reporting of side effects during the second year was largely explained by increased reporting of headache, dizziness and bad smell, while the frequency of skin manifestations remained fairly stable across the two years. Importantly, there were no indications of cumulative toxicity in our study, whereby side effects would have started emerging only after prolonged use. This is reassuring for a malaria control intervention which implies daily administration possibly over a period of several years.</p><p>Bad smell associated with headache and dizziness, has been reported related to agrochemical products [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In a comparative study performed in Malaysia participants felt more comfortable with the odor of picaridin as compared to DEET [<xref rid="pone.0172566.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As preferences in smell can vary extensively geographically and across societies, adapting the repellent&#x02019;s perfume to local preferences might be a way to improve adherence.</p><p>Our findings need to be interpreted in the specific context of the study. First, the reported findings were observed during a cluster-randomized trial, whereby due efforts were done to carefully inform users about the appropriate use and what to do in case of AEs, and whereby users were closely monitored for intolerance. We also note that we did not collect information on AEs and perceived side effects in the control arm, since no placebo was used. This makes it obviously difficult to causally link the spontaneously reported symptoms to the repellent use, and our findings are thus most likely an overestimation. Finally, the aggregation at the family level of data on perceived side effects precluded more detailed individual level analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, we found ARs during mass introduction of the picaridin insect repellent to be uncommon and generally mild. All the 22 ARs reported, amongst over 25,000 individual users occurred during the first few months of the study. Oral repellent abuse was also uncommon but occurred throughout the two years. Hence, control programs employing mass repellent use should be particularly prepared to detect and manage ARs at the time of program onset and cases of repellent abuse remain throughout. While one in five families reported any side effect, few families discontinued repellent use.
