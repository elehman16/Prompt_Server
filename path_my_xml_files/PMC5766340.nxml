&#x02002;Patients with malignant tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract are at risk of weight loss. Early supportive nutrition therapy is therefore recommended and usually requires placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The aim of this study was to compare adverse events and usage characteristics of the direct puncture technique with those of the traditional pull technique when used in patients with endoscopically passable tumors. The primary endpoint was the rate of inflammatory adverse events (AEs) at the gastrostomy fistula. The secondary endpoint was the long-term rate of puncture-site metastases.
</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>
&#x02002;One hundred twenty patients (median age 56; IQR 36, 86 years) were randomized and treated per protocol in this prospective open randomized single-center study. Follow-ups were conducted on the third and seventh post-interventional days, after 1, 3 and 6 months and the last follow-up 5 years after intervention.
</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>
&#x02002;Within the short-term follow-up period of 6 months after PEG placement, AEs were noted in 47 patients (39.2&#x0200a;%). These included 22 inflammations and 16 device dislocations and were mainly found in the puncture group (33 vs. 14 in the pull group) with a significantly increased incidence in the first month after PEG insertion (
<italic>P</italic>
&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001). Evaluation of the 5-year data did not reveal any significant differences. The gastrostomy tube was used in 101 patients (84.2&#x0200a;%) (range 18 days to 5 years).
</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>
&#x02002;Our results favor the pull technique for patients with endoscopically passable tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract due to less short-term adverse events. Both systems contributed equally to secure long-term use.

Due to local and systemic tumor effects and as a consequence of tumor-specific therapy, 30&#x0200a;% to 80&#x0200a;% of patients with tumors lose weight. Patients with tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract are particularly at risk of weight loss due to impaired chewing and swallowing. Consequently, malnutrition correlates with impaired prognosis
<xref rid="JR930-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
. ESPEN Guidelines on Enteral Nutrition suggest that supportive nutrition therapy should be started only if malnutrition is already present (BMI&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;18.5) or if the patient is unable to consume less than 60&#x0200a;% of the required daily energy intake over a period of more than 7 to 10 days
<xref rid="JR930-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
. If low nutrient supply is expected to last longer than 2 to 3 weeks, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) should be favored over nasoenteric systems
<xref rid="JR930-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
. One advantage of this method is the long viability and turnaround time largely due to the safe fixation of the tube by intragastric and extragastric retention plates. The most common PEG technique is the pull technique, which was first described in 1980 by Gauderer et al. After conventional esophagogastroduodenoscopy and percutanous puncture of the stomach, a feeding tube with an intragastrically placed retention plate passes the upper digestive tract
<xref rid="JR930-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
. As a modification, with the introducer technique, the tube is placed via Seldinger technique using a guidewire.
</p><p>
A unique adverse event (AE) of PEG insertion in patients with head and neck cancer is tumor seeding and formation of stromal metastases on the abdominal wall and viscera, especially the stomach. That was first described by Preyer and Thul in 1989
<xref rid="JR930-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
. In a review of all 44 reported cases, Cappell concluded that strong risk factors for stomal metastases included primary pharynx-esophageal cancer, squamous cell histology, less differentiated tumor, large size and advanced cancer stage, PEG placement by the pull technique, untreated primary cancer with local recurrence and at a time &#x0003e;&#x0200a;3 months after PEG insertion
<xref rid="JR930-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
. Several authors have recommended use of direct endoscopic introducer technique (Russell&#x02019;s technique) or insertion under radiological guidance to help avoid this dreaded AE

Until now there have been only a few comparative studies related to PEG placement by means of the pull technique or the direct puncture technique. Most of them were retrospective and did not reveal consistent results

<xref rid="JR930-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
. Almost all studies enrolled in a recent meta-analysis were observational studies without randomization of insertion methods, and none of the groups were matched exactly
<xref rid="JR930-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
. Although gastrostomy has been widely used, there is a lack of randomized trials on this issue.
</p><p>In accordance with the state of evidence at the time of initiation of our study, we hypothesised that the puncture technique would decrease the frequency of inflammatory AEs and rate of formation of metastases at the gastrostomy fistula in patients with tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we investigated in an open prospective trial whether application of the direct puncture technique (Freka-PEXACT-System) is superior to the pull technique. Moreover, we aimed to compare the usage characteristics in the long term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The primary endpoint was the rate of inflammatory AEs in the area of the gastrostomy fistula. The working hypothesis postulated that use of the Freka-PEXACT-System during placement of a PEG in patients with epithelial tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract or the larynx would reduce the rate of inflammatory AEs in the gastrostomy area as compared to PEG placement using the pull technique as the PEG device would not be in direct contact with the microbiome of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Under the assumption that bypassing the upper gastrointestinal tract via the Freka-PEXACT-System would reduce the frequency of metastases, the frequency of metastases in the stoma area was defined as the secondary endpoint of the study.</p><p>
The study was conducted as a monocenter, open, randomized, prospective trial at Leipzig
University. Recruitment took place over 18 months and started in January 2007. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria are listed in
<bold>Box</bold>
. Assignment into the pull group (traditional PEG placement using the pull technique) or into the puncture group (PEG placement using the Freka-PEXACT-System) was continuous and changed on a monthly base. This resulted in well balanced patient assignments to both groups (
<xref rid="TB930-1" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;1</xref>
). The study participants were examined over a median period of 53 months (minimum/maximum 1 month/101 months, interquartile range 12.75; 96 months) after PEG placement. The study protocol was voted on favorably by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Leipzig.

After patients&#x02019; approval via written consent for participation in the study and diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy, PEG placement was performed under sterile conditions and 2&#x0200a;g ceftriaxon were administered intravenously for antibiotic prophylaxis for 30 to 60 minutes during the pre-interventional period. A skin shave was done if appropriate and the patients were placed in a supine position. We did not carry disinfect the oral cavity or decontaminate the gut with antibiotics. Propofol sedation was used in all cases. A 1-cm skin incision prior to insertion of the PEG was done after transillumination in all patients. For the
<bold>pull technique</bold>
, we used Freka PEG 15 Charier (Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Fixation of the PEG tube was reinforced by means of an interior and exterior retention plate without sutures.
</p><p>
For PEG placement using the direct
<bold>puncture technique</bold>
, we used the Freka-PEXACT-System (Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg, Germany). In brief, this required prior safe fixation of the stomach front wall to the abdominal wall. For that purpose, 2 gastropexies were performed and placed laterally to the puncture site using a gastropexy device in accordance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Following the stab incision, a trocar and, subsequently, a pull-away sleeve were inserted over which a balloon probe was placed and fixed by filling the balloon with 5&#x0200a;mL of sterile water. Four weeks later, this was replaced with a permanent Freka Button 15 Charier (Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg, Germany, filled with 5&#x0200a;mL of sterile saline). For that purpose, the gastropexy stitches were removed and the feeding tube was exchanged percutaneously using a guidewire.
</p><p>Follow-up for observation of early AEs was conducted on the Days 3, 7 and 21 post-intervention. To include possible late AEs, further follow-up was carried out after 1, 3 and 6 months and a last follow-up 5 years after intervention.</p><p>The occurrence of inflammatory AEs at the PEG placement site was determined both clinically and anatomically. The occurrence of local signs of inflammation was also recorded.</p><p>Subjective patient satisfaction with the feeding tube was estimated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) on which patients marked the level of their satisfaction along a 100-mm straight line.</p><p>Computer-facilitated scoring and graphic representation of the collected data were performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and SPSS 15.0 for Microsoft Windows. The following techniques were used for statistical evaluation: Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, Wilcoxon test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, logrank test, as appropriate.</p><p>This trial was not registered through any of the registries approved by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors as this was not mandatory at the time of initiation of our study in 2007.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>
One hundred thirty-eight patients were screened for this study and 120 of them were randomized (

Contrary to our hypothesis, we demonstrated that the innovative direct puncture device is associated with a higher rate of short-term PEG-related AEs in comparison with the traditional pull technique. This was not associated, however, with a reduced usage rate or impaired patient satisfaction.</p><p>
Our prospectively observed patient cohort experienced a low rate of inflammatory AEs (15.5&#x0200a;% and 21&#x0200a;% in the pull and the puncture group, respectively). This is lower than reported in a recent retrospective study of 1625 patients (median follow-up 254 days) from 8 Korean hospitals, who received a pull technique PEG. In this study, 81.1&#x0200a;% of all patients had a PEG inflammation
<xref rid="JR930-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
. This remarkable difference may be explained by the fact that our study used strict prophylactic antibiotic supplementation
<xref rid="JR930-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
and the PEG procedure was carried out in a specialized endoscopy unit using established standard operating procedures. We believe that our favorable results are not due to underreporting as all patients were carefully followed by experienced nutrition assistants and a standardized protocol was used.
</p><p>
The direct puncture technique was associated with a longer procedure time. This is well in accord with a recently published retrospective comparative case series of 113 patients
<xref rid="JR930-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
and may simply be explained by the time-consuming performance of the 2 additional gastropexies aside the PEG. Our detailed subgroup analysis, however, revealed that the difference in procedure duration actually stems from the underweight and T1 tumor groups. The pull technique was faster in low-weight patients with sparse visceral fat and even small and less obstructing T1 tumors. Obstruction of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a relevant factor only for the pull technique as all tumors had to be passable by a standard gastroscope as per protocol. Consequently, the puncture technique was equally time-consuming in all T stages. Longer intervention times in the puncture group were not associated with higher propofol doses or peri-interventional adverse events. Therefore, this difference will not be present in most patients with tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract and is of limited clinical relevance in low-weight and T1 tumor patients.
</p><p>
A secondary endpoint of our study was the comparison of tumor seeding at the PEG insertion site. Several authors have advocated the puncture technique on the grounds that it prevented implantation metastases. However, case reports show that PEG insertion using this technique does not eliminate the risk of direct tumor seeding
<xref rid="JR930-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="JR930-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="JR930-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
. A possible explanation for the occurrence of tumor seeding could be that the gastroscope tip implants cells directly into the gastric wall during transillumination. It could also be the result of swallowed tumor cells settling into the fresh gastric wound, which would have caused the metastases to occur regardless of the method of PEG insertion. Fortunately, none of the patients in our study developed a PEG metastasis. Nevertheless, we support previous authors&#x02019; advice to avoid passage of the gastroscope deep into the stomach. This may help to avoid direct contact with the gastric wall during transillumination to prevent inadvertent seeding of the primary tumor to the PEG wound
<xref rid="JR930-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
.
</p><p>During the follow-up period of 4.5 years (median), randomization to the pull or the puncture technique had no influence on the usage characteristics. About 5 of 6 patients who received a PEG used it over the long term without any differences in usage characteristics between the 2 devices used in this study. A scheduled PEG removal after finishing multimodal tumor therapy was possible in more than 40&#x0200a;% of our patients. With regard to quality of life, the puncture technique could have an advantage over the pull technique as it does not require another endoscopy for PEG removal. However, that question has not been addressed in this trial.</p><p>
The Freka PEG, which was used for the pull technique, was manufactured with polyurethane, whereas the Freka-PEXACT was manufactured with synthetic silicone rubber.&#x0200a;Both materials are highly bio- and tissue compatible. Theoretically, there is slightly more irritation with silicone-based tubes because of the roughness of the surface, but in clinical practice, insufficient sealing due to incorrect use or maintenance errors may be superimposed on this factor. Differences between the materials, therefore, may be more reflective of optical or functional aspects (color changes, occlusion etc.) than relevant to AEs. A minor bias especially for the endpoint &#x0201c;rubor,&#x0201d; however, could be conceivable

.
</p><p>We have not assessed glucose tolerance status in our patients. That may be a weakness of our protocol as uncontrolled diabetes is a risk factor for wound infection. Albumin was not measured systematically and there only BMI can be used as an objective measure of nutrition. Howeve4r, BMI had no influence on any PEG complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results favor the pull technique for application of a PEG in patients with endoscopically passable tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract due to fewer short-term AEs. Both the pull and the puncture system contributed equally to secure long-term use and patient satisfaction. The individual choice of an appropriate technique should be based on the patient&#x02019;s informed consent, individual factors such as BMI or tumor size, and the operator&#x02019;s experience and the facilities available.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>
