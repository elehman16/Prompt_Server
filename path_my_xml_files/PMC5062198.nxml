The addition of adjuvant not only augments the anesthetic action of the drug but also reduces the dose required thus improving the safety margin. Levobupivacaine is a new local anesthetic drug which has established itself as a safer anesthetic.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There are only few studies which have further tried to assess its safety and effectiveness in regional anesthesia when admixed with adjuvants. However, no single drug can be considered as an ideal adjuvant to the local anesthetic. In a quest to find a better alternative, numerous research studies have been done but with varying success. The focus keeps on shifting to newer adjuvants in daily anesthesia practice to fulfil these desirable goals of regional anesthesia.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist, is increasingly being used nowadays for regional anesthesia and intravenous (i.v.) anesthesia (Bier's block),[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] attenuation of pressor response, i.v. sedation and analgesia for mechanically ventilated patients in Intensive Care Units,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and nonintubated patients for surgical and other procedures.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Its use in peripheral nerve blocks has only recently been described.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This study was designed by the addition of dexmedetomidine to levobupivacaine for supraclavicular brachial plexus block and to see its possible effects on sensory and motor blockade as well as any effect on duration of analgesia (DOA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After the approval of the Hospital Ethics Committee, written informed consent was taken from all the patients. Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II patients, in the age group of 18&#x02013;60 years undergoing upper limb surgery, under supraclavicular brachial plexus block were included in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with previous nerve deformity or brachial plexus injury, severe liver or kidney disease, patients having opposite side pneumothorax or collapsed lung, patients posted for bilateral upper limb surgeries, hypersensitivity to amide local anesthetics, local infection, coagulopathy, and uncooperative or unwilling patients were excluded from the study. Assuming, a 30 min difference in prolongation of sensory analgesia and taking the power of study at 90% by keeping type I error (&#x003b1; = 0.05) and type II error (&#x003b2;) at 0.1, the sample size was calculated at 28 patients in each group. We enrolled 30 patients in each group for the better validation of study results. Patients were randomly allocated by computer generated randomization number into two groups, of 30 each by allocating 60 coded slips. Group I (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 30 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine with 1 ml of isotonic sodium chloride solution while Group II (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 30 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 1 ml (100 &#x000b5;g) of dexmedetomidine [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-414-g001"/></fig><p>A senior anesthesiologist who was well versed in brachial plexus block technique performed all the procedures, and he was blinded to the study drug solutions. The drug solution was prepared in two partially covered separate syringes for every case by an anesthesia technician who was also unaware of the study design.</p><p>On shifting the patients to preoperative room, the basal heart rate (HR), noninvasive arterial systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. A 20-gauge, i.v. cannula was inserted in nonoperating arm and lactated Ringer's solution started at 5 ml/kg/h.</p><p>For administration of supraclavicular brachial plexus block, the patients were placed in the supine position with adduction of the arm to be anesthetized and head extended and turned away from the side to be blocked. The medial and lateral borders of the clavicle were identified as the first rib generally lies beneath the midpoint of clavicle. The landmarks were confirmed by sliding down the fingers in the interscalene groove until the arterial pulsation of the subclavian artery felt. A skin wheal was raised 0.5&#x02013;1 cm posterior to the midpoint of the clavicle and a 22-gauge, short bevelled nerve stimulating needle inserted in a caudal, slightly medial and posterior direction. The needle was connected to the negative lead of the nerve locator, preset in the motor testing mode with a current setting of 2&#x02013;3 mA and the patient's arm observed. When the patient got a distal contraction of the upper limb, the current was reduced to 0.6 mA. After observing the contractions, at this reading also, the drug solution was injected.</p><p>Sensory block was assessed by loss of sensation to pinprick in the midline using a 22-gauge blunt hypodermic needle every minute using Hollmen scale (1 - normal sensation of pinprick, 2 - pin prick felt as sharp pointed but weaker compared with the same area in the other limb, 3 - pin prick recognized as touch with blunt object, and 4 - no perception of pin prick).</p><p>A sensory block of scale 3 was considered as an endpoint for surgery. The onset of sensory block was taken as the time from injection of drug to Hollmen sensory scale of 2. Duration of sensory block was taken as the time elapsed between performing the block to regression of sensory block and scale of &#x02264;2. Motor block was assessed using Hollmen scale (1 - normal muscle action, 2 - slightly weak muscle action, 3 - very weak muscular action, and 4 - complete loss of muscle action).</p><p>The test was performed every minute until scale 2. A motor block of scale 3 was considered as an endpoint for the surgery. The onset of motor block was taken as the time from injection of drug to Hollmen motor scale of 2. Duration of motor block was taken as time elapsed between performing block to regression of motor scale and lower degree.</p><p>If there was sparing of dermatomes in the region of surgery in any patient, the block was supplemented with midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). In patients with lesser degree of block or uncooperative patients, general anesthesia was supplemented.</p><p>Postoperative pain was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h after surgery. Whenever VAS score reached &#x02265;4, rescue analgesia was given in the form of i.v. injection diclofenac sodium 75 mg. Time to the first dose of diclofenac sodium postoperatively was noted.</p><p>VAS score was determined as 0 - no pain, 1&#x02013;3 - mild pain, 4&#x02013;7 - moderate pain, and 8&#x02013;10 - severe pain. HR, SBP, and DBP were also recorded at 0, 3, 6, 9, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 min. Sedation score was assessed according to the Ramsay sedation scale from 1 to 6 as follows: 1 = Anxious, agitated, restless; 2 = cooperative, oriented, tranquil; 3 = responds to commands only; 4 = brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud noise; 5 = sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud noise; and 6 = no response. Adverse effects comprised hypotension (i.e., 20% decrease relative to baseline), bradycardia (i.e., 20% decrease relative to baseline), nausea, vomiting, and hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90%). The decoding of the groups was done at the end of the study followed by statistical analysis of the results. After completion of the study, the results were statistically analyzed using Chi-square test for nonparametric data and Student unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test for parametric data for inter-group comparison. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS III Statistics for Windows, Version 17.0. (Chicago: SPSS Inc). The value of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 as highly significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic data were comparable in both the groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

The decrease in blood pressure is due to the inhibition of central sympathetic outflow. The presynaptic alpha-2 receptors are also stimulated by dexmedetomidine, thereby decreasing norepinephrine release and causing a fall in blood pressure and HR.

The added advantage of conscious sedation, hemodynamic stability, and minimal side effects makes it a potential adjuvant for nerve blocks.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and
