The study included 30 women of reproductive and perimenopausal age group (20-42 years) of single as well as multiple parity. These women had varied presentation, most commonly being menorrhagia and abdominal pain. None of them were desirous of pregnancy and had agreed to use nonhormonal methods of contraception. Monthly log of all episodes of vaginal bleeding during the course of treatment was noted. A baseline ultrasonography, if it showed a uterine volume on TAS &#x0003e;160 ml or at least one leiomyoma of 2.5 cm, was included in the study. A repeat USG after 6 months was done. The side effects of the drug were also assessed.</p><p>Women desirous to have children or users of hormonal contraceptives or other long-acting hormones/Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues up to 6 months prior to the onset of the study were excluded from the study. Also, pre-existing hepatic, renal, thyroid disorders and abnormal vaginal bleeding were the other exclusion criteria.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethical and Scientific committee, MCH, Kolkata. All the women gave a written consent. The subjects were given 25 mg of a mifepristone preparation (it comes as 200 mg tablet, so 1/8<sup>th</sup> of the tablet was given daily) for 6 months. Besides mifepristone, the subjects were allowed to take analgesics; the type and amount consumed were recorded in the monthly logs. Menstrual blood loss was assessed by pictorial charts.</p><p>A monthly blood loss index was calculated from menstrual history by assigning values 1&#x02013;4 to each day of spotting, indicating light, moderate, and heavy flow, respectively, and then summing the results. The uterine fibroid symptom Quality of life scale 1-100,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> with higher scores indicating better quality of life, was used to measure perceived impact of leiomyomata on day-to-day activities. Each of these questionnaire was administered at baseline and then monthly. Monthly assessments of the presence and intensity of likely leiomyoma symptoms (including pelvic pain, pelvic pressure, urinary frequency, low back pain, and pain during intercourse) were done. The drug side effects (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, hot flushes, and weight gain) were assessed.</p><p>Uterine volume and leiomyoma size and number were assessed by abdominal USG at baseline 3 months and 6 months. The uterus was measured in three planes and total volume was calculated. Monthly hemoglobin levels and pregnancy test were done. Liver function test (LFT) was done at baseline, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> months. All participants underwent endometrial biopsy at baseline and 6-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 30 women met all the eligibility criteria and consented during the allotted tenure. None of the subjects dropped out during the course of the study.</p><p>Their ages ranged between 20 and 45 years, and the highest number of subjects belonged to the age group of 30 to 35 years [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Age distribution</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-52-150-g001"/></fig><p>There was an inverse relationship between parity and occurrence of fibroid. The higher the parity, the lesser the incidence of fibroid. In the present study, 16 of 30 women were nulliparous.</p><p>Pelvic pain and pelvic discomfort was the commonest presentation in 30 patients, 13 complained of dysmenorrhea, vague dragging lower abdominal pain and 11 of 30 women presented with menorrhagia.</p><p>In our study, the size of fibroid varied from being not palpable per abdomen up to 20 weeks uterine size.</p><p>Treatment with mifepristone resulted in marked reduction of bleeding. By the sixth month, 23 of 30 (75.5%) women became amenorrheic. Anemia (defined as Hb levels below 12.0&#x000b0; g/dl) were present in 24 of 30 (80%) women at baseline and after six months of treatment, two of 30 (6.6%) remained anemic [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Graphical representation of increase in haemoglobin percentage after treatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-52-150-g002"/></fig><p>The subjects reported decrease in pain [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. Uterine volume decreased an average of 160 ml among the subjects by the end of 6 months [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. Symptoms of pelvic pain, urinary frequency, low back pain, and dyspareunia also showed improvements. The primary outcome was mean change in leiomyoma-specific overall quality of life scale, 1-100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Graphical representation of side effects</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-52-150-g003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Graphical representation of decrease in mean uterine volume</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-52-150-g004"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Leiomyomata contain both estrogen and progesterone receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> and they are more in number in fibroids when compared with the myometrium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Since leiomyoma has ovarian steroid dependency, we reasoned out that mifepristone may have an inhibitory effect on growth of leiomyomata.</p><p>The effects of mifepristone on uterine leiomyomata have been studied worldwide in several clinical trials; mifepristone can be compared with GnRH agonists in terms of efficiency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> The dosage of mifepristone used in multiple studies ranged from 5 to 50 mg and were either used solely to manage leiomyomata or used prior to surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> to decrease the size. It still remains to be established as to what the optional dosage should be to be effective for treatment of leiomyomata. In a systematic review of six studies, it was found that mifepristone decreased the size of fibroid considerably and decreased the symptoms namely menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></p><p>In our study, we observed that treatment with mifepristone 25 mg daily for 6 months substantially decreased bleeding, uterine volume, and size of fibroid in symptomatic cases and improved the quality of life for these women. The drug was well tolerated by the women as evidenced by no dropouts. There were no major side effects too. The effects of mifepristone in decreasing bleeding and size of fibroids are consistent with previous studies of the drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Previous trials suggested that maintenance of symptomatic improvement and reduction in leiomyoma volume was seen up to one year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></p><p>Further studies are required to determine whether benefits of the drug given for 6 months will be sustained if the drug is continued and so, it is yet to be determined for how long and whether any serious side effects emerge or not by its prolonged use.</p><p>In conclusion, treatment of women with symptomatic leiomyoma using low-dose mifepristone for 6 months results in decrease in leiomyoma size and bleeding; improves the quality of life for these women. It requires larger sample size to comment about the long-term effects of mifepristone as to how long the benefits will be sustained or whether the drug is safe for a long time administration.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
