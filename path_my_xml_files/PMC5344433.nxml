The overall baseline demographics were generally similar when stratified by gender, except that, proportionally, more female than male subjects were black (65% vs 25%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-hiv-9-051">Table 1</xref>). These proportions were consistent with those seen in the 36-week prerandomization phase (66% vs 26%) and the 84-week randomization phase (65% vs 26%).

However, the primary reasons given by the investigators for subjects discontinuing the study varied somewhat by gender. For the ten female subjects who left the study between week 84 and 144, five (50%) were lost to follow up and three (30%) withdrew for pregnancy; for the 45 male subjects who withdrew, the most common reasons were lost to follow-up (29%) and &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; (typically site or sponsor reasons, 29%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-hiv-9-051">Table 1</xref>). The extension phase discontinuation findings were similar to those reported during the prerandomization phase in that proportionally more male subjects withdrew due to being lost to follow-up (24% vs 13%). Proportionally, more male than female subjects withdrew due to adverse events (24% vs 13%) in the prerandomization phase, and, proportionally, fewer male than female subjects withdrew due to insufficient viral load response (10% vs 33%) or noncompliance (10% vs 20%).</p><p>Disposition results in male and female subjects during the randomization phase were comparable to those observed during the extension phase with respect to discontinuations for noncompliance and protocol violations, although proportionally more male than female subjects withdrew during the randomization phase for adverse events (20% vs 10%), and fewer male subjects withdrew because of protocol-defined virologic failure (3% vs 10%) or loss to follow-up (23% vs 30%).</p><p>During the extension phase, pill count assessments at each study visit showed that median adherence to ABC/3TC, ATV, and ritonavir exceeded 96% for both genders over the course of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-hiv-9-051">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Virologic outcomes</title><p>Change in the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL (ITT-E, TLOVR analysis) over the course of the extension phase is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-hiv-9-051">Figure 1A</xref>.

Week 144 median triglyceride levels were above the NCEP cut-off (150 mg/dL) for male and female subjects in the ATV/r group, but below this cut-off for both genders in the ATV group.</p><p>Median changes in fasting lipid levels in male and female subjects from week 36 (when all subjects had been receiving ATV/r, irrespective of which treatment group they were ultimately randomized into) to week 144 were as follows: for those randomized into the ATV treatment group, the change in total cholesterol was &#x02212;9 versus &#x02212;22 mg/dL; in HDL cholesterol, +3 versus +4 mg/dL; in LDL cholesterol, &#x02212;4 versus &#x02212;7 mg/dL; and in triglycerides, &#x02212;42 versus &#x02212;33 mg/dL. For those randomized into the ATV/r group, the change in total cholesterol was +4 versus &#x02212;2 mg/dL; in HDL cholesterol, +4 versus &#x02212;1 mg/dL; in LDL cholesterol, 0 versus &#x02212;6.5 mg/dL; and in triglycerides, &#x02212;13 versus +2 mg/dL. None of the differences between genders in these lipid values were statistically significant within the treatment groups. Between week 36 and 144, lipid-lowering agents were used by a higher proportion of female than of male subjects in both the ATV (21% [n=6] vs 11% [n=18]) and the ATV/r groups (28% [n=7] vs 14% [n=22]).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our gender stratification analysis of the 144-week results of ARIES showed no significant differences between treatment-na&#x000ef;ve female and male subjects in virologic and CD4+ cell count response to ABC/3TC + ATV with or without ritonavir. Similar proportions of female and male subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 and &#x0003c;400 copies/mL across the study phases. Slight differences in response rates were not unexpected because the subject populations were different at the three study phases (515, 419, and 369 subjects). As previously mentioned, only those subjects who had achieved virologic suppression prior to week 36 were eligible to participate in the randomization phase and participation in the extension phase was voluntary. The study dropout rates and adherence rates remained similar across genders.</p><p>The overall similarity in rates of adherence and discontinuation across genders in ARIES contrasts with some clinical trials that have reported notable differences in virologic response between female and male subjects. Such differences appeared to be largely driven by higher dropout rates for female subjects, especially dropouts due to adverse events and consequent poor adherence. When efficacy results have been censored for discontinuations other than virologic failure, female subjects have generally shown as good a virologic response as male subjects.<xref rid="b5-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b25-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In a large meta-analysis conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration that evaluated response of 20,328 HIV-infected subjects from 40 randomized clinical trials across 18 new drug applications, the overall percentage of female and male subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL at 48 weeks did not differ statistically, although five studies in antiretroviral-na&#x000ef;ve subjects that favored male subjects and three that favored female subjects were found.<xref rid="b4-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Response to the ABC/3TC + ATV/r regimen has also undergone gender stratification analysis in the ACTG A5202 study.<xref rid="b15-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A5202 applied a more restrictive definition of virologic failure than ARIES and reported more virologic failures among the female than male subjects while they were receiving ABC/3TC + ATV/r over the 192-week randomization period (hazard ratio, 1.72 in multivariable analysis), although adherence was similar between genders. The investigators hypothesized that the higher virologic failure was due to lower adherence or tolerability; however, no significant differences in adherence, safety, or tolerability were observed, although female subjects receiving ABC/3TC + ATV/r had a higher incidence of grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal safety events than did male subjects (13% vs 7%; A5202 did not report grade 2 adverse events). In ARIES, adherence rates, as assessed by pill count, were &#x0003e;96% for both genders, and the percentage of grade 2 to 4 treatment-related adverse events was similar between genders.</p><p>A5202 investigators also evaluated ATV pharmacokinetics in both male and female subjects. Female subjects generally had slower rates of clearance of ATV than male subjects; however, fast ATV clearance in female subjects was associated with an increased risk of virologic failure, presumably due to low drug exposure.<xref rid="b16-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In another study (KLEAN) in which grade 2 to 4 treatment-related adverse events were reported for ABC/3TC paired with boosted PIs other than ATV/r (fosamprenavir/ritonavir [FPV/r] and lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/r]), the overall rate of these adverse events was similar between female and male subjects (FPV/r: 35% vs 38%; LPV/r: 36% vs 33%).<xref rid="b18-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Gender stratification analyses of efficacy have also been performed in other antiretroviral-na&#x000ef;ve studies where ABC/3TC was combined with other PIs. In APV30002, similar proportions of female and male subjects receiving ABC/3TC in combination with nelfinavir achieved HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;400 copies/mL at 48 weeks (69% vs 67%), while those receiving ABC/3TC plus unboosted FPV had a marginally smaller proportion of female subjects (63% vs 71%) who reached virologic suppression.<xref rid="b17-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In KLEAN,<xref rid="b18-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> female subjects treated with ABC/3TC plus FPV/r had a lower rate of attaining HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;400 copies/mL (64%) than did male subjects (75%) at week 48, as did those treated with ABC/3TC plus LPV/r (67% vs 73%). In the HEAT study, 46% of female subjects receiving ABC/3TC plus LPV/r achieved HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL (at week 96 compared with 62% of male subjects), although female subjects experienced greater median CD4+ cell count increases (+307 vs +245 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in male subjects).<xref rid="b19-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In CASTLE, where ATV/r was combined with tenofovir/emtricitabine, female subjects discontinued treatment more frequently than male subjects (22% vs 15%) and, at week 96, a lower proportion of female subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL compared with male subjects (63% vs 77%), although the increase in CD4+ cell count from baseline was virtually identical (+265 vs +269 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) across genders.<xref rid="b20-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In contrast to our study, the high discontinuation rate in female subjects in CASTLE was driven primarily by lack of efficacy, adverse events, and poor adherence.</p><p>Our study is the first to have done a gender analysis of changes in fasting lipid levels in subjects treated with ABC/3TC + ATV with or without ritonavir. In general, the increases in HDL cholesterol, combined with the reductions or lack of notable changes in total cholesterol, should lead to a more favorable cardiovascular profile. However, in the case of the ATV/r group (but not the unboosted ATV group), any optimism must be tempered by the fact that, over the 144-week period, median triglyceride levels rose above the NCEP cut-off point in both female and male subjects, and this is likely due to the inclusion of ritonavir in the regimen.<xref rid="b28-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Nevertheless, among the ritonavir-boosted PIs, ATV/r has a relatively low lipogenicity, as evidenced by fewer lipid increases than LPV/r, and only small lipid elevations have been reported in direct comparisons in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve subjects.<xref rid="b29-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Conversely, unboosted ATV, relative to most other PIs, has been documented to have little effect on lipids.<xref rid="b31-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>In addition to the gender stratification findings reported above, we previously published a gender analysis of Framing-ham 10-year cardiovascular risk scores observed in subjects enrolled in ARIES.<xref rid="b32-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> This analysis showed that there was little change in these scores over 144 weeks in the study population in general and no notable differences between female and male subjects in score changes.</p><p>Our study enrolled subjects from the US and Canada, and the demographics by race for the female participants closely reflected the demographics of HIV-infected female subjects in the US during the time period this study was conducted.<xref rid="b33-hiv-9-051" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Although our study was limited by its open-label design, its design did allow for statistical analysis of differences between genders for virologic endpoints, CD4+ cell count changes, and incidence of total treatment-related grade 2&#x02013;4 adverse events. However, if our study had included a higher proportion of female subjects, additional clinically meaningful comparisons by gender between the two treatment groups may have been possible. Due to the lower number of female subjects enrolled in this study, these analyses may have been unable to detect some gender-related differences. In our study, three female subjects withdrew due to pregnancy. It is important to emphasize that having to leave a study because of pregnancy does not reflect on treatment efficacy, tolerability, or adherence, and this should be considered when between-study analyses are done in HIV clinical trials evaluating results by gender.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, over 144 weeks, no significant gender differences were observed in clinical efficacy, safety, or changes in fasting lipid levels with ABC/3TC + ATV with or without ritonavir. Larger-scale clinical trials may need to be considered to evaluate by gender the endpoints we examined as well as others that were not within the scope of our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-hiv-9-051"><table-wrap id="ts1-hiv-9-051" position="float"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>List of institutional review boards/independent ethics committee at each study site that approved the protocol</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Canada</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.
