Due to the non-invasive and inexpensive nature of the method, harnessing its potential could be particularly useful for the treatment of neuropsychiatric illnesses involving cognitive dysfunction. However, questions remain regarding the efficacious stimulation parameters. Here, using a double-blind between-subjects design, we explored whether 1 mA excitatory (anodal) left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation with a contralateral extracerebral reference electrode, leads to enhanced working memory performance across two days, relative to sham stimulation. Participants performed the 3-back, a test of working memory, at baseline, and during and immediately following stimulation on two days, separated by 24-48 hours. Active stimulation did not significantly enhance performance versus sham over the course of the experiment. However, exploratory comparisons did reveal a significant effect of stimulation group on performance during the first stimulation phase only, with active stimulation recipients performing better than sham. While these results do not support the hypothesis that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tDCS boosts working memory, they raise the possibility that its effects may be greatest during early learning stages.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id>WT095465</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>Royal Society Industry Fellowship</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a Wellcome Trust PhD studentship awarded to N&#x000ed;all Lally (WT095465).

<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, planning
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and working memory
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Due to the minimal risk profile, arising as function of the very low current delivered to the scalp, and the relatively inexpensive nature of the device, it has high potential as a clinical tool. Tentative evidence thus far suggests that tDCS may be effective in ameliorating neurological and psychiatric illnesses associated with cognitive deficits. Prominent amongst these are recent developments in the study of the treatment of addiction, depression, schizophrenia and stroke
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. However, questions remain over stimulation condition blinding
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, optimal stimulation frequency
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and appropriate electrode placement
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> as these parameters can strongly influence the efficacy of the stimulation device, the induced neuronal activity and moreover, the interpretation of stimulation effects on cognitive performance. Questions have also been raised about appropriate behavioural and stimulation controls
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Many studies have reported enhanced task performance in healthy volunteers following application of the excitatory anodal electrode to a location of the scalp corresponding to a task-relevant region of the brain, including: the temporal parietal junction to enhance social cognition
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>; inferior frontal cortex to enhance target detection
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>; Wernicke&#x02019;s area to enhance visual picture naming
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>; and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to enhance decision making
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and working memory
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The application of the excitatory tDCS electrode to the scalp is thought to cause an increase in neuronal excitability in the stimulated area by altering the resting potential
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. To complete the electrical circuit, the reference or inhibitory cathodal electrode must be placed somewhere on the head or body being stimulated.</p><p>The majority of studies exploring cognitive enhancement using tDCS have targeted DLPFC as their region of excitation while the inhibitory electrode has typically been placed on the contralateral supra-orbit (or DLPFC). For example, in a single blind investigation using this electrode montage, Ohn
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> found that 30 minutes of 1 mA tDCS while participants performed the n-back task led to significant improvements in task performance over sham during stimulation only. However, placing the reference electrode on the scalp introduces a potential confound in the interpretation of any resulting behavioural effects: these could arise as a result of excitation, inhibition, or a combination of the two electrodes. The location of the reference electrode, whether extra or intra -cephalic, has been show to play a prominent role in the efficacy of the excitatory electrode
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p>The n-back
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> is a cognitive task commonly used to assess aspects of executive function, and is thought to engage working memory in particular. Although criticisms have been made with respect to its construct validity
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, the n-back has frequently been used in the context of functional neuroimaging experiments in both healthy volunteers and patients with psychiatric and neurological illnesses. The results of these studies consistently implicate a network of brain regions including parietal cortex and DLPFC, which are engaged with increasing cognitive load during n-back performance
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Importantly, altered DLPFC function is associated with several psychiatric conditions
<sup><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. For example, research using the n-back has identified that the DLPFC is hyperactive in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD)
<sup><xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, suggesting that MDD patients may need to use greater resources to achieve the same level of performance. Similar findings have been reported in schizophrenia
<sup><xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>Working memory dysfunction, and executive function deficits more broadly, have been found across a number of psychopathologies, including attention deficit disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, schizophrenia and depression
<sup><xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Indeed, executive function performance has been identified as a tractable endophenotype to explore across neuropsychiatric illnesses due to its prevalence, particularly in depression and schizophrenia
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Thus, there is significant potential for non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as tDCS to be applied clinically to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction. However, in order to establish whether tDCS has the potential to improve clinical conditions through modulatory effects on executive function, it is pertinent to first establish the effects of specific stimulation parameters in healthy volunteers.</p><p>A recent single-blind within-subjects investigation by Zaehle
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> demonstrated that 15 minutes of 1 mA excitatory tDCS applied to left DLPFC during rest, with the inhibitory electrode placed ipsilaterally at the mastoid, resulted in enhanced post-stimulation performance on the 2-back task in comparison with cathodal, but not sham, stimulation. Importantly, Zaehle
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> utilized a fronto-extracephalic montage, which attenuates interpretational difficulties as the reference electrode and its position can affect the efficacy of tDCS and the underlying neuronal activity
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; it remains unknown whether contralateral or ipsilateral positioned reference electrodes or bifrontal montages are superior in the stimulation of DLPFC. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether stimulation during a task or while at rest is more beneficial. Andrews
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> found tentative evidence to suggest that DLPFC tDCS applied concurrently with a cognitive task may provide more robust effects on subsequent working memory performance that stimulation during rest.</p><p>Here, we sought to build on prior research
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> by conducting a double-blind between-subjects experiment to examine whether excitatory DLPFC tDCS applied across two days would lead to enhancement of n-back performance during and post-stimulation. Specifically, we assessed whether excitatory fronto-extracerebral DLPFC tDCS, with the reference on the contralateral cheek, could improve performance on the 3-back in healthy volunteers across two stimulation days. We hypothesized that those receiving active stimulation would have greater task performance improvement, relative to baseline, in comparison with sham stimulation recipients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-one (14 females, M = 23.09 years, SD = 3.95) right-handed participants were recruited from the Psychology subject pool at University College London, UK.

Importantly, utilizing the &#x02018;study mode&#x02019; of the device allowed the stimulation-administering researchers to remain blinded to the condition participants were in as the readout on the stimulation apparatus was identical for both active and sham stimulation. However, the integrity of the blinding was not assessed. The administered current was applied for 10 minutes with an additional 15-second fade-in and fade-out ramping period to minimize discomfort and facilitate participant blinding.

<sup><xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and depression
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Although tDCS has been suggested as a therapeutic tool for many cognitive and neurological impairments, very few tDCS studies have conducted double-blind assessments in either clinical or non-clinical populations. Furthermore, the specific ameliorative stimulation parameters, such as amplitude, frequency and electrode positioning, are largely undefined. Importantly, few electrode montages have been tested
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, fewer studies yet have applied tDCS for greater than one session
<sup><xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and many of the variables in the available parameter space have not been subject to systematic manipulation
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Contrary to our hypothesis, no effect of tDCS on task performance was identified in this study. However, exploratory tests did suggest that active stimulation was associated with enhanced performance relative to sham stimulation during the first stimulation period on day 1 only. Our results may therefore indicate that the performance enhancement effects of excitatory tDCS may be limited to earlier stages of learning
<sup><xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. They also suggest that reports of improvements after one session of tDCS &#x02013; the most common report in enhancement studies &#x02013; may not translate to continual improvement with additional stimulation. Indeed, Martin
<italic>et al</italic>.,
<sup><xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> using an extracephalic electrode montage with the reference placed on the deltoid muscle, found in a relatively large university sample that, in comparison to sham stimulation, repeated sessions (10) of DLPFC tDCS did not lead to a significant improvement in task performance on a variant of the n-back task when controlling for baseline differences. However, uncorrected contrasts, without controlling for baseline, did reveal a benefit in comparison to sham at the first and eight tDCS sessions only; a result largely consistent with our findings here of attenuated effects of tDCS on task performance with repeated sessions.</p><p>Our results do not support the hypothesis that excitatory tDCS applied to DLPFC results in post-stimulation improvement on the n-back task across multiple days. This result is consistent with some previous research; in comparison with sham stimulation, neither Zaehle
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> nor Ohn
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> demonstrated significant performance enhancements on the n-back task immediately following excitatory DLPFC tDCS. Nevertheless, we did find evidence for a specific improvement in performance during stimulation on day 1 only, an outcome consistent with results from Ohn
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and others
<sup><xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Andrews
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> found that DLPFC excitatory tDCS applied during a working memory task (n-back) led to significant improvements in post-stimulation performance in comparison with baseline on an alternative working memory task (digit span forward but not backward). The improvements found
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> were not present for either sham stimulation in conjunction with task performance or stimulation without task performance. Behavioural data were not reported for the task during stimulation and an intracerebral reference electrode was used, limiting direct comparison with the present study. Furthermore, Hoy
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> found that 1 mA excitatory tDCS applied to DLPFC at rest resulted in an enhancement in 2-back reaction times 40 minutes post-stimulation, but found no improvement in accuracy. However, other reports have found evidence for more enduring cognitive enhancement following tDCS
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> (but see Walsh
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>).</p><p>This discrepancy between results may reflect the different tasks, stimulation parameters, sample sizes and study designs used. For example, it is possible that the payment schemes that served as a performance motivator here limited the potential to observe performance enhancing effects of tDCS. As there was no monetary motivation during the stimulation phase on day 1, participants may not have exerted themselves fully and thus the effects of stimulation may have had greater leverage; while on day 2, participants in both groups may have reached a level whereby any potential for further enhancement of performance through tDCS was limited. Whilst the sample size used here is low for a between-subjects study, few tDCS studies have thus far been conducted using large sample sizes, and future studies should address the issue of stimulation parameter optimization using large sample sizes. Nevertheless, our results suggest that tDCS may be particularly sensitive to earlier stages of learning
<sup><xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>.</p><p>In theory, the beneficial effects of tDCS may be most pronounced in poorer performers. Indeed, there is some evidence that tDCS may be particularly useful as a cognitive enhancer with lower performing individuals
<sup><xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. As the population utilised here primarily comprised students from University College London, between-group differences arising as a function of tDCS may have been attenuated due to high initial baseline ability. Finally, evidence suggests that individual differences in genotype may play a large part in susceptibility to the plasticity enhancing capabilities of tDCS. Fritsch
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> found that tDCS was more efficacious in both mice and humans possessing the homozygous Val/Val genotype of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor polymorphism (rs6265), than Met carriers, though we did not have a sufficiently large sample to explore such moderators in the current study.</p><p>The electrode montage used here (fronto-extracerebral) may have also played a significant part in the efficacy of the stimulation. While DLPFC is one of the most frequent site selections for anodal tDCS, placing the reference (cathodal) electrode on the contralateral cheek is a relatively novel occurrence
<sup><xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Current modeling, a technique to determine the amount of electrical current cerebrally induced as a function of the electrode positioning and other parameters, has been performed for various anodal DLPFC montages, with the reference electrode placed on the contralateral supraorbit, DLPFC and deltoid. The DLPFC and contralateral cheek montage however has yet to be modeled, thus it is unknown if it is more or less efficacious than other electrode configurations. Nevertheless, modeling studies have determined that the distance between the anodal and reference electrode is negatively correlated with the current induction magnitude
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; in theory, the cheek may be preferential to the deltoid, however this remains to be assessed. Furthermore, the majority of early investigations of tDCS for task performance enhancement used an electrode montage with both electrodes positioned proximal to the cerebrum (e.g. DLPFC and the contralateral supraorbit), which limits the interpretation as to which brain region was primarily modulated as both electrodes could contribute, and may in fact do so in opposing ways, to alterations in task performance. Nevertheless, widespread changes in neuronal activity outside of the sites of stimulation have been consistently identified
<sup><xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>, making the issue of electrode placement complex. In sum, electrode positioning is a major potential confound when comparing tDCS effects on both brain activity and behavior across studies, further research addressing the biological and behavioral consequences of differing electrode placement is needed.</p><p>The results of this experiment require careful replication and extension to validate the potential role for tDCS in executive function enhancement. In particular, the evaluation of result specificity represents a prominent hole in the current literature. Few studies thus far have contrasted active stimulation results in comparison with control tasks and active stimulation of control site locations on the scalp
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>; such measures would be beneficial in assessing the findings here and across the field. Additionally, it could be fruitful to replicate this experiment without the monetary incentive. Testing a larger and more representative sample including non-university students would also be informative. Furthermore, while performance improvements under stimulation are important, the clinical utilization of tDCS necessitates long lasting effects once stimulation has ceased. As many psychiatric and neurological illnesses are associated with deficits in executive function task performance, inclusion of a patient group may permit the assessment of the viability of tDCS as a neuroenhancement methodology for psychiatric illnesses. Recent research has indeed shown that tDCS can enhance cognitive control, a component of executive function, in MDD
<sup><xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>; however, long-lasting cognitive ameliorative effects of stimulation in depression have yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>In conclusion, our results do not support the hypothesis that excitatory tDCS applied to the left DLPFC using a contralateral fronto-extracerebral electrode montage produces consistent improvements in executive function beyond the period of stimulation. Nonetheless, we found a beneficial effect of tDCS during task performance only when the task was relatively novel, which could be interpreted as indicating that this particular electrode montage, stimulation voltage and study design may be best suited to early stages of learning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Joseph Arizpe for assistance with the stimulation device and David Luckenbaugh for statistical advice.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hecht</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavidor</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>:

I agree that&#x000a0;interpretation of results from tDCS studies may need to be qualified when using two cerebral electrodes, and&#x000a0;that&#x000a0;using an extracerebral or extracephalic reference electrode can in theory avoid this ambiguity. However, it should not be assumed that the reduced cortical excitability that can result when using such montages due to the greater interelectrode distances necessarily results in reduced efficacy in therapeutic/behavioural applications of tDCS. This is&#x000a0;due to a conceivably greater&#x000a0;cerebral area&#x000a0;being modulated when for example using an extracephalic reference,&#x000a0;which&#x000a0;when treating major depressive&#x000a0;disorder, may be just as&#x000a0;effective (if not more) than a 'bi-cerebral' montage, as it may activate a&#x000a0;larger network of brain regions involved in depression. As the&#x000a0;authors note, widespread stimulation outside the electrode sites is a characteristic of tDCS and assumptions that effects are limited to the electrode&#x000a0;sites are overly simplistic.</p><p>I have read this submission.

<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-2398-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> which found enhancing effects of tDCS on a dual n-back task over 10 successive sessions. Although the present study found no clear difference between active and sham conditions except during tDCS on Day 1, a clearer advantage of tDCS may nonetheless have been observed with additional sessions.</p><p>The statistical analyses conducted have been well detailed and I believe are appropriate for the questions of interest. The limitations of the study have also been adequately discussed. The authors rightly point out that the way in which the monetary incentive for participation was managed could have differentially affected performance between the two testing days, thus possibly obscuring any enhancing effects of tDCS. As also noted, the fact that the sample was primarily comprised of university students may have lessened the likelihood of observing tDCS effects, although Martin
<italic>et al</italic>.
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-2398-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> similarly recruited a university student sample. Perhaps utilising a more difficult task, for example a dual n-back task or adjusting the n value based on participant performance on the previous trial block, may have produced greater differences in performance and allowed any potential effects of tDCS to be borne out.</p><p>Regarding other methodological aspects, the authors applied quite an unusual placement for the reference electrode on the contralateral cheek; one that I have never encountered before. This would not be considered an extracephalic montage as conventionally, an extracephalic electrode is one that has been placed off the head (e.g., deltoid). I am curious as to why the authors chose this montage and if there is any modelling data to support this. Also, were participants asked to guess their stimulation condition after each session? I note that a double-blind design was used but the success of blinding should still be tested.</p><p>In short, I commend the authors in investigating the potential uses of tDCS as a clinical tool but given the above limitations, changes in methodology would need to be implemented before drawing firmer conclusions.</p><p>I have read this submission.

<bold>Introduction: </bold>The authors cite previous studies (e.g., Zaehle
<italic>et al</italic>., 2011) as an example that the applied electrode montage makes the interpretation of the effect of previous tDCS results difficult, due to the confounding factor coming from the cephalic or extracephalic position of the return electrode. However, the present study addresses this question relatively shortly, limiting the question to the extracephalic reference electrode position. Please rewrite this sentence.</p><p>
<bold>Method: </bold>Why did you include 21 subjects? Did the task last for exactly the same time for each participant (irrespectively of the individual differences in the reaction time)? Why did the participants receive performance-dependent extra monetary reward on Day 2 only? It makes the comparison between Day 2 and the previous session rather difficult.</p><p>

The first question of interest was to identify the time course of potential tDCS performance modulations and the second, to determine whether extracephalic (contralateral cheek) influenced performance. A significant benefit of active tDCS was identified immediately after the first session, but was not seen not during the first or second sessions.&#x000a0;</p><p>The experiment appears to be very well done and the writing clearly explains their process. My primary concern is that the authors conducted this experiment using a very small sample size (which they acknowledge, and provide power estimates that are quite reasonable). However, tDCS effects in healthy young university students tend to be quite modest. Ideally, the authors would replicate the experiment with a larger sample and/or with a secondary WM task (apart from the baseline covariate) to identify any heterogeneities in the population that could be obscuring equal and opposite effects. More importantly, to provide greater generalizability in their data, it would be good for them to compare the cheek site with the commonly used orbital site. This would allow greater comparison between the current study and the existing research, and strengthen their point that different paradigms may elicit different effects.</p><p>My second point is that the authors do not really return to the issue of the second electrode site as a potential explanation for their modest effects. One possible explanation would be that the previous work stimulating the contralateral supraorbital region provided stimulation elsewhere in the PFC which contributed to the WM benefit reported by others. Here, current modelling would be particularly helpful to compare the flow of current between the L. DLPFC-R. cheek vs. L-DLPFC-R.supraorbital montages. However, it is clear that the full parameter-space of tDCS effects requires increased clarity and a forum to avoid the 'file-drawer problem' associated with neurostimulation and small effect sizes. Overall therefore, these data will be of interest to the tDCS research community.</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body><sub-article id="comment640" article-type="response"><front-stub><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lally</surname><given-names>Niall</given-names></name><aff>University College London, Ireland</aff></contrib></contrib-group><author-notes><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>
