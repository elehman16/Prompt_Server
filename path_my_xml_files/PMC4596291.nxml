However, it suffers from distinct disadvantages such as implant irritation, need for open reduction, incidence of palpable implants, and need for subsequent implant removal. A smaller incision with percutaneous fixation may be an alternative to this established conventional technique. Thus, the purpose of this trial was to compare the treatment outcomes of patients with mildly displaced patellar fractures treated with closed reduction and percutaneous cannulated screw fixation (CRCF) as compared to open reduction and tension band wiring fixation (ORTF). Specifically, we aimed to determine whether cannulated screw fixation was associated with improved clinical outcomes at 12&#x000a0;months as measured using the Lysholm score, pain scores, degree of flexion, range of motion, time to radiographic union, radiographic outcomes, and complication rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty-three patients with transverse patellar fractures displaced less than 8&#x000a0;mm were included in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, with 52 patients in the final data analysis. Thirty-two patients were operatively treated by CRCF with either two or three cannulated screws. Thirty-one patients were operatively treated by conventional ORTF using the modified tension band technique. At postoperative intervals of 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months, knee function was evaluated using the Lysholm score, pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) score, and active knee extensions and flexion were measured in degrees by goniometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The CRCF group had average Lysholm scores of 84.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.8, 86.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.4, and 93.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.3 after 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months, respectively, which were significantly greater than those of the ORTF group (79.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.3, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001; 81.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.6, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002; and 89.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.2, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.039, respectively). Lower pain and squatting scores were the main reasons for the poorer Lysholm scores in the ORTF group. The VAS scores showed that the CRCF group had lower pain scores and better flexion and total range of motion (ROM) compared with the ORTF group after 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, although both groups had similar outcomes after 12&#x000a0;months. The mean fracture healing time of 2.65&#x000a0;months was similar in the CRCF groups (2.77&#x000a0;months; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.440). Complication rates were 3/26 (11.5&#x000a0;%) in the CRCF group and 14/26 (53.4&#x000a0;%) in the ORTF group. Two patients in the CRCF group and eight patients in the ORTF group experienced skin irritation. In addition, two (7.7&#x000a0;%) patients in the CRCF group and 11 (42.3&#x000a0;%) patients in the ORTF group required implant removal because of symptoms due to the presence of the implants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Surgical treatment of mild displaced (less than 8&#x000a0;mm) transverse patellar fractures by the CRCF technique provides satisfactory clinical results and excellent knee function, with little pain and a low incidence of complications at early follow-up (up to 6&#x000a0;months). These results suggest that the CRCF technique may be a superior alternative to conventional ORTF.

Conventionally, open reduction and internal fixation is indicated for transverse patellar fractures with displacement of greater than 3&#x000a0;mm, articular incongruity of 2&#x000a0;mm or more, or a disrupted extensor mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

This technique, although used widely, has certain distinct disadvantages. These include the requirement for a long skin incision with a substantial soft tissue dissection to provide adequate visualization of the fracture as well as the joint surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the potential for damage to the blood supply to the patella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the need for subsequent prolonged rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], as well as greater blood loss, increased surgical time, and the inherent risk associated with prolonged anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On the other hand, postoperative complications are also common with this method, especially implant-related issues, with a reported incidence as high as 22&#x02013;53&#x000a0;% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The issues include wire breakage and migration, postoperative loss of reduction (22&#x02013;45&#x000a0;% of cases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and a high rate of symptomatic implant irritation (8&#x02013;48&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with rates of subsequent implant removal for symptomatic hardware ranging from 10&#x02013;55&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In view of the problems and complications associated with conventional K wire fixation and tension band wiring, several alternative approaches have been described. These include closed reduction and fracture fixation using inter-fragmentary screws or cannulated screws with or without supplementary tension band wiring through the screw. Additionally, some authors have used arthroscopy to visualize and facilitate the accurate reduction of the articular surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The advantage of these techniques is the minimally invasive nature of the procedure, resulting in minimal soft tissue disruption and a shorter rehabilitation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Closed reduction and stable fixation ensures that the blood supply to the patella is not disturbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although there are no clear guidelines, it is believed that fractures that are displaced by more than 8&#x000a0;mm are likely to be accompanied by disruption of the extensor mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Based on these observations, it has been generally felt that fractures with less than 8&#x000a0;mm displacement are the only ones that are amenable to the closed reduction and fixation procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Currently, there is a lack of comparative research of percutaneous cannulated screw fixation and open reduction and fixation using a modified tension band. Thus, we felt that a prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial would help to evaluate the relative merits and disadvantages of these two different methods of fixation.</p><p>The purpose of this exercise-based prospective randomized trial was to compare closed reduction and percutaneous fixation with cannulated screws (CRCF) versus open reduction and internal fixation with tension band wiring (ORTF) of transverse patellar fractures. The study aimed to determine whether cannulated screw fixation was associated with improved clinical outcomes at 12&#x000a0;months as measured using the Lysholm score, pain scores, knee flexion, knee range of motion, time to radiographic union, better radiographic outcomes, and complication rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This study was carried out over a period of 5&#x000a0;years between June 2008 and June 2013 in the Department of Orthopedics, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Patients with open fractures or multiple fractures, who presented more than 5&#x000a0;days after the initial injury, who had type C1.2 or C1.3 fractures, or who had a transverse patellar fracture with displacement greater than 8&#x000a0;mm according to the computed tomography (CT) scan were excluded from the study. Before undertaking this trial, a pilot study of 14 patients was done to ensure feasibility. Taking into account the possible Lysholm scores and the expected extension, flexion and range of motion (ROM) at 12-month follow-up, we found that the difference between the averages of the two groups was the smallest at 12-month follow-up, with the CRCF group having an average Lysholm score of 93.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.7, which was better when compared to the ORTF group (90.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.9, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.042).

Patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups following simple randomization procedures (computerized random numbers). 32 patients underwent CRCF under the assistance of fluoroscopy, while the other 31 patients were treated by ORTF. At postoperative intervals of 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months, knee function was evaluated using the Lysholm score, pain assessment using the visual analog scale (VAS) score, and active knee extension, and flexion were measured in degrees by goniometry.</p><p>Subsequently, the last 11 patients to be recruited (CRCF: 6, ORTF: 5) were excluded from the data analysis as they were only followed up for 3&#x000a0;months due to lack of research funding.

CT scans were obtained pre-operationally by all study candidates to accurately evaluate the patellar fracture patterns, displacement magnitude of the fracture classification, and also to exclude transverse fractures of the patella that had comminution at the fracture site. All transverse patellar fractures with displacement less than 8&#x000a0;mm were prospectively enrolled in this study. Apart from confirming inclusion in the study, the CT scan also helped in preoperative planning and served as an intraoperative reference.</p><p>X-ray assessments were performed on the standard lateral views of the affected knee joint. These views were obtained with the affected knee joint positioned on the bed surface, keeping the X-ray tube film at a 90-cm distance.

The fracture pattern was confirmed after clinical assessment and cross-sectional radiography (CT). The Orthopedic Trauma Association (OTA) system was used to classify each fracture. The preoperative displacement between the two fragments was evaluated by a CT scan. The affected knee was immobilized in extension to avoid further displacement of the fracture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Operative procedure</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Closed reduction and percutaneous fixation with cannulated screws</title><p>One dose of preoperative antibiotics (Ceftriaxone) was given to all patients within 30&#x000a0;min before induction of the anesthesia, and another postoperative dose was given 12&#x000a0;h later. Under spinal anesthesia, the patients were placed in the supine position on a standard radiolucent operating table with the knee in full extension. Fine adjustments of the reduction were carried out by manipulating the fragments under fluoroscopic guidance. Two pointed reduction clamps were applied percutaneously at the far end of each fragment with a 5-mm stab incision at both the median and lateral side of the proximal and distal one-fifth of the patella (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Thereafter, the knee was then flexed to 15&#x02013;25&#x000b0; to facilitate insertion of the guide wires. The reduction was rechecked by fluoroscopy. Two Kirschner wires (K-wires, 1.5-mm diameter) were percutaneously drilled longitudinally, perpendicular to the fracture line, from the proximal or distal pole of the patella through a stab incision. These two parallel guide wires were separated by 2&#x000a0;cm in the cornal plane. The fracture fragments were fixed over the two guide wires using 4.0-mm cannulated screws (Sanatmetal, Hungary, titanium alloy, partially threaded, diameter of 4.0&#x000a0;mm, and length of 35&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mm). The length of the screw used was determined by the total length of the guide wire minus the length exposed outside both poles of the patella. The exact length of the screw for insertion was measured to ensure that the screw tip penetrated the cortex of the superior patellar pole or the inferior patellar pole and that the heads of the screws were buried into the distal cortical bone. In all patients, washers were used to enhance interfragmentary compression as the screw was advanced across the fracture site. The stability of the reduction and fixation was checked by flexing and extending the knee. A third cannulated screw was added when the stability was not satisfactory, or when osteopenia or osteoporosis was identified (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Closed reduction and percutaneous cannulated screw fixation. <bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>, Preoperative radiograph of a 45-year-old man who had a mildly displaced transverse patellafracture. <bold>c</bold> and <bold>d</bold>, Postoperative radiograph showing the proper placement of the three screws. <bold>e</bold> The minimally invasive approach shows three small incisions less than 8&#x000a0;mm with minimal soft tissue disruption. <bold>f</bold> and <bold>g</bold>, The 8-week postoperative radiograph showingthat the patella fracture has union with agood degree of knee flexion</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2015_719_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Open reduction and internal fixation with tension band wires</title><p>The ORTF technique was performed using a previously described standard procedure for open reduction and fixation with a figure-eight tension band wire technique (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Open reduction and fixation using a modified tension band. <bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>, Preoperative radiograph of a 48-year-old woman who had a transverse patella fracture. <bold>c</bold> and <bold>d</bold>, Postoperative radiograph showing the proper placement of wire and Kirschner wire. <bold>e</bold> The knee joint anterior midline approach showing that a long skin incision of approximately 14 cm was required in this case</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2015_719_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Postoperative treatment and rehabilitation</title><p>External immobilizers, e.g., plaster casts or long knee immobilizers, were not used in any of the patients.

Furthermore, there was no difference in the mean time to union between groups.</p><p>In this study, patients managed using the CRCF technique achieved better knee function, especially in the early postoperative period. The reported advantages of the percutaneous fixation technique include avoidance of extended incisions, preservation of the blood supply to the patella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the possibility of a simpler removal of all hardware in the clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Consequently, the ORTF technique potentially jeopardizes the blood supply of the fragments and the biological environment at the fracture site required for optimal bone regeneration and healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this group, two patients had delayed wound healing with mild infections, possibly due to the open nature of the procedure.

Previously conducted biomechanical investigations have revealed that the cancellous screws alone or in combination with tension band wiring provide stable fixation provided that the fracture is well reduced with less than a 1-mm gap between the fracture fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As such, Benjamin et al. have recommended screw fixation for transverse patellar fractures in patients with adequate bone stock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, studies by Dargel et al. and Carpenter et al. have demonstrated that, in certain cases, interfragmentary screw fixation provides fixation that is even more stable and rigid than the modified tension band wiring technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

In our study, there were 6 out of 26 patients in each group with a postoperative interfragmentary gap, and displacement occurred at 2&#x000a0;weeks in one patient in the CRCF group (45-C1.3). It was believed to be not a fixation failure secondary to an inadequate screw or due to appropriate placement. Rather, we suspected that the extremely poor bone quality and unlimited and aggressive early active mobilization contributed to the resultant failure. The cannulated screws could not achieve the optimal direct interfragmentary compression force and failed in this patient, but there was not enough evidence to support that the cannulated screws were associated with a greater risk of failure in all 45-C1.3 fractures. Two failures in the ORTF group were attributed to technical errors associated with the tension band immediate post operation. We hypothesized that the soft tissue interposition between the tension band and the superior pole of the patella and inadequate wire tension of the figure-eight wire onto the patellar surface were the main causes.</p><p>Biomechanical studies have suggested that cannulated screws can provide a reduction and a direct interfragmentary compression force, while the tension band wiring technique cannot achieve direct fracture site compression and can only transform distraction forces into compression forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, the flexibility of K-wires can counteract a part of the force that should act on the fractured bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In order to function properly, the patella must be able to withstand significant axial forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Especially under full knee extension, a tension wire system may not provide compression at the fracture and may even lead to further fracture displacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which may be aggravated by the concomitant presence of soft tissue atrophy and loss of muscle tone. According to Baydar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], cannulated screws are more durable against distraction forces than the modified tension band technique to treat transverse patellar fractures. Similar studies have reported that fractures stabilized with a modified tension band displace significantly more than those fixed with screws alone or screws plus a tension band in simulated knee extensions (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>An advantage of cannulated screws is the potential for percutaneous application. Currently, several treatment options have been introduced for displaced transverse patellar fractures, including cannulated screws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] as well as cannulated screws with a tension band wire or a titanium cable placed through a screw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A disadvantage of the percutaneous fixation method includes its technical difficulty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, it has been noted that it can be difficult to place K-wires appropriately with a minimally invasive technique, and it may have a substantial learning curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, burying the knot when using the percutaneous fixation method with tension band wiring may also be a difficult task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Finally, technical errors in tension-band wire placement or wire twists have been identified as the cause of fixation failure with the use of percutaneous techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>CRCF had a markedly lower complication rate of 11.5&#x000a0;% when compared to 53.4&#x000a0;% for ORTF. Other clinical reports have similarly shown that osteosynthesis of closed, displaced, multi-type patellar fractures with open techniques can offer acceptable results with a fixation failure rate of 3.5&#x02013;22&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our study, the prevalence of a middle transverse fracture without disruption of the extensor mechanism (45-C1.1) was 61.5&#x000a0;%; and the rate of fixation failure occurring with fracture displacement greater than 2&#x000a0;mm was low, with 7.7&#x000a0;% in the CRCF group and 3.8&#x000a0;% in the ORTF group.</p><p>Painful hardware was the most common complication in the ORTF group, which occurred in 30.1&#x000a0;% of patients, and tension band loosening and migration was the second major complication, seen in 11.5&#x000a0;% of patients. Although symptomatic implant irritation is not as serious a complication as fixation failure or postoperative infection, it has the potential to impede rehabilitation, potentially leading to stiffness that may require a second intervention or manipulation under anesthesia with additional hospitalization and cost. The rates of implant removal for symptomatic hardware have been reported to range from 37 to 55&#x000a0;%, although no large study has directly compared the rate of implant removal for specific fixation constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the reoperation rate was 11.5&#x000a0;% (4/26) for the CRCF group, which was significantly less than 42.3&#x000a0;% (11/26) in the ORTF group. The main reason is that fixation with K-wires is associated with a high rate of hardware removal compared with screws. Other reports have shown that cannulated screws with a low profile caused less soft-tissue irritation than K-wires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the ORTF group, reduction of the joint surface was verified with both direct visualization and radiographic assessment; however, the surgical exposure needed may have resulted in serious injury to the soft tissue. In the CRCF group, anatomical reduction of the articular surface was checked by repeated fluoroscopy only; however, there was no post-traumatic arthritis as a result of malreduction or incongruous articular surface seen at the 12-month follow-up. Nevertheless, a longer follow up on determining the post traumatic arthritis incidence may be required. The arthroscopic technique is a safe and reproducible method for transverse patellar fractures and may allow direct visualization of the joint surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, it is not indicated for major separation displaced fractures with disruption of the extensor mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There may be several advantages of arthroscopy in the treatment of patellar fractures: removal or wash out of small chondral or osteochondral fragments, visualization of the articular surface for reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], evaluation of the articular surface, and assurance that the screw does not intrude upon the patellar cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Reduction by indirect means is not difficult during surgery, especially for fractures with less than 8&#x000a0;mm displacement. These fractures usually have an intact extensor mechanism and are thus amenable to the closed reduction and fixation procedures. We have commented that cannulated screws are technically difficult to place properly because a screw that is too short will not provide adequate fixation, while a long screw may skin irritation, causing it to fail prematurely. But the cannulated screws should not be redrilled and replaced more than two times to avoid compromising the strength of interfragmentary compression. Occasionally, when one or two screws were thought to be in a suboptimal position, a third screw was placed, depending on the size of the fragment. Eighteen patients received two cannulated screw fixation, and only eight patients were operatively treated with three cannulated screws. There were no significant differences in fracture healing between these groups; however, three cannulated screw fixation needed an extra 12&#x000a0;min of intraoperative fluoroscopy time.</p><p>The extensor mechanism of the knee is an intertwined net of tendinous, capsular, and ligamentous tissues. The patella is located between the quadriceps and patellar tendons, which are involved in the extensor movement mechanism of the knee joint. The patella functions as the link between the quadriceps and patellar tendon and functions by increasing the leverage of the quadriceps tendon and also lifting the extensor mechanism from the rotational center of the knee. The majority of transverse patellar fractures are a result of excessive tensile force across the extensor mechanism and thus represent a disruption of the extensor mechanism. The competence of the extensor mechanism post reconstruction is thus vital to ensure an optimal outcome and patient satisfaction. Active straight leg raising is the simplest and one of the most reliable ways to assess the integrity and function of the extensor mechanism.</p><p>Thus, one of the most important findings to be assessed on clinical evaluation is the loss of active extension of the knee or an inability to maintain the passively extended knee against gravity. But physical examination may be difficult, particularly if the injured knee has a severe hemarthrosis. Thus, only a small proportion of patients can usually perform this test on the first clinical examination. Once the pain was relieved, a repeat assessment was done and occasionally a secondary loss of reduction position was found in some patients. There is relevant documentary evidence to support that fractures that are displaced more than 8&#x000a0;mm are likely to be accompanied by disruption of the extensor mechanism, and some patients may be able to perform a straight leg raise, even in the presence of an extensor mechanism disruption, due to an intact iliotibial band and medial or lateral patellar retinaculum. But there was no quadriceps atrophy or weakness in either group at the 12-month follow-up, incomplete terminal extension of the knee, or subjective patient dissatisfaction with overall knee function.</p><p>In most of the literature examples, conservative treatment is limited to fractures with less than 2&#x000a0;mm of separation and no significant displacement of the articular surface. The management options for fractures with diastasis greater than 2&#x000a0;mm or articular step off are either a closed or an open reduction with supplemental fixation. It has been generally felt that fractures with less than 8&#x000a0;mm displacement are the only ones that are amenable to the closed reduction and fixation procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although there are no clear guidelines, fractures that are displaced by less than 8&#x000a0;mm are likely to be accompanied with an intact extensor mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, they are suitable for conservative treatment, especially when the patients have contraindications to operative intervention either because of medical reasons or because of refusal to consent for the procedure.</p><p>There were several limitations of this study. First, our technique was indicated for displaced transverse patellar fractures but is not recommended for transverse fragments displaced more than 8&#x000a0;mm. Second, this was a single-center and open-label trial, and the sample size was relatively small. Thus, this study design might be a cause of bias. Moreover, one experienced surgeon performed the CRCF technique, and another experienced surgeon performed the ORTF technique. Third, some researchers may feel that the follow-up period of one year is too short to reach an appropriate conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The surgical treatment of transverse patellar fractures with less than 8&#x000a0;mm displacement by closed reduction with the percutaneous cannulated screw fixation technique was shown to provide satisfactory clinical results and excellent knee functions, with less pain and a low incidence of complications.
