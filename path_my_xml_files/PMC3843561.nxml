Several studies have shown that superimposed TBI to hemorrhage, e.g. the addition of a traumatic impact to the brain on top of hemorrhage, may result in impaired cardiovascular compensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and a reduced ability to modulate vascular tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. More recent studies have demonstrated disturbances in the autonomic response to hemorrhage if TBI is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and that TBI may attenuate or delay the physiological bradycardic and hypotensive response to acute extracranial blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Additionally, the presence of TBI has been associated with an early increase in baroreflex sensitivity, another key component of cardiovascular hemostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In order to maintain tissue perfusion and to preserve physiological hemodynamics, an adequate function of the peripheral microcirculation within the different organ systems is fundamental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Extracranial hemorrhage is known to be associated with microcirculatory hypoperfusion and subsequent tissue damage by inducing vasoconstriction and decreasing arterial blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, this microcirculatory response to extracranial hemorrhage when coincidenced with a superimposed TBI, as frequently encountered in the clinical setting, is yet to be defined. Apart from directly inflicting and damaging the brain, experimental TBI itself has also been shown affect systemic circulation. Several studies have demonstrated that various models of TBI may create an acute and transient systemic hypertension and bradycardia which is followed by a hypodynamic state with heterogeneous hypoperfusion among organs at increasing magnitudes of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have combined two well-established and characterized experimental models, i.e. i.) a pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock model with ii.) a standardized and clinically relevant model of experimental TBI, to assess vasomotor responses and microcirculatory changes in third-order arterioles and venules of a spinotrapezius muscle preparation by using intravital microscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23; body weight 260&#x02013;320 grams) were housed individually under controlled environmental conditions with a 12-hours light/dark cycle and with ad libitum access to pellet food and water throughout the study. The animals were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, P. R. China (Certification: SCXK (Guangdong) 20060015)). The sample size per group was calculated based upon previous work and experience to statistically test for differences in neurofunction/-behaviour 24&#x000a0;hours and seven days post-injury at an overall error level of 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. All surgical interventions, i.e. pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock, TBI via fluid-percussion as well as intravital microscopy, were performed under deep anaesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (60&#x000a0;mg/kg/body weight i.p.) using a standardized protocol established in our laboratory. All experiments were conducted in the Key Laboratory of Shock and Microcirculation (Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, P.R. China), were in accordance with the Chinese National Guidelines for the Use and Care of Experimental Animals and were approved by the Institutional Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the Southern Medical University, Guangzhou (P.R. China). The Chinese animal guidelines adhere to the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting <italic>In Vivo</italic> Experiments) guidelines which are intended to improve the reporting of animal experiments. All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals used and to minimize animal discomfort. All animals received postoperative oral pain medication for 3&#x000a0;days post intervention (Tramadol 2,5&#x000a0;mg/100&#x000a0;ml in drinking water).</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical preparation and pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock</title><p>Pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock was inflicted as previously described by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly, both femoral arteries and the left femoral vein were cannulated using polyethylene cannulaes for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure, blood withdrawal, and resuscitation. To inflict hemorrhagic shock with a target mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 50&#x000a0;mmHg, blood was withdrawn from the arterial catheter within 10&#x000a0;minutes under continuous blood pressure monitoring. For anticoagulation, the withdrawn blood was mixed with 12.5&#x000a0;IU/ml heparin immediately and stored for later resuscitation at the end of the experimental phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Lateral fluid percussion brain injury (LFP)</title><p>The lateral fluid-percussion (LFP) brain injury is one of the most widely used and well characterized models of experimental traumatic brain injury and has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Briefly, anesthetized rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame. After incision of the scalp, the temporal muscles were reflected and a 4.8&#x000a0;mm craniotomy was drilled (2.5&#x000a0;mm lateral to the sagital sinus and centered between bregma and lambda), keeping the dura mater intact. A hollow female Luer-Lok fitting was placed directly over the dura and rigidly fixed using dental cement. Prior to the induction of trauma, the female Luer-Lok was connected to the fluid percussion injury device via a transducer (Bimedical Engineering Facility, Medical College of Virginia, USA), creating a fluid-filled system in connection with the dura. For the infliction of TBI, a metal pendulum was released from a pre-selected height leading to a rapid injection of normal saline into the closed cranial cavity. A pulse of increased intracranial pressure of 21 to 23&#x000a0;ms duration was created as well as controlled and recorded by an oscilloscope (Agilent 54622D, MEGAZoom, Germany). The severity of injury inflicted on the animal can be adjusted by the amount of force generated by the pendulum. For the present experiment an injury level of moderate severity was induced (2.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2 atmospheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). Hemorrhagic shock only and Sham animals underwent identical preparatory procedures including craniotomy but were not injured.</p></sec><sec><title>Histopathological changes after LFP</title><p>The temporal and spatial histopathological consequences of the LFP model have been intensively investigated and reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In principle, the model reflects a clinical contusion without skull fracture with a direct relationship between pathological alteration and the magnitude of injury inflicted. The model established by our group reproducibly creates a focal cortical contusion ipsilateral to the injured site of the brain accompanied by a characteristic pattern of hemorrhage and a mass shift towards the contralateral hemisphere as a consequence of the trauma-induced ipsilateral cytotoxic and/or vasogenic brain edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Despite the injury is inflicted unilaterally, bilateral diffuse white matter damage is induced remote from the injury site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and severity-graded injury of the brain-stem may account for the high morbidity in this model compared to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The delayed progression of brain damage in this model is accompanied by astrocytosis, diffuse axonal injury, inflammatory events, cortical spreading depression and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> displays an overview of some of the relevant histopathological consequences inflicted by the LFP model. The LFP model for TBI was chosen since it is considered as one of the most clinically relevant experimental models of TBI in rodents and short- as well as long-term behavioural, physiological and histological consequences have been extensively characterized and the injuries are highly reproducible once the model is locally established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To date, the lateral fluid percussion brain injury model is the primary model used for experimental research in neurotrauma mechanistic studies and drug screening trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is certainly accepted that no single animal model of TBI can accurately reproduce the complete pathophysiological complexities of human TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Traumatic brain injury via lateral fluid-percussion (LFP).</bold> The lesion inflicted via LFP is typically located between Bregma &#x02212;2,3&#x000a0;mm and &#x02212;7,3&#x000a0;mm <bold>(i.)</bold>.

The spinotrapezius muscle locates anatomically in the mid-dorsal region where the muscle originates in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar region and inserts onto the spine of the scapula. The preparation of the spinotrapezius muscle was performed as previously described by Gray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Briefly, the exteriorization of the spinotrapezius muscle was performed with marginal damage to the fascia, only. No evidence of local trauma which may impact regional blood flow by this model has been reported yet. Throughout the surgical preparation and the experimental course, the exposed tissue was continuously superfused with a heated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate-buffered solution to maintain a constant 37&#x000b0;C environment temperature, humidity, pH, and ionic strength of the sample. The solution was heated because otherwise there would have been a loss of heat in the way of perfusion. The exposed spinotrapezius muscle was fixed at six equidistant positions around the caudal periphery to ensure consistent shape and length of the selected vessels. Unbranched, third-order arterioles and venules (diameter range 20&#x02013;60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) were selected at random and videotaped with 2000 frames/s using a CR5000X2 high-speed camera (Optronis, Germany). The vessel diameters and erythrocyte velocities (V<sub>RBC</sub>) were assessed at a rate of 25 frames/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> provides an overview of the flow of the experiment. After initial preparation and prior to infliction of the impacts animals were allowed 15&#x000a0;minutes for cardiovascular stabilization followed by baseline measurements for blood pressure and microcirculation. Next, traumatic brain injury via lateral fluid-percussion was induced in the TBI&#x02009;+&#x02009;HS group, followed by pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock in the HS and TBI&#x02009;+&#x02009;HS groups. The target mean arterial pressure of 50&#x000a0;mmHg was achieved within 10&#x000a0;minutes in both groups and maintained for 60&#x000a0;minutes followed by reinfusion of the shed blood to resuscitate the animals to their pre-injury pressure levels (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

In the clinical scenario, hemorrhagic shock and TBI have frequently been reported to account for approximately 50% of all trauma-related deaths within the first 24&#x000a0;hours after hospital admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Previous reports have indicated that hemorrhagic shock may result in a progressive vasoconstriction of arterioles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Accordingly, in the present study acute blood loss during pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock resulted in a sharp and progressive decrease in the diameter of the third-order arterioles and venules both, at initiation and up to 60&#x000a0;minutes of shock. Interestingly, when TBI was added this constriction was also evident but substantially less pronounced. Obviously, the superimposed TBI counteracted the vasoconstriction from pressure-controlled hemorrhage alone. Law and colleagues have reported similar results when assessing macrocirculatory changes in rats suffering from combined TBI and hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These authors could demonstrate that TBI may lead to a reduced ability to modify vascular tone. In detail, brain-injured rats were able to reduce aortal conductance (arterial blood flow/MAP) once hemorrhage was initiated, but they were not able to maintain this vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the response to fluid resuscitation was limited as no relevant changes in aortal conductance were observed. This observation was supported by Yuan and colleagues who demonstrated that TBI may suppress spontaneous hemodynamic recovery from hemorrhage and also impede the efficacy of fluid resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast to the present study, the studies by Law and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] were focused on macrocirculatory changes as reflected by aortic blood flow (ABF) and vascular conductance (ABF/MAP) and on shorter periods of shock, e.g. 30&#x000a0;minutes. The results presented by Yuan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] were focused on cardiovascular responses after TBI and hemorrhage including heart rate, pre- and afterload as well as stroke volumes and indices.</p><p>In the present study, resuscitation efforts in shocked but also TBI-injured animals resulted equivocally only in a moderate change in vessel diameter, but simultaneously in a sharp increase in RBC velocity and flow rate. In this context, it is of note that MAP levels were comparable between both groups (HS only and TBI&#x02009;+&#x02009;HS) and therefore could not be made responsible for these microcirculatory changes. Likewise, there were no differences in Hb, pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub> between the experimental groups observed on repeated blood gas analysis at baseline and during the entire experiment. Therefore, potential acidosis and hypercapnia could also not be made responsible for changes in velocities and vessel diameters.</p><p>One possible explanation for the observed changes in vasomotor response and microcirculation may be related to altered sympathetic nervous activity. Traumatic brain injury has been associated with an immediate sympathetic activation as a result of increasing intracranial pressure thus triggering a corresponding increase of circulating catecholamines within minutes after trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This sympathoadrenal activation with its massive release of vasoactive substances leads to an initial hypertension and an increase in vascular tone. The initial increase in blood pressure shortly after TBI was also observed during our experiments and is confirmed by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The idea that there may be sympathetic vasodilatator nerves to skeletal muscles is an old concept fitting with the &#x0201c;fight or flight&#x0201d; model of the sympathetic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The first evidence for vasodilatator nerves to skeletal muscles emerged when stimulation of skeletal brain stem areas was shown to evoke hypertension, tachycardia and skeletal muscle vasodilatation in terms of the so-called &#x0201c;defense reaction&#x0201d; and that these dilator nerves were cholinergic. Matsukawa and colleagues assessed internal diameter changes of arterial vessels of skeletal muscles evoked by activation of sympathetic cholinergic nerve fibers during stimulation of the hypothalamic defense area in cats. The authors observed a dilatation in small arteries ranging from 100 to 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, but not in larger extramuscular arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. More recently, the skeletal muscle dilator response to sympathoexitatory maneuvers in both, humans and animals, appears to be nitric oxid (NO)-dependent. Joyner and Diek concluded from their review, that most &#x0201c;sympathetic dilator&#x0201d; responses in human muscle are due to adrenaline or local cholinergic mechanisms acting to stimulate NO release from the vascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand side, Nagai and Pleschka have previously demonstrated circumscribed brain stem sites to mediate adrenergic and non-adrenergic vasoresponses in dogs by electrically probing selected brain stem points to determine from which vasodilatation or vasoconstriction of the lingual and intraorbital arteries could be elicited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Vasodilatation in these vessels by stimulation could be induced from an area extending parasagittally through the ventral part of the brain stem from the hypothalamus to the upper pontine region. The most potent area was in the supraoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus, but no representation was found in the dorsolateral part of the central gray matter, one of the most excitable mesencephalic vasodilatator area in the defense reaction. Centrally elicited vasodilatation of the tongue has been shown to be due to non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic efferents with pre- and postganglionic synapses running apart from the cervical spine trunk. The anatomical origin of these efferentes suggests that they may belong to the parasympathethic section of the autonomic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. It is endogenous to the LFP model to induce bilateral diffuse white matter damage and severely-graded injury to the brain stem including the hypothalamus and pontine regions. In the approach here, the authors have inflicted a TBI of moderate severity and it may be assumed that these triggering areas may have been affected (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>The effect of the sympathetic system on vascular tone and microcirculation may also be vessel-diameter dependent. For example, significant hypotension with a mean MAP of 40&#x000a0;mmHg has been shown to induce a reflex response mediated by sympathetic nerves to cause constriction of larger arterioles (70&#x02013;150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In small arterioles, however, both, constriction and dilatation, have been observed in response to the same level of hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As previously described, Matsukawa and colleagues described dilatation in smaller arteries (100&#x02013;150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m), but not in larger extramuscular arteries after hypothalamic defense area stimulation in cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The underlying mechanism by which hemorrhage induces dilation of smaller arterioles is not fully understood. Humoral factors may play a pivotal role as epinephrine has been shown to induce vasodilatation of small arterioles (&#x0003c;40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) by acting through &#x003b2;2-adrenoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Traumatic brain injury-associated cytokines have also been suggested to promote microcirculatory effects. A whole variety of inflammatory mediators and cytokines are typically released into the systemic circulation after both extra- and intracranial trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In the cremaster muscle of rats, TNF-&#x003b1; has been shown to modulate arteriolar diameters via an immediate vasodilatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Interestingly, in this experimental setting only third- and fourth-order arterioles were immediately dilated after administration of TNF-&#x003b1;. In contrast, larger vessels did not show any alteration in diameter under this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. It has been speculated that different characteristics of TNF-dependent receptors may mediate this vasodilatation in third-order arterioles, while larger vessels remain unaffected.</p><p>Similarly, Interleukin (IL-)1 and IL-6 have frequently been implicated in the decreased systemic vascular resistance in different forms of shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. By also using a cremaster in-vivo preparation in rats, Minghini and colleagues have reported a dose-dependent increase in third-order arteriolar diameters from 11% to 51% with 1&#x000a0;hour in-vivo exposure to IL-1 in increments of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 to 20&#x000a0;ng/ml. Cytokine washout resulted in arteriolar return to baseline diameter. In vivo exposure to IL-6 (10, 50 and 250 U/ml) for 1&#x000a0;hour yielded similar results, but after washout arteriolar dilatation persisted. These data indicate that both cytokines are potent dilating agents for skeletal muscle resistance vessels under in-vivo conditions.</p><p>In the present analysis, resuscitation efforts resulted in an immediate and sharp increase of RBC velocity and arterial flow rate, particularly in TBI&#x02009;+&#x02009;HS animals where an overshooting response to resuscitation was observed. A previous study using the same model of pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock demonstrated that higher RBC velocities and flow rates after resuscitation were associated with a better survival rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. At first glance, the present results seem contradictory as TBI&#x02009;+&#x02009;HS animals displayed a higher mortality rate despite high arterial blood flow. However, the induced hypoperfusion during the 60&#x000a0;minutes of hemorrhagic shock may result in acute tissue ischemia. It has been shown that the sudden rise in oxygen at the onset of reperfusion is associated with oxidative stress which itself may lead to cellular and organ damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Therefore, a gradual introduction of oxygen during resuscitation seems to be beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It can be speculated, that the overshooting flow rate, as observed in TBI&#x02009;+&#x02009;HS animals, will lead to a faster reperfusion and therefore may be associated with increased organ damage. Nevertheless, it has to be acknowledged that combined animals had sustained a high magnitude of injury in general.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations of this study have to be acknowledged. In the present analysis, we have focused on selected third-order vessels in a spinotrapezius muscle preparation only. These vessels were selected at random, so we cannot exclude some degree of selection bias. Since we have not assessed other vessel sizes or vascular beds, our results are restricted and interpretation needs caution. The tissue of interest from the critical care perspective is certainly the gastrointestinal tract with secondary complications resulting from mucosal hypoxia and hypoperfusion. Splanchnic ischemia with an intramucosal pH&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;7.3 has commonly been reported after isolated TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and different forms of shock including haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Further studies are necessary to analyze the effects of TBI and haemorrhage on the hepatosplanchnic, renal, pulmonary and cardiac microcirculation, all which persist to fail following hemorrhagic shock and may account for the higher overall mortality rate in the combined group.</p><p>Furthermore, the present study has focused on the first 60&#x000a0;minutes after resuscitation only. Longer observation periods are warranted to elucidate changes in vessel diameter, RBC velocity and flow rate beyond these time points and to assess chronic effects. Increased levels of vasoactive substances (for example catecholamines, nitric oxide (NO)) as well as trauma-associated circulating mediators and cytokines have been speculated as one possible explanation for the observed differential vasomotor and microcirculatory responses after pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock with and without superimposed TBI. Further investigations are needed to assess the precise role of these substances in the context of hemorrhagic shock and TBI.</p><p>The choice of anesthesia, e.g. sodium pentobarbital, used in the present experiment may have also introduced confounding factors. This agent has been shown to cause metabolic suppression via hypoperfusion and a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) due to flow-metabolism coupling. Pentobarbital has relatively minor effects on cardiac output, arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance, but more important effects on left ventricular function and myocardial contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. For instance, 15&#x000a0;minutes after intravenous pentobarbital, cardiac output, arterial pressure, and total peripheral resistance were all essentially at the pre-anesthetic control levels, but stroke volume was reduced, as was myocardial contractility and the velocity of myocardial fiber shortening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Although this would have affected all investigated animals and the 15&#x000a0;minutes stabilization time may have abolished the effect, it could have been influencing the reactions of those animals subjected to combined TBI and hemorrhage in particular due to the disturbance in circulation caused by the experimental model. Kawaue and Iriuchijima have reported a drop in arterial pressure acutely from an average value of about 105&#x000a0;mmHg to a minimum of about 75&#x000a0;mmHg in about 5&#x000a0;min which then gradually recovered to an average level of about 90&#x000a0;mmHg in 30&#x000a0;min after intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. It has to be recognized that pentobarbital in these experiments was administered intervenously while in our study the agent was administered intraperitoneally.</p><p>Another limitation of the present analysis is that the experiments have been restricted to the measurement of hemodynamics only. With regard to TBI, behavioural measurements as well as histopathological analyses would have been an interesting addition and will surely be an integral component of our future studies in this field of interest.</p><p>Lastly, the findings described here represent our first observations and remain therefore entirely descriptive. The authors are aware that none of the potential mechanisms behind have been explored in detail yet. Additional experiments to close this gap via pharmacological inhibition experiments (for example NO-blocking), cytokine and catecholamine measurements and/or studies in vessels of different diameter are necessary and planned.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Superimposed TBI modulated arterial and venular responses to hemorrhagic shock in third-order vessels in a spinotrapezius muscle preparation. Overall, third-order vessels in this preparation seemed to lose their ability to respond to changing blood volumes, resulting in a less pronounced vasoconstriction during hemorrhagic shock and an overshoot in RBC velocity and arterial blood flow during and after resuscitation. These results may indicate that TBI diminishes the ability to modulate vascular tone within the microcirculation. Further research is necessary to more precisely assess and define the impact of TBI on the microcirculation in tissues vulnerable to hemorrhagic shock and to further inform the construction of microcirculatory failure as a clinical concept in the critical ill for better outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AD: Arteriolar diameter; ARRIVE: Animal research: reporting <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments; D: Diameter of the vessel; g: Gram; Hb: Hemoglobin; HS: Hemorrhagic shock; IL: Interleukin; i.p.: Intraperitoneal; IU: International units; kg: Kilogram; LFP: Lateral fluid percussion; MAP: Mean arterial pressure; mg: Milligram; &#x003bc;m: Micrometer; ml: Milliliter; NO: Nitric oxid; RBC: Red blood cell; s: Second; TBI: Traumatic brain injury; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor; U: Unit; V: Velocity; VD: Venular diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BC, MMae and QH designed the study.
