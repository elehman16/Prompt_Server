Among numerous efforts to combat this issue is the development of off-pump CABG (OPCABG) that obviates the need for extracorporeal circulation and is associated with improved neurological outcomes. The objective of this study is to examine whether the neuroprotective effect of OPCABG can be further pronounced by the use of two state-of-the-art operating techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>In this randomised, controlled, investigator and patient blinded single-centre superiority trial with three parallel arms, a total of 360 patients will be recruited. They will be allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to two treatment arms and one control arm. Treatment arms undergoing either aortic no-touch OPCABG or OPCABG with partial clamp applying carbon dioxide surgical field flooding will be compared against control arm undergoing OPCABG with partial clamp. The primary endpoint will be the appearance of new lesions on control brain MRI 3 days after surgery. Secondary endpoints will include the prevalence of new focal neurological deficits in the first 7 days after surgery, the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at either 1&#x02009;week or 3 months after surgery and the incidence of delirium in the first 7 days after surgery.

They have been classified into types 1 and 2 by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Type 1 neurological injuries are overt and include stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA), whereas more subtle complications like delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are classified as type&#x000a0;2 neurological injuries. The frequency of stroke associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) depends on patient variables and the type of surgery performed, ranging from 1.6% to 3%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Meanwhile, the incidence of delirium and POCD during the first week after cardiac surgery was reported in up to 50% and 80% of patients,&#x000a0;respectively.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Although type 2 neurological injuries are not as devastating as stroke, they are associated with negative hospital outcomes including a tenfold increased risk of death and a fivefold increased risk of nosocomial complications.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p>The principal aetiology of intraoperative brain damage is embolic, followed by hypoperfusion and inflammation.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In order to reduce the negative impact of such mechanisms, various strategies have been proposed. Noteworthy among them are preventative operative techniques, especially the off-pump CABG (OPCABG). This method has been introduced to avoid potentially harmful effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and involves performing surgery on a beating heart. In spite of its theoretical advantages, the neuroprotective effects of this approach remain a subject of intense debate.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, an up-to-date meta-analysis revealed no difference between OPCABG and CPB-CABG with respect to all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction while OPCABG was associated with a significant reduction in the odds of cerebral stroke.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Additionally, it is important to note that most studies reporting no difference in neurological complications between on-pump and off-pump procedures do not take into account that OPCABG is not a homogenous technique. One of its modifications (ie, aortic no-touch OPCABG, also known as &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG) avoids any kind of aortic manipulation by using both in&#x000a0;situ internal mammary arteries as the only source of blood supply to the coronary grafts. This may be effective in reducing particulate microembolism because numerous studies showed embolic showers in transcranial Doppler ultrasonography during clamping and unclamping of ascending aorta<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> while avoiding this manoeuvre by using devices for proximal venous graft anastomoses showed reduction in neurological injury compared with CPB-CABG.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Recent meta-analyses found that &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG was associated with lower risk of cerebrovascular accident as compared with OPCABG with partial clamp (&#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Additionally, the neuroprotective value of the &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG has been preliminarily tested in our previous pilot study. This investigation showed a significantly lower incidence of POCD in patients who underwent &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG compared with &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>While &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG technique primarily reduces the number of solid microemboli, formation of gaseous microemboli remains a threat to the patients&#x02019; central nervous system. However, the harmful impact of these factors may be limited by the practice of using carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) flooding to displace air in the surgical field. Carbon dioxide is 25 times more soluble in blood than air, does not form bubbles and is rapidly discharged from the system through breathing. It has been used in cardiac operations since 1950s, but remains relatively underused in CABG. Although the reports on the neuroprotective qualities of CO<sub>2</sub> surgical field flooding are sparse and do not focus distinctly on CABG, they consistently show its efficiency in reducing postoperative neurological injury following open heart surgery.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of this study is to investigate the value of employing the &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG technique and the practice of CO<sub>2</sub> surgical field flooding for the prevention of type 1 and 2 neurological injuries following surgical coronary revascularisation. In particular, we aim to assess the incidence of new lesions on control brain MRI, new focal neurological deficits, delirium and POCD following different techniques of surgery. We hypothesise a reduction in postoperative brain dysfunctions in patients treated with both of the examined methods.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Trial design</title><p>The CArbon dioxide surgical field flooding and aortic NO-touch OPCABG&#x000a0;to reduce Neurological injuries after surgical coronary revascularisation (CANON) trial is designed as a randomised, controlled, investigator and patient blinded single-centre superiority trial with three parallel arms and a primary endpoint being the appearance of new lesions on control brain MRI 3 days after surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study will take place in the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Dr Antoni Jurasz Memorial University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland. This is a tertiary care centre that performs more than 400 CABG annually. The off-pump method is used as standard in all of these surgeries and both its &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; and &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; variants are used regardless of the extent of required revascularisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Participants will be recruited among patients above 60 years of age and expecting elective and/or urgent CABG for multivessel coronary disease. They will be assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) by a trained physician at the time of admission. Patients scoring below age-adjusted and education-adjusted cut-off scores in MMSE and/or above 8 on the subscales of HADS will be excluded from this research. Other exclusion criteria for this study will be as follows: neurological deficit of any aetiology, previous psychiatric illness, use of tranquillisers or antipsychotics, alcohol or drug abuse, history of cardiac surgery, preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%, extracranial carotid artery stenosis of more than 70%, body mass index of more than 35&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, any contraindication for MRI (eg, MRI-incompatible implantable device and claustrophobia)&#x000a0;and emergent and salvage setting. Additionally, patients with isolated left anterior descending coronary artery disease will be excluded from this study as, in this condition, standard of care requires performing &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG and prevents randomisation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients will be randomised into two treatment&#x000a0;arms and one control arm. Treatment arms will undergo either &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG or &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG applying CO<sub>2</sub> surgical field flooding. Control arm will undergo &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG. To reduce the bias of surgeon's experience and preference, all interventions will be carried out by two persons. The operators will be qualified specialist who performed at least 500 procedures of each type before joining this research.</p><p>All patients will undergo OPCABG through a median sternotomy. To obtain heart exposure, deep pericardial traction sutures (Lima stitch) will be applied. Target vessels will be stabilised using Octopus Medtronic coronary stabiliser and occluded with bulldog clamp. All the left anterior descending coronary artery lesions will be bypassed with left internal mammary artery graft (LIMA graft). Other coronary bypasses, for patients in study arm 2 (treatment group operated on with &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG applying CO<sub>2</sub> surgical field flooding) and in study arm 3 (control group operated on with &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG), will be performed with the use of vein grafts anastomosed proximally onto the aorta. For patients in study arm 1 (treatment group operated on with &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG), only skeletonised internal mammary artery grafts will be used (ie, LIMA graft, right internal mammary artery graft&#x000a0;(RIMA graft)&#x000a0;or a Y-graft that uses RIMA anastomosed onto LIMA) to allow for complete arterial myocardial revascularisation. However, in the rare event that the aforementioned approach is insufficient to reach all target vessels, a reversed (great) saphenous vein graft or a radial artery graft may be used to extend the LIMA or RIMA. In study arm 2,&#x000a0;the chest cavity will be insufflated with CO<sub>2</sub> at a flow above 5&#x02009;L/min during the entire surgical procedure. To accurately assess the anastomotic quality of all grafts in every study arm, intraoperative transit time flow measurement will be used.</p><p>All interventions in this study will be performed under the same anaesthetic protocol. All patients will be treated before and after surgery according to the current European Society of Cardiology Guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Modifications</title><p>The final decision on the type of surgery to be performed will be based on patients' safety and will be made by the surgeon after intraoperative assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoint of this study will be the appearance of new lesions on control brain MRI 3 days after surgery.

Prior data indicate that the incidence of this complication after cardiac surgical procedures is 30%.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Consequently, the expected failure rate is 0.3 in study arm 3 (control group operated on with &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG). Based on our pilot research, a 50% reduction in neurological injury in study arm 1 (treatment group operated on with &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG) is predicted.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Accordingly, the presumed true failure rate for experimental subjects in this group is 0.15. A sample size of 120 patients in study arm 1 and 120 patients in study arm 3&#x000a0;are&#x000a0;needed to reject the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control subjects are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The type 1&#x000a0;error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. An uncorrected &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> statistic will be used to evaluate this null hypothesis.</p><p>Currently, there is not enough evidence to allow for prediction of neurological injury rate in study arm 2 (treatment group operated on with &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG applying CO<sub>2</sub> surgical field flooding). Consequently, the number of patients who will be operated using this technique is arbitrarily set at 120 in line with study arm 1 and study arm 3.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Recruitment</title><p>At the time of admission to the hospital, patients who meet the criteria of eligibility for this study will be invited to enter the trial in a one-on-one interview with the principal investigator.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Allocation</title><p>Patients will be assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the three arms of the study according to a computer-generated list of random numbers. The allocation sequence will be concealed from the researchers enrolling and assessing participants in consecutively numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes. The sequence generation and the envelopes will be prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. They will be stored in a closed locker in the operating block. The randomisation will take place after the completion of all baseline assessments, immediately before surgery. A member of the surgical team will open the next consecutively numbered envelope and perform the designated intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Blinding</title><p>Investigators and patients will be blinded to study arm allocation. Unfortunately, some participants may deduce that they were assigned to the study arm 1 (treatment group operated on with &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG) due to the absence of vein harvest wounds on their lower limbs. On the contrary, presence of vein harvest wounds is not indicative of any surgical procedure, as even patients treated with &#x02018;no-touch&#x02019; OPCABG may receive vein grafts. Considering that this potential for unblinding may also affect the investigators, patients will be instructed not to disclose any information about the surgery and to cover their legs during the follow-up assessments. Any cases of unblinding and their reasons will be recorded and reported along with the trial's results.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Data collection methods</title><sec id="s2k1"><title>MRI assessment</title><p>Brain MRI will be performed at baseline and 3 days postoperatively. A 1.5-T scanner will be used (Optima MR450w, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, USA) with a 12-channel coils. Both examinations will consist of morphological imaging and functional imaging. The morphological imaging will be the same for both scans. A high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D)&#x000a0;inversion recovery fast spoiled gradient echo T1-weighted images will be used for the brain volumetric assessment and anatomical reference. Chronic white matter lesions will be assessed with a high-resolution 3D fluid-attenuated inversion&#x000a0;recovery (FLAIR) sequence.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Both chronic and new microbleeds will be detected using a susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>The functional imaging will include an analysis of the diffusion and perfusion within the brain tissue. A multi b-value single shot echo-planar imaging scan (b=0, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000&#x000a0;and 1500&#x02009;s/mm<sup>2</sup>) will be used to perform both a conventional diffusion-weighted image (DWI)&#x000a0;analysis and an imaging based on the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) theory.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Conventional DWIs, including apparent diffusion coefficient maps, will be used to count acute ischaemic lesions. Biexponential fits will be applied to calculate pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion fraction (f) and pure molecular diffusion coefficient (D) on the basis of the IVIM model.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Whole brain perfusion will be assessed with the use of a non-contrast enhanced 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (ASL) technique.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Additionally, the baseline examination will include an analysis of microstructural white matter integrity with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan at 25 directions.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>

Given this lack of data, studies that compare the frequency of neurological injuries following CPB and off-pump procedures usually use &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG as their reference. However, in this clinical situation, &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG may in fact be the least favourable of all off-pump methods. Therefore, the debate between supporters and critics of performing surgery on a beating heart may be greatly influenced by the results of this investigation. If the studied techniques prove to have better neuroprotective value than &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; OPCABG, they should be considered the standard of off-pump surgery to which the CPB-CABG needs to be compared. Consequently, the advantages of avoiding CPB may become more apparent.</p><p>Essentially, data provided by this study may impact clinical practice regarding the choice of the most favourable technique for surgical coronary revascularisation. If the research demonstrates outstanding neuroprotective effectiveness of any studied treatment, it should be considered state of the art for reducing neurological injuries following CABG. Taking into account that such complications threaten a substantial number of people undergoing CABG every year, results of this investigation may reduce their extensive economic and societal impact.</p><p>Finally, the meticulous design of neurological injuries assessment employed in this study needs to be emphasised. Combined with a thorough analysis of clinical data, it may give insights into the underlying mechanisms of postoperative neurological complications that are beyond the initial assumptions of this research. For example, apart from testing its hypothesis, our preliminary investigation has yielded some interesting results regarding the predictive value of a recently developed angiographic grading tool for short-term cognitive outcomes of OPCABG.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Therefore, by providing a vast wealth of neuropsychiatric and radiological data, this project may have a profound impact on the research field in pioneering and facilitating its further development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e235" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016785.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e236" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016785.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SK conceived the study and is a guarantor.
