It is defined as the presence of a chronic cough with sputum production for at least three months, in each of two consecutive years, after other causes of cough, such as tuberculosis and lung cancer, have been eliminated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-5-251">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-copd-5-251">2</xref></p><p>Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) are defined as recurrent attacks of worsening bronchial inflammation that occur on average 1.5&#x02013;3 times a year, and are superimposed on baseline CB.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-5-251">1</xref> These exacerbations are marked by an increase in the volume of daily sputum produced; a change in color of the expectorated sputum (ie, darker, more yellow, more green); and worsening dyspnea.</p><p>Ambroxol is a metabolite of bromhexine and is widely used as a mucolytic. It also induces the synthesis of surfactant in lung alveolar type II cells. By this mechanism, it decreases the work and effort of breathing and can improve respiratory symptoms. It has also been proved to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-5-251">3</xref></p><p>It became evident that theophylline can exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating actions at lower plasma concentrations than those required for bronchodilation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-5-251">4</xref> Theophylline inhibits the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IFN-&#x003b3;. The production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is increased.</p><p>The guidelines of the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) currently recommend consideration of the addition of an oral or intravenous methylxanthine to aerosolized bronchodilators, for management of severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-5-251">5</xref></p><p>The effect of theophylline and ambroxol, when combined together, has been proved to give more than additive effects in improving the mucociliary clearance and increasing the release of respiratory surfactants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-copd-5-251">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-5-251">7</xref></p><p>Guaiphenesin is a commonly used &#x02018;over-the-counter&#x02019; drug for productive cough. It is reported to increase the volume and reduce the viscosity of tenacious sputum. An US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review of preparations available &#x02018;over-the-counter&#x02019; concluded that guaiphenesin was an effective expectorant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-5-251">8</xref></p><p>Farcosolvin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Pharco Pharmaceuticals, Alexandria, Egypt) is a cough mixture of ambroxol (15 mg); theophylline (50 mg); guaiphenesin (30 mg), per 5 mL syrup.

All consecutive patients presenting to both centers who met the eligibility criteria between November 2005 and October 2006 were allocated sequential numbers as they entered the study.</p><p>Patients were randomized into an experimental group, who were treated with Farcosolvin (5 mL syrup three times daily); and a control group, who were treated with a generic guaiphenesin syrup (100 mg per 5 mL three times daily). A block randomization technique was used to ensure that equal numbers were allocated to each group. Treatment was continued for 7 days or until clinical remission, whichever occurred first. In addition to Farcosolvin or guaiphenesin, all patients received standard treatment for their exacerbation as specified by their condition and the guidelines. This was antibiotic (ciprofloxacin 500 mg, twice daily, for 7 days); inhaled or nebulized bronchodilators in the form of salbutamol (two inhaler puffs or 5 mg in 2 mL saline nebulized); and/or ipratropium 0.5 mg as needed, or up to four times daily. Mucolytics, theophylline and expectorants were not permitted during the trial, except as in the protocol.</p><p>Breathlessness was measured on a 7-point Likert scale (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>). Severity of cough and sputum clearance was measured using the Modified Questionnaire for Ease of Cough and Sputum Clearance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-5-251">10</xref> At the end of one week treatment, all patients were asked to grade their impression of improvement or change in their condition using the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement or Change Scale (CGIC),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-5-251">11</xref> which is a 7-point rated scale where 0 = not assessed; 1 = very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5 = minimally worsened; 6 = much worsened; and 7 = very much worsened. Finally, all subjects were interrogated about any possible adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The two treatment groups were compared at baseline and at 3 and 7 days, using tests for nonparametric data (Friedman, Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests).

Also, there was no significant difference between both groups for the concurrent medications they received during the study. All patients needed to be treated with antibiotic and bronchodilators were given on an as-needed basis, except for four patients in the Farcosolvin group and 6 in the Guaiphenesin control group who required regular inhaler use. One patient needed to be given a budesonide dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 &#x003bc;g twice daily at day 3 due to worsening dyspnea.</p><p>The effects of treatment on breathlessness scores and cough scores were analyzed by nonparametric statistical methods as the distribution was found by Kolmogorov Smirnov to be not normal (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>There was a statistically significant improvement of breathlessness and cough scoring in both groups when compared before and after treatment at day 3 and at day 7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-copd-5-251">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-copd-5-251">3</xref>), using a nonparametric related samples Friedman test (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>There was a highly statistically significant difference in improvement in breathlessness score, as well as cough score, in favor of Farcosolvin treatment when the two groups were compared using an independent samples Kruskal Wallis test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-copd-5-251">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-copd-5-251">5</xref>).</p><p>Out of 50 patients, 48 (96%) in the Farcosolvin treated group rated their improvement on the CGIC scale as &#x0201c;much&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;very much&#x0201d; improved, while only 41 patients (82%) reported the same degree of improvement in the control group.

Both ambroxol and theophylline have been extensively studied in the treatment of CB. Ambroxol has been tested in many large multicenter, randomized, double blind controlled studies in cases of CB.

Our results, to some extent, can support our assumption that this mixture can be helpful in such patients through working against these factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We concluded from our study that Farcosolvin syrup might be safe and effective in improving symptoms in cases of AECB.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><title>Appendices</title><app id="app1"><label>Appendix 1</label><title>7-point Likert scale for breathlessness</title><table-wrap id="ta1-copd-5-251" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Extremely short of breath</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Very short of breath</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Quite a bit short of breath</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Moderate shortness of breath</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Some shortness of breath</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A little shortness of breath</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not at all short of breath</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></app><app id="app2"><label>Appendix 2</label><title>Modified questionnaire for ease of cough and sputum clearance (25-point scale)</title><table-wrap id="ta2-copd-5-251" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Cough episodes: frequency</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">How frequently are you coughing today?
