In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy, young males received gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment 1 month prior to 3 of 4 trial days to induce castrate levels of T. On trial days, T gel was applied to the body containing either high or low physiological T dose or placebo. On the 4th trial day, participants constituted their own eugonadal controls. Each study comprised a 5-h basal period and a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Short-term hypogonadism did not affect VLDL triglyceride (TG) secretion, nor did it affect VLDL-TG concentrations. It was, however, characterized by lower total lipid oxidation. In addition, acute rescue with high physiological T increased VLDL-TG secretion during both basal and clamp conditions. These data show that T can act through fast nongenomic pathways in the liver. In addition, the early hypogonadal state is characterized by decreased total lipid oxidation, but whether these changes represent early hypogonadal metabolic dysfunction warrants further investigations. T is not a major determinant of resting VLDL-TG kinetics in men.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>In recent years, interest in testosterone (T) has been increasing due to the accumulating evidence associating low T levels in men with augmented endocrine and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Fundamentally, T is regarded as an anabolic and lipolytic hormone, and in hypogonadal patients, T therapy increases fat-free mass and muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and decreases fat mass (FM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Despite favorable body composition changes, the effects of T on lipid metabolism, including levels of lipids and triglycerides (TGs), are contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and, unfortunately, much of what is known has been inferred by examining results derived from rodent studies or studies comparing men and women.</p><p>Hypogonadal men are prone to develop a metabolic profile characterized by insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Although diabetic patients have greater VLDL-TG secretion and preserved suppression after acute insulin exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), very little data demonstrate T&#x02019;s direct effects on VLDL-TG kinetics. Recently, however, overweight hypogonadal patients were shown to store more meal-derived free fatty acids (FFAs) in fat depots and have lower 6-h postabsorptive fat oxidation than BMI-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This underscores the importance of considering both fasting and postabsorptive conditions when investigating T effects on whole-body lipid turnover.</p><p>Compared with women, men have greater fasting plasma concentrations of total TG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and VLDL-TG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), whereas similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) or lower VLDL-TG secretion and clearance rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) have been reported. If T was an important determining factor for such sex differences, it would imply a greater secretion and clearance of VLDL-TG particles in the hypogonadal state, whereas T substitution would have the opposite effect. This hypothesis is supported by rodent studies, in which androgen receptor knockout mice show increased hepatic lipogenesis and decreased lipid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and castrated male rats show increased TG uptake in intra-abdominal fat depots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Conversely, T increases lipolysis and reduces adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, decreasing TG uptake in abdominal fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). It also stimulates palmitate oxidation in myotubes from male donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Any T treatment, however, will inevitably lead to significant body composition changes and, as a result, changes in resting energy expenditure (REE), substrate oxidation, and aerobic capacity.</p><p>Therefore, to test if T exerts direct effects on hepatic and tissue lipid metabolism, it is necessary to measure these parameters before body composition changes. To overcome this problem, we chose a model of acute sex steroid withdrawal of healthy young men and timed our measurements to occur before significant changes in body composition could take place. VLDL-TG kinetics and oxidation were investigated using ex vivo&#x02013;labeled [1-14C]triolein and the primed-constant isotope dilution technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In addition, we investigated the regulation of T on key enzymes involved in lipolysis during basal and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic circumstances.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects.</title><p>Twelve healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers participated in this study. All volunteers displayed normal primary and secondary sex characteristics and none of them used medication or had a positive family history of diabetes. The exclusion criteria included known heart disease, vascular disease, present or former cancer, and use of androgenic steroids. Men who were planning to participate in competitive sport events during the subsequent year were not included. At baseline, all volunteers had normal fasting plasma glucose (5.2 [4.7&#x02013;5.7] mmol/L), insulin (33.4 [15.8&#x02013;54.6] pmol/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood count, lipid profile, and renal and hepatic blood tests, and all had normal levels of T (18.6 [8.3&#x02013;32.9] nmol/L) as well as luteinizing hormone (4.8 [1.7&#x02013;8.1] IU/L) and follicle-stimulating hormone (3.2 [1.2&#x02013;6.6] IU/L). All volunteers received oral and written information concerning the study prior to giving written, informed consent. The protocol was approved by the Local Ethical Scientific Committee (M-20070046), registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT-00613288), and performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration II.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Research design.</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study with a washout period of at least 4 weeks. The 12 eligible men were randomly assigned to different treatment series consisting of four arms with two coupled days: a day 1 or &#x0201c;metabolic day&#x0201d; and a day 2, allocated for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry estimation of body composition and VO<sub>2</sub>max, respectively. For the latter, a 6-min submaximal exercise test with continuous monitoring of heart rate was performed on a bicycle ergometer (Monark Ergometric 829 E; Monark Exercise, Varberg, Sweden) using a workload of 300&#x02013;1,200 kpm/min, depending on age and reported physical activity by the subject, and maximal aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>max) was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Hypogonadism was achieved by subcutaneous injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (7.5 mg leuprorelide, Eligard; Astellas Pharma, Wallisellen, Switzerland) 1 month before trial session in three out of four trial sessions. Initially, GnRH agonist treatment results in a burst of T followed by gradual T decline. Therefore, gonadotropins and T levels were measured 1 week before trial days, and volunteers that did not present with castrate levels of T at this point were reinjected with GnRH agonist and the session was postponed. Thus, hypogonadal trial days were preceded by at least 7&#x02013;10 days of castrate levels of T, designed to achieve stable changes in their metabolic state.</p><p>On 3 of 4 trial days (day 1), gel containing physiological or supraphysiological T gel (Testogel, 50 or 150 mg; Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) or placebo gel (produced by the local hospital pharmacy) was applied to the upper body of the healthy volunteer and allowed to dry. T gel has previously been shown to result in normophysiological plasma T levels within 2&#x02013;3 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). On one of four trial sessions, the healthy volunteers served as their own eugonadal controls. In order to minimize carryover and period effects, each of the four treatment modalities were equally distributed throughout the 12 treatment series, in random order, and with at least 1-month intervals between sessions. One volunteer completed only two of four sessions due to an unrelated event (prolapse of an intervertebral disc).</p><p>Three days before the study, volunteers were instructed not to participate in heavy physical exercise or to drink alcoholic beverages. After an overnight fast (&#x0003e;10 h), subjects were admitted to the clinical research unit and confined to bed. At 07:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;120 min), a catheter was placed into an antecubital vein for infusion of saline to maintain catheter patency. Another catheter was inserted into a contralateral hand vein and kept in a thermo-regulated heating box (60&#x000b0;C) for sampling of arterialized venous blood. After collection of baseline blood samples, T or placebo gel was applied (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;120 min) as described above. At 08:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> (<italic>t =</italic> &#x02212;60 min), 20% of the [1-14C]VLDL-TG tracer was infused as a bolus, and a constant infusion of the remaining 80% was started. At <italic>t</italic> = 180 min, a 3-h infusion of human insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark) commenced (0.6 mU &#x022c5; kg total body mass<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x022c5; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Plasma glucose was measured every 10 min and clamped at 5 mmol/L by a variable infusion of 20% glucose. The glucose infusion rate during the last hour of the clamp (M value) was used as an index of insulin sensitivity. Blood samples were drawn to determine VLDL-TG specific activity (SA) at <italic>t</italic> = 0, 120, 150, and 180 min (basal period) and 300, 330, and 360 min (clamp period).

We report that short-term hypogonadism and acute T rescue have differential effects on VLDL-TG kinetics. Although VLDL kinetics and levels of VLDL-TG are unaffected by short-term chronic T fluctuations, acute high-normal T increases VLDL-TG secretion in male hypogonadism within hours, independently of FFA concentrations and body fat distribution. In addition, the early hypogonadal state is characterized by intact VLDL-TG oxidation but impaired total lipid oxidation, which we speculate may be an early feature of hypogonad metabolic dysfunction.</p><p>Currently, our understanding of T&#x02019;s metabolic effects in both acute and longer-term settings is incomplete, and we have no definite understanding of genomic versus nongenomic effects. Many studies have been performed on different hypogonadal populations with regard to age, body composition, and degree of hypogonadism, which makes firm conclusions difficult. For instance, recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated a higher cardiovascular disease risk in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), both among T-sufficient and untreated hypogonadal men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Likewise, the effects of T therapy on glucose control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and risk factors such as cholesterol, C-reactive protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), and TG concentrations are contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), which calls for studies assessing direct effects of T.</p><p>At first glance, the preserved VLDL-TG secretion with short-term hypogonadism and increment after acute T150 substitution seems puzzling. It may, however, be explained by the capability of T to activate both genomic and nongenomic pathways, in which the effects can be biphasic depending on the actual hormone concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and temporal exposure. VLDL-TG secretion is a complicated and not fully understood process, in which the activity of numerous enzymes stimulates the two-step process characterized by the formation of the ApoB-containing VLDL precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum (first step) and the later fusion with a larger triacylglyceride droplet to form the mature VLDL particle (second step) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Although there is no available data supporting a role for T governing these enzymes, longer-term T treatment may well influence hepatic lipid homeostasis through different pathways. For instance, isolated hepatocytes from castrated male rats show increased TG synthesis comparable to that of female rats, whereas 1 month of low-dose T substitution suppresses synthesis to eugonadal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). This is in line with the increased lipogenesis and hepatic steatosis found in androgen receptor knockout mice fed a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Conversely, VLDL secretion in male rats is unaffected by castration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), which accords with unchanged VLDL Apo-B kinetics during 6 months of T and/or growth hormone treatment in healthy, elderly, eugonadal men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and both VLDL-TG and VLDL Apo-B-100 kinetics in obese, premenopausal women after 3 weeks of T treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Thus, T may affect hepatic TG synthesis and VLDL-TG secretion differently, and our data support the concept that T is not a major determinant of the VLDL-TG fatty acid secretion pattern in men.</p><p>The increased VLDL-TG secretion during acute T treatment expands our current knowledge on the ability of androgens to activate fast nongenomic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, no data exist describing the molecular regulation of secretion pattern by T, but we speculate that T can elicit cAMP and PKA activation through the SHBG receptor in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In liver cells, physiological levels of T have been shown to increase cAMP levels within 15 min after exposure, but when used at higher, nonphysiological concentrations, only increased inhibition of the SHBG-steroid complex binding to membranes occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Other studies have shown that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase&#x02013;dependent mechanisms within minutes facilitates exocytosis of lipoproteins and TGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), and yet others have demonstrated that fluctuations in hepatocellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations can contribute either directly or indirectly to microsomal TG transfer protein activation, and thereby to the assembly and secretion of mature VLDL-TG particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). We therefore speculate that the T150 substitution, by reaching a certain threshold, could have activated such pathways and facilitated assembly and exocytosis of mature VLDL particles. Another mechanistic explanation includes the activation of a recently described lipase, arylacetamide deacetylase, which catalyzes the lipolytic mobilization of the cytosolic triacylglyceride, and which has considerable identity with HSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Since androgens can upregulate lipolytic &#x003b2; ADRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and increase catecholamine-stimulated HSL activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), an increased arylacetamide deacetylase activity with T substitution, although speculative, could also increase VLDL secretion acutely.</p><p>Our kinetic data suggest that fluctuations in circulating T levels, both in the acute and short-term chronic setting, have no effects on VLDL-TG clearance rates. Since clearance is a composite parameter, these data do not provide detailed information on tissue-specific clearance. It does, however, seem likely that the transient increase in secreted VLDL-TG during T150 substitution must have been met by a matched increase in peripheral TG removal, explaining the comparable levels of total TG and VLDL-TG found across study arms. Our findings on TG levels are supported by most other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), but T therapy has also been found to suppress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) or even increase TG levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Our data, however, contrast with the general perception that hypogonadism is associated with higher TG levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), but since VLDL-TG synthesis is partly a substrate-driven process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), such elevated levels may well be the result of a higher FFA release. Therefore, our finding of comparable concentrations of FFA and of gene expression levels of perilipin, HSL, and ADRs in both muscle and fat tissue could indicate that in vivo, T does not have immediate effects on tissue lipolysis. On the other hand, eugonadal FFAs were in fact higher at single time points during the basal period along with suppressed adipose tissue LPL expression. This could indicate an increased channeling of TG away from storage in fat tissue toward oxidative pathways in muscle. Although no differences in muscle LPL expression were detected, this hypothesis is supported by the trend toward higher eugonadal VLDL-TG oxidation rates and the significantly lower total lipid oxidation found in all hypogonadal arms regardless of intervention.</p><p>Impaired lipid oxidation, even before any signs of insulin resistance or changes in REE, may therefore be an early metabolic feature of male hypogonadism, in which noninhibited peripheral LPL activity may lead to increased TG uptake and storage. This, in turn, provides one potential mechanism by which hypogonadal insulin resistance may ensue over time<italic>.</italic> We do, however, acknowledge that the current study was not designed to explore such later metabolic perturbations, and current knowledge supports the concept that multiple factors are involved in the development of hypogonadal metabolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Whereas T primarily stimulates extrahepatic and not hepatic lipid oxidation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), limited data are available on other tissues such as heart, kidney, and brain, warranting further research. This is further complicated by the fact that T treatment of hypogonadal populations of different age and etiology seems to affect metabolism and body composition differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, short-term chronic fluctuations in T levels affect whole-body lipid oxidation, but have no effect on REE, VLDL-TG secretion, or the clearance or oxidation pattern in healthy young men. Although acute high T does not affect total lipid oxidation, it does increase VLDL-TG secretion, indicating that androgens can affect hepatic lipid metabolism through fast nongenomic pathways. In addition, we speculate that impaired lipid oxidation during hyperinsulinemia may be one contributor in the development of the obese, insulin-resistant, hypogonadal phenotype. Future studies combining tracer techniques and standardized meals should expose both healthy subjects and hypogonadal patients to graded intervals of longer-term T treatment to fully understand androgenic effects on lipid metabolism.</p></sec>
