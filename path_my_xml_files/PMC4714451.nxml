However, the amount and type of therapist guidance needed in ICBT are still under debate. Previous studies have shown divergent results regarding the role of therapist guidance and its impact on treatment outcome. This issue is central to the development of ICBT programs and needs to be addressed directly. The present study aims to compare the benefits of regular therapist guidance via online real-time audio-video communication (i.e. Skype) to no therapist guidance during a 12-week Romanian self-help ICBT program for Panic Disorder. Both treatments are compared to a waiting-list control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A parallel group randomized controlled trial is proposed. The participants, 192 Romanian adults fulfilling diagnostic criteria for panic disorder according to a diagnostic interview, conducted via secured Skype or telephone, are randomly assigned to one of the three conditions: independent use of the internet-based self-help program PAXonline, the same self-help treatment with regular therapist support via secured Skype, and waiting-list control group. The primary outcomes are severity of self-report panic symptoms (PDSS-SR) and diagnostic status (assessors are blind to group assignment), at the end of the intervention (12&#x000a0;weeks) and at follow-up (months 3 and 6). The secondary measures address symptoms of comorbid anxiety disorders, depression, quality of life, adherence and satisfaction with ICBT. Additional measures of socio-demographic characteristics, personality traits, treatment expectancies, catastrophic cognitions, body vigilance and working alliance are considered as potential moderators and/ or mediators of treatment outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first effort to investigate the efficacy of a self-help internet-based intervention with therapist guidance via real-time video communication. A direct comparison between therapist guided versus unguided self-directed intervention for panic disorder will also be addressed for the first time. Findings from this study will inform researchers and practitioners about the added value of online video-therapy guidance sessions and the type of patients who may benefit the most from guided and unguided ICBT for Panic disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=366360">ACTRN12614000547640</ext-link> (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry).

The lifetime prevalence for mental health disorders in general is above 46&#x000a0;%, with the highest prevalence recorded for anxiety disorders, given that almost 1 out of 3 people (28.8&#x000a0;%) suffer from an anxiety disorder during their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Every year over 38.2&#x000a0;% (164.7 million people) of the total EU population suffer from at least one mental disorder and the resulting economic costs rise at 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;% of EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>One third of medical consultations made by general practitioners are in fact provided for mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A report released by WHO (World Health Organization) and WONCA (World Organization of Family Doctors) in 2008 stated that &#x0201c;up to 60&#x000a0;% of people attending primary care clinics have a diagnosable mental disorder&#x0201d; (page VII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is an alarming underdetection of mental health problems &#x02013; for example, detection rates of anxiety and mood disorders in general practice reach only 15 and 36&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, collaboration between GPs and mental health services is either poor or non-existent.</p><p>Despite the potential to successfully treat mental disorders, only a small minority receive even the most basic treatment. Studies have shown that 60&#x000a0;% of those in need receive no treatment at all, and only 32.7&#x000a0;% of those who receive treatment get it at minimal quality standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, there are numerous individual and systemic barriers to accessing mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], thus the treatment is provided only with a significant delay from the onset of the disorder (after 9&#x02013;23 years for anxiety disorders and 6&#x02013;8 years for mood disorders) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In some countries, the situation is even worse. In Romania, where the current study is conducted, 76.4&#x000a0;% of the individuals with mental health disorders do not have access to any form of treatment; only about 11.5&#x000a0;% receive psychological or psychiatric help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Computer and Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments (ICBT) represent recent attempts to innovate the psychotherapeutic process, matching both the existent demands of the market, and the new attitudes of those who seek help in the digital era. Research on internet-based treatments has grown rapidly in the past decade, gathering more than 100 controlled studies that tested various intervention programs for anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or other psychiatric conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Overall, the outcomes of these studies have been positive and very convincing. Several studies reported no significant differences in treatment outcomes when comparing internet-based interventions to traditional face-to-face therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For a review see Andersson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Because half of all lifetime cases of mental disorders start by age 14&#x000a0;years and the median age of onset for anxiety is 11&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], it should be mentioned that ICBT shows promising results not just for adults, but also for treating anxiety and depression in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Anxiety disorders seem to be one of the most approachable and treatable types of mental disorder through online therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Panic disorder (PD) with or without agoraphobia is one of the conditions for which ICBT programs have been developed since the late 1990s and there are several empirical studies supporting their efficacy and effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In Romania, only one internet-based treatment has been tested so far, the Swedish program Sofie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The study yielded positive outcomes for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, but the program is currently not in use.</p><p>The most promising interventions designed and tested so far are guided self-help interventions. A guided ICBT intervention is a web-based self-help program combined with minimal, but regular therapist support. In guided programs, asynchronous communication (emails or text messages) is most commonly used and, on average, patient guidance does not take more than 10&#x000a0;min per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. So far, research is very limited regarding web-based treatment programs that provide guidance through synchronous (real time) audio-video communication (e.g. video chat programs such as Skype). On the other hand, there is growing evidence that the efficacy of CBT delivered via videoconference is equivalent to face-to-face treatment for mood and anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This type of communication closely matches face-to-face therapy and enables access to important face-to-face cues such as verbal tone, facial expressions, and body language. Through synchronous guidance, the therapists may be able to offer more individually tailored feedback and support according to each patient&#x02019;s personal needs. Furthermore, this type of contact may facilitate higher engagement, feelings of accountability and social support, and reduce the risk of misunderstandings, compared to emails and instant messaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. All of the above could also facilitate the development of a better therapeutic alliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], a factor that has consistently proven to be a key predictor for therapeutic change in face-to-face therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. So far, there is mixed evidence regarding the importance of the therapeutic alliance in guided ICBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Even if contact with the therapist is only minimal, patients seem to develop a strong alliance, but this makes no difference for the outcome, at least for self-help interventions with rather low-intensity guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, the therapeutic alliance in internet-based treatments that include video conferencing is yet to be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Of course, there are also disadvantages for using real-time audio-video communication. For instance, compared to asynchronous written exchanges, patients do not have the opportunity to revisit and reread the dialogues with their therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The patients are still able to revisit and reflect upon the information enclosed in the treatment modules, but they cannot review their guidance sessions.</p><p>It is still not clear enough whether guided online treatments work better than unguided treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], however there is a strong tendency for the superiority of guided treatment, especially for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. So far, the literature suggests a superiority of guided versus unguided self-help treatments in terms of efficacy, adherence to treatment and drop-out rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], but the conclusions are based on few studies and mainly limited to depression and social anxiety disorder, thus restricting the generalizability of the findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p>There is good quality evidence that ICBT treatments, especially guided interventions, are both efficacious and effective, either compared with waiting-list or with face to face interventions, but there is no intervention that is suitable for everyone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In order to be able to make recommendations for a certain person, with certain characteristics, we need to know which variables can predict or mediate/ moderate the outcomes. Unfortunately, the studies conducted so far showed that there are few stable predictors across studies and diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. For example, treatment adherence was considered as a potential predictor variable, but there are inconsistencies, with some studies finding an association between adherence and clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and others not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Another example is the severity of the disorder at baseline. In one study, a high baseline severity predicted better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], while another study showed the contrary, low levels of panic symptom severity predicting better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Another interesting result concerns the role of comorbidity. A recent study showed that having a comorbid anxiety disorder was associated with a better treatment outcome among patients with panic disorder but not patients with social anxiety disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], while others found no significant association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Considering these mixed results, we agree with Andersson who concluded &#x0201c;We do not know much about predictors of treatment outcome and the mechanisms involved in generating good outcome. Thus, more studies on moderators and mediators are needed&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], p.106).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives and research questions</title><p>The aim of the present trial is to investigate the clinical efficacy of an internet-based self-help treatment program for panic disorder with therapist guidance via secured Skype in Romanian adults. The program (PAXonline for panic disorder) has been developed de novo by the authors, based on empirically validated cognitive-behavioral models of anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], and it is currently the only available psychological treatment of this kind in Romania. A secondary objective is to compare the guided self-help intervention to a similar but unguided intervention program, considering clinical outcomes, adherence to treatment and drop-out. Additional exploratory research will be conducted to identify potential predictors, moderators and mediators of treatment outcome, such as patients&#x02019; expectations, patient-therapist working alliance, panic disorders severity and comorbidity status, and other relevant factors that were chosen based on previous research findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/ Design</title><p>The study design is reported in line with the CONSORT 2010 statement (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] and the SPIRIT 2013 Statement (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial with two active treatment conditions and a waiting list control group.

The website provides information about panic disorder and treatment options, a description of the present clinical trial, and information about enrollment. The screening process for eligible participants is described below.</p><p>The participants start the screening process on the study website by filling out several online forms, anonymously. Firstly, participants must provide an online informed consent, then provide age and gender information. Next, they fill out three key questionnaires: (1) a screening for the exclusion criteria; (2) a scale for panic disorder diagnosis and severity (PDSS-SR); and (3) a screening for psychiatric comorbidities (PDSQ). Only participants who do not meet any exclusion criteria, who have a PDSS-SR score of at least 6 (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] for PDSS-SR cutoffs), and have completed the entire PDSQ screening are invited to provide an email address for further contact. Eligible participants are contacted by email to schedule a semi-structured clinical interview via secured Skype or telephone. The interviews are conducted by a trained clinical psychologist, who seeks to verify and confirm the diagnosis of a panic disorder and the compliance with all the inclusion/ exclusion criteria. At this point, participants who remain eligible after the interview receive an email from the principal investigator with a detailed informed consent and a link to fill out the online pre-treatment questionnaires. Participants are required to give their express consent to be included in the study. Specifically, they reply to the contact email confirming that they have read the informed consent and they accept to voluntarily participate in the study. They must also fill out their name and contact details at the end of the document. Participants who consent to this procedure are then randomly allocated to one of the three study groups.</p><p>After randomization, each participant receives an email containing instructions for the next phase. The guided participants receive a document with the recommended pathway for the entire course of treatment, along with instructions on how to communicate with their psychotherapist in the platform. They have a few days to explore the platform and read the first recommended module before scheduling their first Skype session with their psychotherapist. The first session is an introductory session in which the therapist explains the platform&#x02019;s architecture and further collaboration between therapist and participant.

The participants in this group have regular 15&#x02013;30 min Skype sessions (the length depends on the complexity of the modules and the needs of each patient) with their psychotherapist. The first Skype session is introductory and takes place in the first week of the treatment, after the participant completed the module &#x0201c;Anxiety, from normality to pathology&#x0201d;. From then on, a new session is scheduled almost every week, but only after the participant has completed the corresponding modules from the recommended timetable. The sessions are scheduled via an encrypted asynchronous communication system available on the treatment platform. The participants can also use this system between two Skype sessions if they need further clarifications from their therapist.</p><p>In total, there are 10 Skype sessions programmed. During these sessions, held over secured Skype, the psychotherapist checks if the participant has completed and understood each module, answers questions, and helps the participant carry out the recommended exercises. The main purpose of each online session is to make sure that the patient has everything he needs in order to put the recommended exercises into practice regularly. That means, according to a behavioral model of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], the psychotherapist try to set the necessary antecedents by providing procedural knowledge (&#x02018;I know what I have to do and how to do it&#x0201d;), self-efficacy (&#x0201c;I believe I can do it&#x0201d;) and motivation (&#x0201c;I&#x02019;m convinced that it is worth doing it&#x0201d;). The agenda for Skype sessions usually involves: review of the week and how the participant feels, checking the homework assigned in previous sessions, discussing the last module, demonstrating a certain exercise or practicing together with the participant and, at the end, planning homework that should be carried out until the next session.</p><p>For example, in the first and the second session the psychotherapist works with the patient to develop a case conceptualization in order to understand the origin of the problem and the mechanisms by which it is maintained. They then discuss the treatment plan so that the patient understands how the intervention will answer his/her needs. In the session following the third module, the psychotherapist briefly explains the hyperventilation process, describes and demonstrates the breathing control technique to the patient and then they practice it once together. In the end, the psychotherapist helps the patient find a time and place to practice the technique twice a day. After the interoceptive exposure module, the psychotherapist explains the rationale of the technique once more, encourages the patient and does a few exercises from the list together with the patient (e.g. breathing for 2&#x000a0;min through a straw, spin in a chair for 20&#x02013;30 s, cover the head with a scarf or a jacket etc.).</p><p>The modules and the entire therapeutic environment of PAXonline are carefully designed in order to facilitate the psychotherapeutic process (e.g. personalization of intervention, organizing information and knowledge in learning objects and use of other effective chunking strategies, enhancing learnability by using multimedia content, use of three layers of information, providing immediate feedback to queries, teach-back exercises, providing a reward after each module completion, offering access to a personal portfolio and a virtual library etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The program also contains certain techniques aimed at improving adherence and compliance with the treatment, e.g. rewards after module completion (short movies that induce positive emotions), the &#x0201c;meditation of the day&#x0201d;, which is sent via e-mail every 5&#x000a0;days and contains a link to a short movie or animation that is meant to be inspirational and/ or motivational. The participants&#x02019; adherence is carefully monitored by measuring overall usage time, the modules and homework assignments completed, the time spent on each module and each module component.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Therapists</title><p>Three licensed psychotherapists with formal training in cognitive-behavioral therapy and a minimum of 3&#x000a0;years of clinical experience work with the participants allocated in the first treatment group. They have also participated in a 3&#x000a0;months blended course (3 face to face meetings plus online learning) prior to this study and were instructed in using the PAXonline platform and delivering CBT interventions online. The guidance will be delivered according to a standard treatment protocol, but it will also be personalized according to each participant&#x02019;s need. During the study, the team meets once a month for discussions and the main researcher is available for contact at any time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Instruments</title><p>The selected instruments have already been well validated and are frequently used in CBT clinical trials for panic disorder in particular, as well as for other anxiety and mood disorders. Measures are taken at baseline (pre-treatment), 6&#x000a0;weeks after the intervention started (mid-treatment), directly after the intervention (post-treatment, 12&#x000a0;weeks after baseline), 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after the intervention ends. All self report measures are administered through the internet (secured links are used and all the data are encrypted) and the diagnostic interviews are conducted through secured Skype or by phone. The questionnaires, which were not yet validated for Romanian population, were previously translated in Romanian and underwent a rigorous back-translation process to ensure a good adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes are the diagnostic status of the participants at post-assessment and symptoms of panic disorder as assessed with the PDSS-SR.</p><p>Panic Disorder Severity Scale &#x02013; Self Report (PDSS-SR). PDSS is originally a face-to-face interview and was adapted to a self-report questionnaire by Houck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The scale contains seven items that measure the severity of seven dimensions of panic disorder and associated symptoms: 1) frequency of panic attacks; 2) distress during panic attacks; 3) anticipatory anxiety (worry about future panic attacks); 4) agoraphobic fear and avoidance; 5) interoceptive fear and avoidance (i.e., apprehension and avoidance of bodily sensations); 6) impairment of or interference with work functioning; and 7) impairment of or interference with social functioning. The PDSS-SR generates a total score ranging from 0 to 28, with a higher score indicating more severe panic symptoms. The questionnaire has good psychometric properties (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92, test-retest reliability is 0.83) and is sensitive to changes following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. A cut-off score of six may discriminate between the presence and absence of current DSM-IV panic disorder and a cut-off score of fourteen may discriminate between mild and severe panic disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Diagnostic interview</title><p>Panic Disorder is assessed using the Romanian adapted version of Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>], which comprises a self-report screening scale, followed by a semi-structured interview delivered by a clinician. The PDSQ scale has good psychometric properties. In the Romanian validation study the mean of the alpha coefficients was .85 and test&#x02013;retest reliability was above .80 for nine subscales, with a mean test&#x02013;retest of .85 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. A diagnosis of Panic Disorder is considered if the participant&#x02019;s score reaches a value of at least 4 on the Panic scale. The same cutoff is applied for agoraphobia. Among Romanian psychiatric patients, these values offered the best balance between sensitivity and specificity: .90/.72 for panic disorder, and .95/.85 for agoraphobia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].</p><p>Following the screening procedures, all eligible participants are interviewed by one of three experienced licensed clinical psychologists, based on the semi-structured interviews included in the PDSQ. This interview has been developed based on DSM-IV diagnosis criteria. In addition to Panic and Agoraphobia diagnoses, any other mental disorder that reached PDSQ screening cutoff point is assessed during the interview. In order to increase inter-raters agreement on assessment protocol, the assessors also participated in a two days training before study commencement. The diagnostic interviews are conducted before and after treatment by clinicians blind to the treatment group. At post-treatment diagnostic interview we are going to count missing data as equivalent to still meeting diagnostic criteria for panic disorder. This is the procedure that is recommended according to the intention-to-treat paradigm and was used in several other studies (e.g. Hedman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcome measures include quality of life, stress levels, depressive symptoms, catastrophic cognitions, body vigilance, and fear of bodily sensations.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Depression</title><p>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a widely used measure for depression.

The WSAS is a 5-item simple, reliable and valid measure and we chose it in order to evaluate the self-reported functional impairment produced by anxiety problems. The scale items encompass different domains of functioning and include the following: ability to work, home management, social leisure, private leisure, and ability to form and maintain close relationships. Each item is rated on a 9-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 8 (very severe impairment). The maximum total score is 40, with higher scores representing greater impairment. The WSAS has demonstrated good internal consistency (range between 0.70 and 0.94) and test-retest reliability (0.73) and is sensitive to patients&#x02019; perceptions of disorder severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Attention biases</title><p>Body Vigilance Scale (BVS)&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] .

The 4 items of BVS measure the degree of attentional focus on, and perceived sensitivity towards changes in bodily sensations, and the amount of time spent scanning for bodily sensations. Research suggests that the BVS has adequate internal consistency in clinical and nonclinical populations and can be used to assess changes in bodily attention during cognitive&#x02013;behavioral treatment for panic disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Fear of body sensations</title><p>Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. BSQ was chosen in order to measure the &#x0201c;fear of anxiety&#x0201d; concept, an aspect that it is targeted in our intervention program. This is a 17 item self-report questionnaire and is used to assess the degree to which sensations associated with autonomic arousal (e.g., &#x0201c;feeling short of breath,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;heart palpitations&#x0201d;) are experienced as frightening. Each item is rated on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely).

The PACQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] is a 25-item scale assessing the extent to which catastrophic cognitions dominated subject&#x02019;s thoughts before, during, or after panic attacks. Participants are asked to rate each thought on a 4-point scale indicating their level of preoccupation with that thought from 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;not at all to 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;totally dominates my thoughts. The total PACQ score is the sum of the 25 item scores. This scale was composed from items generated from the DSM-III-R description of panic attacks, from ideation reported in the anxiety literature, and from interviews with patients. The fifth edition of DSM is currently in use, but analyzing the DSM versions, we could conclude that the panic disorder diagnostic criteria have not changed much from DSM-III-R to DSM-5 (APA, 2013). There is still the distinction between autonomic nervous system symptoms (11 symptoms) and catastrophic cognitions (fear of dying, fear of losing control or going crazy). In the DSM-5 panic disorder and agoraphobia are two separated diagnoses, but other than that there are no major changes, at least not concerning the catastrophic cognitions, which are assessed through PACQ. The PACQ has good internal consistency as calculated by Cronbach alpha (.88).

The PAQ is a 36-item questionnaire designed to measure four dimensions of personal autonomy: cognitive autonomy, behavioral autonomy, emotional autonomy and value autonomy. Ratings are given on a 5-point Likert scale, with higher scores reflecting a stronger personal autonomy (reverse score items: 1, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 29, 34, 35 and 36).

Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale and the items are summed for a total score ranging from 5&#x02013;25. The SS-5 proved to have adequate test-retest reliability (0.92) and internal consistency (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.88).

The SUS consists of 10 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1-5), with odd-numbered items worded positively and even-numbered items worded negatively. The scale has been used in hundreds of studies and the psychometric qualities are adequate (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.88).

The randomization process is done by a software that was developed to implement a minimization algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>], that assures a balanced randomization between groups with respect to certain predefined prognostic (stratification) factors. In this study, two stratification factors have been considered: SEVERITY (3 levels according to PDSS-SR screening scores; level 1: 6 to 13 points; level 2: 14 to 20 points; level 3: 21 to 28 point) and CHRONICITY (2 levels; more or less than 6&#x000a0;months since the beginning of PD) of panic disorder. The minimization method has been shown to outperform simple randomization in achieving balanced groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] and its use in clinical trials has been previously recommended as a better option than other randomization methods (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]). Before each allocation, the algorithm computes an imbalance score for the three available treatments, taking stratification factors levels into account. The treatment with the lowest imbalance score is then given preference when assigning treatments, but the allocation probability varies for each patient, depending on the actual level of imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. This method is preferred because it avoids the deterministic allocation of pure minimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. The allocation is done by an independent researcher and is concealed, i.e. patients and researchers have no knowledge and no control over the allocation of participants when they randomize a participant with the computer program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Blinding</title><p>Taking the characteristics of our research into consideration, it is impossible to keep patients or psychotherapists blind to the study procedures and intervention. All participants are provided with detailed information about the aims and the methodology of the study. They can request more information about the study and they have the right to terminate participation at any time. The personnel in charge with the clinical interviews, on the other hand, will be blind to the treatment group allocation. We specifically instruct the participants not to mention group allocation at the post-treatment interview, but also test whether blinding was successful. The clinicians who conduct the diagnostic interviews are required to describe in their report if the participants disclosed their study group, directly or indirectly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Sample size</title><p>The effect sizes reported between guided and unguided interventions are quite heterogeneous with small to medium Cohen&#x02019;s d size effects between 0.27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and .42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Taking into consideration that, in most part, the guidance in previous studies was in fact low-intensity guidance, and that more support from a therapist yields larger effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], we expect an effect size of 0.5 (Cohen&#x02019;s d) between guided and unguided treatment for PD. Based on this effect size, a power of 0.80, and an alpha level of 0.05, we would need 51 subjects in each condition. This recommended sample size has been increased to accommodate an attrition rate of 20&#x000a0;%. Thus, the study aims to achieve a sample of 192 participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses will be performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. The main analyses will be conducted on the intention-to-treat samples (all randomised participants, regardless of protocol adherence). Following current standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], a linear mixed effects models approach with full information maximum likelihood estimation will be used. This approach has been recommended since it uses all available data and can handle missing data appropriately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. The approach is based on the assumption that data are missing at random, and does not assume that missing data remain stable, as in the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. Significance testing of dichotomous data such as diagnostic status will be conducted with chi-square tests. Calculations of within- and between-groups effect sizes (Cohen&#x02019;s d) will be based on the pooled standard deviations. Regression analyses will be used to identify predictors of treatment outcome. Moderation and mediation analyses will be conducted with multiple regression models, using the PROCESS macro for SPSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>], a computational technique that can compute both simple and complex moderation and mediation models. Effect sizes for significant effects will be indicated by Cohen&#x02019;s f.</p><p>Consistent with CONSORT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] and SPIRIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] recommendations we mention our intention to perform secondary analyses for minimal treatment users, defined as participants that complete at least 5 of the recommended modules, have at least 3 of the available guidance sessions (this is available only for the Skype-guided group) and use the intervention program for at least 80&#x000a0;min. This definition is based on the specific of our intervention program and the criteria used in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Discussion</title><p>The prevalence of mental health problems is very high and bears considerable suffering and burden worldwide. However, only a small percentage of the affected individuals reach out and receive treatment for their problems. There are many barriers at different levels, yet a viable solution to increase access to quality treatment resides in the possibilities provided by internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments. Although several ICBT programs have been tested with strong positive results and even integrated into regular health care, there are countries where validated internet-based interventions are yet to be developed. The present trial aims both to validate the overall efficacy of the first Romanian ICBT program for panic disorder, and to investigate aspects that are novel to ICBT, such as brief therapist guidance sessions via secured Skype.</p><p>There are still divergent results regarding the effect of therapist guidance in ICBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], and the efficacy of Skype-based (or equivalent) therapy sessions in ICBT have not been previously investigated. Thus, a central focus of our trial is to test the additive effect of therapeutic guidance via secured Skype in self-help ICBT programs. Specifically, the current study design allows us to assess the effect of the same self-help intervention modules in two treatment conditions: therapist guided via Skype vs. unguided self-directed intervention.</p><p>There is a general consensus that internet-based therapy can be efficient for many psychiatric conditions, but not all the patients benefit from it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Thus, there is an increasing interest to describe the characteristics of the patients who would benefit the most from this type of interventions. Taking into consideration this issue, additional exploratory analyses of potential predictors, moderators or mediators will be made. Patients&#x02019; treatment expectations, personality traits (e.g. personal autonomy), and usability of the online treatment program could prove to be key factors of treatment adherence and outcome, especially in the unguided self-help treatment group.</p><p>Several possible limitations should be noted. Firstly, the study sample size is large enough to reach our main research objectives, but will not permit us to perform detailed subgroup analyses. However, we expect to identify candidate predictors of treatment outcome that could be tested directly in future studies with larger samples. Secondly, the control group, for ethical reasons, will receive treatment in the second stage of the trial, thus the control group will not be available at follow-up. Furthermore, most of the recruitment will be made from the community, through advertisements in the media and on the study website, which could lead to a self-selected sample. Regarding the latter limitation, several findings from recent studies suggest that sampling bias may not affect the generalizability of internet-based trials. For example, Titov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>] revealed that patients undergoing web-based treatments resemble national samples and present disorders as severe as those undergoing traditional psychotherapy. Another example is a recent study by Donkin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>] on sampling bias in an internet-based clinical trial for depression. The authors revealed that out of 35 potentially biasing factors, only 4 were associated with consenting likelihood, accounting for limited variance in explaining participation, and none were associated with the primary outcomes. Future research will be required, nonetheless, to investigate whether the results from the PAXonline trial can be generalized to samples in regular mental health care settings.</p><p>In Romania, the need for easily accessible treatment programs for mental disorders is very high. 76.4&#x000a0;% of the individuals with mental health problems do not have access to any form of treatment, and only approximately 11.5&#x000a0;% receive psychological or psychiatric treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Internet-based treatments can offer a viable alternative solution to the current situation, considering that internet access has increased rapidly over the past years in Romania (in 2004 only 6&#x000a0;% households had access to the internet, and presently the number has increased to 61&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]). However, although ICBT advantages are easily recognized, both patients and psychologists in Romania have a reserved attitude towards using internet-based psychological intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. By developing rigorous clinical trials on the efficiency of Romanian ICBT programs, we can increase the uptake of these solutions, and thus have a significant positive impact on the quality of life, both at an individual and national level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Trial status</title><p>Trial start date: May 22, 2014.</p><p>Currently recruiting (N<sub>current</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;99 as of December 15, 2015).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The ICBT program for Panic Disorder used in this study was developed by the authors for research purposes, but is delivered, from a technological standpoint, via a web-based software developed by COGNITROM Ltd, a Romanian private R&#x00026;D company.
