ERCP in the prone position can facilitate selective bile duct cannulation and offer a better fluoroscopic image of the pancreaticobiliary anatomy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, in cases of difficulty in the prone position, ERCP can be performed in the left lateral or supine positions. Compared with the prone position, the left lateral position is more comfortable for the patients particularly in cases with limited cervical movement, including cases of cervical cord injury, cervical spine operations, Parkinson's disease, muscle contracture due to cerebral infarction, and in cases of pregnancy, recent abdominal surgery, severe abdominal, and distension. However, fluoroscopic images of the bifurcation, right and left hepatic duct, and intrahepatic bile ducts, pancreatic duct (PD) are adversely affected by the left lateral position.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Furthermore, scope torsion and physician's need to look or turn away from patient or monitors can be additional setbacks of the left lateral position.</p><p>In cases of severe abdominal pain, severe abdominal distension, extensive ascites, recent abdominal surgery, cervical spine surgery, intraabdominal catheter insertion, and severe obesity, it is difficult to place the patient in the prone or left lateral position, and ERCP may therefore be performed in the supine position. However, ERCP in the supine position is associated with a documented increase in the risk of cardiopulmonary adverse events and a decreased selective bile duct cannulation success rate.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Comparison of the efficacy and safety of the prone and supine positions for ERCP have previously been reported in several studies,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] whereas there is a paucity of literature about the left lateral position for ERCP.

Written informed consent for ERCP was obtained from all patients. In patients with combined cholangitis, blood cultures were performed and intravenous third-generation cephalosporin was administered. Before the endoscopic procedures, the patients were randomly assigned to the left lateral position or prone position group based on a computer-generated randomization. Conscious/moderate to deep sedation was performed via a nonanesthesiologist-assisted method.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Intravenous midazolam (0.05&#x02013;0.1 mg/kg) and/or intravenous propofol (0.5&#x02013;1 mg/kg) was administered. The administered analgesics were intravenous meperidine (25 mg) in patients older than 50 years and meperidine (50 mg) in patients younger than 50 years. To limit duodenal peristalsis, hyoscine-N-butylbromide was intravenously administered. Prophylactic rectal nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were not used because it was commercially unavailable. All patients were provided oxygen at 2 l/min via nasal prongs. The patients' oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration were monitored during the procedures. All adverse events that occurred during the endoscopic procedures were recorded in case report forms as intraprocedural adverse events. Four hours, 24 h, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after the procedure, the white blood cell, hemoglobin, and platelet counts, the total bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transaminase, amylase, and lipase levels were recorded, and abdomen and chest X-rays were performed.

There were no differences in rates of successful CBD cannulation or acquisition of the therapeutic goals between the two groups (96.8 and 96.8%, respectively, in the left lateral; 100 and 100%, respectively, in the prone groups). The rates of adverse event were also similar between the groups (40.4% in the left lateral vs. 32.3% in the prone group). Therefore, the present results suggest that the left lateral position for ERCP is as effective and safe as the prone position. However, due to high rates of unintended PD cannulation and PD contrast injection in the left lateral position group, the left lateral position should be initially preferred for patients with limitations, that increase the difficulty of prone positioning, such as cervical movement limitations due to cervical cord injury, cervical spine operation, and neck surgery, Parkinson's disease, muscle contracture due to cerebral infarction, severe abdominal pain, severe abdominal distension, extensive ascites, recent intraabdominal surgery, intraabdominal catheter insertion, severe obesity and pregnancy.</p><p>The rate of ERCP-related adverse events in the present study is relatively high compared with that of a previously reported study.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The reason for this difference is likely the application of strict criteria for adverse events in the present study. Furthermore, analyses of small sample sizes in low volume centers can be associated with high rates of adverse events. However, the majority of adverse events were mild and noncardiopulmonary problems. Moreover, the cases involving severe cardiopulmonary events and intensive care (one case of sepsis and one case who required intubation and a ventilator) recovered without sequelae. There were no bowel perforations, which can be associated with high mortality, in either group. There were no mortalities in the present study.</p><p>In the left lateral group, the rates of PD cannulation and acquisition of pancreatograms were significantly higher than those in the prone group (9/30, 30.0% vs. 3/31, 9.7%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = 0.046; 7/30, 23.3% vs. 1/31, 3.2%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = 0.020). The reason for high rate of PD cannulation in the left lateral position could have been related to the altered axis of the CBD, instability of en face view, difficulty of ampullary visibility, and scope manipulation (torsion and position). In the left lateral position, the axis of the CBD and the PD are rotated further counter-clockwise relative to the prone position. Furthermore, regular use of standard catheter, which lacks ability to bow the catheter, can have an impact on difficulties in adjusting the catheter to the altered axis of the CBD. Consequently, the guidewire tends to more easily cannulate the PD. The reason for the high rate of the acquisition of pancreatograms is likely attributable to the increased need for contrast injection due to the superimposition of the CBD and the PD in the 12 o'clock direction in the left lateral position. In the left lateral position, the CBD and PD can be superimposed in the 12 o'clock direction, whereas the CBD is in the 11&#x02013;12 o'clock direction and the PD is in the 1&#x02013;2 o'clock direction in the prone position. Consequently, in the left lateral position, the guidewire in the PD is relatively difficult to distinguish from the guidewire in the CBD, and thus the need for contrast injection into the PD may be increased with the left lateral position. Despite the high rates of inadvertent PD cannulation and contrast injection, there were no significant differences in the rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis between the two groups (6/30, 20% in the left lateral vs. 5/31, 16.1% in the prone group, <italic>P</italic> = 0.694). It is notable that despite higher rates of PD cannulation, which is known as an independent risk factor of post-ERCP pancreatitis, in the left lateral position, this did not seem to affect the development of pancreatitis in the present study. There could be several possible factors that relieved the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis despite high rates of unintended PD cannulation. First, in cases of difficult cannulation, early rescue intervention using needle-knife precut was performed, and most of them were successful in selective cannulation without difficulty. Second, wire-guided cannulation rather than contrast-induced cannulation was used as a routine cannulation method, and the contrast injection to the PD could be minimized. Third, most of the cases enrolled in the present study were patients who were at non-high risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Fourth, indications for ERCP were carefully selected, and most of the cases were therapeutic ERCPs, not diagnostic ERCP. Due to potentially multiple conflicting factors described above, the impact of PD cannulation on development of post-ERCP pancreatitis could be relieved in the present study.</p><p>The reported incidences of the rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis are generally in the range of 1&#x02013;7% for standard procedures in nonhigh-risk patients.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In the present study, patients with average risk conditions were enrolled, and the rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis was about 18% (11/61). There can be several reasons for the unusually high rates of post-ERCP pancreatitis in the present study. First, low-volume of ERCP (approximately 100 ERCPs of na&#x000ef;ve papilla per year) by a single endoscopist can affect the high rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Second, no use of prophylactic PD stent for preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis can also affect the development of pancreatitis. Third, pharmacologic prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis using rectal indomethacin cannot be performed because rectal indomethacin is commercially unavailable in South Korea. Moreover, other pharmacologic agents were not used practically because of their unclear effect and medical insurance issues in South Korea. Fourth, the use of standard ERCP catheter rather than sphincterotome for initial routine cannulation could be associated with the unusual high rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Fifth, EPBD, a well-recognized risk factor of post-ERCP pancreatitis, was used for sphincter therapy with or without EST in the present study.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The fixed arm fluoroscopy was used because C-arm fluoroscopy is not available in our hospital. The fixed arm fluoroscopy does not have rotatable movement of fluoroscopy, and adjustment of fluoroscopic direction to obtain optimal cholangiogram can be limited. Therefore, the effect of having fixed arm as opposed to C-arm fluoroscopy in performing ERCP can limit optimal evaluation of biliary tree in the present study.</p><p>There are several limitations to the present study. First, this study was performed in a single center with a low case volume by a single endoscopist, and these factors might reduce the general applicability of the left lateral position for ERCP in routine practice. Second, the small sample size could have resulted in an overestimation of ERCP-related adverse events. Third, the evaluation of risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis could not be considered in the present study. Fourth, regular use of standard catheter instead of sphincterotome for routine cannulation can also be a potential weakness in terms of the clinical applicability, given that a majority of endoscopists use wire-guided sphincterotomes rather than standard catheter. Fifth, the lack of rotatable C-arm can limit the adjustment of fluoroscopic direction, and limit to obtain optimal cholangiogram.</p><p>In conclusion, the current findings would suggest that the left lateral position for ERCP is as safe as the prone position. Due to the increased rates of unintended PD cannulation and PD contrast injection, the left lateral position for ERCP should initially be preferred for patients with limitations that increase the difficulty of the application of the prone position. Therefore, a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial with a large number of selected patients is required to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the two different patient positions during ERCP in the future.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This research was supported by the Hallym University Research Fund 2016 (HURF-2016-17).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maple</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Ben-Menachem</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Appalaneni</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Cash</surname><given-names>BD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The role of endoscopy in the evaluation of suspected choledocholithiasis</article-title><source>Gastrointest Endosc</source><year>2010</year><volume>71</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20105473</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baron</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name><name><surname>Mallery</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Hirota</surname><given-names>WK</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacobson</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name><name><surname>Leighton</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The role of endoscopy in the evaluation and treatment of patients with pancreaticobiliary malignancy</article-title><source>Gastrointest Endosc</source><year>2003</year><volume>58</volume><fpage>643</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14595292</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Costamagna</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Tringali</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current management of postoperative complications and benign biliary strictures</article-title><source>Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am</source><year>2003</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>635</fpage><lpage>48</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14986791</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ferreira</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name><name><surname>Baron</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of safety and efficacy of ERCP performed with the patient in supine and prone positions</article-title><source>Gastrointest Endosc</source><year>2008</year><volume>67</volume><fpage>1037</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18206877</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Froehlich</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Patient position during ERCP: Prone versus supine.
