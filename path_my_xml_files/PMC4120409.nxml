<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The diabetogenic effect of diuretics seems to be taken for granted. In fact, in addition to results from a large cohort study,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> a recent network meta-analysis conclusively showed a higher risk for new onset of type 2 diabetes in patients receiving thiazide diuretics than in those receiving calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) or placebo.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It is of note, however, that relatively high doses of thiazide diuretics (25&#x02005;mg of hydrochlorothiazide equivalent or more) were used mainly with &#x003b2;-blockers in most studies included in this meta-analysis. Antihypertensive treatment with diuretics in this way is no longer relevant to current antihypertensive therapeutic practice. Thiazide diuretics are currently used at relatively low doses, more likely in combination with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and calcium antagonists, according to the clinical background of the patient, rather than as a single agent with dose titration. Therefore, there is a need for assessment of the metabolic effects of treatment with low-dose diuretics rather than of those of diuretics per se. In addition, from the methodological point of view, as no study thus far has assessed the diabetogenic effect of diuretics as the primary end point, this study is being done to fill that gap.</p><p>Although there is no universal agreement that thiazide diuretics are the first-choice antihypertensive drug, evidence from clinical trials in &#x02018;salt sensitive&#x02019; patients, such as ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial),<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and pathophysiological considerations regarding salt intake and blood pressure control, suggest that appropriate use of thiazide diuretics is undoubtedly necessary for a large subpopulation of hypertensive patients.</p><p>This study of Japanese patients with essential hypertension was performed to assess the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment with low-dose thiazide diuretics may not be associated with a higher risk for new onset of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities compared to treatment of such patients without diuretics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was an independent, investigator-initiated, multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, open, blinded-end point, parallel group study conducted in Japan (NCT00131846).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study was conducted in Japan at hypertension clinics of 106 sites including general practitioners&#x02019; offices (n=61) and teaching hospitals (n=45).

We collected data continuously even after patients suffered a non-fatal secondary end point in order to assess whether onset of diabetes occurs. Diagnostic criteria for each end point were defined a priori and were used by the end point committee. Briefly, diagnosis of the primary end point was made according to WHO criteria 1998<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and the criteria of the Japanese Diabetes Society<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> based on the results from regular assessment of blood glucose. Gout was diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology 1977 criteria C.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Treatment-resistant hypokalaemia was defined as continuous hypokalaemia (&#x0003c;3.5&#x02005;mmol/L) even after the addition of potassium-sparing drugs or potassium supplementation in patients without any evidence of secondary hypertension. Diagnosis of stroke, myocardial infarction or heart failure was made by WHO MONICA Project diagnostic criteria,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> AHA Scientific Statement 2003<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> or diagnostic criteria of the Framingham study,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> respectively. Renal dysfunction was defined as doubling of serum creatinine concentrations, of 4&#x02005;mg/dL or more, or progression to end-stage renal disease (renal transplantation or haemodialysis). Dissection of aortic aneurysm was diagnosed by medical history, symptoms and imaging. Deterioration of ASO was defined according to the Fontaine classification.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Sample size</title><p>The trial was designed as an equivalence trial, which was powered for equivalence of Diuretics to No-diuretics group on the primary end point.

We also calculated that 713 patients per group would yield 80% power. Thus, a total of 2400 and 1800 patients as the total sample size were to be enrolled, accommodating a possible 20% dropout during the follow-up period, in order to provide 90% and 80% power, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Evaluation of effects of antihypertensive treatment with low-dose thiazide diuretics</title><p>Continuous variables were expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD or median with IQR. Continuous variables were compared using the Student t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test based on their distributions. Clinical outcomes were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Each end point was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Time-to-events analysis of the primary end point should be justified because of regular assessment of glucose with short intervals. Effect of treatment was compared by the Cox proportional hazard model, and was expressed by HR with 95% CI. Comparison was also made with the adjustment by assignment factors. As a sensitivity analysis, we compared incidence of diabetes diagnosed by WHO criteria only between the groups. Treatment effect was evaluated in several prespecified subgroups, including stratified variables, concomitant antihypertensives and dose of diuretics as a subgroup analysis. In addition, we also performed on-treatment analysis to assure results from intention-to treat analysis. No-diuretics group was defined as patients receiving no diuretics throughout the study period and diuretics group was defined as patients receiving diuretics at the end of the observation period irrespective of allocated treatment. The study statistician conducted all statistical analyses with the use of JMP V.8.0 and SAS V.9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA). All reported p values were two-sided with the significance level set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The recruitment of patients was started on 5 April 2004 and terminated on 7 February 2012 despite insufficient statistical power at that point because the steering committee thought that further extension would not promote the enrolment of patients. The follow-up was then terminated at the end of August 2012. We did not conduct interim analyses because of insufficient enrolment of patients. 1130 patients were randomised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004576F1">figure 1</xref>).

Consistency between intention-to-treat analysis and on-treatment analysis might assure our conclusion. A lack of adverse effects of low-dose diuretics on glucose metabolism, represented by fasting glucose levels and HbA1c (which were consistent with the incidence of diabetes), was also demonstrated.</p><p>Unlike our results, a recent meta-analysis of 22 clinical trials showed that diuretics use was associated with a greater risk of new onset of diabetes compared to other antihypertensive drugs and placebo in hypertensive patients.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> We assume that differences in the dose of diuretics used, concurrent antihypertensive drugs used with diuretics and the study design may explain different results regarding incidence of diabetes. Doses of thiazide diuretics in most studies included in the meta-analysis by Elliot and Meyer were higher (25&#x02005;mg of hydrochlorothiazide or more) than those used in the current study. Similarly, although Bakris <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> showed that the fixed combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide impaired glucose tolerance in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome, the dose of this combination was titrated to 100&#x02005;mg of losartan and 25&#x02005;mg of hydrochlorothiazide in approximately 80% of patients. As Carlsen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> showed previously, there is a clear relationship between dose of thiazide diuretics and effect on glucose, potassium and uric acid but not blood pressure. Results from our study suggest that treatment with diuretics at the dose of 12.5&#x02005;mg of hydrochlorothiazide equivalent may not increase the risk for new onset of diabetes; that is, the diabetogenic effect of thiazide diuretics may also be dose dependent. One might claim that there is no evidence to support that diuretics at the doses used in this study reduce cardiovascular events. However, improved cardiovascular outcome can be expected as long as target blood pressure is achieved by a combination of drugs including thiazide diuretics even at low doses (12.5&#x02005;mg of hydrochlorothiazide or equivalent).</p><p>It is of note that almost 80% of patients in the Diuretic Use group of our study used inhibitors of RAS, while &#x003b2;-blockers were the main combination drug with diuretics in most studies included in the meta-analysis such as ALLHAT study.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The combination of diuretics and inhibitors of RAS is common in current clinical practice and appears to be associated with a lesser risk of diabetes compared to the combination with a &#x003b2;-blocker, as shown by the LIFE (Losartan Intervention For End point reduction in hypertension) study.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, it can be assumed that current therapeutic strategy with diuretics at low doses mostly combined with RAS inhibitors does not carry a high risk for diabetes. However, we could not show clear interactions of concurrent drugs (&#x003b2;-blockers and RAS inhibitors) and the risk for diabetes in subgroup analysis, largely because the study was underpowered. Recently, subanalysis of the NAVIGATOR (Nateglinide and Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research) study demonstrated that use of diuretics was associated with excess risk for type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> There is, however, limitation in the interpretation of this result because use of diuretics was not randomised and the doses of diuretics were not as low as our study.</p><p>Our study is, as far as we know, the first randomised, controlled trial to assess, as the primary end point, risk in essential hypertensive patients for new onset of diabetes associated with treatment by thiazide diuretics. Most studies showing a higher risk for diabetes from diuretics use were primarily designed to assess cardiovascular events as the primary end point, and new onset of diabetes was assessed by post hoc analysis or, at best, as a prespecified secondary end point.</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for the increased incidence of diabetes with use of thiazide diuretics at a high dose have not been fully elucidated. A recent quantitative review showed that thiazide-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased blood glucose.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the current study, no clinically significant difference in averaged plasma potassium levels were seen during the observation period, which may be attributable to the low dose of diuretics and frequent use of RAS inhibitors, and may partly explain why no difference in the incidence of diabetes between the groups was found.</p><p>Serum uric acid levels during the study were significantly higher in the Diuretic group than were those in the No-diuretics group. This may suggest that elevation of uric acid cannot be avoided even by use of low dose with RAS inhibitors. However, the clinical significance of such a small elevation of uric acid is unclear, because treatment with diuretics did not increase the incidence of gout, which is consistent with results from another epidemiological study, in which no significant increase in risk for gout was seen with use of lower doses of diuretics (12.5&#x02005;mg/day in hydrochlorothiazide equivalents).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitation of our study</title><p>As we could not achieve the target sample size, our study is statistically underpowered for the assessment of equivalency. Therefore we are able to state that we found no evidence of a difference in outcome, but not that the treatments were equivalent in terms of incidence of diabetes. We conducted a pragmatic trial for the assessment of effectiveness of treatment with low-dose diuretics but not the efficacy of the diuretics per se by using an unblinded study design without any prespecified therapeutic algorithm, which may have impaired internal validity to some extent partly because of clustering of antihypertensives or other drugs such as drugs for hyperuricaemia.</p><p>The ascertainment bias was much less likely even though it was an open study without placebo because we regularly assessed the incidence of diabetes for all patients. However, given that time course of development of type 2 diabetes is uncertain, validity of diagnosis of diabetes in trials such as ours is limited.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results from the present randomised controlled trial suggest that current practice of antihypertensive treatment with thiazide diuretics at low doses may not be associated with increased risk for new onset of type 2 diabetes or other clinically significant metabolic abnormalities. These results might suggest safety of use of low doses of thiazide diuretics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e293" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004576.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e294" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004576.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TM had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
