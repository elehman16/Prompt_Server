We validated tPERSEVERE performance in a prospective cohort, with an a priori plan to redesign tPERSEVERE if it did not perform well. Biomarkers were measured in the validation cohort (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;168) and study subjects were classified according to tPERSEVERE. To redesign tPERSEVERE, the validation cohort and the original derivation cohort (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;299) were combined and randomly allocated to training (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;374) and test (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;93) sets. tPERSEVERE was redesigned using the training set and CART methodology. tPERSEVERE performed poorly in the validation cohort, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.58&#x02013;0.75). Failure analysis revealed potential confounders related to clinical characteristics. The redesigned tPERSEVERE model had an AUC of 0.83 (0.79&#x02013;0.87) and a sensitivity of 93% (68&#x02013;97) for estimating the risk of a complicated course. Similar performance was seen in the test set. The classification tree segregated patients into two broad endotypes of septic shock characterized by either excessive inflammation or immune suppression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>We prospectively tested the performance of the temporal version of the pediatric sepsis biomarker risk model (tPERSEVERE).</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>tPERSEVERE performed poorly in the test cohort, prompting a redesign.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>The redesigned tPERSEVERE model performed well upon testing.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>The redesigned tPERSEVERE provides information regarding septic shock endotypes.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Septic shock is characterized by individual heterogeneity and it is not known who is at greatest risk of poor outcome and would thus benefit from more aggressive treatment. We designed a biomarker-based model to estimate the risk of poor outcome in children with septic shock.

Patient outcomes are highly variable, reflecting a complex, time-dependent interplay between inflammation, immunity, pathogen-related factors, patient heterogeneity, and therapeutic interventions. We have attempted to navigate this complexity at the individual patient level by developing biomarker-based models to estimate the probability of poor outcomes in patients with septic shock (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alder et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan and Wong, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Analogous to longstanding concepts in the oncology field, we contend that understanding baseline probability of poor outcome is fundamental to clinical practice and research in the field of septic shock. Prognostic models that reliably estimate the risk of poor outcome have the potential to serve as tools for enrichment of clinical trials, inform individual patient decision-making, to serve as a benchmark for quality improvement efforts, and to facilitate risk-stratified analyses of clinical data. Further, such models have the potential to provide insight regarding the pathogenesis of septic shock and how it varies among different patients.</p><p>The Pediatric Sepsis Biomarker Risk Model (PERSEVERE) incorporates a panel of biomarkers and age into a decision tree estimating the baseline risk of mortality in children with septic shock (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014b</xref>). The PERSEVERE biomarkers are proteins measured in the blood compartment on day 1 of presentation to the intensive care unit with septic shock. To reflect change in risk over time, we developed a temporal version of the model (tPERSEVERE) (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014c</xref>). tPERSEVERE considers how the PERSEVERE biomarker concentrations change from day 1 to day 3 of septic shock, and how these changes are associated with poor outcome.</p><p>We envisioned that a reliable temporal model could potentially serve as a monitor for therapeutic efficacy, in combination with traditional clinical parameters. For example, if the model signals a decreasing risk for poor outcome over time, this could be indicative of therapeutic efficacy. Alternatively, if the model signals increasing risk or unchanged risk from a high baseline risk, this could indicate lack of efficacy and could potentially trigger a reassessment of the therapeutic regimen.</p><p>Models such as tPERSEVERE require prospective testing in order to assess validity and generalizability. In the current study, we prospectively tested the performance of tPERSEVERE in an independent validation cohort, and use the results to explore how biological variation may be associated with the pathogenesis of poor outcomes in septic shock.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Subjects and Data Collection</title><p>The validation cohort consisted of 168 subjects prospectively enrolled since the initial derivation of tPERSEVERE.

Children &#x02264;&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;years of age admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and meeting pediatric-specific consensus criteria for septic shock were eligible for enrollment (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2007</xref>). The only exclusion criterion was the inability to obtain informed consent, which was obtained from parents or legal guardians prior to any data or sample collection.</p><p>Serum samples were obtained within 24&#x000a0;h of first meeting the criteria for septic shock in the PICU, which was typically at presentation. These are referred to as &#x0201c;day 1&#x0201d; samples. &#x0201c;Day 3&#x0201d; samples were collected 48&#x000a0;h after the day 1 samples. Clinical and laboratory data were collected daily while in the PICU. Organ failure data were tracked up to day seven of septic shock using previously published criteria (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein et al., 2005</xref>). Mortality was tracked for 28&#x000a0;days after enrollment. Complicated course was defined as the persistence of two or more organ failures at day seven of septic shock or 28-day mortality (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Illness severity was estimated using PRISM scores (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Pollack et al., 1997</xref>). Baseline mortality probability was estimated using PERSEVERE (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>PERSEVERE Biomarkers</title><p>PERSEVERE includes C&#x02013;C chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), interleukin 8 (IL8), heat shock protein 70&#x000a0;kDa 1B (HSPA1B), granzyme B (GZMB), and matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8) (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2012</xref>).

Initially, we explored reasons for failure by comparing the validation cohort to the original cohort, and by characterizing false negatives and comparing them to true positives. Then, to redesign tPERSEVERE we combined the 168 prospectively enrolled subjects, and the 299 previously reported subjects. From this pooled cohort (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;467) we randomly selected 80% of the subjects for a training cohort (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;374) and the remaining 20% were retained as a test cohort (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;93).</p><p>The modeling procedures for redesigning tPERSEVERE used CART methodology (Salford Predictive Modeler v6.6, Salford Systems, San Diego, CA) (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Che et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Muller and Mockel, 2008</xref>). The primary outcome variable for the modeling was a complicated course, as defined above (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Using complicated course as the primary outcome variable allows for the exploration of association between temporal biomarker changes and nuances of sepsis severity beyond the dichotomy of &#x0201c;alive&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d;. Continuous, predictor variables for the modeling procedure included the PERSEVERE-based mortality probability, day 1 and day 3 PERSEVERE biomarker values, age, and a derived variable termed &#x0201c;delta&#x0201d;, which subtracted the day 1 value for a given biomarker from the respective day 3 value. Dichotomous predictor variables included gender, and the presence of any co-morbidity, malignancy, immune suppression, or previous bone marrow transplantation. Weighting of cases and the addition of cost for misclassification were not used in the modeling procedures.

We therefore redesigned tPERSEVERE with the goals of improved performance across a diverse cohort of children with septic shock and providing biological insight regarding poor outcomes.</p><p><xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the training and test sets for the modeling procedures.

We tested the performance of tPERSEVERE prospectively and found that it performed poorly. One possible reason for failure is that the originally derived model was mathematically over fit, without providing any biological insight (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014c</xref>). Another possible reason is that clinical characteristics having the potential to affect the risk of poor outcome differed between the derivation and validation cohorts, including the prevalence of a complicated course. Finally, our failure analysis suggested that tPERSEVERE performed poorly in those subjects with lower PRISM-based illness severity who went on to develop a complicated course. Accordingly, we redesigned tPERSEVERE using a modeling approach that included these potential confounders.</p><p>We attempted to account for differences in disease severity by combining the derivation and validation cohorts, and by randomly selecting subjects for training and test sets. This generated two groups of subjects with similar complicated course prevalence. The two groups were also well matched for the majority of clinical variables examined, except for age and mortality. To further account for differences in clinical phenotype, we considered comorbidity variables, age, and gender in the modeling procedures. None of these clinical variables added to the predictive capacity of the redesigned tPERSEVERE model.</p><p>The original version of tPERSEVERE contains only the absolute day 1 and day 3 PERSEVERE biomarker values. To redesign a better performing model that could also provide biological insight regarding the development of poor outcome in children with septic shock, we considered two additional biomarker-based variables. First, we considered the PERSEVERE-based mortality probability. This is a composite variable reflecting day 1 biomarker values for CCL3, IL8, HSPA1B, GZMB, and MMP8, and age (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014b</xref>). Second, we considered the possibility that a derived variable reflecting the changes in biomarker values from day 1 to day 3, could provide biological information beyond the absolute day 1 and day 3 biomarker values.</p><p>The redesigned tPERSEVERE model performed well in the test set. Beyond risk prediction, we suggest that the redesigned model provides useful biological information regarding the risk of a complicated course in children with septic shock. Current paradigms for understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis place patients into two broad endotypes (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Hotchkiss and Sherwood, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Hutchins et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Skrupky et al., 2011</xref>). One endotype involves patients with excessive inflammation. In these patients, inflammatory mechanisms intended for the eradication of infection become excessive and thereby cause collateral damage to host tissues, which in turn leads to organ injury and higher risk for poor outcome. The other endotype involves patients with ineffective inflammation and a state of relative immune suppression. These patients are also at risk for poor outcome because they are unable to effectively clear infections or are at risk for secondary infections. These two endotypes represent extremes of a spectrum; it is likely that many patients with sepsis reside somewhere within this spectrum. In addition, many patients move along this spectrum during the course of illness.</p><p>IL8 and CCL3 are the major chemokines responsible for recruitment and activation of white blood cells and are thus key mediators of inflammation (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Aziz et al., 2013</xref>). In murine models of experimental sepsis, the respective homologs for IL8 and CCL3 increase in proportion to sepsis severity (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Ebong et al., 1999</xref>). Subjects occupying the right side of the redesigned decision tree (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) had an intermediate to high PERSEVERE-based mortality risk. Among these subjects, if IL8 levels remained relatively high on day 3 (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;450&#x000a0;ng/ml, terminal node 11) or if the day 1 CCL3 level was greater than 100&#x000a0;ng/ml (terminal node 10), there was a greater than 50% probability of a complicated course. Conversely, subjects with a high PERSEVERE-based mortality probability, but a relatively low day 3 IL8 concentration (&#x02264;&#x000a0;450&#x000a0;ng/ml) and a day 1 CCL3 concentration less than 100&#x000a0;ng/ml (terminal node 9), had a much lower probability (15%) of a complicated course. Thus, excessive inflammation in the presence of high baseline risk portends poor outcome, while lesser inflammation despite high baseline risk is associated with diminishing risk. These observations are consistent with the sepsis endotype characterized by excessive inflammation.</p><p>Subjects occupying the left side of the redesigned decision tree had a low PERSEVERE-based mortality risk. In these subjects, if IL8 decreased by at least 300&#x000a0;ng/ml from day 1 to day 3, the probability of a complicated course was 6.3% in the context of a day 1 IL8 concentration &#x02264;&#x000a0;525&#x000a0;ng/ml (terminal node 1), but 44.4% in the context of a relatively high day 1 IL8 concentration (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;525&#x000a0;ng/ml, terminal node 2). In other words, relatively lower baseline IL8 concentrations that are decreasing portend lower risk than relatively higher baseline IL8 concentrations that are decreasing. This suggests those subjects whose inflammatory state is excessive at baseline do poorly, even though inflammation may be diminishing over the first few days. In these same low-baseline-risk subjects, subjects with a day 1 IL8 concentration &#x0003e;&#x000a0;125&#x000a0;ng/ml and a day 3 IL8 concentration of &#x0003e;&#x000a0;350&#x000a0;ng/ml had a 42.8% probability of a complicated course (terminal node 8). These observations are also consistent with the sepsis endotype characterized by excessive inflammation and, in particular, suggest evolving excessive inflammation.</p><p>In contrast, subjects occupying terminal nodes 5, 6, and 7 may represent the sepsis endotype characterized by immune suppression. In these subjects higher CCL3 concentrations on day 3 were associated with a low risk of a complicated course (terminal nodes 5 and 7), whereas subjects with relatively lower CCL3 concentrations on day 3 had a higher risk of a complicated course (terminal node 6). It may be that these subjects have insufficient recruitment of white blood cells and therefore had a state of relative immune suppression.</p><p>Finally, subjects in terminal nodes 3 and 4 may represent patients along the spectrum of excessive inflammation and immune suppression. These patients are defined initially by a low PERSEVERE-based mortality risk, a relatively low starting IL8 and a low day 3 CCL3 concentration. In these subjects, day 3 MMP8 differentiates between those at low risk and those at intermediate risk of a poor outcome. This is consistent with data from murine models exploring the role of MMP8 in sepsis. In these studies, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of MMP8 conferred a survival advantage in mice subjected to sepsis, and this effect was associated with decreased activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor, NF-&#x003ba;B, and other indices of inflammation (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Solan et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We note the limitations of the study. The process of redesigning and testing the tPERSEVERE model was based on pooling of all available subjects, random selection, and subsequent allocation into training and test sets. This process could have introduced unknown or unintended biases. It is therefore possible that the redesigned model is over fit, despite its good performance in the test set. The redesigned model requires testing with a fully independent validation cohort. Our interpretation of the biological information that the model might be providing is based on existing principles of potential sepsis endotypes and data from murine models of sepsis, but is speculative nonetheless. It will be important in future studies to directly determine the relative states of inflammation and immune suppression in subjects allocated to the respective terminal nodes potentially associated with excessive inflammation or immune suppression.</p><p>In conclusion, tPERSEVERE performed poorly upon prospective testing. We identified potential confounders leading to failure, and this prompted a redesign of the tPERSEVERE model using randomly selected training and test sets. The redesigned model performed well in the test set, and is consistent with current paradigms of sepsis endotypes involving excessive inflammation and immune suppression. The redesigned model requires prospective testing in a validation cohort and functional studies to confirm the validity of our interpretations of the biological information provided by the model. Successful validation could position tPERSEVERE as a monitor of therapeutic efficacy in patients with septic shock and as a tool for understanding septic shock endotypes predicated on patterns of inflammation and immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Author Contributions</title><p><italic>Hector R.

A negative value for a &#x0201c;delta&#x0201d; occurs when the biomarker level is, on average, decreasing. Terminal nodes (TN) TN1, TN3, TN5, TN7, and TN9 are low risk terminal nodes (0.0% to 15.0% risk of complicated course). TN2, TN4, TN6, and TN8 are intermediate risk terminal nodes (28.9% to 46.7% risk of complicated course). TN10 and TN11 are high risk terminal nodes (&#x02265;&#x000a0;50% risk of complicated course).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Classification of the test set according to the redesigned tPERSEVERE model.
