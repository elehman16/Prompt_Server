But, pain on its injection is a common problem in adults, which varies between 30 and 90%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Several strategies have been suggested to prevent or reduce pain at the site of propofol administration. Most previous and recent work in this area has been performed on the adjuvant use of hypnotic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory or local anesthetic drugs, which include adding lignocaine to propofol, cooling or warming propofol, diluting the propofol solution, injection of propofol into a large vein and pretreatment with intravenous injection of lignocaine, ondansetron, metoclopramide, opioids, magnesium or thiopentone with or without tourniquet; granisetron, metoclopramide, magnesium, ketorolac, dexamethasone or thiopentone &#x02013; all have been tried with variable, and sometimes conflicting, results. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of opioid receptors in the primary afferent nerve endings in peripheral tissues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl is a short-acting pure opioid agonist commonly used for intraoperative and postoperative systemic analgesia. Also, it has some peripherally mediated analgesic action within the clinical dosage range.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Lignocaine is a short-acting local anesthetic agent; when injected into a vein prior to propofol administration, it can reduce pain due to its local anesthetic action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Pain on injection of propofol can be immediate or delayed. Immediate pain probably results from a direct irritant effect whereas delayed pain probably results from an indirect effect via the kinin cascade. Delayed pain has a latency of between 10 and 20s. Despite this discomfort, the incidence of venous sequelae, such as phlebitis, is &#x0003c;1%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The present study objectives was to study the effect of pretreatment with preservative-free lignocaine 2%, fentanyl and normal saline as placebo, using the venous retention technique for prevention of pain on propofol injection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted at the Department of Anaesthesiology of a tertiary care postgraduate teaching Hospital, Kolkata, between January 2008 and September 2008. The number of participants required in each group was determined using PS &#x02013; &#x0201c;Power and Sample Size Calculation&#x0201d; &#x02013; software (Version 2.1.30, February 2003). The sample size required for correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (of equal incidences of pain on propofol injection) with the probability of 90% (i.e., power of 90%) was calculated based on the following assumptions. The incidence of pain on propofol injection in a previous study by Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>. (1984) was 85%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Another study by Pang <italic>et al</italic>. (1998) found that the incidence of pain on propofol injection on pretreatment with fentanyl was 34%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] With &#x003b1;=0.05, i.e. probability of Type 1 error=5%, and the ratio of control to experimental participants equal to one in each group, it was determined that 21 participants in each group were required. Inclusion Criteria: Participants of the age group of 18&#x02013;60 years of either sex, ASA physical status 1 and 2 undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. The Exclusion Criteria: The following participants were excluded from the study:</p><p>

</p><p>This study is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (<italic>n</italic>=21 in each group). The primary outcome variables are:</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i)</label><p>Incidence of pain on pretreatment drug injection in each group.</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii)</label><p>Four-point pain score in the placebo control (saline), fentanyl, in lignocaine groups to assess severity of pain on propofol injection as follows: 1 &#x02013; No pain, no reaction to injection. 2 &#x02013; Slight pain (minor verbal or facial response). 3 &#x02013; Moderate pain (clear verbal or facial response). 4 &#x02013; Severe pain (patient complains of pain and withdraws the arm).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Visual analogue scale (VAS) was not used as it appears to be sensitive to smaller changes in effect over time than are categorical measures. A four-point categorical scoring system was chosen in this study rather than the VAS system as it was very simple to use. Appropriate hand&#x02013;eye coordination required for recording the VAS score might not be present in all participants during the rapidly changing state of consciousness during anesthesia induction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>After approval of the institute's ethical committee and obtaining written informed consent, 21 participants in each of the three groups were enrolled for the study. Participants underwent thorough preoperative evaluation and were checked against the exclusion criteria of this study. In the operating room, after cleansing of the local area with 70% alcohol, venous cannulation was done in a large peripheral vein of the hand using an 18G polyurethane intravenous cannula, and intravenous drip with Ringer Lactate was started at 100 mL/h. To ensure blinding, coded syringes containing test drugs were prepared by an anesthesiologist not involved in evaluation of the pain score. Participants of group A received 2 mL of 2% lignocaine (preservative free) intravenously. Participants of group B received 2 mL fentanyl (100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g) intravenously. Participants of group C received 2 mL normal saline intravenously. Participants were randomized into three groups to receive, intravenously, either lignocaine (40 mg) or fentanyl (100 &#x003bc;g) or placebo (normal saline). The randomization list was generated by a random number function using the Microsoft Excel 2003 spreadsheet, resulting in a list of 63 assigned to participants receiving the drugs. Identical-looking coded syringes were prepared by an anesthesiologist not involved in the study. Venous occlusion of the arm proximal to the puncture site was maintained with a blood pressure cuff inflated to 40 mmHg as veins over the dorsum of the hand were used for the pretreatment drug injection. The study drugs or placebo were injected over 30 s and venous occlusion was released after 1 min of completion of the pretreatment drug injection. The patient was assessed for any pain to the pretreatment drug. After 1 min, the venous occlusion was released and propofol (2 mg/kg) at room temperature was administered through the intravenous cannula. During a 10-s pause after the first 25% of the calculated propofol dose, the patient was assessed according to the four-point pain score. In the present study, long chain triglyceride (LCT)-based propofol formulation was used in all participants. Thereafter, induction of anesthesia was continued with the remainder of the calculated dose of propofol. Atracurium 0.5 mg/kg intravenous injection was used for muscle relaxation to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with halothane 0.5% and 66% nitrous oxide with oxygen on controlled ventilation with intermittent bolus of atracurium. Intraoperative analgesia was maintained with incremental doses of fentanyl 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g as intravenous injection. At the end of surgery, inhalational agents were discontinued and neuromuscular blockade was reversed with injection neostigmine 0.5 mg/kg plus injection glycopyrolate 0.01 mg/kg intravenously. The participants were extubated and transferred to the recovery area after confirmation of satisfactory recovery criteria. The injection site was checked for pain, edema, and wheal and flare response after one hour of induction by a person blinded to the group assignment.</p><p>Data Analysis expressed as follow: Demographic data were expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD (age, weight, height) or proportion (sex and ASA physical status). Incidences of severe pain and milder degrees of pain on injection of propofol (grades 1&#x02013;4 on a four-point pain scale) were expressed as proportions (percentage) of the total number of participants in each study group. Parametric data were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni's and Tamhane's <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis. Categorical data were analyzed using the Chi-square test. Comparison was made using Phi and Cramer's V statistics after cross-tabulation for the incidences of pain and skin reaction on injection of pretreatment drugs and the pain associated with propofol injection in participants pretreated with either normal saline or fentanyl or lignocaine intravenously. The severity of pain on propofol injection was compared among the three groups using Kendall's tau b statistics. Processing of study data and statistical analysis was carried out using the &#x0201c;SPSS version 13.0 (2004) for Windows&#x0201d; statistical software and Quickcalcs online calculator for scientists from Graphpad software to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were 63 participants (<italic>n</italic>=63) divided into three equal groups of 21 participants (<italic>n</italic>=21) each.

In the control group, 38.1% of the participants experienced severe pain compared with 9.5% in the fentanyl (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) group, and there were no such incidences with lignocaine. These observations corroborated with the previous studies where the incidence of pain on intravenous injection of fentanyl, lignocaine and normal saline was 34%, 11% and 0%, respectively. The lowest incidence of pain on propofol injection was observed in group B (lignocaine pretreatment group, 14.3%), whereas group C (normal saline pretreatment group, 71.4%) experienced the highest incidence of pain on propofol injection. Participants in group A (fentanyl pretreatment group) had a lower incidence of pain (42.9%) than group C (normal saline pretreatment group, 71.4%), but still higher than that in group B (lignocaine pretreatment group). Both lignocaine and fentanyl pretreatment reduced pain on propofol injection, with lignocaine pretreatment being more efficacious.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Others reported that intravenous lignocaine was the most commonly used pretreatment, but had a failure rate of 13&#x02013;32%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The effectiveness of lignocaine and fentanyl are consistent with the reports of others who also reported that lignocaine and fentanyl were effective in reducing the intensity of propofol injection pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] But, few other studies concluded that fentanyl pretreatment was not found to be effective in reducing pain on propofol injection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] It may be noted that in one of the former studies, venous retention technique for the pretreatment drugs was not used, which might account for the difference in the result.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, 38.1% of the participants had severe pain (score 4) and 23.8% had moderate pain (score 3) on propofol injection in the normal saline group compared with 9.5% participants with severe pain and 14.3% with moderate pain in the fentanyl group. None of the participants in the lignocaine group experienced severe or moderate pain, proving more efficacious than fentanyl in this respect.

Many factors can affect the incidence of pain, which include site of injection, size of vein, speed of injection, buffering effect of blood, temperature of propofol and concomitant use of drugs such as local anesthetics and opioids, all of which could not be get rid of.</p><p>Different methods have been used to decrease the discomfort of pain for drug-pretreatment by brief venous retention with tourniquet, which is used prior to propofol injection, that isolates the forearm veins from the rest of the circulation. It presents a useful model for studying the peripheral actions of a drug in the absence of a central effect. Briefly applied venous tourniquet does not cause pain by itself. Although this technique is straight-forward in elective surgery and adult participants, its clinical applicability in emergency induction and children remains doubtful. Further studies are needed to establish the feasibility of this technique in children and emergency induction of anesthesia.</p><p>In conclusion, lignocaine 40 mg or fentanyl 100 mcg retained in the tourniquet-occluded veins for 1 min effectively reduce pain on propofol injection compared with the normal saline placebo. Compared with fentanyl, lignocaine is more effective in preventing pain on propofol injection. Compared with fentanyl, lignocaine pretreatment was more effective in preventing pain on propofol injection.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
