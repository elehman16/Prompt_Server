During the curative phase of cancer, optimal enteral or parenteral nutrition intake can reduce morbidity and mortality, and improve quality of life. When the main goal of treatment becomes palliative, introduction of artificial nutrition is controversial. Although scientific societies do not recommend the introduction of artificial nutrition in all cases of malnutrition, especially in hypophagic patients if their life expectancy is shorter than 2&#x000a0;months, considerable differences in the use of parenteral nutrition in nonsurgical oncology practice are noted around the world. One explanation is a paucity of well-conducted randomized controlled trials in these situations, and consequently, the risk/benefit ratio of parenteral nutrition and its impact on quality of life in palliative care remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The ALIM-K study is a French national multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of parenteral nutrition, versus an exclusive oral-feeding supply, on the quality of life of malnourished patients who have a functional digestive tube and who are at the palliative phase of advanced cancer with a life expectancy of more than 2&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This article presents the methodologic options chosen for our study, and in particular, the choice of the Zelen method of randomization, the definition of the main end point (quality of life), the choice of comparator (oral feeding), and the inclusion criteria (life expectancy of more than 2&#x000a0;months), which are all critical points in building a randomized controlled trial in the setting of palliative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study was registered with the clinical trials database ClinicalTrials.gov on May 27, 2014, under the number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02151214">NCT02151214</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Malnutrition</kwd><kwd>End-stage cancer</kwd><kwd>Palliative care</kwd><kwd>Parenteral nutrition</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Malnutrition in cancer patients is well established as a contributor to morbidity and mortality, and its prevalence remains high, despite considerable progression in cancer therapy over the last 10&#x02013;year period. According to reports, malnutrition affects 20% to 50% of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and its consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality are well described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Anticancer treatments compound this situation by the addition of frequent digestive disorders (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, mucitis, paralytic ileus, malabsorption). The sometimes severe vomiting despite adjunctive use of antiemetics or optimization of chemotherapy regimens can also be a possible cause of malnutrition.</p><p>In the last few years, malnutrition in cancer has garnered increasing attention, and this is reflected by the publication of specific guidelines and research reports, whose number has increased by 84% in the last 5&#x000a0;years (131 publications) as compared with the previous 5&#x000a0;years (71 publications) (based on a Medline search for the terms &#x0201c;malnutrition&#x0201d; AND &#x0201c;Cancer&#x0201d; limited to &#x0201c;Clinical Trials OR meta-analysis OR guideline&#x0201d; as filters, as performed on August 12, 2014).</p><p>Accordingly, the European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) has published specific guidelines for the use of artificial nutrition in cancer patients in the nonsurgical context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For patients undergoing curative treatment, management of malnutrition is based on enteral nutrition when the digestive tract is functional, and parenteral nutrition is indicated for patients whose digestive tract is not functional (for example, in patients with peritoneal carcinosis with intestinal occlusion in the context of gynecologic cancers). Parenteral nutrition offers the possibility of increasing or ensuring nutrient intake in patients in whom normal food intake is insufficient and enteral nutrition is either not feasible, contraindicated, or not accepted by the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The duration of this type of nutrition can be up to several months. This type of artificial nutrition yields a significant increase in survival, and also a significant gain in terms of disease-related morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Serious complications can occur in the short, medium, or long term, and mainly comprise catheter infections, septic complications, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, or hyperglycemia, resulting in dehydration with electrolyte disturbances. These in turn may cause coma, hypertriglyceridemia, or hepatobiliary complications in the longer term, with risk of progression to active fibrosis and cirrhosis.</p><p>Considerable controversy remains as to whether artificial nutrition should be introduced at the palliative stage of cancer. The European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) has published specific guidelines for the use of artificial nutrition (enteral or parenteral) in end-stage cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite efforts by scientific societies to be restrictive with the indications for artificial nutrition, wide variations in the use of parenteral nutrition in nonsurgical oncology practice exist around the world. Withdrawing or withholding artificial nutrition in palliative care is often interpreted by the patient, their family, and/or the caregivers as an abandonment that can often lead to ethical dilemmas among health care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Health care providers seem to lack information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and consensus regarding the introduction or withdrawal of artificial nutrition at the end of life, and most existing guidance stems from expert agreement, with a low level of evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In case of end-stage cancer, the results are even less salient, and to date, few clinical studies have evaluated the risk-benefit ratio of artificial nutrition in the context of palliative care. Agreement exists among all healthcare professionals that it is not advisable or desirable to introduce artificial nutrition in an aphagic or hypophagic patient at the end stage of cancer, if their life expectancy is shorter than the expected duration that it would take to die of starvation (that is, less than 2&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Conversely, it is unclear what should be done for such patients with incurable cancer when life expectancy is longer than 2&#x000a0;months.</p><p>A major source of controversy in daily practice arises from the involvement of several different specialists, who each focus on different outcomes. For example, the oncologist focuses on reducing tumor growth and improving survival, whereas the nutritionist focuses on balancing food intake and biologic parameters, whereas supportive carers are primarily concerned with the well-being and quality of life of the patient. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for oncologists to persist with their treatment objectives, even when some consider that artificial nutrition could accelerate tumor growth. Nutritionists and dietitians cite the benefits of a balanced diet in responding to energy needs, thus helping the patient to feel better.</p><p>Last, palliative or supportive caregivers are reluctant to administer parenteral feeding, for fear of a futile and risky intervention, which could lead to serious complications and loss of autonomy with unnecessary prolongation of the patient&#x02019;s suffering and end-of-life process, rather than extending survival with an acceptable quality of life.</p><p>One of the main objectives of palliative care is the improvement of, or failing that, maximizing delay in the deterioration of health-related quality of life. In this context, the expected favorable effects are counterbalanced by the constraints and complications related to artificial nutrition, particularly when oral feeding is still possible. Thus, artificial nutrition is not recommended in patients if the nutritional status, and/or calorie intake, remain satisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>A recent nationwide cross-sectional study performed by the research network in palliative care in Sweden (PANIS) described off-label use. The authors studied 1,083 patients with malignant tumors at the palliative stage, and noted that 13% were receiving artificial nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The data showed that parenteral nutrition was the most frequent type used (in two thirds of cases), with wide regional variations. Other countries have reported almost systematic use of artificial nutrition in this context (80% of patients at admission to the Seoul main hospital, and up to 83% at 2&#x000a0;days before death) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Weight loss and loss of appetite were the main reasons justifying initiation of artificial nutrition, despite the possibility of oral feeding. Initiating artificial nutrition at this stage of disease seems to be less guided by scientific evidence, and more by subjective motivations linked to beliefs, cultural or religious traditions, the symbolism of the function of eating, the deep-seated fear of dying of hunger, and the vision of care.</p><p>Parenteral nutrition could contribute to maintaining or improving autonomy, thanks to increased muscle mass, reduced feelings of asthenia, and overall improvement in general well-being. Only one randomized controlled trial to date has shown that parenteral nutrition prolongs overall survival of cachexic patients, as compared with oral feeding alone, associated in both arms of the study with cyclooxygenase, insulin, and erythropoietin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The risk-benefit ratio of parenteral nutrition, particularly in terms of health-related quality of life, is thus poorly documented among patients with malnutrition but with a functional digestive tract during the end stages of cancer.</p><p>Therefore, we initiated a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the clinical benefit, as assessed by patients&#x02019; health-related quality of life, of supplemental parenteral nutrition versus no parenteral nutrition, in the context of palliative care at the end stage of cancer.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypotheses and objectives</title><p>In view of the uncertainty regarding the risk/benefit ratio of supplemental parenteral nutrition, we aim to investigate which of two management options (initiation of supplemental parenteral nutrition or no introduction of parenteral nutrition) proves to be superior in terms of health-related quality of life without a significant decrease in survival, in the palliative phase of cancer.</p><p>The primary objective of the ALIM-K study is to evaluate the clinical benefit in terms of health-related quality of life, as evaluated at 2&#x000a0;months (or at treatment discontinuation for patients who discontinue treatment allocation before 2&#x000a0;months), by using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative (QLQ-C15-PAL), and in particular, the physical function, global health, and fatigue subscales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], of the initiation of supplemental parenteral nutrition as compared with no parenteral nutrition, in malnourished cancer patients at the palliative stage who have a functional digestive tract, and in the absence of any curative therapy.</p><p>Secondary objectives are to compare the effects of both types of nutrition on overall survival and nutritional parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>We initiated a multicenter, prospective, 1:1 randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial. The experimental arm consists of initiation of supplemental parenteral nutrition. The control arm consists of pursuing oral feeding alone.</p><p>To minimize the difficulty of obtaining informed consent and to stimulate accrual, we used the Zelen single-consent design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to randomize patients before informed consent has been obtained. After randomization has been performed, only patients allocated to the intervention group are approached and asked to consent to the study intervention (parenteral nutrition in this case). According to Zelen, patients allocated to the control group and receiving the standard of care (oral feeding in this case) do not need to be informed because these patients are simply going to receive the usual therapy, and therefore, do not constitute a &#x0201c;study population&#x0201d;. Patients allocated to the intervention group who refuse consent are reassigned to the control group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants, interventions, and outcomes</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study will be conducted nationwide in France in nine comprehensive cancer centers selected for their expertise, and qualified to treat patients with more-advanced cancers, as well as in two university teaching hospitals (University Hospital of Besan&#x000e7;on and Henri Mondor Hospital, Creteil, France).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title><italic>Inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table</italic>&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref><italic>)</italic></title><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

In the context of cancer, the prior presence of an implantable chamber for specific chemotherapy will facilitate administration of parenteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition through a central line makes it possible to use hyperosmolar mixtures that, thanks to the high rate of flow of the vena cava, do not present significant venous toxicity.

No specific brand or product is recommended for the study; each participating center is free to administer parenteral nutrition in accordance with their local practice. The type or brand of product used will be taken into account in the analysis at the end of the study. Micronutrients will be systematically added to the mixture daily via a vial of multivitamins and oligoelements. The addition of electrolytes (sodium, potassium) will be adapted to the patient&#x02019;s requirements, and added to the mixture if no associated infusion is present. Vitamin K supplementation will also be adapted to the patient&#x02019;s requirements (by evaluation of vitamin K-dependent factors). Finally, magnesium and phosphorus supplementation will be provided as needed.</p><p><bold>Energy intake</bold>&#x02009;The exact modalities of parenteral nutrition will be left at the physician&#x02019;s discretion, with the possible help of a dietitian.

Daily intake must not exceed 1.25 times the resting energy expenditure, as calculated by using the Harris-Benedict equation.

Flow rate for infusion of carbohydrates must not exceed 4&#x000a0;mg/kg/min; the daily dose of lipids will be &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;g/kg/day. Cyclic administration (over 12&#x000a0;hours at night) is now considered standard practice because of the numerous advantages of this technique, including greater autonomy for the patient, possibility to maintain physical activity, preservation of the physiological alternation between fasting and food intake, the frequent association with oral feeding, and better hepatic tolerance.

Thus, the standard of care in this study will be exclusive oral feeding.

Studies of this type have previously been performed in many patient populations, including patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], but with only a very few studies in patients at the palliative phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This latter study highlights the difficulty of performing randomized controlled trials in palliative care, because the inclusion of the sample size of 309 patients took 6&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Performing randomized clinical trials on nutrition in patients at the palliative stage of advanced cancer, a particularly vulnerable population, remains a challenge. It requires the ultimate respect for the patients, many of whom are totally opposed to the idea of any kind of research at this stage of their life and illness. Indeed, being too ill was the most frequently cited motive for refusal to participate in a randomized study by Rabow <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] comparing the efficacy of palliative care with standard management in outpatient care for patients with advanced congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer. It is often difficult for patients and their families to accept the idea that research would still be possible at this stage of their illness, let alone the idea that random allocation might be the best option, given the medical uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of the mode of nutrition to be administered. Furthermore, randomization for patients in this context can appear to the patient to &#x0201c;dehumanize&#x0201d; the relation with caregivers and the healthcare system, which can justifiably cause considerable worry and anxiety in the face of the medical community&#x02019;s uncertainty.</p><p>To avoid the possible information bias mentioned and its associated deleterious effects on participation rates, we decided to use the Zelen single-consent design for the ALIM-K study. This choice was approved by the Ethics Committee, the Institutional Review Board, and a group representing patient associations. Many experts initially considered the Zelen method to be a violation of the ethos, if not the very letter of the law, regarding informed consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, the method was found to be attractive for research in situations of great precariousness and is used in a variety of different contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Patients remain free to express their preference for another treatment approach at any time.</p><p>Nonetheless, recruitment remains challenging for several reasons. The methodology of the Zelen design used in the ALIM-K study provides an opportunity to investigate the factors that influence the decision by patients or physicians to accept (or not) artificial nutrition in the setting of palliative care for advanced care. At the palliative stage of cancer, the main end point is quality of life, even though this term may appear to be a misnomer to many patients at the end of life. The QLQ-C15 PAL questionnaire used in our study presents the advantage of addressing simple issues related to daily life, and is quick and easy to complete.</p><p>Because our randomization procedure takes into consideration the fragility of this patient population, and the design is close to the reality of routine practice, it will be interesting to see which factors emerge as predictors of refusal or acceptance of artificial nutrition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>Between May 2012, and April 2013, 13 patients were included in two centers to check the feasibility and understanding of the questionnaires, as well as their acceptability. Qualitative analyses of these pretest data confirmed that methods and questionnaires are acceptable and that the study is feasible. The main adjustment to result from this test phase was greater precision required in some of the inclusion criteria.</p><p>At the time of submission of the manuscript, the ALIM-K study is ongoing. All 10 centers were enrolling progressively, and the last participating center (Lille) was opened on April 16, 2014. Patient recruitment is not complete, at the time of submission.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANSM</term><def><p>Agence Nationale de S&#x000e9;curit&#x000e9; du M&#x000e9;dicament et des produits de sant&#x000e9; (French Agency for the Safety of Health Products)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNIL</term><def><p>Commission Nationale de l&#x02019;Informatique et des Libert&#x000e9;s (French National Authority for the Protection of Privacy and Personal Data)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EORTC</term><def><p>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESPEN</term><def><p>European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDI</term><def><p>Integrated Discrimination Improvement method</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>institutional review board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAR</term><def><p>missing at random</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCAR</term><def><p>missing completely at random</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MNAR</term><def><p>missing not at random</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRI</term><def><p>Net Reclassification Improvement method</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QLQ-C15 PAL</term><def><p>Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QLQ-C30</term><def><p>Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QUAL-E</term><def><p>Questionnaire of Quality of Life at End of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SFNEP</term><def><p>Soci&#x000e9;t&#x000e9; Francophone Nutrition Clinique et M&#x000e9;tabolisme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTD</term><def><p>time to quality of life score deterioration.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>Main investigators: RA, CB.
