While less is known regarding DHT and E2, testosterone is an androgenic metabolic hormone capable of positively regulating a variety of anabolic and androgenic processes in the body. Accordingly, it has been postulated that the age-related reduction in serum testosterone levels leads to reductions in lean muscle mass, bone mineral density, and other physical conditions that impair physical performance and decrease quality of life. Preliminary studies suggest that key ingredients found in Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122;, a natural supplement containing the carotenoid astaxanthin from <italic>Haematococcus pluvialis</italic> and Saw Palmetto berry lipid extract from <italic>Serenoa repens</italic>, could positively impact testosterone levels. To investigate the clinical efficacy of Resettin&#x000ae;, the serum profiles of testosterone, E2 and DHT in healthy sedentary males before and after Resettin&#x000ae; treatment were evaluated in a randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Twenty healthy, sedentary men between the ages of 21 and 70 were randomized into either an 800&#x000a0;mg/day or 1200&#x000a0;mg/day Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122; treatment group or lecithin, which was used as the placebo. After a 14-day treatment period, there was a 14-day washout period.

Gradual reductions in testosterone levels can lead to many symptoms of andropause including a lack of energy, decreased mental acuity, a loss of overall well-being, and sexual dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Androgen deficiency in aging men may also occur concomitantly with a geriatric syndrome called sarcopenia or the loss of significant amounts of lean skeletal muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Sarcopenia is significantly associated with a variety of adverse outcomes which can result in increased incidences of slips, trips and falls leading to bone fractures, hospitalization and physical disability leading to a poor quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although the causal factors leading to sarcopenia are complex and multifactorial, there is a clear association between age-related decreases in testosterone levels and increased incidences of sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In males, testosterone is predominantly synthesized by Leydig cells of the testes using the steroid biosynthesis pathway. Testosterone acts on target cells expressing the androgen receptor to induce changes in gene expression related to the anabolic growth of muscle and an increase bone density, as well as the androgenic maturation of sex organs. Testosterone levels are directly regulated by 5&#x003b1;-reductase, an enzyme which catalyzes and regulates the synthesis of the more potent androgenic steroid hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from free testosterone, and aromatase, an enzyme that directly converts testosterone into the estrogenic steroid hormone estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>As men age, bioavailable levels of testosterone decrease by 2% per year after age 30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Given the role of testosterone in directly increasing the synthesis of muscle protein and counteracting the catabolic effects of the hormone cortisol in breaking down muscle, researchers and clinicians have developed a variety of pharmacological treatment modalities that aim to increase serum testosterone levels. These approaches include the exogenous administration of testosterone transdermally, through subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, or by boosting endogenous testosterone through the pharmacological inhibition of 5&#x003b1;-reductase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The latter approach is not a common clinical strategy as inhibitory drugs only elicit a moderate impact on testosterone (approximately 15%) in conjunction with an increase in E2, gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, cataract formation, depressive symptoms, and other mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the most common approach for elevating testosterone levels is through the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), or a combination of both. SERMs block the effects of estrogen in the central nervous system and breast in men, thereby reducing the occurrence of gynecomastia and they also block the suppressive effect of estrogens on luteinizing hormone production, which propagates testosterone production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. HCG is structurally similar to the luteinizing hormone and it is recognized by the body as luteinizing hormone, which in turns signals the testes to begin producing more testosterone. However, SERMs also function as estrogen agonists in the liver and this leads to an increase in the production of the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which circulates in the blood and may irreversibly bind to testosterone and other sex hormones, causing them to become inactive. As a result, SERMs therapy may increase the total concentration of testosterone, but the concentration of bioactive testosterone may remain low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, testosterone therapy has the potential to disrupt the feedback cycle from the hypothalamus/pituitary to the testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>With regard to CVD it is uncertain that any risk or beneficial effects of increasing testosterone levels through exogenous testosterone therapy, SERMS or HCG may be different than the use of other approaches such as the use of natural supplements and is continuously under investigation. One such natural compound is Astaxanthin (AX), a carotenoid with favorable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability produced by <italic>Haematococcus</italic> algae (<italic>pluvialis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. AX is shown to inhibit both 5&#x003b1;-reductase and aromatase CYP-19, which is an enzyme that converts C19 androgens to aromatic C18 estrogenic steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, findings from an open label dose response study of a product containing AX provided some suggestion that the compound may be involved in the regulation DHT and E2 levels, even within three days of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, the primary aim of this study was to extend these findings to men under the age of 50. To this end, the hormonal response patterns of sedentary men was tested following an administration of novel Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122;, which is a raw material consisting of AX and a lipid extract from the saw palmetto berry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A prospective single blind treatment vs. placebo study was conducted over a 14&#x000a0;day period at Hunter Laboratories in Walnut Creek, CA. Experimental groups of 20 healthy, sedentary men between the ages of 21 and 70&#x000a0;years of age with a body mass index of less than 27&#x000a0;kg/m2 were phlebotomized following an overnight fast. Assignment to an experimental group was conducted in an alternating fashion, based upon arrival time. The study consisted of two experimental groups. In the low dose group, participants received a dose of 800&#x000a0;mg/day. The high dose group received a dose of 1200&#x000a0;mg/day. Study participants were asked to self-administer two to three (depending on their experimental group) soft-gelatin capsules daily containing either 400&#x000a0;mg of Resettin&#x000ae; (Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122;; Triarco Industries, Wayne, NJ) or lecithin, which was used as the placebo. Participants were randomized into either the 800&#x000a0;mg/day or 1200&#x000a0;mg/day Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122; treatment group. After a 14-day treatment period, participants discontinued placebo or Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122; treatment for a consecutive 14&#x000a0;days. Following this 14-day washout period, participants were crossed over within their respective group to either Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122; or the lecithin placebo for 14&#x000a0;days. Blood was collected on days 0, 3, 7 and 14&#x000a0;days following the initiation of treatment. Serum hormone levels were collected and analyzed. Patterns of hormonal response were compared across the treatment groups in a pairwise manner. Researchers attempted to collect blood samples from all of the participants at approximately the same time of day in order to minimize circadian variations in serum hormone levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of forty sedentary, healthy men between the ages of 21 and 68 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled for this study. Enrollment was voluntary, and participants signed informed consent statements in compliance with the Human Subjects Guidelines of Western Institutional Review Board and the American College of Sports Medicine. Participants were excluded from study if they had a history of smoking, pulmonary disease, hypertension, hepatorenal disease, musculoskeletal disorders, neuromuscular or neurological diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, peptic ulcers, or anemia. Participants were also excluded if they exhibited repeated signs of benign prostate hypertrophy, regularly consumed commercially available products containing saw palmetto or AX, were taking ergogenic levels of nutritional supplements that may affect muscle mass, such as creatine, or exhibited anabolic hormone levels, such as androstenedione or dehydroepiandrosterone. Participants taking prescription medication for a heart condition, pulmonary or thyroid problem were also excluded from the study. Participants on anti-hyperlipidemia, hypoglycemic, anti-hypertensive, endocrinologic, psychotropic, neuromuscular/neurological, or androgenic medications were also not invited to enroll in the study. After a 10-hour fast of all food or drink with caloric value along with a 48-hour rest from strenuous exercise, participants were phlebotomized. Participant age, height, weight, body mass index, resting heart rate, and blood pressure were also collected at this time.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum hormone quantification</title><p>Serum levels of testosterone, DHT, and E2 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially available kits (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, USA). Briefly, reference controls, standards and samples were aliquoted in triplicate into separate wells pre-incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated primary antibodies specific for either testosterone, DHT, or E2. After washing, reference controls, standards, and sample wells were incubated with tetramethylbenzidine and gently agitated. After 10&#x000a0;min, the HRP-substrate colorimetric reaction was stopped with 0.16&#x000a0;M H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450&#x000a0;nm of each well was evaluated using a spectrophotometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To evaluate the significance of possible group differences in steroid hormone levels within treatment groups, a 2 (high versus low dose)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 (sample time point) one-way repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted. To evaluate statistically significant differences in steroid hormone levels between treatment groups, a two-way ANOVA was used. Differences in steroid hormone concentrations were considered clinically significant when the probability of a Type I error was less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Total testosterone levels tend to decline as men age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

Specifically, there were meaningful differences in terms of the mean participant age across studies (i.e., 55.6 versus 41.2&#x000a0;years of age). Thus, age-related changes likely explain the lack of significant findings, as it is expected that the way that the body metabolizes, or processes, various supplements will produce variable results within and between populations. Changes related to typical aging are also likely have significant impacts on all processes within the body, and the synthesis of testosterone is no different. Moreover, other differences in sample population characteristics likely account for the divergent findings across these studies.</p><p>More specifically, compared to a non-placebo controlled trial conducted by Angwafor and Anderson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the present sample had many unique characteristics, which may be meaningful in terms of the generalizability of these data. For example, mean baseline concentrations of serum testosterone across the groups were measured to be less than half of the observed concentration levels at baseline in the previous study. Initial observation of DHT concentration across the groups were almost three times higher in the present study than the baseline DHT serum concentrations observed across all groups in the previous study. Baseline concentrations of estradiol between the two studies were even more divergent. Serum concentrations of estradiol at baseline across the groups were nearly four times higher in the current sample than that of the baseline serum estradiol concentrations observed previously. This is suggestive of underlying sample population characteristics that may account for variable results and additional studies exploring for latent clinical profiles of the androgen response to supplements are needed.</p><p>Indeed, participants in the present study weighed 10&#x000a0;kg to 15&#x000a0;kg more than the participants in the 2008 non-placebo controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A wealth of evidence exists linking the accumulation of adipose tissue with detrimental metabolic changes within the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For instance, the aromatase enzyme, which is found within adipose tissue, is primarily responsible for converting androgens into estrogen. Increases in adipose tissue have been linked with higher serum concentrations of estrogens and lower levels of serum testosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As previously discussed, the men within the present sample exhibited much higher serum estrogen concentrations than the men in the previous study. Taken together, it is likely that metabolic changes as a result of being overweight or obese transform the manner in which the endocrine system is influenced through exogenous factors, such as dietary supplements.</p><p>In comparing serum estrogen concentration, responses to Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122; were different across both studies. Following baseline subtraction, average serum estrogen concentrations for an individual in the aforementioned study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] were found to decrease significantly from baseline to day 7 in the low dosage group (800&#x000a0;mg/day), as well as from baseline to days 3, 7, and 14 in the high dosage group (2000&#x000a0;mg/day). Interestingly, the present study found similar patterns with a much lower dose of the supplement such that serum estrogen concentrations were found to be lower on average for the high dosage treatment group (1200&#x000a0;mg/day). The placebo group, in contrast, exhibited higher concentrations of estrogen overall. These data also support the idea that the metabolic profiles of participants in the current sample may not be comparable to that of the previous study, owing to confounding factors related to higher amounts of adipose tissue. Indeed, according to recently published data, estrogen levels for adult males typically range from between 37 to 110 pM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Baseline concentration levels of participants in the current study ranged from 85 to 90 pM, while they ranged from 21.5 to 24 pM in the previous study. In conjunction, serum DHT concentrations were much higher at baseline in the present sample compared to the previous study. Interestingly, despite these differences, at day 14 the groups in both studies exhibited lower concentrations of serum DHT when compared to the placebo group. More specifically, in the current study the low dose group (800&#x000a0;mg/day) started out with concentrations of 6 nM of serum DHT and dropped more than 0.6 nM over the course of 14&#x000a0;days. Further, the high dosage group (1200&#x000a0;mg/day) exhibited an increase in serum DHT concentrations to approximately 1 nM at day 14, while the DHT levels for the placebo group also rose to approximately 2 nM. These data indicate that, given the likely contribution of higher levels of adipose tissue among participants in the present sample, it may be beneficial to examine the endocrine response, particularly testosterone levels, using a higher dose of Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122;. Further, individuals included in the present sample were drawn from the U.S. population, while participants from the previous study were drawn from a country in west Central Africa. Thus, it is expected that factors related to the diet of individuals within the present sample, characterized as high in fats, sugars, and carbohydrates, as well as physical conditions, play a significant role in accounting for why the current data failed to replicate previous findings. Additional studies are warranted to provide support for the generalizability of these findings.</p><p>Further, the sample sizes across studies are relatively small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, there is a high risk for confounding factors that may have skewed the data. For instance, an unmeasured characteristic of the men included within the present study like higher levels of the aromatase enzyme, may account for their lack of response to Resettin&#x000ae;. Additional studies are warranted to more clearly delineate the association between Resettin&#x000ae; and serum testosterone levels. Findings from these studies are expected to improve the generalization of the conclusions. Notwithstanding, there was a measurable 38% increase in serum testosterone levels and a 4.5% decrease in estradiol among participants receiving the 1200&#x000a0;mg/day experimental group. Indeed, while this increase may not have reached the stringent criteria for statistical significance, this difference may be clinically relevant. Additional studies are warranted to explore specific benefits to this degree of improvement in testosterone level. Moreover, given that serum DHT levels were significantly lower in both the 800&#x000a0;mg/day and 1200&#x000a0;mg/day treatment groups, and that Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122; has been shown to prevent the conversion of testosterone into DHT over time, it may be that this accounts for the rising testosterone levels in a subset of participants. Thus, additional studies that include a broader sample of study participants are warranted to explore for the generalizability of these findings. Future studies may also be needed to examine dosage level in relation to weight or BMI and androgen response. While weight specific dosing is not novel in terms of the pharmaceutical field, dietary supplements have not typically provided dosing instructions that are dependent upon the individual&#x02019;s weight or BMI. It is expected that findings from studies examining the impact of various dosages of Resettin&#x000ae;/MyTosterone&#x02122; on the metabolic profiles, specifically testosterone, DHT, and estrogen levels, across individuals who are overweight or obese will provide support for including weight dependent dosing instructions and, thus, improve the individual&#x02019;s hormonal response to this natural dietary supplement.</p><p>Additional studies are necessary to evaluate the full extent of the regulatory effects of Resettin&#x000ae; in the body&#x02019;s efforts to resume homeostasis and return testosterone to ideal levels. This study highlights that there are likely ideal levels of testosterone in men. These data contribute to the possible benefits of using Resettin/Mytosterone for combating age-related androgen deficiency and andropause.</p><sec><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>There is no supporting data that is currently available.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA-RM: Analysis of Variance-repeated measures</p><p>AX: Astaxanthin</p><p>DHT: Dihydrotestosterone</p><p>E2: Estradiol</p><p>ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p><p>HCG: Human chorionic gonadotropin</p><p>HRP: Horseradish peroxidase</p><p>SERMs: Selective estrogen receptor modulators</p><p>SHBG: Sex hormone binding globulin</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author declares that he has no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MA carried out experimental studies, participated in the randomized assignment of the participants and drafted the manuscript.
