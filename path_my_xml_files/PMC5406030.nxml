It is therefore not surprising that medication errors occur most frequently at transitions of care such as hospital admission and discharge [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Studies show that up to 95% of patients experience medication errors at hospital admission, and up to 73% of patients experience medication errors at hospital discharge [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The causes of these errors are multi-factorial, such as the patient&#x02019;s inability to accurately recall his medication use at admission, incomplete transfer of information between healthcare settings and incorrect transcription of information. Besides medication errors numerous other problems can occur, e.g. irritation or anxiety of patients, harm to patients due to adverse drug events or increased costs due to additional healthcare use. Numerous guidelines on medication transfer have been published to decrease errors and patient harm [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These guidelines advocate the implementation of transitional care programs that include medication reconciliation, patient counselling and communication of medication related information between settings. Although studies have shown that these transitional pharmaceutical care programs are effective in decreasing medication errors, [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] their effects on reducing rehospitalisations are inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In a context of increasing healthcare costs and limited resources, hospitals and professionals are increasingly concerned about the cost-effectiveness of approaches to improve continuity of pharmaceutical care [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, only few cost-effectiveness studies in this field have been performed until now with conflicting results. Previous studies were often model-based economic evaluations using multiple assumptions that are debatable [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, published economic evaluations for transitional care programs generally only consider healthcare costs, exclude the costs of the intervention, use intermediate outcome measures such as medication errors, lack sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty around key estimates or assumptions, and lack an incremental analysis of costs and effects [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>We developed a transitional pharmaceutical care program (COACH, Continuity Of Appropriate pharmacotherapy, patient Counselling and information transfer in Healthcare) to improve the transition of patients from hospital discharge to the community setting [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Secondary care costs consisted of hospital admission costs (i.e. hospitalisations, one-day care and ED-visits), costs for outpatient visits and laboratory tests. Medication costs consisted of costs for prescription and non-prescription (i.e. over-the-counter) medication [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

Costs due to productivity losses consisted of absenteeism from paid and unpaid work.</p><p>Data on rehospitalisations were gathered using the hospital information systems of the study hospital and the five other hospitals. Information on prescription medication was extracted from the hospital&#x02019;s CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) at discharge and extrapolated to three months. Medication costs were calculated using Dutch prices [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Dutch guideline prices were used to value resource use (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0174513.t001">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Paid work absenteeism was valued with Dutch standard costs using the mean income of the Dutch population according to age and gender.

For this calculation, the time spent by the pharmaceutical consultant was converted into labour costs. The pharmaceutical consultants needed on average 62.7 minutes (standard deviation: 14.6) per patient. Based on a gross mean year salary of &#x020ac;50.000, assuming 46 annual working weeks and an efficiency rate of 70%, the labour costs for the intervention were &#x020ac;41.04/patient. We did not include costs of time spent by other healthcare providers because the extra tasks were performed by the pharmaceutical consultants.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Patient characteristics were extracted from the medical records of the hospital information system including gender, age, length of stay, and previous hospital contacts in the six months before inclusion. The Charlson co-morbidity score which has been shown to be associated with hospitalisations, was used to evaluate the severity of co-morbidities with higher scores indicating more severe comorbidity [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

Missing cost and effect data were imputed separately for the usual care and COACH group using multiple imputation with Fully Conditional Specification and Predictive Mean Matching in SPSS 21 [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A multiple imputation model was built that included patient&#x02019;s baseline characteristics that differed between patients with complete and incomplete follow-up, were associated with an unplanned rehospitalisation (p&#x0003c;0.20) or with total costs after three months (p&#x0003c;0.20). Included characteristics were sex, age, race, marital status, education level, receiving help with medication use, admission type (planned/unplanned), Charlson co-morbidity score, kidney function, number of medications at hospital admission and previous hospitalisations in the six months before inclusion. Five complete data sets were created [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Cost and effect differences were estimated using bivariate regression models while adjusting for confounding variables (p&#x0003c;0.10) [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Next, the estimates per data set were pooled using Rubin&#x02019;s rules [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Both a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis were performed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated by dividing the adjusted difference in mean costs between the two groups by the adjusted difference in mean outcomes at three months. To avoid double counting, we excluded the costs of unplanned rehospitalisations in the ICER calculation with unplanned rehospitalisation as effect measure. The uncertainty surrounding the ICERs was estimated by bootstrapping bivariate regression models including a separate set of confounders for costs and effects (5000 replications).</p><p>The bootstrapped cost effect pairs were represented visually on the cost-effectiveness plane [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The horizontal axis divides the plane according to incremental cost (more expensive above, less expensive below) and the vertical axis divides the plane according to incremental effect (more effective on the right, less effective on the left). This divides the incremental cost-effectiveness plane into four quadrants [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The distribution of the cost-effectiveness pairs over the four quadrants is an indication of the uncertainty around the ICER. Cost-effectiveness acceptability (CEA) curves were also estimated. In a CEA curve the horizontal axis shows the threshold (ceiling ratio), which represents the maximum amount of money that a decision maker is willing to invest to gain 1 unit of effect extra. The vertical axis shows the probability that the intervention is considered cost-effective in comparison with usual care for a specific ceiling ratio [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Multiple imputation was done using SPSS version 21.

Although the cost difference was in favour of the COACH program in the main analysis, the rehospitalisation rate was slightly higher, and confidence intervals were very wide due to the small sample. In the main analysis, the probability that the COACH program was cost-effective in comparison with usual care was high (89% for unplanned rehospitalisations). However, this effect was lost in the sensitivity analyses. The results of the cost-utility analysis showed lower costs but also lower QALYs in the intervention group. This could also be interpreted as higher costs and more QALYs gained in the control group compared with the intervention group. The ICER of 137,059 is much higher than what would be considered acceptable by NICE the National Institute for Health Care and Excellence in the UK (which uses a threshold of 20,000&#x02013;30,000 British Pounds per QALY gained) or the National Health Care Institute in The Netherlands (which uses thresholds ranging from 20,000 to 80,000 Euro per QALY gained, depending on the severity of the disease/disorder). Based on these results, we conclude that the COACH program is not cost-effective in comparison with usual care.</p><p>Previous economic evaluations showed variable results [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The study population and the intervention broadness differed between these studies making comparisons difficult. Of five evaluations, three studies reported positive results on cost-effectiveness, one study reported non-significant positive results and one study reported no difference in costs between groups [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The three positive studies used model-based approaches where the effect of different types of interventions were based on assumptions in decreasing medication errors and adverse drug events [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our economic evaluation we found non-significant differences. This was also found in the study of Wallerstedt et al. who reported high ICERs as well and no effect on rehospitalisations and QALYs (using EQ-5D questionnaires) for Internal Medicine patients receiving medication review, patient counselling at hospital discharge and a medication report [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There may be several explanations for our findings. First, we included patients if they used at least one drug. A focus on patients with a higher risk may have been more effective, such as patients with polypharmacy or patients with multiple hospitalisations in the history. Two studies showed that a focus on high risk groups was more cost-effective [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Second, our program focused on medication reconciliation and not on extensive medication review as opposed to the study of Gillespie et al. and Ghatnekar et al. where positive results were noted on costs due to drug-related admissions [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Third, we failed to implement our study completely, resulting in a low overall intervention fidelity, as general practitioners did not receive the complete medication overview through the discharge letter which could have influenced results. Finally, our intervention was a pharmaceutical care program. It is therefore more likely that the intervention could influence unplanned drug-related rehospitalisations rather than all cause rehospitalisations. As drug-related rehospitalisations are rare, a larger sample size was needed to show effects.</p><p>We expect that transitional care programs could be cost-effective, but research should indicate what the effective components are and how the context (including implementation fidelity) influences the outcomes. For example, in many studies pharmacists are used in transitional care programs, but in the Netherlands this is not feasible due to costs and lack of availability of pharmacists. Furthermore, transitional care programs prevent medication errors but the costs of these errors are difficult to clock (e.g. the time needed for rectifying errors, telephone calls to the department, wastage of medication and anxiety experienced by patients). Also, uncorrected medication errors could lead to adverse drug events [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Estimates of costs per adverse drug event range from &#x020ac;900&#x02013;&#x020ac;1800 [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In this study, adverse drug events were not measured.</p><p>Strengths of this study are that we collected cost data from a societal perspective and included rehospitalisation data from multiple hospitals. Limitations of this study also need to be discussed. First, the existence of selection bias is likely. Only 21% of patients included in the main study also participated in the economic evaluation. Patients regarded the data collection as a burden or lacked interest in the study. Patients not participating in the economic evaluation received significantly more frequent help with using medication and were significantly more frequent non-native Dutch. This limits generalizabilty of the results. Generalizabilty of the results is also limited due to the monocenter setting of the study. Also, patients included in the COACH program had more severe co-morbidities than usual care patients. We adjusted for this, but unknown confounders may be present. Second, complete cost data were available for only 54% of the patients. Although patients were contacted by telephone to increase response, this had only a limited effect. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data which is currently considered the most appropriate technique to deal with missing data [<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174513.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Baseline data for quality of life at the moment of discharge was not assessed. Therefore, the results of the cost-utility analysis should be interpreted with caution. Finally, the follow-up of three months may have been too short to show an effect on quality of life.</p><p>Recommendations for future research include the following. It needs to be assessed which specific components of transitional care programs are effective. With a stepped wedge design interventions could be implemented in steps and the effect of these interventions could be evaluated per (added) step. New studies should evaluate more intensive interventions, focus on high risk groups and assess multiple outcomes (e.g. adverse drug events). Finally, follow-up should be extended to a period of at least one year as the optimal follow-up period is unknown.</p><p>In conclusion, from a societal perspective, after three months the COACH program was not considered cost-effective compared to usual care. Future studies are needed to assess whether and which components are effective for patients transitioning from the hospital setting to the community setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174513.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174513.s001.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the patients and the department of Internal Medicine for the cooperation in this study.
