A recent step in restorative dentistry is the replacement of natural tooth structure with pre-polymerized and machined resin-based methacrylic polymers. Recently, a new CAD/CAM composite was launched for the crown indication in the load-bearing area, but the clinical reality forced the manufacturer to withdraw this specific indication. In parallel, a randomized clinical trial of CAD/CAM composite crowns luted on zirconia implant abutments revealed a high incidence of failure within the first year of service. Fractured crowns of this clinical trial were retrieved and submitted to a fractographic examination. The aim of the case series presented in this article was to identify failure reasons for a new type of CAD/CAM composite crown material (Lava Ultimate; 3M Oral Care, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA) via fractographic examinations and analytical assessment of luting surfaces and water absorption behavior. As a result, the debonding of the composite crowns from the zirconia implant abutments was identified as the central reason for failure. The adhesive interface was found the weakest link. A lack of silica at the zirconia surface certainly has compromised the bonding potential of the adhesive system from the beginning. Additionally, the hydrolytic stress released from swelling of the resin-based crown (water absorption) and transfer to the luting interface further added to the interfacial stress and most probably contributed to a great extend to the debonding failure.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dentistry</kwd><kwd>fractography</kwd><kwd>computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing composite</kwd><kwd>adhesive failure</kwd><kwd>crown restoration</kwd><kwd>lava</kwd><kwd>ultimate</kwd><kwd>hydrolytic degradation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2050313X17741015"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major advance in digital restorative dentistry is the recent marketing of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) polymer materials for single crown restorations.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> CAD/CAM polymers such as Lava Ultimate (3M Oral Care) are in fact resin composites and are generally identified as highly filled methacrylic resinous materials.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> An organic nanofiller technology enabled a filler loading up to 82&#x02009;vol% in a three-dimensionally cross-linked polymer matrix consisting of short- and long-chain dimethacrylate monomers. In the past two decades, mechanical properties of such materials were improved competing today with silica-based glass-ceramics for the single crown indication.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> While dental composites have traditionally been applied in a direct way&#x02014;via viscous paste insertion, intraoral shaping, and subsequent light curing&#x02014;the idea became appealing to further improve the mechanical performance by pre-polymerization. With the aid of pressure, temperature, a suitable initiator system, and accompanied by the parallel development of high-precision CAD/CAM technologies for dentistry, CAD/CAM composites entered the market. These new CAD/CAM composite materials combine a sufficiently high flexural strength with a relative low elastic modulus.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This is supposed to mimic the resilient periodontal ligament using a low modulus crown material and hence to prevent biomechanical complications during occlusal contact loading.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The improved resilience and enamel-like wear behavior, combined with the CAD/CAM chairside treatment option made this a popular material, very competitive, and advantageous to established ceramic restoratives.</p><p>CAD/CAM composite blocks are classified as medical products which allow marketing without proof of effectiveness from extensive clinical trials. It became obvious that a variety of such materials entered the market with different promises and performances. One of the first materials on the market was Lava Ultimate indicated for all types of single-tooth restorations including the single full crown. After clinical use, the number of concerns increased in terms of fracture and debonding.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, the causes still remain unclear. A variety of combinations regarding support material (dentin, enamel, implant titanium or zirconia, etc.), adhesive procedure (surface pretreatment, bonding, and cementation strategy, polymerization, etc.), and material degradation (hydrolysis, mechanical fatigue and wear, etc.) are currently under discussion in dental research.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> One strong hypothesis, among others, guides toward a weak adhesive luting interface. Adhesion is established by a complex luting multilayer, consisting of the crown and abutment material surfaces, the thin adhesive layers, and the resin-based luting cement in between.</p><p>The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical fracture process of three Lava Ultimate crowns, bonded to zirconia implant abutments. All fractures occurred during the first year of function and within a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Fractographical analysis was performed on the crown material as well as on the zirconia implant abutments in order to speculate on possible reasons for failure. Chemical surface analysis of the implant abutment surface as well as water absorption measurements of the polymeric material were performed for a deeper analytical insight into responsible mechanisms leading to failure.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2050313X17741015"><title>Case section</title><p>The fractographic examination of three fractured clinical crowns is based on a RCT.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Although the clinical procedure is described elsewhere, a brief description relevant for the fractographic examination is as follows.</p><p>The restoration material used in both treatment modalities of the RCT was a resilient (&#x0201c;shock-absorbing&#x0201d;) crown material (based on resin composites) bonded to a stiff zirconia implant abutment. A total of 50 patients with a missing single premolar in the maxilla or mandible were included. Among other factors, severe bruxism was rated as an exclusion criterion. After implant therapy and impression taking, the abutment&#x02013;crown complex was fabricated in the dental laboratory. The milled crowns were visually examined for defects by the dental technician prior to the bonding procedure. Subsequently, the zirconia abutment surfaces as well as the crown intaglio sides were sandblasted using the Rocatec system (tribochemical silica coating using Rocatec Soft (3M Oral Care), 30&#x02009;&#x000b5;m, 2&#x02009;bar, 2&#x02013;10&#x02009;mm distance). The adhesive procedure made use of the 3M adhesive/cement system and was performed according to the respective instructions for use (IFU, in 2013). Scotchbond Universal (3M Oral Care) was applied on the crown intaglio as well as on the abutment surfaces (no separate light curing, as stated in the IFU). RelyX Ultimate (3M) was used as resin luting agent and light cured for 5&#x02009;min in a GC Labolight device (GC Europe, Leuven, Belgium). After delivery, the crown&#x02013;abutment complex was screw retained to the implant, and the access cavity was filled with a glass ionomer restoration material.</p><p>100% implant and abutment survival was evaluated, but only 14% (n = 7) of the abutments showed uncompromised survival after 1&#x02009;year of clinical service. 80% (n = 40) initial debonded crowns and 6% (n = 3) fractured crowns were documented. In all debonding cases, the luting remnants were found in the crowns but not on the abutment side, which was not always the case for the fractured crowns. The study was the first published clinical trial on the performance of Lava Ultimate restorative material for single crowns.</p><p>The fragments of the three fractured crowns were collected and cleaned in an ultrasonic alcohol bath for 5&#x02009;minutes and stored dry prior to further observation. The fragments were photographed with standardized illumination and equipment (Nikon D100, Medical-Nikkor 120&#x02009;mm; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and observed under a stereomicroscope (SV6; Zeiss, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany) using lateral illumination. The fractured crowns were then coated with gold for examination under a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Leitz ISI SR 50, Akashi, Japan). The fractographic examination was conducted using a systematic approach,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and interpretations of the fracture patterns were based on established methods.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Arrest lines, hackle, wake hackle, compression curls, or any other characteristic features were identified in order to trace back crack origins, direction of crack propagation (DCP), and discriminatory indicators of crack initiation/acceleration mechanisms. Wear facets and the exposed fractured surfaces were cautiously examined using SEM standard and back-scattered modes. Analysis regarding the presence of silica on the surfaces of the zirconia abutments was performed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy. Water sorption of the crown material was measured according to ISO 4049:2009.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2050313X17741015" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section3-2050313X17741015"><title>Case 1</title><p>This crown was retrieved from tooth #14 of a 60-year-old male patient and fractured after 2&#x02009;months in situ without any complications or reported malfunction.

The adhesive interface was identified as the weakest link. A lack of silica at the zirconia surface certainly has compromised the bonding potential of the adhesive system from the beginning. Additionally, the hydrolytic stress induced from swelling of the resin-based crown (water absorption) and transfer to the luting interface most probably added to the interfacial stress and contributed to a great extend to the debonding failure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethical approval:</bold> Ethical approval to report this case was obtained from Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen (METc number 2012.388, ABR number NL 42288.042.12).</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The RCT was supported by a grant from Dentsply Sirona Implants, M&#x000f6;lndal, Sweden and by the authors&#x02019; institutions.
