FMS is the second most common disorder, after osteoarthritis, observed by rheumatologists [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The defining symptoms of FMS include chronic widespread pain, intense pain in response to tactile pressure (allodynia), prolonged muscle spasms, weakness in the limbs, nerve pain, muscle twitching, palpitations and diffuse tenderness, along with fatigue, sleep disturbance and cognitive impairments. These impairments include problems with short- and long- term memory, short-term memory consolidation, impaired speed of information processing, reduced attention span and limited multi-tasking performance. FMS is a persistent disorder with symptoms that have a devastating effect on people's lives, including limited ability to engage in everyday activities, limited ability to maintain outside work and difficulties to maintain normal relationships with family, friends and employers [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These limitations can lead to the occurrence of anxiety and depression in many FMS patients.</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Challenging syndrome</title><p>FMS is not completely understood, in part because there is no evidence of a single event that &#x0201c;causes&#x0201d; fibromyalgia. Rather, many physical and/or emotional stressors may trigger or aggravate symptoms. Those have included certain infections, such as a viral illness or Lyme disease, as well as emotional or physical trauma [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Establishing proper diagnostic criteria is also a challenge [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) introduced the first fibromyalgia classification in 1990 [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Over time, those criteria invoked both conceptual and practical objections [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, many physicians did not know how to evaluate the tender points [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another reservation had to do with the fact that important features such as fatigue and cognitive symptoms were not included in the 1990 criteria. Some questioned the validity of defining fibromyalgia as a unique syndrome because of the overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To resolve the difficulties associated with the classification and diagnosis of FMS, Wolfe et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] proposed new, simple practical criteria that do not require tender point examination and still classify correctly almost 90% of the cases diagnosed by the 1990 ACR classification criteria.</p><p>As with many other syndromes, there is no efficient cure for FMS and no agreed upon treatment &#x02013; the suggested treatment depends on the classification of choice. Those who regard FMS as a neurological disorder advocate pharmacotherapy. All current treatments, such as prescribed medications, aerobic exercises and cognitive behavioral therapies, consist of symptom management [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Integrated programs based on these treatments have been shown to alleviate pain and some other symptoms but with limited effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Association with changes in brain activity</title><p>The level of pain sensation is determined by the relevant sensors recording at the location of the pain and by the processing of that information in the brain. Comparison between SPECT imaging of FMS patients and healthy subjects revealed elevated activity in the somatosensory cortex and reduced activity in the frontal, cingulate, medial temporal and cerebellar cortices [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These results are in agreement with earlier studies based on fMRI imaging [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other fMRI studies found that depressive symptoms were associated with the pain response in areas of the brain that participate in interpretation and assignment of the pain sensation, but not in areas involved in sensory processing of the input signal [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These findings might indicate that the amplified pain sensation in FMS patients is largely associated with higher level processing of information in the brain. However, there is an ongoing controversy, in which many rheumatologists take the opposite stand on this issue. As we explain in the discussion, our findings&#x02014;that the pain amelioration in those patients who responded to the HBOT treatments goes hand-in-hand with changes in brain activity&#x02014;provide important validation to the idea that in many of FMS patients the syndrome is associated with abnormal pain processing in the brain. This is opposed to the stand shared by other rheumatologists, according to which FMS is a sort of peripheral small fiber inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is likely that the latter is the cause of FMS in some patients. However, a claim that it is the only cause stands in contradiction to a wide body of literature. For example, it fails to explain why FMS appears in many patients following a traumatic brain injury.</p><p>Studies of brain metabolism using single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) found abnormalities within the hippocampal complex in patients with fibromyalgia [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Since the hippocampus plays crucial roles in maintenance of cognitive functions, sleep regulation and pain perception, it was suggested to associate the hippocampal metabolic dysfunction with these symptoms in FMS patients.</p><p>The evidence suggests that the pain in fibromyalgia results primarily from abnormalities in pain processing pathways, which may be described as the &#x0201c;volume&#x0201d; of the neurons set too high, and these hyper-excitability of pain processing pathways and under-activity of inhibitory pain pathways in the brain result in pain experience in the affected individual. Since some of the neuro-chemical abnormalities that occur in fibromyalgia can also regulate mood, sleep and energy, it might explain why mood, sleep and fatigue problems are commonly co-morbid with fibromyalgia.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Looking for a solution &#x02013; Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)</title><p>Clearly, new methods should be examined in order to provide sustained relief to FMS patients. Our study was motivated by the idea that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can rectify abnormal brain function underlying the symptoms of FMS patients. The hypothesis is based on new trials demonstrating that HBOT can induce neuroplasticity that leads to repair of chronically impaired brain functions and improved quality of life in post-stroke patients and mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) patients with prolonged post concussion syndrome (PCS), even years after the brain insult [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (see <xref rid="sec049" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref> section for more details). As explained in the discussion it is plausible that increasing oxygen concentration by HBOT can change the brain metabolism and glial function to rectify the FMS-associated brain abnormal activity. It has already been demonstrated that exposure to hyperbaric oxygen induces significant anti-inflammatory effect in different conditions and pathologies [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As such, it was also demonstrated that repetitive HBOT may attenuate pain by reducing production of glial cells inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>About a decade ago, Yildiz et al. (2004) [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found a significant reduction in the number and threshold of tender points following HBOT. The effect of HBOT was not restricted to FMS. Similar improvements following HBOT were reported in complex regional pain syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], migraines [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], cluster headaches [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and other pain conditions[<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Studies with animal models also demonstrated that HBOT can relieve pain in chronic pain condition [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>The crossover approach</title><p>There is a persisting dilemma regarding the adequate sham control for testing the effects of HBOT. The standard requirement for proper sham control is: <italic>&#x0201c;Medically ineffectual treatment for medical conditions intended to deceive the recipient from knowing which treatment is given</italic>.<italic>&#x0201d;</italic> Naively, one could assume that placing the patients in the HBO<sub>2</sub> chamber at normal air (21% oxygen) and normal pressure (1.0Atm) can serve as proper control. However, in order to have them sense elevated pressure, as required by sham control, the chamber pressure must be increased to 1.3 Atm or higher. The problem is that breathing normal air at 1.3 Atm can elevate the dissolved tissue oxygen by 50% or more, leading to significant physiological effects. Hence, room air at 1.3 Atm is not <italic>&#x0201c;ineffectual treatment&#x0201d;</italic> and cannot serve as proper sham control as required by the placebo definition. We decided to adopt the crossover approach which we had successfully used to test the effect of HBOT in post-stroke patients and in victims of mTBI at late chronic stage [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this approach, the participants are randomly divided into two groups. One, the trial group, receives two months of daily HBO<sub>2</sub> treatments while the other, the control group, goes without treatments during that time. The latter is then given the same treatments two months later. The study endpoints include, in addition to the physiological evaluations, also blinded detailed computerized clinical evaluations with SPECT scans that were blindly compared for all patients. The advantage of the crossover approach [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] is three-fold, as it allows comparison between treatments of two groups, between treatment and no treatment of the same group, and between treatment and no treatment in different groups. This is further reflected upon in the discussion section.</p><p>

These inherent spatiotemporal variations are reflected by high variance in the brain activity at each Brodmann area, as measured by SPECT imaging. The statistical challenge imposed by the SPECT imaging is the low signal-to-noise ratio: that the magnitude of the non arbitrary changes in the brain activity (following treatment) in most of the Brodmann area are comparable to the magnitude of the arbitrary change related to the inherent person-to-person and time variations that are not related to the treatment.</p><p>To meet the challenge, we introduced a significance index I<sub>&#x003c3;</sub>(n) to substantiate the comparison between the changes in brain activity in the response group during treatment and those in the crossover group during the control period.

Similarly, P<sub>R</sub>(n) is the p-value of the change in SPECT measurements for the post treatment vs. pre treatment period of the patients in the response group (the responders). The rationale for the new index is that lower values of P<sub>R</sub>(n), hence higher values of [1-P<sub>R</sub>(n)], correspond to higher significance of the changes during treatment. On the other hand, higher values of P<sub>C</sub>(n) imply that the changes during control are likely to vary arbitrarily prior to treatment. Hence, consistent changes measured during treatment are more significant. The significance index is defined such that both contributions are included.

The studies revealed a notable difference in brain activity between the two groups. In particular, they found that FMS is associated with elevated activity in the somatosensory cortex and reduced activity in the frontal, cingulate, medial temporal and cerebellar cortices [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Even more persuasive was the correspondence we found between the brain areas whose activity increased/decreased following the HBOT sessions and the brain areas that were shown in previous studies to have reduced/enhanced activity in FMS patients relative to normal subjects. In order to attain greater validity, symptom assessment and SPECT analysis were done by blinded evaluations and evaluators: the tests of the FMS state were done by computerized validated methods and the SPECT analysis was blind to patients' participation in treated/crossover group.</p></sec><sec id="sec042"><title>Association</title><p>Brain SPECT imaging was performed and evaluated for all patients.

More specifically, in the response group, 10 BAs showed above +0.6 normalized mean changes (hyper-perfusion) and 5 BAs showed below -0.6 normalized mean changes (hypo-perfusion) following the HBOT period. In contrast, the normalized mean changes in brain activity for all BAs are scattered within the (-0.6 &#x02014; +0.6) range following the control period of the patients in the crossover group. In addition, the scatter of the normalized mean changes after HBOT fits a distinct funnel shape distribution (<xref rid="pone.0127012.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>) that is significantly different from the distribution after the control period (<xref rid="pone.0127012.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>).

As mentioned before, earlier studies showed that FMS patients have reduced brain activity in BAs in the frontal cortex and elevated activity in the posterior brain <sup>11, 12</sup>. We found that, after treatment, BAs in the posterior brain show reduced activity and BAs in the frontal cortex show elevated activity. Hence, our finding indicate that, in FMS patients, hyperbaric oxygen therapy leads to beneficial changes in the brain activity of specific BAs known to have abnormal activity in these patients.</p><p>In the next section we mention that the amelioration consequent to HBOT led to a significant decrease in the intake of pain medications by the patients. In principle, part of the observed changes in the SPECT imaging may be associated with the changes in the intake of pain medication. While this possibility cannot be ruled out, we deem it unlikely. First, we note that the patients have been taking pain medication for a long time (years). The intake of the drugs eased the pain but did not reverse the condition, while HBOT did reverse the condition. Also, the changes in the brain activity as detected by the SPECT coincided with improvement of the FMS symptoms, so much so that most of the patients could reduce or stop altogether the intake of pain medications. In other words, the plausible causal chain is that the changes in brain activity were induced by the HBOT, these changes alleviated the FMS symptoms and eased the pain, leading to a diminished need for pain medication.</p></sec><sec id="sec047"><title>Changes in intake of pain related medications</title><p>The amelioration of pain consequent to HBOT led to a significant decrease in the level of analgesic medications intake by the patients in both groups. More specifically, 9 patients from the treated group were on chronic daily medication with analgesic drugs (5 were taking two different drugs and 4 were taking one) before HBOT. After the HBOT, 3 patients got completely off medication, 3 out of the 5 continued with two drugs, and 3 out of the 4 continued with one drug, p = 0.02. In the crossover group, 12 patients were on chronic daily medication of analgesic drugs before HBOT (2 on two drugs and 10 on one drug). All of them continued taking the medications during the control period. Consequent to the HBOT period, 5 patients stopped taking drugs altogether and all other 7 patients took one drug, p = 0.02. With regard to chronic use of antidepressants, in the treated group, the 7 patients that were chronically treated before HBOT continued with their medications at the end of the treatment. In the crossover group, of the 12 patients treated with antidepressants at baseline and during the control period, 8 continued with their medications after the HBOT treatments, p = 0.04.</p></sec><sec id="sec048"><title>Safety and side effects</title><p>Five patients decided to stop the HBOT due to dizziness, claustrophobia and inability to adjust ear pressure by &#x0201c;ear pumping&#x0201d;.

However, at the end of the HBOT period, all of these patients experience significant amelioration of pain and improvements in the different evaluated parameters in this study as compared to baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec049"><title>Discussion</title><p>We presented a prospective active control, clinical trial of evaluating the effect of HBOT on female patients of ages 21&#x02013;67 with chronic FMS. The time elapsed from FMS diagnosis to study recruitment was 2&#x02013;22 years (mean 6.5 years). A crossover approach was adopted in order to overcome the HBOT inherent sham control problem (see <xref rid="sec049" ref-type="sec">discussion</xref> further below). The participants were randomly divided into two groups. One, the treated group, received two months of HBOT; the other, the control group, was not treated during those two months and received treatment in the following two months. The advantage of the crossover approach is the option for a triple comparison &#x02013; between treatments in two groups, between treatment and no treatment in the same group, and between treatment and no treatment in different groups.</p><p>The changes in all measures (pain threshold, number of tender points, FIQ, SCL-90 and SF-36) were assessed by detailed computerized evaluations and were compared to changes in brain activity obtained by SPECT imaging. The HBOT in both groups led to similar significant improvements. No significant changes were detected during the non-treatment period in the crossover group. These results are in agreement with earlier findings by Yildiz et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Analysis of brain imaging showed significantly increased neuronal activity after a two-month period of HBOT, compared to the control period.</p><sec id="sec050"><title>Brain functionality</title><p>What makes the results particularly convincing is the good correspondence between the physiological improvements and the changes in brain functionality as detected by the SPECT scans, as well as the good agreement with the abnormal brain activity of FMS patients. As presented in the introduction, comparison between brain activities of healthy subjects and FMS patients, assessed by SPECT imaging, revealed higher activity in the somatosensory cortex and reduced activity in the frontal, cingulate, medial temporal and cerebellar cortices in FMS patients [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We also mentioned that these results are in agreement with earlier studies based on fMRI imaging [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The specially devised analyses of the HBOT imaging revealed that the improvements in the syndrome status went hand-in-hand with changes in the patterns of brain activity towards those of healthy subjects. More specifically, for the response patients, HBOT sessions led to reduction in brain activity in the somatosensory cortex and enhancement of the brain activity in the frontal, cingulate, medial temporal and cerebellar cortices.</p></sec><sec id="sec051"><title>HBOT can rectify abnormal brain activity</title><p>Levels of pain sensations are determined by the sensory recording and higher level information processing (interpretation) in the brain. Evidence from previous studies suggests that the pain in fibromyalgia results primarily from abnormality in the function of pain processing pathways. In simple terms, it may be described as hyper-excitability of pain processing pathways and under-activity of inhibitory pain pathways in the brain, resulting in the affected individual experiencing pain. In the present study we found that HBOT can rectify chronically abnormal brain activity &#x02013; decrease the activity of hyperactive regions (mainly posterior regions) and increase the activity of underactive regions (mainly frontal areas), in good agreement with the current knowledge regarding the brain&#x02019;s response to pain.</p><p>More specifically, brain areas that are activated in response to pain are S1, S2 (BA 1, 2 and 3), insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and thalamus [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Anticipation of pain activates the anterior insula, ACC and PFC. It has also been shown that rostral ACC is activated in analgesia [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The effect of the ACC on pain processing is unclear, but one option that was suggested is that the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and/or opioids reduces the excitability of ACC neurons that send descending innervations directly or indirectly to rostral ventromedial medulla neurons [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Consequently, this might cause less pain information to arrive from the spinal cord to the brain. Thus, the activation of the ACC and other frontal areas can prevent pain information from the spinal cord from reaching the brain and thus reduce activation in the rostral areas that receive this information.</p></sec><sec id="sec052"><title>A quest for new understanding</title><p>Previous studies provided convincing evidence that HBOT could induce neuroplasticity leading to repair of chronically impaired brain functions and improved quality of life in post stroke patients and post mTBI patients with prolonged post concussion syndrome, even years after the brain insult [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. HBOT can entail repair of brain damage resulting from stroke and TBI via an assortment of intricate mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For example, it is known that HBOT can initiate vascular repair mechanism and improve cerebral vascular flow, induce regeneration of axonal white matter, stimulate axonal growth, promote blood-brain barrier integrity, and reduce inflammatory reactions as well as brain edema [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. At the cellular level, HBOT can improve cellular metabolism, reduce apoptosis, alleviate oxidative stress and increase levels of neurotrophins and nitric oxide through enhancement of mitochondrial function both in neurons and glial cells, and may even promote neurogenesis of endogenous neural stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In FMS patients, glial cells might be hypothesized to play an integral role in the pathogenesis of central sensitization and chronic pain [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that increasing oxygen concentration by HBOT can change the brain metabolism and glial function to rectify the FMS associated brain abnormal activity. It has already been demonstrated that exposure to hyperbaric oxygen induces a significant anti-inflammatory effect in different conditions and pathologies [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As such, it was also demonstrated that repetitive HBOT may attenuate pain by reducing production of glial cell inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It can be informative to include, in future studies, additional modalities of brain monitoring such as EEG, fMRI and DTI, and to test the changes in brain response to pain stimulation in addition to assessments of changes in the base activity, as was done in this &#x0201c;proof of concept&#x0201d; study.</p><p>A supportive clinical observation for the notion that HBOT is indeed inducing neuroplasticity and is not merely &#x0201c;pain killer therapy&#x0201d; is the fact that a significant number of patients reported an increase or change in the pain sensation during the first 10&#x02013;20 session. Consequent to this period of changed/increased pain sensation, patients reported a more comprehensive change beyond pain alleviation, including improvement in sleep characteristics and cognitive functions, more energy for daily tasks and improvement in general wellbeing. The symptom worsening during the first session might be related to HBOT-induced metabolic and circuitry changes in brain areas associated with pain interpretation. There might be intermediate stages in the HBOT-induced repair process of the abnormal metabolism and circuitry, during which the pain sensation can be further amplified before reaching normal metabolism and circuitry. However, currently this is only a plausible idea that calls for future studies. This intriguing phenomenon was not anticipated when the study was designed so it was not objectively evaluated; further studies are needed to investigate this newly discovered phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="sec053"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The study is subject to some limitations:</p><p>I. <italic>Sample size</italic>. Clearly, larger scale clinical trials are required to corroborate the findings presented here. In addition to statistical discussion on the sample size consideration in the study protocol (S1), another consideration for including sixty patients in a single clinical site, was our attempt to optimize between two contradicting constrains: 1. The need for diverse population treated in order to generalize the findings for a more heterogeneous group of patients. 2. The need to perform physiological evaluations for each of the participating patients, including repeated metabolic brain imaging. Further studies are needed in multiple clinical centers in order to evaluate the findings in larger heterogonous patient population.</p><p>II. <italic>Diagnostic criteria</italic>. As mentioned earlier, it is important to select proper diagnostic criteria for FMS. While the study started in 2010, it&#x02019;s design and application were done earlier &#x02013; well before the new criteria by Wolfe at al. [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] were proposed and accepted. Nevertheless, being aware of the limitations mentioned earlier that are associated with the 1990 ACR criteria, we quantitatively assessed the tender points and included additional functional impairment as well as psychological distress and quality of life evaluations. In retrospect, the assessment we used can be view as a combination of the 1990 and 2010 criteria. Yet, future studies might consider using the new, 2010 criteria.</p><p>III. <italic>No double blinding</italic>: While the division into two sub-groups was done randomly and so were the physiological evaluations and the SPECT assessments, the patients were not blinded because of the above mentioned placebo considerations. The non- blinded identity of the patients to the examiners may have an effect on the self assessment questionnaires (FIQ, SCL and SF-36). The agreement between the improvements as reflected in self assessment questionnaires and in pain thresholds and brain SPECT analyses, which was done in a blinded fashion, further substantiates the clinical findings. Moreover, the association between the anatomical locations of the changes in the brain metabolism, as demonstrated by the SPECT, and the clinical findings provides important validation of the evaluation.</p><p>IV. <italic>Sham control</italic>. There is an inherent difficulty in handling sham control in HBOT trials, as mentioned in the introduction and detailed below.</p><p>V. <italic>Comparative studies</italic>. Future studies are needed in order to compare HBOT with other therapeutic interventions used for FMS patients</p></sec><sec id="sec054"><title>The sham control dilemma</title><p>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy includes two active ingredients: pressure and oxygen [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The use of pressure is intended for increasing plasma oxygen, but pressure increase alone can have significant effects on the cellular level, in particular in organs that are pressure auto-regulated, such as the brain and kidneys [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. More specifically, any increase in cranial pressure may have a significant effect on neurons, glial cells and the function of endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Put together, ample observations indicate that small increases in pressure, with normal or even reduced oxygen levels, cannot serve as placebo since they activates at least one of the two active ingredients of HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy &#x02013; pressure and level of tissue oxygen.</p><p>To engender the sensation of pressure, the chamber pressure must be 1.3 Atm abs or higher. This led several studies to mistakenly use HBO<sub>2</sub> treatment at 1.3Atm with normal air as sham control, overlooking the fact that under such conditions the tissue oxygen level can increase by more than 50%, possibly resulting in significant physiological effects due to the elevated pressure and the tissue oxygenation. Therefore, such doses should be regarded as a dose-comparison study and not as sham control, as was correctly done by Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>. who demonstrated that 1.3 Atm with normal air is effective in the treatment of children with CP [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, to circumvent the inherent sham control problem, we adopted the crossover approach that has already been successfully used to test the neurotherapeutic effects of HBOT [<xref rid="pone.0127012.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127012.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Clearly, the &#x0201c;placebo effect&#x0201d; is not fully resolved by the crossover approach, but what make the results sounder and suggest that the improvements are not likely to be a placebo effect are the following: 1. Only the responders showed significant changes in brain activity, and the changes rectified the known abnormality in brain activity of FMS patients. 2. Unexpectedly, in many of the patients, the symptoms worsened during the first 20 sessions.</p></sec><sec id="sec055"><title>Looking ahead</title><p>Follow-up studies are needed in order to investigate the durability of the HBOT effects on FMS. It might be that some patients will need more HBOT sessions. The issue of how to optimize patient-specific protocols is an important subject for future research. We foresee that the future oxygen-pressure dose-response studies will have significant therapeutic implications. In particular, based on previous studies in mTBI patients, it can be anticipated that, for some patients, HBOT treatment at lower pressure and/or lower oxygen level can be effective. Our findings of changes in brain activity in the responsive patients indicate that non invasive monitoring, e.g. by EEG and fMRI, can help assess the response of the patients to the treatment and design person-specific dose-response adjustments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec056"><title>In conclusion</title><p>This study provides evidence that HBOT can improve quality of life and wellbeing of many FMS patients. It shows for the first time that HBOT can induce neuroplasticity and significantly rectify brain activity in pain related areas of FMS patients. Additional, studies are required to find the optimal dose-response curve and optimal time of treatment. The observation that pain characteristics may fluctuate, and even get worse during the first 10&#x02013;20 sessions, before its resolution, deserves notice and future investigation. Since there is currently no solution for FMS patients, and since HBOT is obviously leading to significant improvement, it seems reasonable to let FMS patients benefit from HBOT, if possible, now rather than wait until future studies are completed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec057"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127012.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127012.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127012.s002"><label>S1 Consent Form</label><caption><title>Informed consent form.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127012.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127012.s003"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Additional assessment of the within the crossover group.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127012.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127012.s004"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Additional comparisons between groups.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127012.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127012.s005"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical Study Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127012.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are thankful Dr. Rachel Lev-Wiesel for enlightening discussions regarding the neurophysiology effects of HBOT and the help with the data analysis.
