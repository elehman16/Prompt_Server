Participants gave written informed consent prior to randomisation. Exclusions included bleeding diathesis or comorbidity precluding surgery. SCNB was performed by advanced radiography practitioners and VAB by radiologists. Quality-of-life (QOL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ BR-23 questionnaire pre biopsy, 2, 6 and 12 months post randomisation. Final pathological diagnosis was compared with the initial biopsy result. A total of 110 participants were required to show a 25% improvement in diagnosis with VAB compared with SCNB (90% power).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>PPV for MM biopsy was 30.2%. Groups were evenly matched for age and lesion size (75% &#x0003c;15 mm). Eligibility was assessed for 787 cases; 129 women were randomised. Diagnostic accuracy of VAB was 86% and SCNB was 84%, which precluded any effect on surgical outcomes; 12.5% of VAB cases (8.7% SCNB) upgraded from DCIS at surgery. Following VAB, 44% cases required repeat surgery (29% SCNB). VAB took longer (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) and yielded more specimens (12 vs. 8) (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). Three VAB (4.7%) procedures were complicated by severe bleeding. Significant falls in QOL scores for global health (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) and social functioning (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.04) were observed over time for both groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>SCNB and VAB were equally accurate in the first-line diagnosis of malignant microcalcification.</p></sec></body></article>
