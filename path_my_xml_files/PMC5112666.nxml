The nursing students should be actively trained in order for them to sufficiently understand real clinical situations and gain the learning in a real context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Deubel stated that the use of an educational theory and subsequent use of a teaching model alone is not sufficient to advance learning and in order to design active courses and create the ground for learners to think, educational spectrum and teaching models must be integrated. The integration of these practices such as simulation and critical thinking strategies will improve the effectiveness of training programs and will help students gain Nursing skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Students have interest in simulation as one of the forms of interactive learning as well as a powerful way of transferring skills, which can be performed individually or in small groups. There are many types of simulation such as live simulation, virtual simulation, structural simulation, role-playing simulation and use of mannequins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Simulation helps students to understand the importance of nursing interventions to patient outcomes by reflecting on the performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It was revealed in different studies that simulation strengthens confidence, interest and clinical skills in nursing students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Nursing students should be active learners and think critically to provide safe patient care. Hence, nursing education has stressed critical thinking as a necessary nursing skill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Critical thinking is an essential component of professional responsibility and quality nursing care. In nursing, critical thinking is the ability to think systematically and reflect on the reasoning process used to ensure safe nursing practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, critical thinking skills are helpful in making appropriate decisions and quality nursing care. The development of critical thinking strategies and activities that facilitate this process will assist nurse instructors in planning appropriate educational strategies and assessment techniques. Simpson et al. believe that, critical thinking practices can change the students' focus from remembering to active learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Critical thinking strategies are the active learning strategies to promote critical thinking.</p><p>There are many educational methods for improving critical thinking such as using problem-based learning with case studies, group discussion and self reflection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>There is a close correlation between the simulation-based learning, critical thinking strategies and the principles of constructivist and collaborative learning. Furthermore, the integration of these strategies will strengthen learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], because students focus on problems in real clinical situations that could strengthen their understanding of concept and prepare them to manage complex clinical situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One of the major problems in training the nursing students is the utilization of traditional and non-active education in the clinical training and practical skills, which makes it difficult for the students to follow the critical thinking, problem solving ability and clinical decision path [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One of the problems for the nurse instructors is the implementation of critical thinking strategies in the curriculum and scenarios, which determine the clinical complications in making the right decisions for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In most reviewed studies, the integrated simulation training was investigated only with Problem based learning and the use of other critical thinking strategies (problem solving-based on group discussion) is less studied. The importance and necessity of this study is clear with respect to the special status of teaching the critical thinking skills, the sensitivity of teaching the clinical skills. In this way, we can empower nurses by adopting new techniques and strategies of active learning. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effects of integrated training (simulation and critical thinking strategies) and simulation-based training on the performance level and the critical thinking ability of students in 2014 in Shiraz.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This research was a quasi-experimental research with non-equivalent group pretest posttest design, which was carried out to compare the effect of simulation-based training and integrated training (simulation and critical thinking strategies) on the performance level and the critical thinking ability of nursing students studying at Shiraz Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery in 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Samples and setting</title><p>The study samples include all first-year nursing students studying in the second semester of the academic year of 2014&#x02013;2015 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) who were selected applying census method.

</p><p>In total, the results showed that the experimental group obtained higher performance score, with statistically significant difference, than the control group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effects of the integrated training (simulation and critical thinking strategies) and simulation-based training on the performance level and critical thinking ability of nursing students. The results of this study showed that the performance level of students in the experimental group (the integrated training) was higher than the performance level of students in the control group (simulation-based training) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.001). Also, the results showed that the score of the critical thinking ability obtained in the integrated training was increased only in the analysis dimension. In other words, this training method didn't fully strengthen students' critical thinking ability. This finding is in line with similar results regarding the effects of the simulated patient (high-fidelity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], effect of lecture method alone, lecture and case study, and the simulated patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] on critical thinking of nursing students. The results showed that, the critical thinking scores were improved, but there were no significant difference between groups. In summary, it can be concluded that a training course alone is not significantly correlated with the critical thinking. Furthermore, acquiring the critical thinking skills needs long period of time and continuing education. Moreover, the results showed that there was a significant relationship between the score of the performance level of the group which received simulation-based training alone and the one, which received the integrated training (simulation and critical thinking strategy) (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The result shows that integrated use of the training methods leads to higher performance in students. Previous studies have also revealed similar results regarding the positive effect of using integrated methods on clinical practice, problem solving skill, clinical efficacy and academic achievement and clinical competency. Moreover, in a study carried out by Liw et al. (2010) on first year nursing students in Singapore, which was conducted using the integrated training and problem- based training, the performance score of students who participated in the integrated education was higher than the performance score of those who received the problem- based training alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Lee et al. (2009) in Korea investigated the effectiveness of integrating two training methods (critical thinking strategies with simulation) on the empowerment in nursing fundamentals. The results suggested that the problem-solving skills and self-directed learning was significantly improved in the experimental group. Thus, the integrated method was proposed as a useful strategy in nursing education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>This study showed that the integration of critical thinking strategies (problem based learning with small group discussion) with simulation can improve the practical learning. The integration of both active learning will provide the opportunity to practice clinical skills in a real non-threatening environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This helps students to have personal interpretation from problems and therefore strengthens the learning processes and problem-solving skill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this research, students were given the opportunities to deeply discuss and explore the scenario through the integration of simulation and critical thinking strategies. The theoretical knowledge obtained from the scenario analysis facilitates the transfer of theoretical knowledge to students' clinical performance during simulation as well as encourages the discussion after simulation synthesis and application of the knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of the present study suggest that the use of integrated training methods (simulations and critical thinking strategies) as an active learning and student-directed strategies increase students' practical learning in a safe and controlled environment. This participatory approach is a deep learning guide for the learner in order to think aloud and explore the knowledge, solve problems and think critically.</p><p>Group dynamics on the development of critical debate and immersion in the simulation cycle enable students to use various sources to understand the functions (capabilities) of the job prospects while transferring knowledge. In addition, training in the stress-free environment of the clinical skills center enables coaches to allow students to obtain theoretical foundations and practical application of knowledge and problem-solving skills more. In this regard, it is recommended by researchers to use integrated teaching practices in the clinical training planning in order to enhance the clinical performance of students.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>OSCE</term><def><p>Objective Structured Clinical Examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCTST</term><def><p>California Critical Thinking Skills Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KR-20</term><def><p>Kuder-Richardson formula 20</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The present article was extracted from the MSc Medical Education thesis by Mrs. Farideh Saadat under the guidance of Dr. Nahid Zarif Sanaiey with the consultation of Dr. Mitra Amini (Grant No: 92&#x02013;6673).
