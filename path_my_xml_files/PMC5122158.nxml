Several face-to-face and web-based treatments have shown to be effective. Blending of web-based and face-to-face treatment is expected to improve smoking cessation treatment.

Patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;344) will be randomly assigned to either the blended or the face-to-face group. Both treatments will consist of ten sessions with equal content held within 6 months. In the blended treatment five out of ten sessions will be delivered online. The treatments will cover the majority of behavior change techniques that are evidence-based within smoking cessation counseling. All face-to-face sessions in both treatments will take place at the outpatient smoking cessation clinic of a hospital. The primary outcome parameter will be biochemically validated prolonged abstinence at 15&#x000a0;months from the start of the smoking cessation treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This RCT will be the first study to examine the effectiveness of a blended smoking cessation treatment. It will also be the first study to explore patient satisfaction, adherence, cost-effectiveness, and the clinically relevant influencing factors of a blended smoking cessation treatment.

Of the smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco the majority want to quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although a proportion of smokers quit without professional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], counseling and medication can more than double the success rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Success rates of smoking cessation treatments (5-months-after-treatment) range between 8,5% (minimal or no counseling or self-help) and 27,6% (intense counseling &#x00026; medication) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], depending on (1) contact time and intensity, (2) number and length of sessions, (3) number and type of clinicians involved, and (4) number and type of counselling formats and interventions. A treatment comparable to the ones of this trial has shown to lead to a cotinine-validated prolonged 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; abstinence rate of 10% (based on intention-to-treat analysis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, smoking cessation treatment is offered as face-to-face counseling. With the rise of the internet, web-based treatment offers an additional channel for effective smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nowadays face-to-face treatment and web-based treatment are usually offered separately. An integration of web-based and face-to-face treatments (blended treatment) is expected to combine the &#x0201c;best of both worlds&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] as this will allow the strengths of one to offset the weaknesses inherent in the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The weaknesses of face-to-face treatment that can be offset by the strengths of web-based treatment refer to (1) therapist drift; (2) patients&#x02019; no-show and (3) travel costs. (1) Face-to-face treatments often suffer from therapist drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This drift can be reduced by the protocolled nature of web-based treatments, which have shown to lead to higher treatment integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. (2) Patients&#x02019; no-shows result in time lost both for the counselors and the patients. In BSCT counselors can replace patients not showing up with online work, which can be planned flexibly as the process of online communication with the patients occurs asynchronously. Patients that miss a face-to-face session can still access their personal online dossier and continue treatment autonomously (e.g. psycho-education, exercises, and summaries of counseling conversations). As both counselors and patients can use their time more efficiently this can result in offering treatment to more patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. (3) Travelling to the smoking cessation clinic to attend a face-to-face meeting with the counselors is both time consuming and costly for the client. Web-based sessions do not require showing up at the clinic during the normal business hours, because they can be done e.g. at home in the evening. This reduces work time lost as well as travel related costs for the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The weaknesses of web-based treatment that can be offset by the strengths of face-to-face treatment refer to (1) poor engagement of patients and (2) tailoring of interventions. (1) A common problem of web-based treatment is poor engagement of users due to the small amount of personal contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Face-to-face treatment offers more personal contact and may therefor result in a higher commitment of the patients. (2) Web-based treatments are supposed to offer more tailoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Face-to-face treatment can offer greater flexibility in customizing interventions to the patients&#x02019; needs by for example explaining therapeutic interventions or providing additional information for diagnostic purpose or case management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge there has been no research on the potential benefits of a blended treatment for smoking cessation. The primary objective of this research is to find out if a blended smoking cessation treatment (BSCT) results in non-inferior quit rates compared to a face-to-face treatment as usual (TAU). Secondary objectives are to assess whether (1) patients are more satisfied with BSCT; (2) BSCT reduces treatment costs; (3) there is link between quitting and adherence in BSCT; (4) there are moderators or mediators predicting treatment outcome; and (5) how the treatment can further be improved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study will be a single-centre randomized controlled non-inferiority trial with a parallel group design.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population will consist of the patients of the outpatient smoking cessation clinic at Medisch Spectrum Twente (MST), Enschede, The Netherlands. These patients will be referred to the clinic by treating physicians of the hospital or by their GPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion/Exclusion criteria</title><p>Participants of this study will be smokers who admit themselves to the cessation clinic (indicating readiness to quit), who are at least 18&#x000a0;years old, who are currently daily smokers (at least one cigarette/day), and who are able to both access websites and communicate by email (both verified during intake procedure by asking whether the participant has internet access at home, and a current email address). People who are not able to read or write in the Dutch language will be excluded from this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participant will be recruited from those patients that have signed up for smoking cessation treatment at the outpatient smoking cessation clinic.

The data used for the QMinim minimization will be collected using the baseline questionnaire, which will be filled in online by the patient at home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Blinding</title><p>The study will be an open label study, as it is self-evidently impossible (due to the nature of the treatment conditions) to blind the staff and patients that are involved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study intervention</title><p>BSCT will be a combination of face-to-face treatment combined with web-based treatment into one integrated smoking cessation treatment that can be delivered in conventional smoking cessation clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Both BSCT and TAU will be provided by the Outpatient Smoking Cessation Clinic (SRP), which is part of the Department of Pulmonary Medicine of MST hospital. The web-based interaction of BSCT &#x02013; which patients will do e.g. at home - will make use of Tactus Addiction Treatment&#x02019;s website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rokendebaas.nl/">http://www.rokendebaas.nl</ext-link>. Out of this web-based treatment five session have been adopted for the integration in BSCT (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The SRP team consists of a pulmonologist and three qualified stop-smoking counsellors. The counsellors are registered on the Dutch Quality Register of qualified smoking cessation counsellors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kwaliteitsregisterstopmetroken.nl/">http://www.kwaliteitsregisterstopmetroken.nl</ext-link>). Both treatments fulfil the requirements of the Dutch care module for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] which is derived from the evidence-based Dutch Guideline Treatment Tobacco Addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

</p><p>TAU is personalized to the patients&#x02019; needs and contains flexibility in quitting strategies. To allow for comparability this flexibility is also integrated in BSCT. At treatment start the patients will be asked to favor one of three quitting strategies:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Stop at once: the patient sets a quit date, makes a preparation plan and stops abruptly on the quit date.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gradual change: the patient selects daily activities and contexts in which smoking is habitual and step-by-step continues these activities smoke free (for example when reading newspaper, Facebook, reading email, drinking coffee); finally, the patient sets a quit date. Being already accustomed to a range of daily habits without smoking will make it easier for the patient not to relapse.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Scheduled reduced smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]: the patient gradually decreases the number of cigarettes at regular intervals; at the start the patient does not smoke less but becomes used to a fixed schedule, and in subsequent phases the number of cigarettes will be gradually reduced (100%&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;75%; 75%&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;50%; 50%&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;25%) until the patient is ready to stop completely. This strategy systematically deconditions the cues. Although recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] suggest that gradual cessation strategies &#x02013; such as scheduled reduced smoking - may be sub-optimal compared to abrupt cessation, gradual cessation is still superior to non-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Offering scheduled reduced smoking broadens the target group for the cessation clinic, as it also allows patients who are initially reluctant to quit abruptly to enroll. Further, as it is an established part of TAU in this clinical setting, gradual cessation needs to be included in BSCT as well.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Both BSCT and TAU will consist of ten sessions with similar content spread over 6 months, with the frequency of sessions fading over time (six sessions within the first 3 months, four sessions within the final 3 months). Although participants may choose their preferred quitting strategy, this only marginally affects the content of the actual treatment that is delivered. Regardless of quitting strategy, the number and order of sessions is identical, as well as the effective components: the behavioral change techniques applied within sessions do not vary systematically. However, within the early sessions some differences may occur on a more detailed level within the BCTs (e.g. the timing of goal achievement within goal setting), due to quitting strategy.</p><p>All TAU sessions will take place at the SRP clinic while BSCT sessions will take place alternately face-to-face at the SRP (five sessions) and online (five sessions). This blended protocol resulted from a user centered design approach in which experts and counselors were involved in developing the most suitable mix of both delivery modes. The 50&#x02013;50% blend of face-to-face and web-based sessions results in a considerable substitution by web-based interaction, while at the same time maintaining the intensity of the full intervention.</p><p>As in TAU, BSCT consists of both counselor-dependent and counselor-independent components. The counselor-dependent web-based components of BSCT are interactive and rely on (asynchronous) communication between counselor and patient. The counselor-independent components such as psycho-educational content or the smoking diary are used by the patients on their own and in their own time. In TAU these components are provided in a paper manual that clients take home. In BSCT, these components are accessible online. As such, both treatments are equivalent with regard to both content and intensity. An additional benefit of BSCT, though, is that the content of previous counselor-dependent components remains accessible as email correspondence saved online.</p><p>Both BSCT and TAU will cover the majority of the behavior change techniques that are used within individual behavioral support for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], including those techniques that have shown to be reliably associated with better quit outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The distribution of the main behavior change techniques and the distribution of the face-to-face and web-based session are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Measurements</title><p>The time-points of the follow-up measurements are tied to the estimated stop-date, which is appropriate for aid-to-cessation trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The expected stop-date is 3 months after treatment start, which is later than in common cessation treatments where quitting usually is expected within 1 to 3 weeks. In total there will be four follow-up measurements with measurement 3 and 4 (9 and 15&#x000a0;months follow-up) to be conducted at standard time points (i.e. 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after the expected stop-date):<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>3&#x000a0;months after treatment start, expected stop-date, (3&#x000a0;months follow-up);</p></list-item><list-item><p>6&#x000a0;months after treatment start, end of treatment and 3&#x000a0;months after expected stop-date, (6&#x000a0;months follow-up);</p></list-item><list-item><p>9&#x000a0;months after treatment start, 3&#x000a0;months after end of treatment, 6&#x000a0;months after expected stop-date, (9&#x000a0;months follow-up); and</p></list-item><list-item><p>15&#x000a0;months after treatment start, 9&#x000a0;months after end of treatment, 12&#x000a0;months after expected stop-date, (15&#x000a0;months follow-up).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>A measurement schedule can be found in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

</p><p>The CO measurements in the study will serve as a backup for the cotinine measurements. They will only be analyzed in case the saliva samples are not usable. This backup strategy has been chosen because CO measurements are part of the routine stop-smoking treatment. To keep the burden for the participating patients as low as possible the measurements are linked to the scheduled face-to-face sessions. As the last face-to-face session in both treatment groups usually takes place in week 22 this moment has been chosen for the measurement to prevent the patient from travel time/work time loss for an extra appointment because of the study.</p><p>During the informed consent procedure all participants will receive a patient information letter that outlines the burden of participation, including the online questionnaires. By stressing the importance of the online questionnaires we try to increase patient commitment. During the trial, completion of the questionnaires will be checked after 2 weeks. Participants not completing the questionnaire will receive four weekly reminders: first twice via email, then twice by telephone. If a participant signals to be struggling with completing the questionnaire online, we will offer a paper version of the questionnaire, which will be sent including a return envelope.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Instruments</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary outcome (Cotinine level)</title><p>The primary outcome parameter will be biochemically validated prolonged abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] at 15&#x000a0;months from the start of the smoking cessation treatment. Saliva cotinine level will be measured as biochemical verification of abstinence only by those patients that report quitting smoking in the previous online questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Prolonged abstinence is defined as having salivary cotinine levels&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] that validate both the self- reported abstinence after the self-chosen stop date &#x02013; usually 3 months after start - and the self-reported abstinence at 15&#x000a0;month follow-up. Patients not reporting abstinence or with a higher cotinine level on any of these follow-ups will be regarded as smokers as well as patients who are lost to follow-up. A 0,5&#x02013;1&#x000a0;ml salivary sample will be collected for cotinine assessment by means of a Salivette (Sarstedt AG &#x00026; Co., N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Germany). Under supervision, patients will have to chew on a cotton swab for 1min to stimulate the saliva flow rate.

The scores obtained on the test permit the classification of nicotine dependence into five levels: very low (0 to 2 points); low (3 to 4 points); moderate (five points); high (6 to 7 points); and very high (8 to 10 points). The instrument evaluates for example time from awakening to the day&#x02019;s first cigarette, smoking when bed-ridden with illness, and difficulty in refraining from smoking when prohibited.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>MAP-HSS&#x02009;+&#x02009;smoking related complaints of smokers</title><p>The MAP-HSS is a ten-item health scale, which was adapted from the Opiate Treatment Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Each item is scored on a five-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (complaint never present in the previous 30&#x000a0;days) to 4 (complaint always present in the previous 30&#x000a0;days), resulting in a total scale-score ranging from 0 to 40. In addition to MAP-HSS the patients will be asked to scale 16 typical smoking related complaints (for example cold hands and feet, cough, pale skin, pain in the lung). An overall score of physical complaints will be calculated by adding MAP-HSS and the additional smoking related complaints.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21)</title><p>The DASS21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] is a consistent, valid and reliable set of three self-report scales designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. Each of the three DASS scales contains seven items. Patients will be asked to use 4-point severity/frequency scales to rate the extent to which they have experienced each state over the past week.

There are three response alternatives for each domain. The EQ-5D index is obtained by means of applying predetermined weights to the five domains. The EQ-5D index is a societal-based numerical quantification of the patients&#x02019; health status which can range from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health status). In addition to the five domains, EuroQol-5D also offers an overall rating for quality of life by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS).

Attitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] refers to the overall evaluation of smoking cessation. Attitude will be measured with an indirect, belief-based scale for perceived pros (four items: improved health for the patient, improved health for the patient&#x02019;s personal environment, lower risk of lung cancer, improved self-satisfaction) and cons (four items: suffering withdrawal symptoms, missing smoking, less ability to relax, feeling bored). Social influence refers to three distinctive constructs: social norms, perceived behaviour of others and direct support. It will be measured recording if the patient is stimulated to stop smoking by acquaintances, if his/her partners is a smoker and how many of his/her acquaintances are smokers. Self-Efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] refers to the confidence in the ability to refrain from smoking in specific high-risk situations, i.e. the situations in which the quitter is tempted to relapse. It will be measured recording six typical relapse situations (e.g. stress or party). The three constructs of the ASE model will be measured using standardized questions developed by the former Dutch foundation STIVORO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Alcohol and substance (mis)use</title><p>Alcohol (mis)use will be measured using the Five-shot questionnaire on heavy drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

Based on the expected benefits of BSCT the estimated abstinence rate for BSCT is 15%. If BSCT leads to an abstinence rate of not lower than 5% it will be regarded as non-inferior. With a power of 80% and &#x003b1; of 0,025 172 patients per group are needed for this RCT (calculated with PASS).</p><p>The 5% criterion is based on the three assumptions described below:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A validated prolonged abstinence rate of 5% may still be considered as superior to (1) a non-intervention condition which is estimated at a 1.4% abstinence rate and to (2) a 2.6% abstinence in a minimal intervention condition in clinical populations such as COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>In a worst-case scenario, BSCT patients will fail to use the web-based part of the intervention completely, and adhere to the face-to-face component only.

It will also be the first study to explore patient satisfaction, adherence, cost-effectiveness, and active ingredients of a blended smoking cessation treatment. The main three strengths of the LiveSmokefree Study are: (1) The blended smoking cessation treatment explored in this study was developed by a team in which all relevant stakeholder actively participated; (2) it demonstrates high ecological validity involving the heterogeneous population of regular patients of an outpatient smoking cessation clinic; and (3) it includes a long term biochemically validated follow-up assessment. Main objective is to test whether face-to-face-smoking cessation treatment can be substituted by a less demanding and more patient-friendly blended treatment with similar outcomes. As our clinical experience with blended smoking cessation treatment evolves, this trial will contribute to the understanding of the influence of blended treatment on both the stop smoking process and the patient&#x02019;s experience. The conduct of this trial and its findings will substantially strengthen the evidence base regarding new delivery modes of smoking cessation treatment. If blended smoking cessation treatment is shown to be non-inferior on effectiveness while offering secondary benefits, then dissemination to clinical practice should be warranted. Such secondary benefits may be lower treatment costs and higher user friendliness.</p><p>However, there are also limitations in this study. First, by allowing participants in both arms to opt for one of three different quitting strategies (stop at once, gradual change, scheduled reduced smoking), heterogeneity is introduced within the treatment. As allocation to the treatment groups is stratified on this criterion, however, all three quit strategies will be distributed equally over both groups and therefore not affect the internal validity of this trial. As a result, the main objective of this trial, i.e. comparing two modes of delivery of a treatment with identical content and intensity, is safeguarded. External validity may be somewhat impeded, though, as most cessation interventions in previous trials do not display such a flexible, preference-based, quit approach. To explore this issue sub-analyses of program effects among participants within each quit strategy will be considered, depending on sufficient sample size within subgroups. Alternately, moderation by quit strategies or by preference-based personalization requires testing in a more complex trial design with multiple study arms in future research.</p><p>Despite this obvious limitation, the personalized quitting strategy can also be considered a strength of the treatment, as it broadens the treatment to a larger target group and increases the potential reach among smokers.</p><p>Another limitation that will merit discussion of the practical relevance is the rather inflexible approach of blending in the treatment (five web-based sessions and five face-to-face sessions in a fixed sequence and with equivalent content) that is used to allow for comparability. This inflexible approach may limit the potential of blending. Blending web-based and face-to-face intervention could - in extremis - lead to a flexible exchangeability of all intervention components, which would foster a treatment that is highly tailored to the patient&#x02019;s needs and abilities. This would allow both the counsellor and the patient to choose a preferred blend of web-based or face-to-face delivery, while maintaining efficacy. Future studies should explore such benefits of flexibly blended treatment options.</p><sec id="Sec37"><title>Current status</title><p>Recruitment of patients started in May 2015.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BSCT</term><def><p>Blended smoking cessation treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FtF</term><def><p>face-to-face</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p>Interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MREC</term><def><p>Medical Research Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MST</term><def><p>Medisch Spectrum Twente hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRP</term><def><p>Outpatient Smoking Cessation Clinic of Medisch Spetrum Twente (Dutch: Stoppen-met-Roken-Poli)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the directors and the personnel of both Medisch Spectrum Twente and Tactus Addiction Treatment.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Both the Research Group Technology, Health &#x00026; Care at Saxion University of Applied Sciences and the Centre for eHealth and Well-being Research at University of Twente fund this research.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LS, MEP, MGJBK, and MGP identified the study questions and designed the study and its measuring instruments.
