The high prevalence, morbidity, mortality and economic burdens of COPD are increasing steadily. The projection for 2020 indicates that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Because of tobacco smoking, solid-fuel use, and other reasons, an estimated 65 million people will die of COPD between 2003 and 2033 in China
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, designing strategies and treatments for COPD is important. In light of evidence-based medicine, short-acting bronchodilators, long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled glucocorticosteroids, and low-dose, slow-release theophylline are the established interventions for treating COPD patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, it is difficult to improve people&#x02019;s symptoms without suffering too many side effects or adverse events
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The remarkable longevity and current popularity of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for COPD implies its potential advantages in ameliorating symptoms, reducing the frequency of acute exacerbation, and improving quality of life on the basis of different patterns and stages
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There is limited evidence for randomized controlled trials on comprehensive TCM interventions, especially based on the TCM patterns. Therefore it is difficult to fully reflect the efficacy, characteristics and advantages of TCM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The TCM pattern is a specific stratification of a disease according to a group of symptoms, which can be regarded as a summary of the body&#x02019;s condition at a certain stage in a disease process
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A potential way of studying COPD is by adopting the method of TCM patterns in clinical practice. According to our previous study, there are three common TCM patterns of stable COPD, and there is one specific herbal intervention responding to each pattern, which reflects the concepts of individualized therapy of TCM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, we performed a multi-center randomized controlled study that had been carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of comprehensive interventions based on the three TCM patterns in patients with stable COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><sec><title>Diagnostic criteria</title><p>COPD was diagnosed by the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, and the Chinese Treatment Guidelines of COPD

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There are three common patterns as follows.</p><p>Pattern of lung-spleen qi deficiency: Symptoms of lung-spleen qi deficiency included the following: (1) coughing and shortness of breath which are worse when active; (2) lassitude and spontaneous sweating, which are worse when active; (3) being prone to catching a cold; (4) poor appetite or eating less; (5) bloating in the gastric cavity, abdominal distension or loose stools; and (6) an enlarged tongue with a white or greasy fur and deep thready pulse, deep slow pulse or thready weak pulse. As long as the patients showed any two of symptoms (1), (2), or (3), along with any two of symptoms (4), (5), or (6), the pattern of lung-spleen qi deficiency was diagnosed.</p><p>Pattern of lung-kidney qi deficiency: Symptoms of lung-kidney qi deficiency included the following: (1) panting, shortness of breath, which are worse when active; (2) lassitude and spontaneous sweating, which are worse when active; (3) being prone to catching a cold; (4) weakness in the lower back and knees; (5) tinnitus, vertigo, or asthenia facial edema; (6) profuse urine, frequent urination at night, or urine released with coughing; and (7) a pale tongue with white fur, deep thready pulse or thready weak pulse. As long as the patients showed any two of symptoms (1), (2), or (3), along with any two of symptoms (4), (5), (6), or (7), the pattern of lung-kidney qi deficiency was diagnosed.</p><p>Pattern of lung-kidney qi and yin deficiency: Symptoms of lung-kidney qi and yin deficiency included the following: (1) panting and shortness of breath, which are worse when active; (2) lassitude, which is worse when active; (3) being prone to catching a cold; (4) weakness in the lower back and knees; (5) tinnitus and dizziness; (6) a dry cough or scanty sputum and difficult in spitting; (7)spontaneous sweating or night sweating; (8) feverishness in the palms and soles; and (9) a pale or red tongue with thin and little fur, and a thready pulse, thready weak pulse or thready rapid pulse. As long as the patients showed any two of symptoms (1), (2), or (3), along with any one of symptoms (4), or (5), and any two of the symptoms (6), (7), (8), or (9), the pattern of lung-kidney qi and yin deficiency was diagnosed.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients were included in the study according to the following: (1) patients met the diagnostic criteria; (2) patients met the TCM pattern criteria of stable COPD (TCM diagnosis); (3) patients were stable and met the diagnosis of mild to severe COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GOLD 1,2,3); (4) patients were aged between 40 to 80 years; (5) patients underwent a two-week wash-out period prior to randomization; (6) patients had no experience in other interventional trials in the previous 1 month; and (7) patients should receive the treatment voluntarily and sign informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients were excluded from the study for the following reasons: (1) acute exacerbation of COPD or very severe COPD (GOLD 4); (2) female patients were in pregnant or breast-feeding; (3) confusion, dementia or any type of mental illness that rendered patients unable to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study; (4) patients were complicated by severe heart failure (Grade II or IV New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Classification); (5) patients were complicated with bronchial asthma, bronchiectasis, active tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism or diffuse panbronchiolitis; (6) patients were complicated with a neuromuscular disorder, which affected the respiration; (7) patients with serious hepatic and renal diseases, such as liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, bleeding of varicose veins, dialysis, or renal transplantation; (8) congenital or acquired immune deficiency; (9) participation in other clinical intervention research; and (10) allergies to treatment drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and trial registration</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethical Research Committees of The First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (batch number: YFYKTLL2007-1). The study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Register Center (ChiCTR-TRC-11001406).</p></sec><sec><title>Entry procedure</title><p>Patients with stable COPD were enrolled from either the out-patient department or open recruitment and were observed in four centers, including the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Henan Provincial People&#x02019;s Hospital and the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. All patients signed the informed consent before inclusion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>A total of 352 cases were divided into the trial group (n=176) and the control group (n=176). The frequency of acute exacerbation was considered as the primary outcome. From a previous study, the number of the exacerbation frequency decreased by 0.44 times every half year by the TCM comprehensive interventions compared with the Western medicine treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We assumed that when the number of exacerbation frequency was decreased at least by 1 times between the two groups and the standard deviation was 1.5 times/year, the efficacy of TCM comprehensive interventions could be reflected and had promotional value. The formulae (

The two-sided alpha level was 0.05, and the beta level was 0.10. The &#x003b4; value was 1, the &#x003c3; value was 1.5, the &#x003bc;<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> value was 1.96, the &#x003bc;<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> value was 1.28. Using the calculation, N=2*(1.96+ 1.28) <sup>2</sup>*1.5<sup>2</sup>/1.0<sup>2</sup>, the sample size in each group was approximately 48. If the severity of airflow limitation in COPD (GOLD 1, 2, 3) was considered as the stratification factor, and the stratification factor was 3, then 144 (48*3) patients were required in each group, and the sample size in the two groups would be 288 (144*2). Allowing for a 15% dropout rate over the course of the study, the sample size would be approximately 332 (288+288*0.15). The sample size was inflated to allow for the balance of the research centers, with two patients were added to each group, and therefore the sample size was 336 (332+2*2). To avoid the negative effect of accidents in clinical implementation, four patients were also added in each research center. The number of research centers was four, and therefore, the final sample size was 352 (336+4*4), with 176 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>A stratified and block randomization design was adopted. The number of the groups was 2 and the distribution ratio was 1-to-1. Considering the long time for treatment observation, the process was divided into more than one block, and the length of the block was four. The number of center hierarchical levels was four. A random number from 001 to 352 was generated by SAS 9.2 and saved in a sealed envelope by an independent clinical statistician. Treatment allocation occurred when the participant met the inclusion criteria and signed the informed consent form. In the event of a clinical emergency, the individual&#x02019;s randomization code and group allocation could be identified by the emergency envelope as soon as possible. The randomization design was provided by the DME department of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p><p>The study was an open-label trial, however, some measures were taken to strengthen quality control. An investigator separate from all of the clinical researchers was assigned in each research center as the contact person who preserved and recorded the randomization information. Therefore, the clinical researchers did not have any effect on enrollment or randomization. Meanwhile outcome assessments were made by an independent clinical statistician blinded to group allocation and uninvolved in providing intervention or management.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients in the control group were given conventional Western medicine treatment based on the classes of medications recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and Chinese Treatment Guidelines of COPD

During the course of AECOPD, patients with aggravation of shortness of breath are often accompanied by dyspnea, chest tightness, a worse cough, increased sputum volume, changes in color, and (or) viscosity of sputum and fever
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The frequency and duration of AECOPD each time during treatment were recorded for 6 months and at a follow-up survey for 12 months.

Therefore, exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to overall severity in individual patients. Presently, the classes of medications recommended by GOLD are commonly used in treating COPD. Although more alternative approaches are used in COPD patients, definite effect evidence for TCM treatment is still limited. Hence, based on conventional Western medicine that referred to the GOLD classes of medications, we conducted our study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCM treatment by measuring such outcomes, scuh as exacerbations, lung function, symptoms, exercise tolerance and quality of life.</p><p>The TCM treatment in this study included Bu-Fei Jian-Pi granules, Bu-Fei Yi-Shen granules and Yi-Qi Zi-Shen granules. These granules are made from highly concentrated, selected Chinese herbs, and are produced in accordance with a traditional Chinese formula. The choice within each granule depends on the patient-specific pattern on which based the TCM theory of lung, spleen and kidney and Chinese medicine pattern theory. Over the 6-month treatment and 12-month follow-up, the TCM granules had beneficial effects on the measured outcomes, with no relevant between-group differences in adverse events.</p><p>AECOPD and lung function were the primary outcomes in this study. AECOPD can affect a decrease in lung function and impair the health-related quality of life
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It has been reported that the in patients admitted to intensive care units for AECOPD, their mortality rate was about 11&#x02013;24%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, the reductions in the frequency and duration of exacerbations are a major goal of COPD management and an important indicator for evaluating the treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. An accelerated decline in lung function is the main hallmark of COPD. A previous study showed that the rate of decline in FVE1 in COPD patients decreased from 47 ml to 69 ml per year
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. According to the results from the well-known UPLIFT Trial and TORCH Trial, the rate of decline in FVE1 in the salmeterol/fluticasone group was 39 ml/yr and the rate of decline in the tiotropium group was 41 ml/yr
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our results showed that the frequency and the duration of AECOPD in the trial group was 1.02 times and 4.39 days, respectively; however, those in the control group were 1.76 times and 6.37 days respectively. The rate of decline in FVE1 in patients in the trial group increased by approximately 4.16 ml per year, and it decreased approximately 52.54 ml/yr in the control group. The rate of decline in FVE1 in patients in the control group was consistent with that of previous large trials. TCM granules can reduce the frequency and duration of acute exacerbation, and maintain the rate of decline in FEV1. This may be due to the combined effect of conventional Western medicine and Chinese medicines.</p><p>Symptoms, exercise tolerance and health status outcomes were also observed in the current study. The characteristic symptoms of COPD are chronic and progressive dyspnea, cough, and sputum production. Although COPD is defined on the basis of airflow limitation, in practice the decision to seek medical help is usually determined by the effect of a symptom on a patient&#x02019;s daily life. However, in an early or stable state, dyspnea is not obvious and often overlooked by patients and physicians
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Evaluation of the degree in breathing difficulty is important to understand the severity of COPD, the health status of patients and to evaluate clinical intervention effects. Therefore, observations of symptoms and the Dyspnea Scale questionnaire were used in the current study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The 6MWD is widely used in respiratory disease as a comprehensive evaluation of functional status of the body with moderate or severe disease
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The main objective of the 6MWD is to determine exercise tolerance and oxygen saturation during sub-maximal exercise. The 6MWD is also considered useful in the determination of the point at which patients should be listed for rehabilitation programs. The cut-off point for the 6MWD was approximately 350 m
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and the minimal important difference in COPD patients is 25 m
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Currently, quality of life is an indispensable indicator and assessment tool. Because of the long course of COPD and a progressive decline in lung function, patients&#x02019; daily activities are limited and they rely on on family members more, coupled with a financial burden and decreased family status. COPD patients usually have low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and other adverse effects on psychological emotion and social adaptation ability. There are many types of effective and reliable health related quality of life questionnaires on chronic respiratory diseases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. With better reliability and validity, the WHOQOL-BREF was adopted in the current study to evaluate the quality of life of patients with COPD. Our results showed that the improvement of 6MWD in the trial group was 31.84 m, which, was better than that 14.07 m in the control group. The improvement of quality of life was 13.26% in the trial group and 6.13% in the control group, and symptoms were reduced, with lower dyspnea scale scores in the trial group compared with those in the control group. TCM granules reduced symptoms, and improved exercise tolerance and health status.</p><p>In addition, the reasons for the favorable effects of TCM treatment on the clinical parameters in COPD patients were also taken into account. Our results suggest that these favorable effects may be due to the combined effect of conventional Western medicine and Chinese medicines. The clinical effect of the TCM granules lied in reducing the frequency of acute exacerbation, ameliorating symptoms, increasing exercise endurance, and improving quality of life. In view of our previous studies, the mechanism of the TCM granules may be involved in reducing the expression of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;, and regulating the level of inflammatory cytokines. TCM granules may also be involved in regulating the level of cellular immunity, especially the expression of T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+) and CD4+CD25+; reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-2, MMP-9, improving the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1, regulating the balance of MMPs, and reducing the expression of JAK/STAT signaling pathways related factors and inflammatory factors.</p><p>Based on the the results of our trial, TCM treatment, including Bu-Fei Jian-Pi granules, Bu-Fei Yi-Shen granules, and Yi-Qi Zi-Shen granules, is safe and effective for treating COPD patients. However, there are some limitations for this study. In this study, herbal interventions (the granules) for the three TCM patterns were recognized as whole comprehensive interventions rather than one herbal intervention for each pattern. This study aimed to evaluate comprehensive interventions based on the three common patterns in stable COPD patients. Therefore, the efficacy of each type of herbal intervention on a TCM pattern was not evaluated. In addition, the 6-month treatment duration and 12-month follow-up duration was a little short to observe changes in lung function and to show the fully effect of TCM treatment. Further studies should be performed to evaluate TCM treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the TCM patterns, TCM treatments for COPD are safe and effective.
