Less than half survive to discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but recommended guidelines are often not met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although standard courses are the mainstay of ongoing life support training, the evidence that these courses improve outcomes is modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Other approaches to improve CPR quality include real-time CPR feedback devices and structured postresuscitation debriefings. Real-time CPR feedback devices report quantitative CPR quality data (e.g., compression rate, depth, and release velocity) and have been moderately effective at improving psychomotor aspects of basic life support (e.g., chest compressions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but data demonstrating improved long-term outcomes are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Comprehensive reviews (debriefings) of resuscitation efforts for the physicians involved in the resuscitation have improved CPR quality but have not been found to increase the rate of survival to hospital discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Their lack of effectiveness may be due to traditional debriefing programs targeting only those providers who actually participated in the event under review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, a novel approach that incorporated patient-centric physiology into the review and included the entire care environment (i.e., both providers who were and those who were not at the resuscitation under review) has been associated with a higher rate of survival with favorable neurologic outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The generalizability of the benefits resulting from patient-centric physiologic debriefings with all potential providers of the care environment is unclear because this intervention has been evaluated only in a small, single-center before-and-after study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The 42-month pediatric ICU study included an 18-month control period, a 6-month transition period, and an 18-month intervention period. The study enrolled 52 subjects with an index (first) CPR event in the control period and 42 subjects in the intervention period. The overall rate of survival with favorable neurologic outcome increased from 29% in the control period to 50% in the intervention period. Adjusting for potentially prognostic variables (age, sex, and first documented rhythm), subjects in the intervention period were more likely to survive to hospital discharge with favorable neurologic outcome (adjusted OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.01&#x02013;7.5; <italic>p</italic> = 0.047) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Despite limitations, the results suggest that this intervention may offer a powerful new approach for improving outcomes of in-hospital pediatric CPR. However, a multicenter randomized controlled trial is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par19">The present study protocol was written in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT).

In a parallel design, each hospital is randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group for the duration of the trial. In a TSW design, each hospital begins enrolling in the control group and transitions to enrolling in the intervention group at a randomly assigned time. The design ultimately selected for this trial is an HSW design, which is a hybrid between the parallel and stepped-wedge designs. As in a parallel design, two randomly selected hospitals are permanently assigned to enroll in the control group, and two others are permanently assigned to enroll in the intervention group. The remaining six hospitals, as in a stepped-wedge design, initially enroll in the control group but are randomly assigned a time to transition to enrolling in the intervention group. However, it is important to note that the influence of the intervention on hospital staff and thereby on patient outcomes is not fully effective on the day that the intervention is initiated. Therefore, each of these six hospitals has a brief transition period during which outcome data will not be included in the analysis. To our knowledge, ICU-RESUS is the first implementation of an HSW design, one with several advantages in the context of the trial.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of cluster-randomized trial designs.

In particular, the design enables valid comparisons in the midst of underlying temporal trends in the outcome. In contrast, a simple before-and-after design, as in the single-center pilot study, cannot adequately account for temporal trends, and any observed &#x0201c;intervention effect&#x0201d; cannot be disentangled from other influencing factors that may have changed over time. In addition to the advantages of a TSW design, an HSW design has been reported, in many instances, to have increased power compared with a TSW design or a parallel group design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par23">The intervention is a two-part ongoing training program for ICU staff. The program includes structured debriefings for the entire care environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (i.e., any care provider from several disciplines: physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, extracorporeal support specialists) and point-of-care practice with a manikin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">A 1-h CPR debriefing is held approximately monthly (at least nine times per year) by the unit, and all ICU staff are encouraged to attend. Providers are &#x0201c;invited&#x0201d; to the sessions through emails and departmental flyers. Ideally, a recent resuscitation from within the unit is selected, but a de-identified case from another unit or hospital may be used if needed.

Although the analysis will control for each individual unit, randomization occurs at the hospital level as opposed to the unit level to prevent the possibility of contamination. If units within a hospital were allowed to transition at different times, the intervention in one unit might inadvertently influence outcomes in the other, nontransitioned unit. One way that contamination could happen is through staff members from a transitioned unit temporarily working a shift in the nontransitioned unit. Therefore, when multiple units from a hospital are participating in the trial, all units are assigned the same transition date, reducing the possibility of contamination.</p><p id="Par34">All possible permutations of the hospitals were considered for the order in which hospitals would transition from control to intervention. However, some permutations lead to a transition schedule in which the smallest hospitals transition early and the largest hospitals transition late, causing more subjects to be enrolled in the control group than in the intervention group. The imbalance for each permutation was estimated on the basis of hospital-specific enrollment expectations, and permutations with excessive imbalance were excluded. The permutation selected for implementation was then chosen at random from permutations with adequate balance with respect to expected enrollment between intervention and control groups.</p><p id="Par35">The timing of the intervention for each hospital was established by the data coordinating center prior to enrollment.

The scheduled hospital is allowed a 4-week window to begin the transition by holding an inaugural debriefing. The exact dates marking the beginning and end of the transition period, a period during which newly enrolled subjects are excluded from analysis, is determined by the date on which the first and fourth debriefings are held.

Baseline PCPC is retrospectively assessed in enrolled patients and is typically based on their status prior to the event leading to the current hospitalization. However, baseline PCPC is evaluated no more than 30 days prior to CPR for subjects who have been in the hospital for more than 90 days. Subjects who are born during the same hospitalization in which the CPR occurred will have their baseline PCPC assessed based on their status prior to the decompensation associated with the CPR event.

The primary predictor in the model will be treatment group (intervention vs. control). Fixed covariates in the model will be age category (&#x02264;&#x02009;6 months, &#x0003e;&#x02009;6 months), Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (PRISM; a measure of illness severity in the 2&#x02013;6 h prior to CPR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], first documented rhythm, illness category (medical cardiac, surgical cardiac, medical noncardiac, surgical noncardiac), and a piecewise linear spline of time. Age, illness category and severity, and first documented rhythm are known predictors of mortality and are included to improve the model fit and potentially increase power. In contrast, survival with favorable neurologic outcome is not expected to change over time. However, without adjusting for time, an improvement over time in survival with favorable neurologic outcome that is unrelated to the intervention would be erroneously interpreted as evidence for the intervention owing to the increased enrollment in the intervention group toward the end of the trial. Including time as a covariate is critical for TSW and HSW designs in order to have valid inference in case of potential temporal trends. Although time is often modeled as a categorical variable in TSW trials, we chose to model time as a piecewise linear spline because we expect it to provide better model fit with fewer estimated parameters. For the spline, knots will divide the enrollment period into epochs of equal duration. The number of knots will be chosen to minimize the Akaike information criterion. There are 18 distinct units at the 10 participating hospitals. Unit will be included as a random effect to account for variability in outcomes between units and increase the generalizability of results.</p><p id="Par45">The data needed for this analysis are readily available, and automated data validation ensures that critical measurements are entered. However, in a very small number of subjects, the window for the PRISM score will be entirely prior to hospitalization. In order to obtain a best estimate of prearrest severity of illness, measurements more than 30 minutes prior to the arrest may be used in this case. In the very rare case that a subject experiences a CPR event within the first 30 minutes of hospitalization, all values will be assumed to be normal prior to the decompensation associated with the CPR event.</p><p id="Par46">This trial compares the effect of the ICU-RESUS intervention to current practice, but participating units had varied quality improvement programs prior to this trial.

In particular, TSW and HSW designs have many more subjects enrolled in the control group than in the intervention group at interim time points.

The HSW design is similar but often provides more power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], especially when transition periods are essential. To our knowledge, ICU-RESUS is the first implementation of an HSW design. The ICU-RESUS trial uses an HSW design with short transition periods to reduce the sample size, study duration, and cost. The transition period in the single-center pilot was 6 months, with debriefings held every 6&#x02013;8 weeks. However, we found that these long transition periods had a detrimental effect on power for HSW designs and especially for TSW designs. Using a shorter but more intense transition period (3 months instead of 6 months with debriefings held every 4 weeks) and using an HSW design rather than a TSW design allowed the duration of the trial to be reduced from 6 years to 4.5 years, with accompanying reduction in sample size and cost. The effect of transition duration is so striking because the most influential observations are those immediately prior to and after crossover. Therefore, when a period of transition is included, the observations containing the most statistical information are lost. The effect is somewhat subdued in an HSW design because some hospitals do not cross over and therefore do not experience a transition. Nevertheless, transition periods for both TSW and HSW trials should be as short as possible while still allowing the effect of the intervention to be fully realized. This was achieved in ICU-RESUS by increasing the intensity of the intervention during the transition with more frequent debriefings, which allowed the transition period to be reduced from 6 to 3 months.</p><p id="Par52">Most of the challenges of implementing an HSW trial are the same as for a trial with a TSW design. However, an HSW design introduces a few unique challenges, including the logistics of implementing an intervention prior to the start of enrollment and institutional willingness to participate. In a TSW trial, the intervention is first applied after a period of enrollment. In an HSW design, some hospitals must start the intervention prior to the enrollment period. This can add to the logistical complexity of study startup. When a transition period is required, such as in the ICU-RESUS trial, the start of enrollment may be delayed until the first hospitals are fully transitioned and ready to enroll in the intervention group. If the timeline is inflexible, enrollment may need to begin before the first hospitals have completed the transition to the intervention, reducing statistical power.</p><p id="Par53">Another potential challenge that is unique to an HSW trial is that hospitals may not be willing to participate in a trial in which they might never have the opportunity to apply the seemingly beneficial intervention. However, if true equipoise exists, there should be no preconceived expectation that receiving the intervention will ensure better outcomes. This issue required substantial discussion, but all investigators and sites agreed that the results of the small, single-center before-and-after pilot do not support a generalizable conclusion about the effect of the intervention or justify broad application of this resource-intensive intervention without further study. Therefore, no reservations were expressed by investigators or by the institutional review board in regard to the study design. To assuage potential concerns that the remaining control hospitals may be deprived of this potentially lifesaving program, the investigators determined a priori that support will be provided for the implementation of the intervention, after trial completion, at those remaining control hospitals if it proves to be effective.</p><p id="Par54">In conclusion, the ICU-RESUS trial uses a pragmatic and innovative design to determine whether structured debriefings coupled with point-of-care bedside practice can provide the much-needed improvement in pediatric resuscitation outcomes. This trial has the potential to profoundly impact pediatric in-hospital resuscitation outcomes as well as training and quality improvement initiatives. Additionally, our ongoing experience in the implementation of this trial may serve as an example to others of the practical benefits and challenges of using an HSW design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par55">The 4.5-year enrollment period began on October 1, 2016, and will conclude on April 1, 2021.
