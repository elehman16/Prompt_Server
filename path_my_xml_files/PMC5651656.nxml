About 2&#x02013;3% of people worldwide and more than 10% of Americans are affected by CRF.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The disease is increasing in developing countries so that its prevalence in Iran increased from 238 cases per million people in 2000&#x02013;354 cases per million in 2006.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] A few treatment options are available for patients with CRF, including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hemodialysis was the most common treatment method known in the world and including 70% of renal replacement therapy in 2014.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In Iran, review study shows that 47.7% of all patients with CRF use hemodialysis so that 25,934 patients were under chronic hemodialysis in 2013.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although the widespread availability of hemodialysis prolongs the lives of thousands of patients with end-stage renal diseases; However, these patients suffer from many problems and complications.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Hemodialysis patients suffer from high degree of disability, loss of function, and family lives; therefore, they need additional support from others among whom family caregivers play the most significant role in providing suitable support and care,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and they have the most central role in patient's adapting to and managing this chronic disorder.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Chronic illness of a family member and its economic and psychosocial consequences will involve the entire family and affect their lifestyle. Studies show that family caregivers of patients with chronic illness experience a vast range of physical and emotional distress and psychological symptoms, including depression, anxiety, anger, despair, and feelings of guilt and shame.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Furthermore, having the role of a caregiver in the family (an increasing phenomenon) affects the people's quality of life and accordingly has become one of the community health problems.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Therefore, family caregivers are at risk of becoming ill and are sometimes called hidden patients.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Even though basically, the caregiving role enhances sense of affection and love, gives meaning to their lives, strengthens their family ties, creates sense of self-content, and results in respect for themselves and others.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The reality is that taking care of hemodialysis patients at home reduces the quality of life and the ability of the caregiver.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Studies have showed that family caregivers have an exclusive role in caring for patients undergoing hemodialysis and their quality of life decrease in this situation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Similarly, Habibzadeh <italic>et al</italic>. reported the low caregivers&#x02019; &#x0201c;quality of life&#x0201d; in all aspects.</p><p>In hemodialysis centers, health professionals are responsible for patient care. However, at home, the patient's relatives undertake this role.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] These caregivers are often deficient in knowledge and skills related to patient care, lack social support, or support from health-care system. With disease progression, patients became more disabled, and caregivers are confronted with more complex caring needs.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In this regard, Mollaoglu <italic>et al</italic>. showed that caregivers&#x02019; most vital educational needs are patients&#x02019; nutrition (35/2%), dialysis (27/8%), fistula care (20/4%), caring of catheter (18/8%), CRF knowledge (18%), blood pressure (17/2%), weight control (17/2%), hygiene (3/1%), and sport and travel (6/5%);[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] according to Isenberg and Trisolini's study, most hemodialysis family caregivers reported insufficient knowledge of the disease, control of symptoms, and patient care. In addition, they mostly wanted to know about the food and drug management of their patients.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>According to the research results of Belasco <italic>et al</italic>., 70% of caregivers face two major problems, one of which is associated with the care and treatment of the disease, and the other one related to adjustment with caring responsibilities.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In addition, findings show that caregivers suffer anger, stress, and compatibility issues resulting from taking care of chronic patients.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Hence, caregivers in addition caring skills require applying other skills in stressful situations to facilitate proper relationship with the patient, reduce stress and tension, and increase problem-solving and compatibility abilities.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Studies suggest that whenever people placed under stressful situations, effective adaptation can protect them from physical and mental harm and that coping skills of caregivers play vital role in removing tensions and promoting their mental health status.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Coping skills is a process through which individuals manage their interaction with the environment. Appropriate coping skill is essential for family members to enhance the quality of life. These skills are divided into two categories: problem-focused and emotion-focused.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Problem-focused coping skills consist of direct behavioral and mental functions carried out by the individual to change and modify threatening environmental conditions. Direct confrontation, seeking social support, anger management, and communication skills are also parts of problem-focused coping capabilities.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The results of other studies have indicated the effect of supportive educative program, which consists of problem-focused skills and strategies for taking care of patients at home, on increasing the quality of life of caregivers of other chronic diseases such as cancer, heart failure, dementia, mental illness, and diabetes.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In addition, the results of systematic review and descriptive studies confirmed the necessity of implementing supportive educative program to enhance quality of the lives of caregivers.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] However, the caregivers of hemodialysis patients are mostly neglected, and few studies are available on home care training for these caregivers[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and no studies are available on the effectiveness of supportive educative on the quality of life in these caregivers.

Inclusion criteria for the caregivers were as follows: being a patient's first-degree relative, having the responsibility for the home care of his or her hemodialysis patient, willingness to participate in the study, at least 18 years of age, writing and reading literacy, having no known psychological or neurological disorders, having no severe family conflict, and not being a health-care worker. Inclusion criteria for the patients were as follows: performing regular hemodialysis for at least 2 months, at least three times a week, and for 3&#x02013;4 h in each session; having no history of kidney transplantation; and having a family caregiver to do home care. The lack of appropriate cooperation by the caregiver, participation in similar training courses, the occurrence of a family crisis (divorce, financial crisis, the death of a first-degree family member) during the study, a subject's decision to withdraw from the study, the absence of even a training session, and booking the patient on the kidney transplantation list were selected as exclusion criteria.</p><p>The required sample size for each group after investing the amounts in the following formula estimated 38.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="JEHP-6-80-g001.jpg"/></p><p>A two-part instrument was used. The first part included a demographic questionnaire including questions on the caregiver's and the patient's demographic data, such as the caregiver's age, gender, marital status, education level, job, type of family relationship with the patient, financial status, having a known physical illness, and the size of their family as well as the duration of the patient's disease, duration of using regular hemodialysis, history of kidney transplantation, dialysis association membership, having active insurance coverage, and the type of insurance coverage. The Farsi version of the short-form quality of life (SF-36) questionnaire was used as the second part of the study instrument.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>Quality of life (SF-36) questionnaire is a universal standard criteria. Its shortened form contains 36 items divided into three levels: (1) Questions, (2) eight scales with any combination of 2&#x02013;10 questions as physical health (10), bodily pain (2), general health (6), physical role functioning (4), vitality (3), emotional role functioning (3), social functioning (2), mental health (6), and (3) two summary scales forming physical health components (physical function, bodily pain, general health, and physical role functioning), and mental health components (vitality, emotional role functioning, social functioning, and mental health). The mean scale is calculated separately, and the results of each scale vary from 0 to 100. The lowest score on this questionnaire is 0, and maximum score is 100. Zero is the worst case, and the higher scores reflect the better quality of life.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] This scale was translated to Farsi by Montazeri <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and its validity and reliability were confirmed through content validity and internal consistency method (0.70&#x02013;0.85); also, its Cronbach &#x003b1; has been reported in the range of 0.70&#x02013;0.90.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Furthermore, in a preliminary study on the thirty caregivers of patients undergoing hemodialysis, the Cronbach &#x003b1; was calculated as 0.82. However, the data of preliminary study was not used in the final analysis.</p><p>After approval of the study was obtained, the first researcher referred to the aforementioned hemodialysis center, and through a file review and interviews with the patients, those with inclusion criteria were found. Then, the researcher made telephone contact with the patient's main caregivers, and through telephone interviews, assessed their eligibility, informed them that a study is starting to investigate caregiver's quality of life, and invited them to participate in the study. Caregivers who agreed to take part were informed that they would be involved the study for about 2 months and would be asked to complete the questionnaires two times, during the study. Then, all of them were invited to attend a session in the hall of the dialysis center to complete the study instrument and were informed that after a while they would be invited to attend several educational sessions. Subsequently, through a coin-tossing method, caregivers of the patients who referred on even or odd days of the week were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group, respectively. Then, the 38 caregivers in the intervention group were allocated into five small subgroups of five to eight, and each subgroup participated in two training sessions on how to take care of hemodialysis patients at home and four training sessions on problem-focused coping strategies (proper communication, anger management, and deep breathing) that were held three sessions per week, in 2 consecutive weeks, and each session lasted for about an hour. All coping skills training sessions were delivered by an expert psychiatric nurse that was previously trained and tested to facilitate group discussions.</p><p>Each session consisted of a combination of a short PowerPoint facilitated lecture, a group discussion, a question and answer period, and a role playing. The researcher motivated the caregivers to present their questions and ambiguities and participate in activities through group discussion and question and answer and finally, summed up what was mentioned at the end of session. The caregivers were asked to practice the skills at home while taking care of patients; the researcher's phone number was given in case of emergent questions. At the end of the first session, an educational booklet related to the issue was given to all the participants to be read and exercised at home. The content validity of the educational booklet was confirmed by 10 nursing professors in the Tehran, Iran, and Shahid-Beheshti Universities of Medical Sciences.

The researchers were sensitive to preserving the participants&#x02019; rights according to the Helsinki ethical declaration. To observe ethics, the caregivers in the control group also received the educational booklet after the last assessment.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 21.0 [IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA].

Just in a study without control group in Turkey, Mollaoglu <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effects of education on caregivers&#x02019; burden and reported that education was effective in reducing caregivers&#x02019; burden.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Regarding these results, for the first time, we decided to evaluate the effectiveness of supportive educative program on the quality of lives of caregivers for patients undergoing hemodialysis. The present study showed that home care training (giving information about CRF, hemodialysis, its complications, and how to take care of patients at home) can improve their quality of lives. So that mean and standard deviation of the quality of life of caregivers increased from 45.9 &#x000b1; 14.9 to 63.5 &#x000b1; 11.50; this increase implied the efficiency of educative program on the quality of life of caregivers. In addition, educational intervention on caregivers of patients with CVA in Thailand showed the enhanced quality of life of caregivers.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Belgacem <italic>et al</italic>. showed the positive effects of training program on quality of life of caregivers of cancer patients.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] However, those two studied paid less attention to supporting caregivers and focused merely on training them.</p><p>In addition to learning how to take care of patients, coping skills help them ease tensions, comply with their caring role, and promote mental health.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] According to in Grey <italic>et al</italic>. and Khanjari <italic>et al</italic>. studies, the quality of life of parents has increased after coping skills training through lecture and group discussion.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Therefore, considering the decisive role of coping skills in compatibility of caregivers, second part of the intervention program teached problem-focused coping skills such as communication skills, anger management, and deep breathing. The research attempts to encourage the caregivers to make themselves compatible with their role and relieve the tension burdening them so that they can perform their responsibility more effectively.</p><p>Etemadifar <italic>et al</italic>. argued that presenting group support to caregivers of heart failure patients increases the ability and self-esteem of family members to provide better care at home through reducing stress and pressure of their responsibility.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Navidian <italic>et al</italic>. believe that empowering family as a group can promote their quality of patient care and improve their physical and mental health.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>After implementing supportive educative program, results of the study show considerable difference in all dimensions of quality of life except physical function between intervention and control groups; most significant increase in intervention group is related to these dimensions: limitations in function due to physical and emotional problems, mental health, vitality, social function, physical pain, general health, and physical function. In general, the score of physical and mental health of quality of life of caregivers in the intervention group is 51.59&#x02013;66.04, and 40.30&#x02013;60.99 before and after the intervention, this suggests that although physical health of caregivers have high score after intervention, their mental health has been further increased after the intervention; therefore, based on results, supportive educative program has had great impact on emotional and mental aspects of quality of life. Unlike the score of quality of life of intervention group, the scores of control group subjects indicate significantly decreased in physical function, physical pain, vitality, and physical health 6 weeks after intervention.</p><p>Unlike the results of the present study, the results of a study on caregivers of women with breast cancer showed that after the administration of the supportive educative program, their quality of lives in physical, emotional, and mental aspects significantly increased (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), but not in the social aspect.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Furthermore, in the present study, the caregivers had no consensus over the provided services by the Dialysis Association Society; therefore, the lower score of social domain can be related to the insufficient social support of caregivers from the Dialysis Society. For example, in the study of Habibzadeh <italic>et al</italic>., despite participants&#x02019; membership in Dialysis Association, about 85% of caregivers had reported insufficient support from the society.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Studies have shown that besides knowledge and skills on coping strategies, caregivers of hemodialysis patients need counseling, empathy, and psychological support to cope with their caregiving roles.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Isenberg and Trisolini in 2008 and Khanjari <italic>et al</italic>. 2014 showed that group discussions and sharing experiences among caregivers are effective in providing ways to give and receive empathy and psychological support.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Confirming the findings of the previous studies, the present study also showed that these strategies, along with educating the caregivers on problem-focused coping strategies. Furthermore, in the current study, besides group discussion, we used role playing to educate home care and gave caregivers the researcher's phone number to ask any caring questions. It can be acknowledged that using the different methods of education such as role-playing, group discussion, question and answer, and phone consultation was helpful in the better learning and practical application of the learned skills and improving the caregivers&#x02019; quality of life.</p><p>Most of the caregivers in this study were females who were daughters or wives of the hemodialysis patients. This finding was consistent with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Evidence shows that most of caregivers of the chronic patients in Asian families are females.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Mollaoglu <italic>et al</italic>. have also reported that female family caregivers are usually more sentimental and sensitive to patients caring needs and also have greater ability than men in the management of problems and establishment of intimate relationships with patients.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Therefore, it is recommended that future studies pay more attention to the role of woman in taking care of chronic patients.</p><p>This study was conducted only on caregivers of patients in a dialysis center; the small sample size and the relatively short follow-up period can be considered limitations to generalize the findings of this study. Therefore, the replication of similar studies with larger sample sizes and longer periods of follow-up is recommended. Moreover, as in any questionnaire study, the caregivers&#x02019; responses to the questionnaire might have been affected by their psychological condition, and this was not under the full control of the researchers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study showed the effectiveness of supportive educative program on the quality of life of family caregivers of hemodialysis patients. Based on the results of the present study, we can conclude that training home-care capabilities and problem-focused coping skills to caregivers of hemodialysis patients can promote their quality of life through integrating communication skills in relationship with the patient and relatives, anger management skills, and deep breathing practices in stressful situations. At present, no program is running on educating family caregivers in the health-care system of Iran and caregivers of hemodialysis patients are totally ignored. Authorities and policymakers in the health-care system are responsible to take strategies to integrate educational programs such as the program implemented in the current study the country's health-care system.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences (grant no. 94-01-28-25834-110422), and it was recorded I the Registry of Clinical Trials with the code of IRCT 138809032769N1.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This resultant article has been part of the master's thesis of the first author and also is the research project approved by Iran University of Medical Sciences (Project No. 94-01-28-25834) and was funded by Research Deputy of Iran University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are deeply thankful to the authorities in Shahid Hasheminejad Hemodialysis Center and all family caregivers who participated in this study and professors of Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Iran University.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><source>United States Renal Data System.
