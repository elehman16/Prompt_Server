It is characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and is the most frequent endocrinopathy in women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It is commonly linked with insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Ovarian hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation are highly linked with hyperinsulinemia. However, weight loss in obese women with PCOS leads to decrease in insulin and androgen levels with an obvious improved fertility outcome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Clomiphene citrate (CC) was the first-line therapy for ovulation induction in these patients but it has still high failure rate. However, CC usage for more than six cycles had high risk of ovarian cancer in these patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>According to latest recommendations, insulin-sensitizing agents (ISA), such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, have been preferred for PCOS treatment. These agents have both metabolic and endocrine/ovarian favorable effects. In addition to the favorable metabolic actions, i.e., improvement in glucose, lipid, and proinflammatory profiles, these agents also put forth beneficial endocrine and ovarian effects, e.g., amelioration of reproductive abnormalities, restoration of ovulation and menstrual cycles, reduction of androgen production, and increase in pregnancy rates. For that reason, the use of insulin sensitizers along with lifestyle measures and/or other agents, in women with PCOS, particularly in the situations of insulin- or clomifene-resistance, have been emphasized.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge and understanding, the studies done on this topic are scarce in Saudi Arabia so we set out the objectives of this study to compare the effects of CC alone and in combination with metformin in females presented with PCOS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized controlled trial of independent cases and controls with one control per case was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hera General Hospital, Makkah, Saudi Arabia from February 01 to December 31, 2008.</p><p>The sample size was determined according to Jones <italic>et al</italic>., criteria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] as 42 subjects because Vandermolen <italic>et al</italic>., indicated the ovulation failure rate of (<italic>P</italic>1 = 73%) in the group treated with CC alone and (<italic>P</italic>2 = 25%) for experimental group treated with both CC and metformin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The standardized difference was calculated as 0.96 by following formula. This sample size was calculated to reject the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control subjects were equal with probability (power) 90%. The Type I error probability (alpha) associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. A line was drawn in the nomogram from 0.96 to the power axis at 0.9, and found 42 subjects from the intersect with the central axis, at 0.05 a level in the study.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="JHRS-6-15-g001.jpg"/></p><p>The first 42 diagnosed patients of PCOS were enrolled. The diagnosis was made on the bases of the presence of two of the three following criteria:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Polycystic ovaries (either 12 or more peripheral follicles or increased ovarian volume (greater than 10 cm<sup>3</sup>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Oligo- or anovulation (irregular cycles, amenorrhea).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism (Acne, hirsutism, voice changes, and clitoromegaly).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>PCOS was only diagnosed after excluding other etiologies like thyroid dysfunction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia, and androgen-secreting tumors. The baseline screening tests were done, i.e., thyroid function tests, a serum prolactin, and free androgen index (total testosterone divided by sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) &#x000d7;100 to give a calculated free testosterone level). In cases with clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism and total testosterone &#x0003e; 5 nmol/l, 17-hydroxyprogesterone was advised to exclude androgen-secreting tumors. Male factor was kept normal in both groups by making semen analysis to rule out male infertility. Females with recent history of pelvic inflammatory disease were also not selected. Hysterosalpingogram was done to exclude tubal factor.</p><p>The females were divided into group A (cases) and group B (controls) (21 subjects in each) by randomization for management with CC along with metformin and CC alone, respectively. The randomization was done by opening opaque envelopes containing cards bearing the management protocols.</p><p>The group A received 500 mg three times a day of metformin continuously (the same dose) from the first cycle for 6 months or till pregnancy was confirmed. In both groups, CC was started at a dose of 50 mg from 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the menstrual cycle till 6<sup>th</sup> day for a total of 5 days.</p><p>All females were followed for six cycles for evidence of ovulation as detected by follicle tracking (ovarian volume, follicular size in millimeter and number of follicles) on ultrasonography by professionals and regulation of menstrual cycles. Ovulation was confirmed by dominant follicle (18-20 millimeter) on 12<sup>th</sup> day with absent follicles on 16<sup>th</sup> day. After ovulation Human Chorionic Gonadotropin 10,000 IU intramuscularly was given to patients followed by advice of intercourse after 36 hours. With ovulation the dose of CC was unaltered in both groups. The dose of CC was increased, if the size of dominant follicle was remained &#x0003c;18 mm, i.e., 100 mg during the second cycle and 150 mg in the 3<sup>rd</sup> cycle and kept the same dose of 150 mg for the remaining three cycles till ovulation occurred.</p><p>Confirmation of conception was done by positive urine pregnancy test in those women who did not menstruate. In females, who became pregnant, metformin was continued up to 08 weeks of pregnancy. Clinical pregnancy was confirmed by gestational sac detection on ultrasonography.</p><p>Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and subjected to descriptive analysis, i.e., number, percentage. Chi-square test (2 &#x000d7; 2 contingency Table) was applied to categorical variables.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>ETHICAL ISSUES</title><p>The Hospital granted us permission to conduct this study and we declared that we have no financial or personal relationship(s) which may have inappropriately influenced us in writing this paper.</p><p>A written formal informed consent from all study participants was taken after they had been made aware of study procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-4"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The subjects&#x02019; mean &#x000b1; SD age (years) of group A was insignificantly high than group B, i.e., 32 &#x000b1; 3.5 <italic>vs</italic>. 31.3 &#x000b1; 2.9; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05.
