Roflumilast, a first-in-class, potent and selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, reduces the rate of exacerbations in patients with a high risk of future exacerbations and has been shown to reduce inflammatory cells and mediators in induced sputum, a surrogate of airway inflammation. However, these anti-inflammatory effects are yet to be confirmed in another robust study directly assessing inflammatory markers in bronchial sub-mucosa.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>An international, 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study investigating the effects of roflumilast 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once-daily versus placebo on inflammatory parameters in bronchial biopsy tissue specimens, sputum and blood serum. One hundred and fifty patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis for at least 12 months will be recruited into the study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either roflumilast or placebo. The primary endpoint will be the number of CD8+ cells (cell counts per mm<sup>2</sup>) in bronchial biopsy tissue specimens (sub-mucosa) and the key secondary endpoint will be the number of CD68+ cells (cell counts per mm<sup>2</sup>), assessed by indirect immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is hypothesized that treatment with roflumilast reduces the characteristic inflammation found in the airways of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, compared with placebo. The design of the present study has built on the work of previous bronchial biopsy studies available in the literature. It is hoped that it will reveal the cellular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast and identify potentially important biomarkers and other surrogate endpoints in patients with COPD. The design and rationale for this trial are described herein.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical trial identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01509677">NCT01509677</ext-link> (clinicaltrials.gov)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>Roflumilast</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Exacerbation</kwd><kwd>Bronchoscopy</kwd><kwd>Bronchial biopsy</kwd><kwd>Protocol</kwd><kwd>Sputum</kwd><kwd>Histology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem and it is projected that its burden will increase over the coming decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) document defines COPD as a &#x0201c;preventable and treatable disease, characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. Exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease. Most notably, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, macrophages (CD68+) and neutrophils are increased in the airways and sputum of patients with chronic bronchitis and COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Increased CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts have been characterized in the alveolar walls, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] pulmonary arteries, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] peripheral airways, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] bronchial glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and subepithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] of patients with COPD. Moreover, neutrophil numbers are elevated in the bronchial glands and epithelium, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] while increased macrophage infiltration has been observed in the subepithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and bronchial glands of symptomatic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In a cross-sectional study of patients with a wide range of COPD severity, Hogg and colleagues have shown that the percentage of airways containing inflammatory cells (including neutrophils, macrophages and CD8+ cells), increases with increasing GOLD stage of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, the level of inflammation underlies not only disease severity, but also exacerbation severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and recovery time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Papi et al. have observed that the proportion of sputum neutrophilia correlates positively with exacerbation severity, independently of bacterial or viral infections, and that sputum eosinophilia may be a good predictor of an imminent viral exacerbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There is also a significant relationship between the differences in interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 levels at baseline and day 7 after an exacerbation, and symptom recovery time, suggesting an important role of these inflammatory markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>COPD exacerbations are also associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For example, patients experiencing a severe exacerbation have augmented neutrophilic recruitment and gene expression of neutrophilic chemoattractant proteins compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. IL-6 and IL-8 levels are elevated in the sputum of patients experiencing an exacerbation and even in frequent exacerbators who are stable, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] while CD8+ T-lymphocytes have been found to be increased at the onset of COPD exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Most recently, it has been shown that CD8+ T-lymphocytes actually move from the circulation to the lung following experimental RV infection in COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The use of bronchial biopsies has contributed significantly to our knowledge of COPD, helping to reveal the anti-inflammatory properties of COPD therapies, and the key role of CD8+ T-lymphocytes in COPD pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. One study demonstrated that a salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination reduces CD8+, CD45+ and CD4+ cell numbers, as well as cells expressing genes for tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Bourbeau et al. have confirmed that the same combination has anti-inflammatory effects which are not observed with use of the inhaled corticosteroid alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Roflumilast is a first-in-class, potent and selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, which targets the underlying chronic inflammation in COPD. As the first approved selective PDE4 inhibitor, roflumilast reduces the rate of exacerbations in patients with a high risk of future exacerbations (GOLD patient groups C and D) and symptoms of chronic cough and sputum (chronic bronchitis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A placebo-controlled clinical study has shown that roflumilast reduces absolute neutrophil and eosinophil counts in induced sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, evidence for its anti-inflammatory effects is limited and warrants further investigation in another study, in patients with COPD.</p><p>Accordingly, an ongoing clinical study has been designed with the aim of increasing our understanding of the anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast. The study will analyze inflammatory markers in bronchial biopsies, induced sputum and blood serum and will offer the opportunity to identify potentially important biomarkers and surrogate endpoints in patients with COPD. The present paper brings the protocol of this clinical study to the attention of the medical community and discusses the rationale behind the study design.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>An international, 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) investigating the effect of roflumilast 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once daily versus placebo on inflammation parameters in bronchial biopsy tissue specimens, sputum and blood serum (clinical trial identifier: NCT01509677).

Previous trials have shown that drop-out rates in bronchial biopsy studies may be as high as 30% from enrolled patients; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] therefore, if a conservative estimate of 30% is applied, the present study may have 105 patients who complete the trial. Drop-outs are difficult to handle in bronchial biopsy studies. If drop-outs are excluded this could unfairly bias the trial, however, if drop-outs continue in the study after having treatment with antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids, this could also bias the results. It is therefore important to choose a group of patients who are unlikely to exacerbate or drop out during the course of the trial, which is the case in our study design. A universally recognized level of clinical relevance regarding the primary endpoint (sub-mucosal CD8+ cells) has not yet been agreed on within the scientific community, but a 30% improvement using roflumilast treatment over placebo may be of clinical relevance. We have calculated that with a dispersion of 25, tissue area of 0.3&#x000a0;mm<sup>2</sup> and further assumptions (1:1 randomization, two-sided &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.90, event rate on roflumilast&#x02009;=&#x02009;200 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>, event rate on placebo&#x02009;=&#x02009;285 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>), the trial would have a high power (approximately 90%) to detect treatment differences.

It will be the primary analysis for this study and will be performed for all primary and secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint relates to pulmonary inflammation expressed as CD8+ cell counts per mm<sup>2</sup> in sub-mucosal bronchial biopsy tissue specimens measured before and after the double-blind treatment period. The key secondary endpoint relates to CD68+ cell counts per mm<sup>2</sup> in sub-mucosal bronchial biopsy tissue specimens. Roflumilast/placebo comparisons for these endpoints will be performed via a multiple test procedure such that the family-wise error rate of 5% is controlled in the strong sense. The two null hypotheses are: equal CD8+ counts/mm<sup>2</sup> and equal CD68+ counts/mm<sup>2</sup> for roflumilast and placebo. These null hypotheses will be ordered, so that the CD8+ comparison comes first and the CD68+ comparison comes second. If the comparison with respect to CD8+ is significant at the nominal level &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;5%, the corresponding null hypothesis will be rejected and the CD68+ comparison will be performed in a confirmatory way (otherwise confirmatory testing stops). This will again be done at nominal level &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;5%. If significant (after a significant result in the first comparison), the corresponding null hypothesis will be rejected. If the first comparison is not significant at 5% level, then neither null hypothesis must be rejected. The component tests of the multiple test on CD8+ and CD68+ will be based on Poisson regression models with CD8+ (CD68+) at end of treatment period as a dependent variable and treatment and baseline values of the respective dependent variable as covariates. A dispersion parameter and an offset (equivalent to the bronchoscopy sampling area) will be taken into account.</p><p>Analyses of the other secondary endpoints will be descriptive on treatment and visit, by ANCOVA on absolute change from baseline to last available measurement during double-blind treatment for continuous variables, or Poisson regression for count data. In addition, analyses will be performed in subgroups stratified by COPD stage, smoking status, concomitant LABA and former ICS use.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This clinical study hypothesizes that roflumilast reduces the characteristic inflammation of COPD in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. A specific pattern of inflammation has been characterized in the airways and lung parenchyma of COPD patients, predominantly consisting of increased numbers of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, CD68+ cells and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Previous research has shown that inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 and IL-8, also play an important role in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Roflumilast reduces exacerbations in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and chronic bronchitis, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] but there are limited clinical data on its anti-inflammatory effects in the lungs as well as systemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The present study was designed to implement lessons learned from previous bronchial biopsy studies. It will hope to reveal the precise anti-inflammatory properties of roflumilast responsible for its therapeutic effect in the lungs (biopsy and sputum) and identify potentially important biomarkers and surrogate endpoints in patients with COPD. Moreover, the results from this study may also provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of COPD and serve as a foundation for future research.</p><sec><title>Rationale behind the study design</title><p>This will be the first study to associate roflumilast&#x02019;s effects in sputum, the lungs and systemic circulation with observed anti-inflammatory changes. Previous studies have pinpointed CD8+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages (CD68+) as cell populations characteristic in COPD inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Based on these data, CD8+ and CD68+ cell counts have been selected as the respective key primary and secondary endpoints for this study. The measurement of cell counts per mm<sup>2</sup> was selected on the basis that the area profile count is a commonly used method for the quantification of inflammatory cells in bronchial biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Induced sputum offers another opportunity to obtain samples containing potentially valuable information on disease characteristics, relatively easily; while the collection of blood serum for biomarker analyses is based on the hypothesis that systemic inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD. It may be argued that the endpoints used in this study are neglecting the most important site of inflammation in COPD &#x02013; the small airways. However, until safe and reliable methods, which can detect small airway inflammation accurately are developed, the analysis of bronchial biopsies will remain a valuable technique for sampling COPD inflammation.</p><p>Roflumilast is effective after only four weeks of treatment, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and longer studies have shown similarly consistent clinical improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Based on these data and other studies that have revealed anti-inflammatory treatment effects over 3 months, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] a treatment period of 16 weeks has been selected as an optimal length of time to collect information on the anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast, while allowing sufficient time for patients to fully recover between interventions. A 6-week single-blind run-in period has been incorporated into the study schedule to assess patients&#x02019; compliance and for reasons of standardization.</p><p>Steps have been taken to reduce factors that contribute to intra- and inter-patient variation when obtaining samples. Work by Gamble et al. has shown that endobronchial biopsies from more than one airway generation should be examined in order to maximize statistical power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; in this study, 2&#x02013;3 endobronchial biopsies will be taken from each lobar and sub-segmental carina. At the same time, consistency between investigators and sites will be ensured by way of centralized training. Sites will also be requested to provide biopsy and sputum samples for quality evaluation before they are allowed to enrol further patients.</p><p>Selecting the most appropriate patient population for bronchial biopsy studies is an important factor. Ethically, it is not appropriate to subject patients in the indicated roflumilast patient population to the procedures required in this study, since it may put them at increased risk. Furthermore, if patients experience exacerbations during the study and require treatment with steroids or antibiotics, it would confound the analysis of the study and make it difficult to ascertain the effects of roflumilast on inflammation. With this in mind, patients with moderate-to-severe COPD (stages II and III) according to GOLD 2009 were chosen for this study. These patients were considered to be stable enough to be subject to bronchoscopy with bronchial biopsy and sputum collection. Although they are not exactly the indicated roflumilast population, it is important to note that roflumilast improves lung function in patients with stable disease too, regardless of exacerbation history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, the study design provides us with a valuable opportunity to obtain information on the effects of roflumilast in patients with more stable disease, who have not previously been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. All patients will continue to receive standard bronchodilator therapy throughout the trial, thereby ethically justifying the placebo arm of the study. Moreover, allowing the use of bronchodilator therapy throughout the trial will also show the effects of roflumilast on top of standard therapy.</p><p>The safety of enrolled patients is another important consideration, especially in an invasive study of this kind. Hattotuwa et al. have shown that fibre optic bronchoscopy with bronchial biopsy are procedures that can be performed in research patients with COPD (even with severe disease), with a low incidence of adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are risks associated with bronchoscopy such as bleeding, discomfort and coughing, although serious adverse events such as lung leak and pneumothorax are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A number of approaches will help to minimize these safety pitfalls in this study. Firstly, bronchoscopies with bronchial biopsies will only be conducted at experienced investigational sites, which have demonstrated that they are able to perform these techniques in a standardized and safe manner, in previous clinical studies. Secondly, standardized procedures will be followed by each site. Thirdly, dedicated safety follow-up visits have been included in the study schedule and fourthly, sputum collection will alternate with bronchoscopy visits to limit the number of interventions performed on any given day. Finally, although class-specific adverse events have been reported in previous clinical studies with roflumilast, the treatment has at the same time proved to be effective in COPD patients with moderate-to-very severe airflow limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, drug-specific adverse events will be closely monitored and recorded throughout the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This bronchial biopsy trial will increase our understanding of the anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast in COPD. Roflumilast reduces COPD exacerbations, but its actions in the lungs, particularly its anti-inflammatory activities, are not well understood. A better comprehension of the effects of roflumilast on inflammatory cells and mediators may help in identifying patients who would benefit most from treatment. It would also improve our understanding of which measurable parameters (e.g. cell counts, activities and mediators) might serve as surrogate predictors for the clinical efficacy of roflumilast.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APAAP: Alkaline phosphatase-anti-phosphatase complex; ATS: American Thoracic Society; COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ERS: European Respiratory Society; FAS: Full analysis set; FEV1: Forced expiratory volume in one second; FVC: Forced vital capacity; GCP: Good clinical practice; GOLD: Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease; ICS: Inhaled corticosteroid; ITT: Intention-to-treat; LABA: Long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist; MAP: Multi-analyte profiling; MCP-1: Monocyte chemotactic protein-1; MMP-9: Matrix metalloproteinase-9; PDE4: Phosphodiesterase-4; TFN&#x003b1;: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha; TIMP: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The study is being funded by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International GmbH.</p><p>N.B. has received lecture and consultancy fees from GlaxoSmithKline, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck Sharp and Dohme, Nycomed/Takeda, Forest Pharmaceuticals, Almirall and Novartis.
