In recent years, ropivacaine has increasingly replaced bupivacaine as a preferred local anesthetic because of its similar analgesic properties, lesser motor blockade, and decreased propensity of cardiotoxicity. Neuraxial adjuvant such as clonidine used in epidural anesthesia offers advantage by augmenting the local anesthetic effect and reducing the anesthetic and analgesic requirement.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims and Objectives:</title><p>Comparison of onset, duration of sensory and motor block, and any adverse effects between 0.5% ropivacaine with normal saline versus 0.5% ropivacaine with clonidine (75 &#x003bc;g/kg).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This prospective randomized study was carried out in 50 patients (25 in each group) of American Society of Anesthesiologist Grade 1 and 2 scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy under epidural block.

However, bupivacaine is one of the most cardiotoxic local anesthetics in current use and motor block is still a problem. Ropivacaine is an amide local anesthetic produced in the pure levorotatory form addresses some of the concerns related to bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] To attain an equal or better potency and to enhance the postoperative analgesic effect, use of adjuvants plays an important role. It has been seen that addition of an adjuvant sometimes enhances the effect of the principle anesthetic agent synergistically. Clonidine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, is one of the main drugs that can be used for this purpose owing to its production as a preservative-free preparation.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of clonidine in terms of hemodynamic stability, ability to achieve and maintain the sensory and motor blockade, minimize the postoperative analgesic requirement, and the side effects when used in combination with ropivacaine in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy.</p><p>For this purpose, a prospective, randomized controlled study was planned in which a total of 50 ASA Grade 1/2 female patients aged 40&#x02013;60 years, scheduled to undergo abdominal hysterectomy, were enrolled as study subjects and randomly allocated to two study groups viz., patients who received epidural 0.75 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine with 20 ml (0.5%) ropivacaine (Group RC) and patients who received epidural 20 ml (0.5%) ropivacaine with normal saline (Group R). All these doses have been reported to be optimum and safe for use as a local anesthetic with or without the use of epinephrine.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The groups were matched for demographic, anthropometric characteristics, and baseline hemodynamic parameters.</p><p>With respect to HR during the study period, statistically no significant differences among groups were observed for the initial part of the study, however, from 30 min onward till 120 min, Group 1 (RC) had significantly lower HR as compared to Group 2 (R alone). In a study by Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] while using clonidine in combination with ropivacaine during epidural block as compared to ropivacaine alone similar variations in HR were observed but at different time intervals. In their study, the addition of 75 &#x003bc;g clonidine to isobaric epidural ropivacaine resulted in longer, complete, and effective analgesia with similar block properties and helped to reduce the effective dose of ropivacaine when compared with plain ropivacaine for cesarean delivery. In our study also we found prolonged analgesia in RC group.</p><p>The pattern of change and intergroup differences observed for BP variables, i.e. SBP and DBP were also similar to those observed for HR with RC groups showing lower mean value and a decremental trend for the major part of the study as compared to an incremental trend and higher mean value for ropivacaine alone group. Clonidine suppresses sympathetic outflow resulting in lower BP. Addition of clonidine either as a fixed dose or as an infusion has been shown to have a lowering effect on arterial pressure as observed in the present study.</p><p>Despite reduction in mean BP levels, no event of hypotension was noticed in any group thus highlighting that the given dosages of adjuvant use of clonidine did not reduce the arterial pressure substantially.</p><p>Clonidine is lipophilic, and as a result is quickly redistributed systemically despite neuraxial injection. It therefore has both central and peripheral effects. At lower doses, the central effects cause sympatholysis leading to hypotension, whereas the peripheral effects at higher doses cause vasoconstriction. Clonidine administered in the low thoracic or lumbar region typically produces BP effects similar to that seen with intravenous administration.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] When given in the mid or upper thoracic regions, epidurally administered clonidine causes an even greater decrease in BP. In the present study, we administered clonidine through lumbar region and obtained a less hypotensive effect of clonidine, which was within the safe limits.</p><p>With respect to onset of motor and sensory block, both the blocks were achieved earlier in Group 1 (RC) as compared to Group 2 (R alone). Similarly, regression of sensory and motor blockade took longer time in Group 1 (RC) as compared to Group 2 (R alone). Group 1 (RC) had significantly shorter onset time and longer regression time for motor and sensory block as compared to Group 2 (R alone). The results are in agreement with the study of Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who observed that addition of clonidine reduces the onset time for blocks and enhance the duration of block when added to ropivacaine.</p><p>With respect to duration of analgesia, Group 1 had significantly longer duration of analgesia as compared to Group 2. Coadministration of clonidine with local anesthetic has been documented to show better analgesia than the drug alone and observations in the present study support the same. The effects of epidurally administered clonidine are seen as early as 20 min after injection, with peak effects occurring in 1 h. The analgesic potency has been described as being comparable to epidurally administered morphine. Adding clonidine as an adjuvant in the epidural space has an additive effect, which results in a lower dose of narcotic necessary for optimal pain control.</p><p>The present study did not have any severe side effect. Dry mouth and nausea/vomiting were the most common side effects observed in both the groups. None of the patient had respiratory depression. Although side effects were minimum in ropivacaine alone group, yet for none of the side effects, a significant intergroup difference was observed. As stated earlier addition of clonidine in the epidural space has an additive effect, which results in a lower dose of narcotic necessary for optimal pain control. As a consequence of which the incidence of respiratory depression is diminished. It has a known side effect of dry mouth as reflected in the present study too though with less potent and significant effect.</p><p>Addition of clonidine enhanced the efficacy of epidurally administered ropivacaine without any potential side effect.</p><p>RC appears well suited to achieve long-lasting nerve blockade without having to resort to adjuvant medications.</p><p>The findings in the present study show that ropivacaine in combination with clonidine provides a hemodynamically stable, faster, and prolonged epidural block and a longer analgesic effect as compared to ropivacaine alone. No potential side effect or bradycardia or hypotensive event took place thus showing that the adjuvant use of clonidine can be done safely.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>On the basis of present study, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p>

</p><p>Duration of analgesia was prolonged in ropivacaine with clonidine group as compared to ropivacaine alone group.

Given the relative superiority of ropivacaine with clonidine as compared to ropivacaine alone, it may be recommended for the use in epidural block in cases of abdominal hysterectomy.</p><sec
