Maintenance therapy is defined as the prolongation of treatment duration or administration of additional treatment at the end of a defined number of initial chemotherapy cycles, after maximum tumor response has been achieved (this may be complete response, partial response, or stable disease). Erlotinib (Tarceva<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) is one of only two treatments approved for use as first-line maintenance therapy by the European Medicines Agency,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ceor-4-031">10</xref> the other being pemetrexed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ceor-4-031">11</xref> The randomized, multicenter, Phase III SATURN (SequentiAl Tarceva in UnResectable NSCLC) study compared first-line maintenance therapy with either erlotinib or placebo (n = 487) following four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ceor-4-031">8</xref> Patients who had not experienced disease progression after initial chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to receive erlotinib 150 mg/day orally + best supportive care or placebo + best supportive care until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ceor-4-031">8</xref> Erlotinib therapy significantly improved progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62&#x02013;0.82; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and overall survival (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70&#x02013;0.95; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0088) in the intent-to-treat population (n = 438)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ceor-4-031">8</xref> and in a subpopulation of patients (n = 252) with stable disease following initial first-line chemotherapy (progression-free survival HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.56&#x02013;0.83; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; overall survival HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59&#x02013;0.89; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0019<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ceor-4-031">8</xref>). The survival benefits observed following erlotinib maintenance therapy in patients with mutated epidermal growth factor receptor and patients with wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor were also achieved without significantly compromising tolerability or health-related quality of life. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of erlotinib versus best supportive care when used as first-line maintenance therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and stable disease following first-line therapy in three European countries, ie, France, Germany, and Italy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of erlotinib, an economic decision model was developed using patient data on progression-free survival and overall survival for erlotinib and best supportive care as first-line maintenance therapy from the SATURN trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ceor-4-031">8</xref></p><sec><title>Model structure</title><p>An area under the curve (or partitioned survival) model was developed consisting of three health states, ie, progression-free survival, progression, and death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ceor-4-031">Figure 1</xref>). Survival data from the trial were used to follow patients from the progression-free survival to the progression and death states, and allowed for extrapolation of the data beyond the trial period. The model uses the stable disease population, as indicated in the European Union label,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ceor-4-031">12</xref> to calculate efficacy and the same dose as was used in the trial, ie, erlotinib 150 mg/day orally + best supportive care or placebo + best supportive care. The area under the curve model works by assuming that, at any discrete time point, the difference between the proportion of patients in overall survival and the proportion of patients in progression-free survival determines the proportion of patients who have experienced disease progression. At the start of the analysis, it was assumed that all patients were in the progression-free survival health state. A half-cycle correction is used to account for events that occur during each monthly cycle. The time horizon of 5 years can be considered to be a lifetime perspective in this patient population (after 5 years, virtually all patients will have died).</p><p>The model was developed from the perspective of the national health care payer in three European countries, ie, France, Germany, and Italy; therefore, indirect costs, including travel costs, and costs to other public agencies were not included. Costs and health benefits were discounted by 3.5% for each country.</p><p>Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the impact of changes in the key input parameters and assumptions on the results of the base-case analysis. Distributions around the following parameters were used to reflect uncertainty in the model (ie, the probability of erlotinib being cost-effective): estimates for the parametric progression-free survival and overall survival functions, and cost and frequency of adverse events. No distributions were applied for drug prices and administration costs.</p><p>Adverse events were selected for inclusion in the model by grade of severity and frequency of occurrence by event and treatment arm, according to the following rules: all treatment-related adverse events grade 3&#x02013;4, and adverse events that occurred from the start of the study and 28 days after the last cycle of first-line treatment inclusively. The frequency of each event was further categorized into the number of patients experiencing at least one adverse event. The maximum number of adverse event episodes was also calculated. These values were used for calculating the average number of each adverse event per patient (eg, probability of a specified adverse event per patient &#x000d7; average number of episodes of adverse event per patient).</p><p>The model does not include post-progression-free survival treatments (following disease progression) once maintenance therapy is stopped, because it was not designed to incorporate this information. Therefore, second-line and further-line treatment costs, capturing the various treatment strategies used following progression, were not accounted for within the model. This was due to the variation in second-line treatment observed in the SATURN study; uncontrolled patients received multiple therapies after disease progression, which included taxanes (eg, docetaxel), antimetabolites (eg, pemetrexed), anti-neoplastic agents, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, erlotinib), and platinum compounds. In addition, insufficient data were reported in the SATURN study on second-line treatment dosing and duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Model inputs</title><p>Survival curves were fitted parametrically to the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier progression-free survival and overall survival curves to facilitate extrapolation beyond the clinical trial period.

Therefore, these functions were used in all analyses to estimate and extrapolate progression-free survival and overall survival beyond the clinical trial period.</p><p>The cost of erlotinib was incorporated into the model using the country-specific list price of a pack of 30 &#x000d7; 150 mg tablets (&#x020ac;2130.00, &#x020ac;2928.24, and &#x020ac;1864.57 for France, Germany, and Italy, respectively) and was applied in the base-case analysis for the average treatment duration during the clinical trial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ceor-4-031">Table 1</xref>). As per the study protocol, patients received a single daily dose of erlotinib 150 mg orally. In order to calculate the monthly cost of erlotinib, the cost per 150 mg tablet (&#x020ac;71.00, &#x020ac;83.63, and &#x020ac;49.10, respectively) was multiplied by the average number of days per month (30.4 days, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ceor-4-031">Table 1</xref>). To estimate the resource use associated with administration of erlotinib, the appropriate reference costs associated with administration of oral medication in the pharmacy were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ceor-4-031">Table 1</xref>).

In view of the current poor survival outcomes in metastatic NSCLC, it is of interest to consider the cost per life-year gained with a new therapy. An increase in health care expenditure in cancer care makes cost-effectiveness analysis an important tool for national health care payers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ceor-4-031">26</xref> This is the first analysis of its kind to present a cross-market analysis of cost per life-year gained for first-line maintenance therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.</p><p>In each country, erlotinib resulted in a survival gain when compared with best supportive care.

The methods of extrapolation are also similar to those commonly suggested by the health economic community,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ceor-4-031">18</xref> as well as the modeling methods widely reported in peer-reviewed publications.</p><p>Despite the strengths of the model, it is important to recognize any associated limitations. The model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treatment in the first-line maintenance setting only. Therefore, second-line treatment costs were not accounted for within the model. This was due to a variety of second-line and further-line treatments reported in the SATURN trial and insufficient data reported on treatment dosing and duration.</p><p>Pemetrexed, a multitargeted antifolate chemotherapeutic agent, is the only other therapy approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in first-line maintenance for metastatic NSCLC (in patients with non-squamous disease).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ceor-4-031">11</xref> In the JMEN trial,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ceor-4-031">27</xref> pemetrexed was associated with similar efficacy benefits versus best supportive care (progression-free survival HR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.42&#x02013;0.61; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ceor-4-031">27</xref> as erlotinib versus best supportive care in the SATURN trial.</p><p>In a population-matched, indirect comparison analysis comparing erlotinib and pemetrexed as first-line maintenance therapy in metastatic NSCLC, both treatments were found to be similarly efficacious (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ceor-4-031">Table 3</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ceor-4-031">23</xref> An economic analysis of pemetrexed versus best supportive care in the US market showed that the cost per life-year gained using pemetrexed first-line maintenance therapy versus best supportive care in patients with advanced, non-squamous NSCLC was US$122,371 (&#x020ac;86,869).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ceor-4-031">22</xref> The analysis suggests that pemetrexed is not cost-effective compared with best supportive care, given the cost-effectiveness ratios for medication typically reimbursed in the US, while our analysis shows that erlotinib is cost-effective when compared with best supportive care (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ceor-4-031">Table 3</xref>). However, it is difficult to compare the cost-effectiveness of erlotinib and pemetrexed using the results of these three analyses. Pemetrexed was only efficacious in a non-squamous population and erlotinib was efficacious in both the intent-to-treat and stable disease populations. Patient distributions of key characteristics between the SATURN and JMEN studies were not balanced. The adenocarcinoma population varied by 3%, the number of patients with stage IIIb and IV disease varied by 8% between the two trials for both disease stages, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status varied by 9% for both 0 and 1. Patients in the JMEN trial had a better prognosis at baseline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ceor-4-031">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ceor-4-031">27</xref> Furthermore, drug costs in the US and Europe are different.</p><p>If a cost-effectiveness analysis of erlotinib versus pemetrexed were to be performed, the comparable efficacy of erlotinib and pemetrexed derived from the indirect comparison analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ceor-4-031">23</xref> would make drug costs the key driver. Monthly costs of erlotinib and pemetrexed comprising administration, acquisition, and adverse event costs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ceor-4-031">Table 3</xref>) derived from a manuscript in press<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ceor-4-031">28</xref> (published in part at a recent scientific conference<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ceor-4-031">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ceor-4-031">25</xref>) show erlotinib has lower monthly per-patient treatment costs. Based on these costs, a cost-effectiveness analysis of erlotinib versus pemetrexed might be expected to show that erlotinib is as efficacious as pemetrexed but less costly. However, the results would need to be interpreted with caution, given the imbalance in the key characteristics of patient populations between the SATURN and JMEN trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ceor-4-031">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ceor-4-031">27</xref></p><p>Given that erlotinib is cost-effective versus best supportive care based on this economic analysis, and has efficacy similar to that of pemetrexed at a lower cost, it could become the new standard of care in first-line maintenance therapy in locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC.
