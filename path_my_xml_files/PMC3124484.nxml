Lastly, after all other analysis had been done and conclusions drawn, analyses for the effect of drug-level were performed.</p><p>An explorative analysis (not protocol specified) included the natural log of the ratio between the total cortisol AUC measured after intervention and the total cortisol AUC measured before the intervention (ln(deltaAUC)), the treatment indicator and the design variables. Ln(deltaAUC) followed the Gaussian distribution with good approximation. We first analysed if there was a treatment effect of this outcome measure in a regression analysis including ln(deltaAUC) and the treatment indicator (I). Then we examined if any of the design variables interacted with the treatment. Each analysis included ln(deltaAUC), the treatment indicator (I), one design variable (D) and I&#x0002a;D.</p><p>Explorative analyses were also done using a mixed model see e.g. Sullivan et al. <xref rid="pone.0021224-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and Winkel et Zhang <xref rid="pone.0021224-Winkel1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The modeling program (R-program) not including the intervention indicator was developed using the p-cortisol data measured at the start of the trial. The intervention indicator was then included (see below) in this program, which was applied on the p-cortisol values measured in the two intervention groups at the end of the trial.</p><p>Initial analyses showed that it was necessary to use logarithmic values to obtain homogeneity of variance. The p-cortisol was measured 17 times in each subject. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021224-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the mean of ln(p-cortisol/unit) as a function of time in each of the two groups. It appears that the relationship between mean values and time (t) is linear with reasonable approximation within each of the intervals [1&#x02264;t&#x02264;5], [6&#x02264;t&#x02264;9] and [10&#x02264;t&#x02264;17] in the following referred to as A, B and C, respectively. The model is as follows:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0021224.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>where a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h are coefficients (&#x02018;fixed effects&#x02019;), to be estimated. IA is an indicator equal to 1, if t is within the time interval A and 0 otherwise. IB and IC are similarly defined; a is an intercept, b is the common slope of p-cortisol as a function of time. The indicators define the level of each of the three linear functions corresponding to the above-defined three time intervals. The interaction (symbolized by &#x02018;:&#x02019;) between t and the indicators serve to modify the slope of each of the three linear functions relative to the common slope b.</p><p>Significant reductions of the variability were obtained by supplementing the model with random effects (subject specific coefficients) corresponding to all of the above fixed effects.</p><p>An analysis of the variance of the residuals showed inhomogeneity of the variances in that the variance was not the same in the three groups defined by the three time intervals This effect was therefore included in the final model. The residuals were not significantly correlated.</p><p>Using the subject specific random effects in conjunction with the fixed effects personalized models of the p-cortisol versus time curve may be developed and used to follow a subject as his/her own control.</p><p>In the present context we utilized the model by introducing an intervention indicator (arm) in it (main effect and interactions, i.e. the terms arm, arm:t, arm:IA arm:IB etc were added to the model). We then tested if any of the corresponding coefficients differed significantly from 0 to see if the intervention influenced the three linear functions in any way.</p><p>In correlation analyses where the data did not follow Gaussian distributions we used the Friedman non-parametric test in place of the Pearson correlation test.</p><p>All analyses of the primary outcome were performed using cases without any missing values (complete case analysis), as well as using all cases completed by multiple imputation analysis of missing area under the curve of the DEX-CRH test (SAS version 9.1) <xref rid="pone.0021224-Knorr2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The following quantities were included in the multiple imputations: age, sex, BMI-1, HAMD-1, HAMD-2, nScale-1, nScale-2, NEON-1, NEON-2, YearEducation, corAUCtotal-1, corAUCtotal-2, salivaryCorAUCtotal-1, salivaryCorAUCtotal-2, ActhAUCtotal-1, ActhAUCtotal-2, and Intervention. To normalize the quantities during the imputations the following transformations were done: age, BMI-1, and all areas were log transformed, HAMD-1 and HAMD-2, nScale-1, and nScale-2 were square root transformed. The transformations y1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1/NEON-1<sup>2</sup> and y2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1/1/NEON-1<sup>2</sup> were used to transform NEON-1 and NEON-2.

Thus, our hypothesis that an intervention with escitalopram 10 mg would decrease the cortisol response in DEX-CRH test in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with MDD was not supported. Further, no statistically significant effect was found on any other measure of the DEX-CRH test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021224-t004">Table 4</xref>). Post-hoc analyses showed that increasing levels of escitalopram tended to decrease the HPA-response in the DEX-CRH test and this effect increased with age.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Advantages of the trial</title><p>The AGENDA trial has several advantages. Firstly, the trial and the analyses were carried out as planned in advance and the completion and compliance in the trial was very high. Secondly, the registered diagnosis of depression for the probands was verified by a face-to-face psychiatric research interview by trained medical doctors. The participants were assessed and diagnosed by validated and frequently used multi-dimensional methods. Thirdly, the participants were genetically homogeneous as all were ethnic Danes with European, mostly Danish, parents and grandparents. Fourthly, we used well established methods, e.g., the DEX-CRH test which is a sensitive, biological, objective test to detect increased HPA-function in humans <xref rid="pone.0021224-Ising1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021224-Heuser1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The response to the DEX-CRH test may be sensitive to age <xref rid="pone.0021224-Heuser1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and sex <xref rid="pone.0021224-Kunugi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and in our trial, stratification by these factors resulted in equal distributions in the two intervention groups. Fifthly, the participants were studied in a randomized clinical trial blinded in all phases including the statistical analyses and conclusion phase. The blinding was successful in relation to participants as well as researchers. Finally, the antidepressant effect of escitalopram is generally accepted <xref rid="pone.0021224-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and the participants were subjected to four weeks of intervention thus including the interval in which clinical improvement has been reported in trials with patients with MDD <xref rid="pone.0021224-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations</title><p>We have not compared healthy individuals with a family history of MDD to healthy individuals without a family history of MDD. However, the participants included in the present trial presented with values of CorAUC<sub>total</sub> in the initial DEX-CRH test before intervention, (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021224-t002">Table 2</xref> (12,005&#x000b1;15,506 nmol/l&#x000d7;min/l)) that were higher than values found among healthy individuals without a family history of MDD in the study by Modell <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0021224-Modell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> (7,773&#x000b1;1,071 nmol/l&#x000d7;min/l) and approaching the values for healthy individuals with a family history of MDD in that study (15064&#x000b1;3947 nmol/l&#x000d7;min/l), suggesting that participants included in our trial were comparable to the participants with a family history of depression in the Modell study. Notably, our results showed rather large intra- and interindividual variation in the baseline cortisol response to the DEX-CRH test as well in the change in the cortisol response from start to end of intervention, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021224-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021224-t004">4</xref>. It cannot be excluded that the quality of the detective methods in the DEX-CRH test as well as the heterogeneity of the individuals included in the trial may have added to the increase in the variability of the DEX-CRH response. For example, the experimental situation of the DEX-CRH test may influence individuals in different ways resulting in a variation of the DEX-CRH response. However, this was a randomized trial and such unknown confounders ought to be evenly distributed between the escitalopram and the placebo group.</p><p>We cannot exclude that the dosage of 10 mg escitalopram was too low. However, this dosage has been suggested as the optimum dose for treatment of moderate depression <xref rid="pone.0021224-Bech2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and it resulted in well-known adverse effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021224-t003">Table 3</xref>), thus a substantial proportion of the participants in the escitalopram group reported sexual adverse effects. Notably, insomnia was decreased in the escitalopram group.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Risk of errors</title><p>The risk of errors in trials falls in three major categories <xref rid="pone.0021224-Gluud1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021224-Gluud2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>: 1) <italic>Systematic error (&#x02018;bias&#x02019;)</italic>: We have minimized bias by using a randomized, age-and sex-stratified, comparison with blinding in all phases of the trial. 2) <italic>Random error (&#x02018;play of chance&#x02019;)</italic>: We planned to include 80 participants due to resources, feasibility, and availability of the healthy first-degree relatives of patients with MDD studied in our group. Since no prior trials have investigated the effect of SSRI on healthy individuals, the power calculations were hypothetical and influenced by great uncertainty. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility of overlooking a difference due to the play of chance. However, in the era of systematic reviews it has been questioned if the size of an individual trial still does matter <xref rid="pone.0021224-Gluud1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The results from any trial may contribute to the larger body of evidence despite arbitrary sample size calculations in the individual trial that may eventually prevent important trials from being conducted <xref rid="pone.0021224-Guyatt1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. 3) <italic>Design errors</italic>: These errors may include that some participants may not have reached sufficient levels of escitalopram in the blood in order to produce an effect on the HPA-axis. Our serum escitalopram concentrations were lower than in a study by Soegaard <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0021224-Sogaard1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, who found steady state plasma escitalopram concentrations of 63&#x000b1;32 nmol/l for escitalopram 10 mg as compared to 50&#x000b1;29 nmol/l in our trial. The low plasma levels in our trial may be a result of the fact that approximately 12 hours elapsed from taking the last tablet to blood sampling and that the half-life of escitalopram is 27&#x02013;32 hours. However, a therapeutic plasma interval level has never been clearly defined for escitalopram. The intervention time is considered to be appropriate since clinical improvement is seen within this time, however it cannot be excluded that an effect of escitalopram could be detected in a trial with longer duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Generalizability, clinical implication and future studies</title><p>Our participants were healthy, ethnic Danes, with a parent or a sibling who was treated for depression in a hospital setting in Denmark. Our results may generalize to healthy Caucasians in general. To infer direct clinical implications from the results were not an aim of our trial, but effects by escitalopram 10 mg on the primary outcome for the HPA-axis function in healthy was not detected. Future studies may explore individuals in prodromal phases of depressive disorder or establish a run in period to optimize adherence to protocols. Further, the distinction between healthy participants with and without increased familial risk for MDD needs further exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Interpretation</title><p>Considering advantages, disadvantages, risk of errors, and generalizability of the findings in this trial, it is likely that the results reflect reality. Thus, activation of the monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems by escitalopram does not seem to substantially affect the HPA-axis as measured by the DEX-CRH test in healthy individuals with a family history of depression. This finding seems to indicate that intervention with SSRI does not reduce the response to stress, as induced by CRH in the DEX-CRH test, in first-degree relatives. Our finding is in accordance with recent data showing that restoration of HPA system dysfunction seems to be neither a necessary nor a sufficient determinant for an acute treatment response in depressed patients <xref rid="pone.0021224-Schule1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Taken together these findings suggest that dysregulation of the HPA-axis, as assessed by the DEX-CRH test, does not play a <italic>primary</italic> role in the mechanisms of action of SSRIs. The HPA dysregulation seen in depressed patients may rather represent the down stream effects of other, more primary abnormalities as suggested by Manji <italic>et al.</italic>

The results did not show a statistically significant difference in &#x00394;CorAUC<sub>total</sub> in the DEX-CRH test between escitalopram 10 mg and placebo given for four weeks. Further, the results showed large intra- and inter-individual differences in the response to the DEX-CRH test. Increasing drug levels of escitalopram was associated with a decrease in the HPA-response of the DEX-CRH test and this association increased with age.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>UK, AH, PW, CG, and JW declare no competing interests.
