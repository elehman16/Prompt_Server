However, accumulating adult and pediatric data suggest that excessive fluid administration is associated with worse patient outcomes and even increased risk of death. The optimal amount of intravascular fluid required in early pediatric septic shock resuscitation prior to the initiation of vasoactive support remains unanswered.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The SQUEEZE Pilot Trial is a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, open-label, prospective pilot randomized controlled trial. Participants are children aged 29&#x000a0;days to under&#x000a0;18 years with suspected or confirmed septic shock and a need for ongoing resuscitation. Eligible participants are enrolled under an exception to consent process and randomly assigned via concealed allocation to either the Usual Care (control) or Fluid Sparing (intervention) resuscitation strategy. The primary objective of this pilot trial is to determine feasibility, based on the ability to enroll participants and to adhere to the study protocol. The primary outcome measure by which success will be determined is participant enrollment rate ("pass" defined as at least two participants/site/month, recognizing that enrollment may be slower during the run-in phase). Secondary objectives include assessing (1) appropriateness of eligibility criteria, and (2) completeness of clinical outcomes to inform the endpoints for the planned multisite trial. To support the nested translational study, SQUEEZE-D, we will also evaluate the feasibility of describing cell-free DNA (a procoagulant molecule with prognostic utility) in blood samples obtained from children enrolled into the SQUEEZE Pilot Trial at baseline and at 24&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The optimal degree of fluid resuscitation and the timing of initiation of vasoactive support in order to achieve recommended therapeutic targets in children with septic shock remains unanswered. No prospective study to date has examined this important question for children in developed countries including Canada. Recruitment for the SQUEEZE Pilot Trial opened on 6 January 2014. Findings will inform the feasibility of the planned multicenter trial to answer our overall research question.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01973907">NCT01973907</ext-link>, registered on 23 October 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1689-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fluid therapy</kwd><kwd>Resuscitation</kwd><kwd>Shock</kwd><kwd>Sepsis</kwd><kwd>Pediatrics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008360</institution-id><institution>Hamilton Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIF 12307</award-id><award-id>Not Applicable</award-id><award-id>RFA-2013 Fox-Robichaud</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Melissa J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fox-Robichaud</surname><given-names>Alison</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000014</institution-id><institution>Canadian Blood Services</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIHRPA201309-MP-322414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Melissa J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIHRPA201309-MP-322414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Melissa J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000066</institution-id><institution>Canadian Child Health Clinician Scientist Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale</title><p>Septic shock remains one of the most significant and potentially preventable causes of death in children worldwide, with pediatric mortality rates ranging from 15 to 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current pediatric Surviving Sepsis Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] from the American College of Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) emphasize an early and goal-directed approach to resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These guidelines suggest that fluid resuscitation should be aggressive with repeated intravenously (IV) administered fluid boluses of 20&#x000a0;mL/kg, such that some children may require as much as 200&#x000a0;mL/kg of fluid to achieve therapeutic endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The guidelines also recommend initiation of vasoactive agents at the stage of &#x0201c;fluid-refractory shock,&#x0201d; i.e., when there is persistent hypoperfusion despite at least 60&#x000a0;mL/kg IV fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While evidence suggests that adhering to the resuscitation goals and guidelines of the ACCM may improve mortality and functional morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], fluid resuscitation guidelines from the ACCM were derived primarily from observational studies and expert opinion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Aggressive fluid administration in septic shock has recently been called into question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Accumulating adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and pediatric data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] suggest that excessive fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This has sparked a furious debate in both the adult and pediatric medical literature on how &#x0201c;aggressive&#x0201d; fluid resuscitation should be, given that the main morbidity and mortality in septic shock is due not to refractory hypotension, but to end-organ failure due in part to massive fluid overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The overall objective of our research program is, therefore, to evaluate whether a fluid-sparing strategy, that involves earlier initiation and preferential escalation of vasoactive medications to achieve ACCM goal-directed targets, results in improved clinical outcomes for children experiencing septic shock.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Relevant medical literature</title><p>Mortality in pediatric septic shock has significantly improved since the introduction of rapid fluid resuscitation in the first &#x0201c;golden&#x0201d; hour of resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Subsequent improvements in pediatric septic shock survival have been attributed to adherence to the first iteration of the ACCM septic shock guidelines, and the use of goal-directed targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the largest and most publicized pediatric trial of fluid resuscitation in children with suspected septic shock (FEAST trial), published in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> in 2011, demonstrated an increased mortality among children treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation in comparison to the conservative fluid resuscitation arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These results sparked a flurry of commentaries and attempts to explain these unexpected findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The FEAST trial was conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, and enrolled a significant proportion of children with malaria. As a result, the pediatric critical care community clearly acknowledges that these results, while important, are not necessarily generalizable to developed countries such as Canada. These results did, however, fuel further discussion and debate regarding the optimum fluid resuscitation in the course of goal-directed therapy in septic shock.</p><p>Emerging publications in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) medical literature suggest that excessive, compared to conservative, fluid administration in adults with septic shock worsens outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], complications related to the third-spacing of fluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], length of ICU stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recent systematic reviews reveal a paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence, other than the FEAST trial, examining the impact of fluid resuscitation on mortality in children with septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This raises the important question of whether children in developed countries would also benefit from fluid-sparing resuscitation. A goal-directed fluid-sparing strategy would, by default, require earlier initiation and preferential escalation of vasoactive medications to target ACCM hemodynamic goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There are potential adverse effects attributable to the earlier initiation of vasoactive medications that may outweigh those resulting from an aggressive fluid administration strategy, providing further justification for this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The optimal degree of fluid resuscitation and the timing of initiation of vasoactive support in order to achieve therapeutic targets in children with septic shock remain unanswered. No prospective study to date has examined this important question for children in developed countries including Canada.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Overall research question</title><p>In pediatric patients with septic shock, does a fluid-sparing strategy to achieve ACCM therapeutic goals result in improved clinical outcomes without an increased risk of adverse events compared to the usual care of aggressive fluid resuscitation, as currently recommended by the ACCM guidelines?</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pilot trial primary research question</title><p>Is it feasible to conduct a multicentre trial using this protocol?</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Explanation for choice of comparators</title><p>There is currently not clinical equipoise to randomize children with septic shock to a &#x0201c;No bolus&#x0201d; intervention.

</p><p>The SQUEEZE Pilot Trial includes a nested translational study, SQUEEZE-D. The overall objective of SQUEEZE-D is to describe the levels of plasma cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) in pediatric septic shock. cfDNA is released by activated neutrophils and is a potent trigger of blood coagulation. In adult patients with severe sepsis, cfDNA has high discriminative power to predict ICU mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The primary objective of SQUEEZE-D in the context of the pilot trial is to evaluate the feasibility of describing cfDNA in blood samples obtained for clinical purposes at baseline and 24&#x000a0;h in children enrolled in the SQUEEZE Pilot Trial. The secondary objectives of SQUEEZE-D are to determine (1) the availability of the required samples from patients enrolled in SQUEEZE and (2) the process, resource, and management aspects of feasibility which impact upon the ability to process and test samples to inform the design of a larger-scale study.

<sup>a</sup>Bolus: a (fluid) bolus is a discrete volume of fluid prescribed to be administered intravascularly (intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO)) over a defined period of time (ranging from stat, i.e., as fast as possible to <italic>typically</italic> no greater than 60&#x000a0;min). A fluid bolus <italic>typically</italic> ranges in size from usually not less than 5&#x000a0;mL/kg (250&#x000a0;mL for participants &#x02265;50&#x000a0;kg) to 20&#x000a0;mL/kg (1&#x000a0;L for participants &#x02265;50&#x000a0;kg, although some clinicians may use per kilogram dosing in larger patients). A documented medical order is required for a fluid bolus. Routine fluid replacement is not considered to be bolus(es)</p><p>

In the Fluid Sparing arm, a fluid bolus record requires the medical team to provide justification for any fluid boluses administered to the participant. Data will be reviewed in light of the assigned intervention and any protocol deviations will be documented. Study process feasibility includes protocol adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We will document and report the following protocol deviations: failure to (1) implement study procedures within 1&#x000a0;h of randomization, (2) prescribe fluid boluses in accordance with protocol, (3) prescribe vasoactive medications in accordance with protocol, and (4) provide notification of enrollment to the participant or SDM per protocol. The importance of protocol adherence will be routinely reinforced. There will be no restrictions with respect to concomitant care and interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>Pilot trial outcomes are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The proposed primary outcome for the full study is <italic>time to shock-reversal</italic>. We have defined time to shock-reversal as the amount of time (in hours) from allocation until shock is reversed. <italic>Shock-reversal</italic> is defined based on the ACCM therapeutic targets, when all of the following criteria have been met:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Free from all vasoactive medication support</p></list-item><list-item><p>Normalization of HR (above the 5th, and below the 95th percentile for age)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Normalization of blood pressure (SBP and MBP above the 5th percentile for age)</p></list-item><list-item><p>CR &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;s</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Shock-reversal criteria will be assessed as documented in the medical record. Shock will not be determined to be reversed unless the patient has been free from vasoactive infusions for 24&#x000a0;h. If a participant is placed on mechanical circulatory support, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or if death occurs during the intervention phase, shock will be coded as &#x0201c;never reversed.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Measurement of cfDNA (SQUEEZE-D)</title><p>The citrated plasma tube (CPT) used for determination of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is the same collection tube used for cfDNA.

We will consider adjusting the pilot trial sample size upward to provide an opportunity for the new site(s) to recruit sufficient subjects to allow for assessment of external feasibility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Screening and recruitment</title><p>Patients will be screened for eligibility from the following patient care areas: emergency department, medical and surgical wards, and the Pediatric Critical Care Unit (PCCU). Posters and information sessions will be used to promote the study to physician and nursing staff, and trainees. The research coordinator and/or PI will be paged for any potentially eligible patient, e.g., suspected sepsis, receiving a fluid bolus. If/when a patient is screened and determined to meet study eligibility criteria, and provided there is no objection by the MRP or their delegate, the randomization procedures will be executed immediately and the patient enrolled. This trial will use an exception to consent (deferred consent) process (see &#x0201c;Ethical Considerations&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, participant enrollment, and communication of participant assignment</title><p>The allocation sequence will be created by the Biostatistics Unit and this information will be kept secret from, and inaccessible by, the investigators.

Fluid resuscitation is a hot topic in need of rigorous study to inform optimal patient care. Our research aims to fill this gap with high-quality evidence. Resuscitation trials face unique challenges, given that interventions are frequently time-sensitive in vulnerable patients. This is certainly true of our study and supports the need for an initial pilot trial to evaluate feasibility prior to proceeding with a larger study. Pilot trials also offer an opportunity to test and refine trial processes and procedures before embarking on a more costly and complex endeavor.</p><p>Making our trial pragmatic was a priority to best reflect how the intervention would work in day-to-day practice. For this reason the trial contains very few exclusion criteria and, apart from these, aims to enroll all children with persistent signs of shock in the setting of suspected or proven infection. We recognize and accept that &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; for some study participants, such as those with premorbid cardiac conditions or renal impairment, may approach that of the intervention strategy. However, randomization should lead to these and other patients with analogous circumstances being evenly distributed between the study arms in any large-scale trial. Also pragmatic, we suggest that clinicians follow the ACCM guidelines for treatments apart from those impacted by the study intervention; however, we do not rigidly require guideline adherence. Some elements of the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines are currently under debate as a result of recent high-profile publications while others are in the process of being studied. Of particular note, the PROCESS, ARISE, and PROMISE trials challenge (in adults) the utility of aggressive treatment to meet ACCM goals such as central venous pressure (CVP) and hemoglobin targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, we do not consider these recent publications a threat to our investigation. Rather, evidence supporting a move away from aggressively targeting measures, such as CVP, actually supports adherence to our fluid-sparing intervention. Changing attitudes towards other targets, such as transfusion thresholds, should also be evenly distributed between groups as is expected for both known and unknown confounders.</p><p>A number of considerations went into defining the study intervention. Without doubt a large volume of fluid may be administered in the initial stages of septic shock resuscitation prior to the initiation of vasoactive support. Early initiation of vasoactive support was the only acceptable way to mitigate this, with permissive hypotension the alternative. In children, hypotension is a late clinical finding and we expect that inaction in the face of hypotension would be unacceptable to any clinicians providing care for children with septic shock (including our team). An important caveat, however, is that physiologically adequate end-organ perfusion and age-based blood pressure targets are not necessarily one in the same. Nonetheless, the ACCM currently defines goal-directed hemodynamic targets by age &#x02013; at least during the early stages of resuscitation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While the early initiation of vasoactive medications could define the intervention alone, we felt that this was likely insufficient to result in meaningful fluid sparing among any participants but those with the mildest cases of septic shock. To be effective, a fluid-sparing intervention likely requires an ongoing strategy to limit fluid administration after vasoactive support has been initiated.</p><p>We also sought to define our control arm pragmatically while being mindful of the need to achieve between-group separation. Consistent with the ACCM guidelines, we request that vasoactive support not be initiated in participants randomized to the Usual Care arm until at least 60&#x000a0;mL/kg (3&#x000a0;L for patients &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;kg) of isotonic fluid boluses has been administered from the time of shock onset. We expect between-group separation to be potentially challenging to evaluate, given the small pilot trial sample size and resulting increased risk of imbalance in potentially important confounders such as illness severity. Depending on the nature of these findings, further modifications to the study inclusion criteria and/or the intervention may be required.</p><p>The planned primary outcome for the definitive trial is time to shock-reversal. We consider time to shock-reversal a clinically meaningful outcome since this measure is objective and impacts the need for critical care resources. While we will measure and report PICU Length of Stay, this outcome may be influenced by a host of factors apart from the patient&#x02019;s condition, rendering it less useful. Another candidate primary outcome is organ dysfunction, as measured by PELOD-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. While we will report mortality data, mortality is not an appropriate or feasible primary outcome for many pediatric trials due to high survivorship in children compared to adults for many conditions and a comparatively smaller number of available participants.</p><p>We expect that one of the most contentious aspects of this study will be our use of an exception to consent process. Considering the rapid rate at which septic shock resuscitation unfolds, as well as the life-threatening emergency nature of the situation, it is impracticable to seek prospective informed consent and any attempt to do so would risk coercion. Early enrollment in the course of resuscitation is also required from a scientific perspective to achieve a meaningful impact of the intervention. We are genuinely interested in SDM experiences with the exception to consent process and research is also underway to evaluate this specifically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>The optimal degree of fluid resuscitation and the timing of initiation of vasoactive support in order to achieve therapeutic targets in children with septic shock remain unanswered. In their systematic review Ford et al. concluded &#x0201c;The most important direction for future research is the applicability of the findings of the FEAST trial to other populations and settings&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. SQUEEZE will help to answer this very question in children with access to advanced critical care in countries such as Canada. The pilot trial described herein represents the first step in achieving this aim.</p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Trial status</title><p>Active recruitment at the time of manuscript submission.
