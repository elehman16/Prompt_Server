Papua New Guinean children experience high rates of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization within weeks of birth, predisposing them to pneumococcal disease. In a trial to determine the safety and immunogenicity of early infant vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV), we investigated the impact of early schedules on pneumococcal carriage.</p><p>Infants were randomized at birth to receive 7vPCV in a 0&#x02013;1&#x02013;2-month (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;101) or a 1&#x02013;2&#x02013;3-month (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;105) schedule or no 7vPCV (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;106). All children received 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at age 9&#x000a0;months. We cultured nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected at ages 1, 2, 3, 4&#x000a0;weeks and 3, 9, 18&#x000a0;months, and middle ear discharge if present. Pneumococcal serotypes were identified by the Quellung reaction.</p><p>A total of 1761 NPS were cultured. The prevalence of pneumococcal carriage was 22% at 1&#x000a0;week of age, rising to 80% by age 3&#x000a0;months and remained &#x0003e;70% thereafter, with high-density carriage in 42% of pneumococcus-positive samples. We identified 63 different serotypes; 43% of isolates from controls were 13vPCV serotypes. There were no significant differences in 7vPCV serotype carriage between 7vPCV recipients and controls at any age (22% vs. 31% at 9&#x000a0;months, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.2). At age 9&#x000a0;months the prevalence of non-7vPCV carriage was 17% higher in 7vPCV recipients (48%) than in controls (25%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). More non-7vPCV serotypes were isolated from ear discharge in 16 7vPCV recipients than from 4 controls (48% vs. 25%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.13).</p><p>The limited impact of neonatal or accelerated infant 7vPCV schedules on vaccine serotype carriage is probably due to the early onset of dense carriage of a broad range of pneumococcal serotypes. While serotype-independent pneumococcal vaccines are needed in high-risk populations, the underlying environmental factors and sources of infection must be investigated.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00219401" id="ir005">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00219401</ext-link>.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Papua New Guinea</kwd><kwd><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic></kwd><kwd>Carriage</kwd><kwd>7-Valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</kwd><kwd>Pneumococcal serotype</kwd><kwd>Neonate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Pneumonia is the most common cause of death in children worldwide <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus) is a major cause of pneumonia as well as other invasive diseases such as meningitis and bacteraemia. It is also responsible for non-invasive diseases such as otitis media (OM) which can result in hearing loss <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Nasopharyngeal carriage of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> predisposes individuals to pneumococcal diseases; early carriage in infants is associated with increased risk of OM and is found in populations with a high incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the highlands of Papua New Guinea (PNG), colonization of the nasopharynx starts within weeks of birth, with all infants acquiring <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> by 3&#x000a0;months of age and high carriage rates being maintained throughout childhood <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Pneumonia remains the most common cause of death and reason for hospitalization in childhood in PNG <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Mortality due to acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), in particular pneumonia, was reported in 1999 to be highest in the first year of life, with 56% of deaths in children under the age of five years occurring before six months of age <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have been used to combat pneumococcal disease in infants. A protein carrier is linked to an otherwise T cell-independent polysaccharide antigen to evoke an immunological response and enhance long-term memory to serotypes included in the vaccines. The introduction and widespread use of PCVs in first world countries has resulted in a significant decline in nasopharyngeal carriage and IPDs caused by vaccine serotypes in children under the age of 2&#x000a0;years. PCVs also indirectly protect unvaccinated people through herd immunity <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Encouraging results have also been seen in third world settings where PCVs have been trialled <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. PCV given at ages 6, 10 and 14&#x000a0;weeks in third world countries and 2, 4 and 6&#x000a0;months with a booster in the second year of life in first world countries are immunogenic and reduce nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcal serotypes included in PCVs <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition, a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has previously been shown to reduce pneumonia mortality in PNG children when given between the ages of 6&#x000a0;months and 5&#x000a0;years <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, in populations where carriage occurs within weeks of birth and where morbidity and mortality due to ALRI are highest in the first 6&#x000a0;months of life, interventions at a very young age are necessary. Hence, a trial evaluating an accelerated schedule including a neonatal PCV dose was carried out to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the seven-valent PCV (7vPCV) in children living in the Asaro Valley, Eastern Highlands Province, PNG. We have previously reported that neonatal and early infant immunization with 7vPCV is safe and immunogenic <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We now aim to describe the effect of 7vPCV on nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci and pneumococcal serotypes when given either in a 0&#x02013;1&#x02013;2 or 1&#x02013;2&#x02013;3-month schedule.

The lack of a significant difference in overall prevalence of pneumococci between vaccinated and control groups was also observed in Kenyan infants and other high risk populations in Africa and Fiji where prevalence of carriage is high <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, pneumococcal carriage was dense in a high proportion of pneumococcus-positive samples in our study regardless of their PCV vaccination status and high density is associated with increased risk of disease <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Further studies investigating the effect of PCV on density of carriage using quantitative PCR for total bacterial load and species-specific load are needed in PNG.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms that foster and sustain the elevated carriage in this population are unclear. However, possible sources of respiratory pathogens could be contact with densely colonised older siblings <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, the child&#x02019;s mother <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and adults with chronic lung disease which is a prevalent condition in the highlands of PNG <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Overcrowding is an important risk factor and was found to be the strongest predictor of carriage in Australian Aboriginal children <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Overcrowding in the highlands of PNG is common and is also likely to be a factor driving high nasopharyngeal carriage transmission in this population. It is common for a family, often including members of the extended family, to live together in a traditional highland house, which typically comprises just one communal room with smoke from a wood fire in the centre of the room <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and wood smoke from burning biomass fuel, a popular form of fuel for cooking due to its affordability, may also contribute to high carriage rates by enhancing nasopharyngeal colonization <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In an indoor air pollution study, Kirarock recorded significantly higher levels of coarse particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) released from burning of biofuel in traditional highland houses than in semi-permanent and permanent houses <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Hand hygiene can also play a role in the acquisition and transmission of different serotypes in children. Aboriginal children living in remote communities were 3 times more likely to have nasal discharge and 23 times more likely to have hand contamination with both <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic> than children attending urban day care centres <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. More needs to be done to increase public health awareness on healthy living lifestyle and improving living conditions especially in the rural areas.</p><p>A total of sixty-three different pneumococcal serotypes/serogroups were detected over the duration of the study illustrating the high diversity of serotypes present in this population. This is likely to be an underestimate as factor sera were not available for all serogroups. Pneumococcal isolates with indeterminate serotype, like 6A/C, were not counted as separate serotypes. Factor typing was not available in our previous studies in PNG; therefore this is the first study to report any serotype-specific carriage data in Papua New Guinean children. Overall, the high diversity of serotypes in this population may limit the impact of limited valency conjugate vaccines.</p><p>In this study there was a reduction in VT carriage in the vaccinated cohorts at 9&#x000a0;months of age, although not statistically significant, and no difference in carriage of any pneumococcus between vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. However, the prevalence of NVT carriage at 9&#x000a0;months was significantly higher in 7vPCV recipients than in controls suggesting some impact of PCV on the pneumococcal carriage populations in vaccinated children. It is likely that the limited effect of 7vPCV on VT carriage is due to the high density of carriage and diversity of serotypes circulating, with relatively low prevalence of 7vPCV types; in the control cohort only 39% of carried isolates at 9&#x000a0;months of age were 7vPCV types.</p><p>We have previously reported immunogenicity to PCV7 in this trial <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Geometric mean concentrations (GMTs) of serotype-specific IgG levels for all VT were above the cut-off value of 0.35&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL for protection from IPD. At age 4&#x000a0;months antibody GMTs were remarkably similar to those reported in Kenya following the standard 6&#x02013;10&#x02013;14-week PCV schedule commonly used in third world settings and also following the neonatal schedule trialled in Kenya <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The more conservative value of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL was more discriminatory as less than half of the samples at age 9&#x000a0;months had a serotype-specific antibody titre &#x02a7e;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL for serotypes 4, 9V, 18C and 23F. However, it is noteworthy that antibody titers were high at age 9&#x000a0;months for those serotypes that were more commonly isolated at age 3&#x000a0;months (6B, 14 and 19F), suggesting that carriage boosts the antibody response. The proportion of samples with antibody titers &#x02a7e;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL in our study was higher for all VTs than among recipients of the standard EPI schedule in Kenya <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To our knowledge there is no established correlate for protection against pneumococcal carriage although 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL was found by Goldblatt et al. to be protective against serotype 14 carriage in adults in the United Kingdom <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. While theoretically administration of PPV at age 9&#x000a0;months may affect memory B cells numbers at age 18&#x000a0;months, we have found circulating VT-specific memory B-cells are present at 18&#x000a0;months and are not different to unvaccinated controls at age 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The relationship between carriage and immune response to pneumococci requires further investigation.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. Firstly, the study was originally powered to detect group differences in immune response <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and, consequently, some of the potentially important observed differences in secondary outcomes such as carriage prevalence, do not reach statistical significance. For example, the key finding of a difference in prevalence of VT at 9&#x000a0;months of age between vaccinated (22%) and unvaccinated (31%) groups would require a sample size of 278 per group to have 80% power to be detected as statistically significant (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). This would involve the recruitment of approximately 350 infants per group whereas only around 100 per group were actually enrolled. Secondly, the time points selected for sampling may not have been optimal to detect impact of PCV on carriage: age 3&#x000a0;months may have been too early to see an effect on VT carriage while 9&#x000a0;months may have been too late. We saw a non-significant difference in VT carriage between PCV recipients and controls at age 9&#x000a0;months, but the impact of PCV on VT carriage might have already peaked at age six months.</p><p>Not all samples could be cultured as samples were lost following a freezer failure. Nevertheless 87% of samples (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1761) were cultured and for 80% of children we had culture data from 5 or more samples per child. Furthermore, we did not have factor type sera for all serogroups and therefore could not serotype all isolates (although some additional factor typing was available on isolates characterised in Australia). Hence the serotype diversity is an underestimate. Finally, in view of the wide diversity of serotypes and the consequent small number of isolates across the serotypes, we could not look at the impact of 7vPCV on individual serotypes.</p><p>The high and varied diversity in serotypes limits PCV coverage and in turn increases the likelihood of replacement serotypes in carriage and disease. Following the rollout of the 13vPCV in PNG in 2014, it is vital to closely monitor carriage and invasive pneumococcal disease serotypes to observe direct and population herd effects of vaccine on serotype distribution. Serotype-independent vaccines are needed to protect against pneumococcal disease irrespective of capsular serotype, but there is also a need to address the underlying environmental factors and to determine the sources of infection in children.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Financial disclosure</title><p>This project was funded by an International Collaborative Project Grant of the <funding-source id="gp005">Wellcome Trust</funding-source>, United Kingdom (071613/Z/03/Z) and the <funding-source id="gp010">Australian National Health and Medical Research Council</funding-source> (NHMRC #303123).</p><p>DL received funding from an NHMRC Program grant (#353514) and a Project Grant (#572590).
