poor subjective psychosomatic symptoms (SPS). The study was designed as a two-armed parallel cluster randomised controlled trial and the study population comprised adolescent students (aged 12&#x02013;14 years, <italic>n</italic> = 1,565) who were recruited from 19 middle schools in Japan. The PADOK intervention or usual school programme was provided in schools to all eligible participants. The primary outcome was the SPS score at 6 months, while secondary outcomes included lifestyle factors, BMI, and dietary intakes. Analyses were undertaken on an intention to treat (ITT) basis accounting for the clustered design. Nineteen schools were randomised to the PADOK group (10 schools) and control group (9 schools). The numbers of students used for analysis were 1,509 for ITT and 1,420 (94.1%) for PPS. At 6 months, the crude mean change from baseline of the SPS scores by ITT analysis showed a significantly greater reduction in the PADOK group compared to that in the control group (&#x02212;0.95, 95% <italic>CI</italic> &#x02212;1.70 to &#x02212;0.20, <italic>P</italic> = 0.016), while those for baseline-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted values showed similar directionality but were not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.063 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.130). The results indicated that the PADOK program may improve poor SPS scores among adolescents.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan.</institution></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research Grant C in 2012&#x02013;2014 (Grant No. 24500991)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Junko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research Grant C in 2012&#x02013;2014 (Grant No. 24500991).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adolescence is a critical stage of the life course that offers the opportunity to improve or prevent potential chronic health problems such as obesity [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and adverse psychological (psychosomatic or psychiatric) symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], both in adolescence and later in life [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many school-based cluster randomisation trials have been conducted in Western societies to prevent obesity regarding lifestyle behaviour modifications among adolescents, but few studies have been conducted in Asia [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Improving the well-being of adolescents is a major public health concern [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and requires effective lifestyle and behavioural interventions that target healthy dietary intakes [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and physical activity among adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Not only obesity but also mental health problems have been reported to affect 10&#x02013;20% of children and adolescents worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although associations between adolescent lifestyles and poor subjective psychosomatic symptoms (SPS) scores have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], there have been few studies examining the effectiveness of interventions to alter adolescents&#x02019; lifestyle on improving their SPS scores [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In particular, very few relevant cluster randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted in Japan. Considering the rapid increase of poor SPS scores in Japan [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it is important to develop an effective lifestyle and behaviour intervention program for general use with adolescents in Japan.</p><p>A lifestyle intervention program could be targeted to impact a broad range of outcomes related to improving the poor SPS scores of Japanese adolescents, including an increased enjoyment of school life and improving balanced dietary intakes and daily habits such as maintaining a regular sleeping routine. Considering these points, we developed a school-based home-collaborative lifestyle education program to reduce poor SPS in adolescents (<bold>P</bold>rogram for <bold>ADO</bold>lescent of lifestyle education in <bold>K</bold>umamoto, PADOK). The design of PADOK was based on strategies described in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165285.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and aimed to change adolescents&#x02019; lifestyle in a non-compulsory way and provide feedback on their dietary habits by assessment using the FFQW82 food frequency questionnaire, which was developed to assess habitual dietary intake by evaluating the nutritional intake at each meal [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The inclusion of home-collaborative support may help to obtain favourable effects. We hypothesised that adolescents who participated in the PADOK group would show a greater improvement in their SPS scores than those who participated in the control group after 6 months. Correspondingly, the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the PADOK intervention programme in reducing the frequency of poor SPS scores among adolescent students at 6 months after baseline compared with the usual education provided to Japanese middle school students by their schools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed as a two-armed school-based parallel cluster RCT, with individual middle schools as the unit of allocation and individual participants as the unit of analysis. This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects/patients were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Prefectural University of Kumamoto in 2012 (No. 24001) and was registered with the Japanese Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN 000012525). The registration had been late for the enrolment of participants (the participant recruitment period: May 2013 to July 2013) because it took time for the coordination with school teachers. The registration had been completed during the follow-up period (June 2013 to January 2014). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects (middle school students) and their parents or guardians. The study followed the CONSORT guidelines for the design and reporting of clinical trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165285.s001">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>), and the CONSORT flow diagram for the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165285.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone.0165285.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0165285.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Consort flow diagram.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0165285.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants</title><p>Nineteen schools among 178 schools with a middle school in Kumamoto prefecture, Japan (around 52,000 students), were eligible for inclusion and were invited to participate.

However, team members of data management, with the exception of the project coordinator and research assistants, remained blind to the group allocations until the code was open after the last follow-up call was completed and the data were recorded. The project coordinator and research assistants were not blinded because they were responsible for distributing the education to participants.</p><p>To minimise the risk of bias, strict protocols for follow-up assessment procedures (in Japanese) were developed and research assistants were trained to adhere to these protocols.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Interventions</title><p>Interventions were delivered in the academic year May 2013&#x02013;January 2014 during health education classes.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>PADOK program</title><p>The PADOK intervention scheme is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165285.g002">Fig 2</xref>.

Namely, increasing their enjoyment of school life and health, forming a habit of sleeping at regular hours of each day for a period of more than 6 hours, eating breakfast, and increasing their physical activity by decreasing the time spent on computer games, mobile phones, internet, and watching television. The program also encouraged students to increase their dietary intake of staple foods (rice, bread, etc.), main dishes (soy, fish, eggs, and meat), and vegetables, particularly at breakfast. The program also aimed to develop students&#x02019; skills in food selection by delivering advice and education, for example, not to consume high-fat foods such as mayonnaise and dressings or high-energy drinks.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Usual care</title><p>Students in the usual school programme (control) arm participated in health education sessions provided by the school according to the usual curriculum.

The facilitators had at least an undergraduate university degree in a relevant discipline, an appropriate professional background, or experience of working with adolescents. In all sessions, the intervention was delivered under observation by the facilitators.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcomes were collected during class time by questionnaires administered by researchers and completed by students at baseline and 6 months. The primary outcome was the SPS score measured by the responses to the questionnaire. The SPS questionnaire consists of 9 symptoms (fatigue, headache, lassitude, irritation, lack of concentration, lack of motivation, poor ability to wake in the morning, upset stomach, and stiff shoulders). The Japanese and English translated versions of the questionnaire are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165285.s002">S1 Fig</xref>. The response categories for the frequency of experiencing each symptom were &#x0201c;0 = never&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;1 = rarely&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;2 = sometimes&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;3 = often&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;4 = always.&#x0201d; Assuming the Likert scale, we calculated the SPS score (0&#x02013;36 points) as a sum of the category values for 9 items. Because the assumption of the Likert scale was not necessarily guaranteed, we calculated another score (SPS-D score) as a sensitivity analysis. Since the response &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; should be desirable for adolescents, a response in any of the other 4 categories was classified as &#x0201c;having poor symptoms&#x0201d;. The number of poor symptoms for which students were classified as &#x0201c;having poor symptoms&#x0201d; was used as the SPS-D score (0&#x02013;9 points). For both the SPS and SPS-D scores, a higher score denotes poorer symptoms. Internal consistency of the SPS score was examined by the Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; coefficient. The results for the validity and reliability of the SPS score are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165285.s003">S2 Fig</xref>.</p><p>Secondary outcomes were lifestyle factors including enjoyment of school life, BMI, and dietary intakes assessed by the FFQW82 (<italic>see</italic>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165285.t001">Table 1</xref>). The FFQW82 consists of a list of 82 foods with colour illustrations showing portion sizes, and the dietary habits of respondents for the previous 1 month can be calculated for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and by food group. The validity and reliability of FFQW82 were previously established for adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

adolescents who participated in the PADOK group would show a greater decrease in their mean SPS score than adolescents who participated in the control group after 6 months. The effects of the intervention were expected to be measured after 6 months using a self-completed questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size required for the study was determined based on the information needed to detect a difference in the primary outcome with a significance level of 5% and power of 80%, under the assumptions of 40 students per cluster (assuming the same sample size for each cluster), an effect size (for poor SPS) of 0.3 (Cohen&#x02019;s d), and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.02. The effect size was estimated from our experience in a former study [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Data management and data monitoring</title><p>We captured all study data in a Microsoft Excel file. The validation rules for each case record had been pre-specified and included range checks so that inaccuracies in data collection could be identified at an early stage.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used descriptive statistics to assess the balance between the trial arms at baseline. To ensure that cluster randomisation was successful, the significance of differences between the intervention and control groups was examined using chi-squared test and <italic>t</italic>-test. The primary effect was assessed by calculating the difference between the changes from baseline to 6 months in the SPS scores of the PADOK and control groups. The primary analysis was conducted based on an intention to treat (ITT) principle with the full analysis set and imputation of missing data was performed using the last observation carried forward method (ITT/LOCF) and a multiple imputation method (ITT/MI) using chained equations under the assumption of missing at random [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A linear random-effects mixed model employing the maximum likelihood method was used for the analyses. A general linear random-effects mixed model employing the restricted maximum likelihood method was used for the analysis of continuous variables. Outcome measures were used to examine the effects of the intervention by a crude model (Model 1), a model adjusted for baseline values (Model 2), and a multivariate-adjusted model (adjusted for baseline, sex, age, and BMI) (Model 3).</p><p>Secondary analyses were conducted for the secondary outcomes using the ITT/LOCF approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary and the secondary outcomes using the per protocol set (PPS) identified from the complete data set following the criteria determined <italic>a priori</italic> including analyses for the SPS-D score for ITT/LOCF. As for the dichotomous secondary outcomes, a generalised linear random-effects mixed model (logistic model) was used for the analysis and associations were shown as an odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval (CI).</p><p>All tests for significance were conducted using a 2-sided approach with a 5% significance level.

The findings suggested that the PADOK intervention program was effective for improving the SPS score of adolescents. Improvements were also observed in some lifestyle habits, including increases in subjective enjoyment of school life, the daily servings of staple foods, main dishes, and vegetables consumed at breakfast.</p><p>This study provides the first evidence for improvements in SPS scores and lifestyle habits as a result of delivering a lifestyle education program, based on a cluster RCT in Japan. In particular, it is important to ascertain the breakfast habits of the adolescent age group [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The PADOK intervention is mainly focused on the benefits of regularly eating a healthy breakfast for reducing students&#x02019; SPS scores. Other reports on the beneficial effects of similar interventions such as the development of psychosocial and behavioural function [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], improved academic performance [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], decreases in tardiness and suspensions, and improved student behaviour and attentiveness may support our results. The potential mechanisms that could be targeted to improve adolescents&#x02019; SPS scores include fostering an increased enjoyment of school life, a balanced dietary intake, and healthy daily habits.</p><p>One recent cross-sectional study conducted in England provided information about changing mental health trends in early adolescence and specifically identified a significant increase in emotional problems in girls aged 11&#x02013;13 years [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our findings were concordant with those of previous studies, which reported that students who regularly ate breakfast were more likely to behave better in school and get along with their peers better than those who did not [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Many therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as meditation, relaxation, recreation, and time in nature, are enjoyable and may therefore become self-sustaining healthy habits [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Our results showed that the PADOK intervention led to a reduction in the mean SPS score of students. In the school-based home-collaborative lifestyle education, registered dieticians encouraged students and their parents or guardians to help students to improve their lifestyle through each classroom lesson, homework assignment, and newsletter by following a cycle of goal setting, practice, and assessment. Our study focused on treating poor SPS as a whole entity, while previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165285.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165285.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] involving RCTs focused on treating certain individual mental health outcomes such as having depression. These studies either administered a questionnaire for self-completion by the participants [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165285.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or assessed risk factors and protective factors related to having depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In these studies, no significant differences between the intervention and control groups were observed. A prior systematic review reported that there was limited evidence that the school environment has a major influence on the mental health of adolescents, although student perceptions of teacher support and school connectedness were associated with better emotional health [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On the other hand, Williams and her colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] conducted a systematic assessment of the school environment and identified the opportunity to design realistic and relevant interventions for promoting health in adolescents through improving physical activity and nutrition behaviours using the PRECEDE framework. We cannot exclude the possibility that the teachers of students in the PADOK group had changed their way of thinking about the importance of lifestyle education and aimed towards the improvement of such education in their general classes. If so, we can consider it as a secondary effect of the PADOK intervention. Further study is needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms by which PADOK is effective in reducing SPS and promoting health-promoting lifestyle behaviours.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>We considered it important to involve students&#x02019; parents or guardians in the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To achieve this, the students were asked to discuss the knowledge gained from the PADOK program with their parents/guardians. The inclusion of home-collaborative support may help to obtain favourable effects. In a previous clustered RCT for physical activity intervention among adolescents, an intervention that included parental support led to an increase in self-reported school-related physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165285.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In our study, the textbook was used for communication among the student, his or her guardian(s), and the registered dietitian. Free exchange of information among the 3 persons concerned was possible by using the notes in the text book. Thus, it was hoped that the process might create a shared understanding among these 3 persons.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. Firstly, the success of the PADOK program was to some extent dependent on the skill of the dietitian. To address this issue, we developed a training process for registered dietitians to undertake before the start of the randomised study. Secondly, we relied on self-reported ratings of SPS and did not undertake any diagnostic interviews. It is therefore possible that there were important changes in the status of SPS. The results of our ITT/LOCF and ITT/MI analyses denoted significance only for crude differences from baseline. The directionality of the differences was similar in the case of the SPS score assuming the Likert scale, but these differences did not reach significance. Since we used the LOCF method for missing values, the statistical analysis might be biased towards being conservative. However, such a conservative bias is generally preferable to lower the possibility of obtaining false positive results in a clinical trial. Further, we added the SPS-D score that was calculated as the number of responses for &#x0201c;having poor symptoms&#x0201d;, since the response &#x0201c;never having poor symptoms&#x0201d; should be desirable for adolescents. The construct validity was established (see the results of factor analyses [EFA and CFA] in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165285.s003">S2 Fig</xref>) for both scoring methods. When we calculated the SPS and SPS-D scores, Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; coefficients were 0.88 and 0.90, respectively. From these results, the scoring methods we used in this study were proved to be valid. In addition, we conducted multiple testing for the secondary outcomes, and we should, therefore, interpret the significance of the results carefully.</p><p>Thirdly, the generalisability of the results was limited to Japanese middle school students in Kumamoto prefecture in Japan. In addition, we initially approached 178 schools to request their participation in the study and among them, 19 schools agreed to participate, while the remaining 159 schools declined. The most common reason given was that &#x0201c;the curriculum has already been fixed and cannot be changed&#x0201d;. Therefore, the sample set included in this trial may over-represent schools that are more innovative than average and this may be a risk of bias. However, we conducted randomisation and the risk of bias is small, although we cannot deny that a risk exists. Considering that the health and activity conditions among the students in Kumamoto were not largely different from those of average Japanese adolescents according to the available data [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the results may also apply to general adolescents in other prefectures in Japan. Fourthly, the term of intervention was 6 months in this study, although longer term interventions have been found to improve the mental health of pupils [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As for the duration of the intervention, there are many types of study design [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Considering the feasibility of the real education situation, we considered it as practicable. In addition, there was also emerging evidence that health behaviour interventions might have "spill-over effects" on mental health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0165285.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165285.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which we should also consider. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of the PADOK program. Fifthly, to ensure that cluster randomisation was successful, we examined the differences in baseline values between the intervention and control groups. Although some of the variables showed significant differences, we think these differences may have been caused by chance because of the nature of randomisation. In addition, cluster size varied widely, and the inflation value due to the design effect of taking clustering into account was 1.66 when using the intraclass correlation coefficient (= 0.0125) estimated by Model 2, the power was estimated as 0.898 by the &#x0201c;clustersampsi&#x0201d; procedure in Stata and our results were considered to be acceptable. Finally, we used the LOCF method to impute missing outcomes. The rates of lost to follow up for the intervention and control groups were similar (40 [5.0%] and 49 [4.9%], respectively). The main reason for non-completion overall was &#x0201c;having a cold&#x0201d;. In the control group, a significant proportion of the reasons given was &#x0201c;not willing&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 30). The baseline characteristics of those who had missing outcomes were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To date, there has been a lack of evidence from cluster RCTs regarding the effects of providing lifestyle interventions for Japanese adolescents on improving their poor SPS scores. Our trial fills this gap in the literature. Our results indicated that a lifestyle intervention program delivered at middle schools in Kumamoto, Japan improved the SPS scores of adolescents and increased the proportions of participants reporting a regular daily intake of staple foods, main dishes, and vegetables at breakfast, as well as an increased enjoyment of school life. The test population showed a moderately high adherence rate to the PADOK program, which is a positive indication of its feasibility in broader school-based home-collaborative practice. Our study provides useful information for designing lifestyle educational interventions not only for adolescents in the Kumamoto area but also for Japanese adolescents in general.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0165285.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0165285.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0165285.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Japanese Version and English translated versions of questionnaire.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0165285.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0165285.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Validity and reliability of the SPS score.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0165285.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0165285.s004"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>FFQW82 (Japanese version and English translated version).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0165285.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0165285.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Mean change of the SPS score from baseline at 6 months (intervention effect on primary outcome) by multiple imputation.</title><p>SPS, subjective psychosomatic symptoms;
