The problem can occur at any age and can affect both sexes. It has been estimated that at least 50% of individuals over the age of 50 years have, at sometime experienced symptoms related to hemorrhoids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The prevalence of hemorrhoidal disease ranging from 4.4% in the general population to 36.4% in general practice. It has been re-ported that 1 in 3 persons with symptomatic hemorrhoids seek medical help. Women have an increased prevalence during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In both sexes, a peak in prevalence was noted from age 45-65 years, with a subsequent decrease after age 65 years. The development of hemorrhoids before age 20 years was unusual.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Numerous theories concerning the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids have been proposed, but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Constipation and straining were once accepted as the major cause of hemorrhoidal disease, but this is considered to be a gross oversimplification.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Angiogenesis is evident in hemorrhoid tissue, suggesting the possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids. The direct degeneration effect of MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9), on supporting structure elastic fibers in anal cushion, is another important mechanism. The high expression of iNOS (nitric- oxide synthase) suggests that the inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids, and NO may be involve in pathological effect on hemorrhoids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Hemorrhoidal disease can give rise to varying degree of bleeding, anal swelling, pain, discomfort, discharge, and pruritus. Bleeding is the most common presenting complaint. Hemorrhoidal disease is the most common cause of lower GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Colonoscopy is an accurate and best assessment method for diagnosis and colonoscopy classification of internal hemorrhoids is highly useful in evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The use of laxatives including high-fiber diet, bulking agents, stimulants, fecal softeners, osmotic agents, show a consistent beneficial effect for relieving overall symptoms and bleeding in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Drugs which improve microcirculation, capillary flow and vascular tone, and strengthen connective tissue of the perivascular amorphous substrate, can relieve capillary impairment and venous insufficiency.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The resin of <italic>Commiphora Mukul</italic>, (bdellium, <italic>C. wightii</italic>, Indian bdellium) Burseraceae, which has exuded from the bark and dried in the air, is the pale yellow granular secretion that is discharged into cavities in the bark when it is wounded. This resin is an astringent antiseptic with anti-inflammatory and demulcent properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] This botanical product is traditionally stated to possess anti-microbial, astringent, carminative, expectorant, anti-catarrhal, antiseptic, and vulnerary properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Avicenna, the famous physician of Persian medicine, believes that <italic>Commiphora Mukul</italic> (<italic>CM</italic>) is one of the best herbal monotherapy for hemorrhoids, which can be used orally or topically. It is a laxative, hepatoprotective and astringent agent that can metabolize bioactive etiologic component of hemorrhoids which is traditionally called melancholy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Detailed descriptions of the varieties, physical qualities, actions, uses, and indications of <italic>CM</italic> are available in the treatises of Charaka (l000 B.C.). <italic>CM</italic> resin is a complex mixture of various classes of chemical compounds such as lignans and lipids, diterpenoids, and steroids. The nature of these compounds is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, and the scheme on segregation of <italic>CM</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The gum resin of Commiphora proved to be a rich source of steroids. Of the 10 steroids isolated and characterized from the resin [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>], 4 (viz. cholesterol and guggulsteroids I, II and Ill) are C<sub>27</sub> steroids, whereas the others are pregnant derivatives.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The lignans, lipids, and diterpenoids isolated from <italic>commiphora mukul</italic> gum</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PM-9-350-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Scheme to show the chemical segregation process of <italic>commiphora mukul</italic> (Guggulu) gum</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PM-9-350-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Steroids isolated from <italic>commiphora mukul</italic> gum</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PM-9-350-g003"/></fig><p>Relative high incidence and prevalence of this disease and poor potent effective existing therapeutic drugs, has made the search for new pharmacologically active non surgical remedies unavoidable.

Over 70% of patients were in age range 30-49 years that is very important from social and economical viewpoint. More than 93% of participants were married that shows low prevalence in age below 30. Distribution of sex was not normal. This can be interpreted as more common risk factors in women than in men, factors such as low physical activity, obesity, pregnancy, etc. or may be due to more fear of rectal bleeding in women than in men. Almost half of patients experienced previous treatment, and this can show low efficacy of current medical treatment for hemorrhoids grade 1 and 2. Mean duration of disease was about 1 year. Embarrassment in expression of anal discomfort, symptom tolerability, and self-medication by soothing agents may be of delayed reference to the physician and varied prevalence and incidence in different society. Rectal bleeding was the most common referral cause, but among symptoms, constipation was the most. It can probably postulate that people are more sensitive to bleeding than other symptoms or signs. Furthermore bleeding makes patients motivated to seek treatment faster. Constipation was the most common finding and had a significant correlation with main signs of hemorrhoids such as protrusion (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000), rectal bleeding (<italic>P</italic> = 0.047), and colonoscopic grade (<italic>P</italic> = 0.018). This can emphasize on role of constipation as an important etiologic factor. Some theories have mentioned regarding the cause of hemorrhoids. The following factors have been suggested to contribute the development of hemorrhoids: Heredity, anatomic feature, nutrition, occupation, climate, senility, endocrine changes, food and drugs, infection, pregnancy, exercise, coughing, straining, vomiting, constipation, psychological problems, but the actual cause is remaining unclear.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Meanwhile there are some evidences suggesting the possible biochemical mechanism in the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] According to Persian traditional medicine, the main mechanism in majority types of hemorrhoids is accumulation of a biochemically changed blood in anorectal veins, which is called melancholic blood. Based on Persian and Ayurvedic traditional medicine, <italic>CM</italic> is stated to possess astringent, anti thrombotic, laxative, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, hepatoprotective properties and seems to act at a microcirculatory level. These properties cover the main therapeutic goals in hemorrhoids treatment. In this study, the effect of crude purified <italic>CM</italic> resin is evaluated in patients with hemorrhoids grade 1 and 2 in a randomized clinical trial. According to research findings, local symptoms including painful defecation (mean rank= 48.08), constipation (mean rank = 46.96), and bleeding (mean rank = 46.98) were alleviated better in control group (mean rank = 51.89, 52.98, 52.96, respectively). It can be justified by <italic>anti-hemorrhoid</italic> suppository administration in this group. Many studies have been carried out on clinical effects of <italic>CM</italic> resin, in a dose ranging 2-8 g/d for a 3-36 week period. Petroleum ether extract of this resin called Gugulipid is available in form of capsule, as a hypolipidemic agent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>This clinical trial showed significant reduction in symptoms of hemorrhoids like concomitant GI symptoms including flatulence, GE-reflux, colonoscopic stage, and marked improvement in most of hemorrhoids symptoms even after 4-week follow-up. Because of no topical prescription in study (test) group and continuity of some symptom's relief in this group, it can be concluded that <italic>CM</italic> has acted on hemorrhoids by systemic effects. In this study, <italic>CM</italic> is used in low dose and period in comparison whit previous studies. It seems that using upper doses and longer period, in addition to topical formatives, can lead to better results. This should be assessed in more future researches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The efficacy of <italic>CM</italic> in the treatment of uncomplicated hemorrhoids grade 1 and 2 was evidenced in this work.
