Adhesion barriers are rarely used despite the high morbidity caused by intra-abdominal adhesions. Only one of the currently available adhesion barriers has demonstrated consistent evidence for reducing adhesions in visceral surgery. This agent has limitations through poor handling characteristics because it is sticky on both sides. C-Qur&#x02122; Film is a novel thin film adhesion barrier and it is sticky on only one side, resulting in better handling characteristics. The objective of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of C-Qur&#x02122; Film to decrease the incidence of adhesions after colorectal surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a prospective, investigator initiated, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter trial. Eligible patients undergoing colorectal resection requiring temporary loop ileostomy or loop/split colostomy by laparotomy or hand assisted laparoscopy will be included in the trial. Before closure, patients are randomized 1:1 to either the treatment arm (C-Qur&#x02122; Film) or control arm (no adhesion barrier). Patients will return 8 to 16&#x000a0;weeks post-colorectal resection for take down of their ostomy. During ostomy takedown, adhesions will be evaluated for incidence, extent, and severity. The primary outcome evaluation will be assessment of adhesions to the incision site. It is hypothesized that the use of C-Qur&#x02122; Film underneath the primary incision reduces the incidence of adhesion at the incision by 30%. To demonstrate 30% reduction in the incidence of adhesions, a sample size of 84 patients (32&#x02009;+&#x02009;10 per group (25% drop out)) is required (two-sided test, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, 80% power).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Results of this study add to the evidence on the use of anti-adhesive barriers in open and laparoscopic &#x02018;hand-assisted&#x02019; colorectal surgery. We chose incidence of adhesions to the incision site as primary outcome measure since clinical outcomes such as small bowel obstruction, secondary infertility and adhesiolysis related complications are considered multifactorial and difficult to interpret. Incidence of adhesions at repeat surgery is believed to be the most valuable surrogate endpoint for clinically relevant adhesion prevention, since small bowel obstruction and adhesiolysis at repeat surgery are not likely to occur when complete adhesion reduction in a patient is accomplished.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01872650">NCT01872650</ext-link>, registration date 6 June 2013.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>adhesions</kwd><kwd>adhesion prevention</kwd><kwd>anti-adhesive barrier</kwd><kwd>C-Qur&#x02122; film</kwd><kwd>colorectal surgery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Postoperative adhesions develop in more than 90% of patients undergoing an intra-abdominal surgical procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These adhesions are known to cause small bowel obstruction, secondary infertility and pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. At repeat abdominal surgery, intra-abdominal adhesions necessitate adhesiolysis, leading to increased operating times and substantial risk of intra- and postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The clinical implications of adhesions carry a significant health and socioeconomic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Adhesions are fibrous bands that connect tissue surfaces where anatomical connections do not normally exist. Adhesions are formed after a tissue surface has been injured (abrasion, desiccation, dissection, <italic>etcetera</italic>) and the subsequent process of fibrinolysis is incomplete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. At present, there are several products on the market to combat postsurgical adhesion formation. These are broad coverage adhesion barriers, generally consisting of liquids, like icodextrin 4% (Adept&#x02122;, Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA) adhesion reduction solution. These materials may limit adhesion formation by minimizing tissue insult during the surgical procedure when used as an intra-operational lavage. At the conclusion of the surgical procedure, instillation of large volumes of liquid acts to separate tissue surfaces by hydroflotation, limiting tissue-tissue contact. Broad coverage adhesion prevention has the distinct advantage of allowing the surgeon to treat many areas of the intraperitoneal space at once. A disadvantage is the lack of control giving adhesion prevention at sites at risk for complications of adhesion prevention such as an anastomosis. In addition, side effects of abdominal distension and vulvar swelling are commonly encountered in the use of liquids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The second group of barriers consists of local coverage adhesion barriers: films, sprays, or gels that are applied directly to adhesiogenic tissue surfaces to act as a physical barrier that blocks tissue-tissue contact. The barrier is generally only effective when it remains at the site of treatment. This requires the barrier to either be sutured or glued in place or to have tissue adherent properties. All local coverage adhesion barriers require the surgeon to anticipate where adhesions are likely to occur and to apply the barrier directly to those sites. These generally include sites where the peritoneum was interrupted during the surgical procedure, such as under a laparotomy incision to minimize adhesions between the incision site and the viscera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Despite the frequent occurrence of adhesions after surgery and the availability of different adhesion barriers, these barriers are rarely used by general surgeons. This discrepancy might be explained by an underestimation of the impact of adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Also, of all the clinically available adhesion barriers, only HA/CMC (hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose) barrier film (Seprafilm&#x02122;, Sanofi, Paris, France) has demonstrated consistent evidence for reducing adhesions in visceral surgery. Seprafilm&#x02122; has limitations through poor handling characteristics because it is sticky on both sides. In a large, prospective, randomized controlled multicenter study on the safety of Seprafilm&#x02122;, significantly more anastomotic leak and leak-associated complications occurred in the Seprafilm&#x02122; group due to the wrapping of Seprafilm&#x02122; around an anastomosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A subgroup analysis of control patients and patients without (593 patients) Seprafilm&#x02122; wrapped around the anastomosis showed no significant difference. Therefore, wrapping the suture or staple line of a fresh bowel anastomosis should be avoided.</p><p>Atrium (Atrium Medical Corporation, Maquet Gentinge Group, Hudson, NH, USA) has developed and manufactures C-Qur&#x02122; Film Adhesion Barrier, a novel thin film adhesion barrier for intraperitoneal use in general surgeries. The C-Qur&#x02122; Film has been approved for use in humans and received a CE mark on 13 May 2011 (CE number 10123365). The evidence on efficacy and safety of the C-Qur film originates from research on the C-Qur mesh, a mesh with an omega-3 fatty acid coating used for patients with an abdominal ventral hernia. The C-Qur mesh was found to be safe in intraperitoneal use and reduces adhesions to the mesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The C-Qur&#x02122; Film falls into the category of local coverage adhesion barriers. The C-Qur&#x02122; Film is an adhesion barrier consisting of a non-adhesive omega-3 fatty acid layer on one side and a Na-CMC (sodium-carboxymethylcellulose) tissue adherent coating on the other side. It is fully resorbable and designed to adhere to the site of treatment for a time that is sufficient to minimize postsurgical adhesion formation and clearance from the site of treatment within approximately 60&#x000a0;days. In contrast to Seprafilm&#x02122;, The C-Qur&#x02122; Film is a one-sided adherent, resulting in good handling characteristics. It offers the potential patient benefits of reduced adhesion formation and corresponding reduction of small bowel obstruction, secondary infertility, pain and adhesiolysis at repeat surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of C-Qur&#x02122; Film to decrease the incidence of adhesions after colorectal surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The CLIPEUS trial is registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01872650.

The surgeons who have agreed to participate in the study and perform the index procedures will be trained in the placement of C-Qur&#x02122; Film and in adhesion mapping.</p><p>Patients will be included at the outpatient clinics of the participating centers (Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen; Catharina Hospital, Eindhoven; Atrium Medical Center, Heerlen; Maxima Medical Center, Veldhoven; Gelderse Vallei Hospital, Ede) by the treating surgeons. During the operation, when the definite decision to create a temporary ostomy is made, patients are randomized 1:1 to either the treatment arm (C-Qur&#x02122; film) or the control arm (standard treatment: no adhesion barrier, no placebo). In patients assigned to the treatment arm, the C-Qur&#x02122; Film must be applied beneath the incision. The C-Qur&#x02122; film can also be applied to other areas considered to be adhesiogenic (for example, the dissection site and ostomy site, but not around the anastomosis).

Weight and vital signs will be noted and the following laboratory investigations will be repeated: CRP, sodium (Na), potassium (K), urea, creatinine, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time (PT).</p><p>Patients in both groups will undergo the same procedure for ostomy closure. To evaluate the adhesions at the loop ileostomy/colostomy site, the incidence, severity and extent of adhesions around the ostomy have to be evaluated during takedown. The time required for takedown of the ostomy is defined as the time from start of the takedown to the time the bowel is repositioned in the abdomen, and this time will be noted on the CRF. The severity of adhesions will be scored according to the Z&#x000fc;hlke classification (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To assess the extent of adhesions, the ostomy is divided in four quadrants (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The extent of adhesions is scored as the number of quadrants containing adhesions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). After the ileostomy/colostomy takedown is completed, the surgeon will introduce a laparoscope at the ostomy site and evaluate the incidence, extent and severity of adhesions at the incision site and at other areas potentially injured (and covered) during the initial procedure. The severity will be scored according to the Z&#x000fc;hlke classification (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The extent of adhesions underneath the incision site will be scored through estimation of the area covered by adhesions as a percentage of the total area underneath the incision.

This hypothesis is based on the supporting documentation for Seprafilm&#x02122; (treatment) versus Control (no treatment) with an adhesion rate of 94% in the control group and 64% in the treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We estimate a total drop out of 25% in this study, comprising 10% regular drop out and 15% drop out because of anastomotic leakage. A 15% drop out because of anastomotic leakages is chosen because it is the upper limit of the incidence of this complication. Assuming that the C-Qur&#x02122; Film group performs similarly to Seprafilm&#x02122;, a total of 84 patients, (32&#x02009;+&#x02009;10 per group (25% drop out)) would be needed in a randomized study, with 80% power and two-sided alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 in order to detect a 30% reduction in incidence of adhesions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistics</title><p>In general, for continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation, median, IQR, minimum and maximum values will be presented. Groups will be compared using the <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, as appropriate, based on the distribution of the data. For categorical variables, the frequencies and percentage within each category will be calculated. Groups will be compared using the chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test, as appropriate, based on the expected counts. All available data will be summarized. Demographics, preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative parameters will be reported and compared for both groups. Descriptive statistics will be presented to describe the trial results. Missing data will be evaluated by the investigators, and appropriate action will be undertaken<italic>.</italic> In case of skewed baseline data between groups, results will be corrected for this data.</p><p>Our primary analysis will focus on the effectiveness and safety of the C-Qur film between the treatment group and the control group. A chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test will be performed to assess a significant improvement in the incidence, on the Z&#x000fc;hlke score of adhesions underneath the incision site, underneath the loop ileostomy or loop/split colostomy site, and for the extent of adhesions underneath the loop ileostomy or loop/split colostomy site as well. The extent of adhesions underneath the incision site and the time needed for takedown of the ileostomy or loop/split colostomy will be compared using a <italic>t</italic>-test. To assess the safety of the C-Qur film the total incidence of postoperative complications will be compared using a <italic>t</italic>-test or a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. The mortality and the incidence for each separate complication will be compared using a chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test.</p><p>Subgroup analysis will be performed on laparoscopic versus open colorectal resection, and on ileostomy versus colostomy for the incidence, extent and severity of adhesions as described above. Since data collection of the outcome parameters is not blinded when the same surgeon who performed the index procedure also takes down the ostomy, subgroup analysis will be performed for patients with and without blinded data collection of outcome parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Reporting</title><p>The CLIPEUS trial findings will be reported in concordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Results of this study add to the evidence on the use of anti-adhesive barriers in open and laparoscopic &#x02018;hand-assisted&#x02019; colorectal surgery. Although the ultimate objective of adhesion prevention is to reduce the clinical consequences of adhesions, we chose incidence of adhesions to the incision site as primary outcome measure. Clinical outcomes such as small bowel obstruction, secondary infertility and adhesiolysis related complications are considered multifactorial and difficult to interpret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Incidence of adhesions at repeat surgery is believed to be the most valuable surrogate endpoint for clinically relevant adhesion prevention, since small bowel obstruction and adhesiolysis at repeat surgery are not likely to occur when complete adhesion reduction in a patient is accomplished. No adhesion under the incision site in particular will benefit patients at re-laparotomy or re-laparoscopy. Recent evidence from our group emphasizes the large disease and socioeconomic burden of adhesions needing lysis at subsequent abdominal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>To be able to evaluate incidence of postoperative adhesions, a second-look surgery model is required, also because noninvasive methods such as cine-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have not been validated measuring adhesion reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Colorectal resection with temporary loop ostomy is an obvious choice, since colorectal surgery is frequently performed and known for its relatively high incidence of adhesion-related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We will include patients undergoing resection for benign or malignant indication. Malignancy is the largest indication for colorectal resection, and since (disease-free) survival has strongly increased, life time risk of adhesion-related complications has increased correspondingly.</p><p>In this study, both laparoscopic and open colorectal resections will be included. In many countries, laparoscopic colorectal resection for benign and malignant diseases has gained popularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Thus, performing only an open colonic resection study would lower the generalizibility of the results on adhesion prevention. Laparoscopic technique is accompanied by less tissue trauma. Hence, it is suggested that laparoscopic colorectal surgery results in fewer adhesions. A recently published population-based register study specifically addressed readmission rate for clinically apparent adhesions after colorectal surgery, comparing the open and laparoscopic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Of the total of 187,148 patients included, 11,013 (5.9%) had laparoscopic resection. With a median follow-up of 31.8&#x000a0;months, overall adhesion-related readmission rate was 8.1%; 8.2% after an open approach versus 6.3% after a laparoscopic approach (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001). An important limitation of this study was the higher percentage of emergency operations in the open group compared to the laparoscopic group. The most common underlying disorder for an emergency laparotomy (that is, peritonitis) has a higher adhesion formation propensity. Despite the relative reduction of 23% in the re-admission rate, it should be concluded that clinically relevant consequences of adhesions are substantial also after laparoscopic surgery. A subgroup analysis for open versus laparoscopic resection will be conducted to control for the difference in surgical technique and concomitant adhesion formation.</p><p>For the sake of safe and secure placement of the adhesion barrier, only patients undergoing laparoscopic resection with a specimen extraction incision of at least 6&#x000a0;cm will be included in our study. This minimal incisional length was chosen based on previous experience with the C-Qur&#x02122; Film. The availability of different sizes of the film and the tissue adherence only at one site improve the placement in narrow spaces. These characteristics provide potentially better handling when compared to the commonly used HA/CMC barrier film in open colorectal surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial has been approved by the official Independent Review Board Nijmegen (2013/470) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].
