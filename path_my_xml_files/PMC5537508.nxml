Rigorous randomised controlled trials are recognised as the gold-standard methodological approach to achieve these aims, but commonly require large sample sizes to detect clinically relevant effects. Concerns have been expressed about the rising financial burden and regulatory complexities of conventional randomised controlled trials. It has also been estimated that up to 85% of research investment is wasted,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with examples including inefficient delivery and unduly restrictive regulation.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Large trials require effective recruitment and efficient data acquisition.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Methods to increase recruitment include informing participants of the potential benefits of enrolling in a clinical trial,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> consent processes that involve opportunity to opt out with enrolment as the default<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and short, simple participant information sheets.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The efficiency of data acquisition can be improved by using electronic patient records (EPRs) in what are referred to as &#x02018;point-of-care trials&#x02019;.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, despite evidence for the effectiveness of these approaches,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> take-up has been limited and the extent to which regulatory barriers are contributory is unclear.</p><p>A key component of regulation is to ensure studies conform to agreed principles of research ethics. In many countries such as the UK, this is the responsibility of independent research ethics committees (RECs). The UK RECs were established in 1991 to review research conducted within the National Health Service (NHS). For multisite research, approval is sought from a single REC. The UK Health Research Authority (HRA) that has responsibility for RECs was established in 2011 to promote and protect the interests of patients in health research and streamline regulation.</p><p>We aimed to determine the acceptability to the UK RECs of methods to facilitate efficient, large, simple clinical trials. We tested the hypotheses that methods would be acceptable and decision-making consistent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The WithHolding Enteral feeds Around packed red cell Transfusion (WHEAT) trial is a multicentre, comparative effectiveness, point-of-care trial. We designed the WHEAT trial to address a clinical uncertainty identified as important by service users and clinicians in the field of preterm birth.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The aim of the WHEAT trial is to compare two practices that are both in wide current clinical use (withholding enteral feeding or continuing normal feeding) during blood transfusion in preterm babies with the hope of reducing the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>). WHEAT is a real trial being developed by an investigator group with the support of the UK neonatal clinical care community, has incorporated parent involvement from inception and is supported by a National Institute of Health Research Enabling Involvement grant.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<boxed-text id="bx1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Summary of study submitted to Research Ethics Committees for the WithHolding Enteral feeds Around packed red cell Transfusion (WHEAT) study</title></caption><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;The purpose of WHEAT is to compare two practices that are widely used in neonatal units across the UK and around the world to see if one reduces the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in babies born early (premature).</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;NEC is a serious gut disease that affects about 1 in 20 very premature babies (approximately 500 each year); about 1 in 3 of these babies will die of NEC and survivors often have long-term health and developmental problems. In 2014, prevention of NEC was ranked the third most important research priority by parents and perinatal health professionals.</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;Premature babies receive frequent milk feeds (every 1 to 4&#x02005;hours) and they often need blood transfusions because they become anaemic (they do not have enough red blood cells). Some doctors worry that feeding babies during a blood transfusion may increase the risk of NEC. Others, however, think that it is more dangerous to stop feeds. Because of this, the way babies are cared for during blood transfusions varies across the country; some babies have milk feeds stopped before, during and after a transfusion (around 12&#x02005;hours in total), while others have feeds continued.</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;The purpose of WHEAT is to determine which approach is best. We will do this by comparing babies who have feeds stopped with those who have feeds continued during blood transfusions. Whether feeds will be stopped or continued will be decided by randomisation. Randomisation is done by computer and ensures that each baby has an equal chance of receiving either approach. WHEAT will compare standard UK practices and involves nothing new. WHEAT will take place in neonatal units all over the UK and will involve about 4500 babies.</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;Professional opinion (National Health Service Blood and Transplant, National Institute of Health Research Children's Clinical Research Network and most UK neonatal units) supports the need for a trial like WHEAT.</p></boxed-text></p><p>The WHEAT trial includes the following approaches to facilitate efficient data collection and recruitment:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A point-of-care trial design where all trial data are extracted from an existing national neonatal EPR via the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD). In the UK, 430 clearly defined data items (the Neonatal Data Set&#x02014;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_dictionary/messages/clinical_data_sets/data_sets/national_neonatal_data_set/national_neonatal_data_set_-_episodic_and_daily_care_fr.asp?shownav=0">http://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_dictionary/messages/clinical_data_sets/data_sets/national_neonatal_data_set/national_neonatal_data_set_-_episodic_and_daily_care_fr.asp?shownav=0</ext-link>) are extracted from a national summary EPR system to form the NNRD. Data protection complies with national standards, appropriate regulatory approvals are held and all parents are offered the opportunity to opt out of inclusion of their baby's data in the NNRD.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A short (2-page, 1000-word) parent information sheet (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary data</xref> 1).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Explicit mention in the patient information sheet of the possibility of inclusion benefit through participation: &#x0201c;Each of the two options in the WHEAT study is currently used by doctors in the UK because we do not know which one is better.

This non-evidence based approach to neonatal care may involve more risk than being in a study like WHEAT which involves a carefully designed protocol and consistent monitoring&#x0201d;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A consent process involving enrolment as the default unless a parent opts out. This was described as follows: &#x0201c;Parents of babies that meet the inclusion criteria will be approached by members of the local clinical team after their baby is admitted to the neonatal unit, usually in the first 24&#x02005;hours. Parents will be provided with the parent information sheet that explains the WHEAT trial and makes it clear that both arms (withholding feeds and continuing feeds) represent current clinical practice. The parent information sheet will make it clear that opt-out consent is being requested. This means that if they do not want their baby to take part in the WHEAT trial, they can inform the local clinical team at any point. If they do not do &#x02018;opt out&#x02019; in this way then their baby will be enrolled into WHEAT trial and will be randomised to one of the two study arms. The local team will record in the electronic health record that they have explained the WHEAT trial and the &#x02018;opt-out&#x02019; consent process to parents.&#x0201d;</p></list-item></list></p><p>The lay &#x02018;Summary of the study&#x02019; and the &#x02018;Summary of the main [ethical] issues&#x02019; from the NHS REC form are shown in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">boxes 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx2">2</xref>, respectively.

<boxed-text id="bx2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 2</label><caption><title>Summary of main (ethical) issues submitted to Research Ethics Committees for the WithHolding Enteral feeds Around packed red cell Transfusion (WHEAT) study</title></caption><p>Opt-out consent</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;In present day practice, consent to either continue or withhold feeds is not sought from parents. In WHEAT, parents will be offered opportunity to opt-out of randomisation at any time and without having to give a reason. This reduces the risk of &#x02018;injurious misconception&#x02019; where parents reject trial participation because of the burden of decision-making and an exaggerated perception of risk (Snowdon <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Full informed opt-out consent in the WHEAT trial will be a continuing process in which parents will be able to review their decision over the course of their relationship with neonatal unit staff. Parent opt-out will be recorded in the baby&#x02019;s electronic health record.</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;The opt-out approach is preferable because an opt-in approach is associated with a selection bias towards a healthier sample (Junghans <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) thus reducing the generalisability of study outcomes.</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;The opt-out approach has been used previously in neonatal research, particularly in comparative effectiveness research such as WHEAT where there is no research-related risk (as opposed to normal care-related risk).</p><p>Extracting trial data from routinely recorded clinical information</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;The large sample size required to detect a clinically relevant effect on NEC would be expensive and challenging for standard trial methodology. WHEAT is a registry trial, this means that all trial data will be obtained from a database that holds routinely recorded clinical information, the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD).</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;All neonatal units in England and Wales contribute data to the NNRD, NNRD data are a National Health Service Information Standard (ISB1595) and are extracted quarterly from real-time neonatal electronic health records. The NNRD is approved by the Caldicott Guardians and Lead Clinicians of all contributing neonatal units, the National Research Ethics Service (10/H0803/151) and the Confidentiality Advisory Group of the Health Research Authority (805(f)/2010). The quality and completeness of data that will be used in WHEAT have been validated against clinical paper notes and clinical trial Case Report Forms and high levels of agreement have been shown. All parents of babies admitted to neonatal units are given an information sheet that explains the NNRD and its uses (service evaluations, audit and approved research) and that if they wish they may choose to opt out of clinical data entered into the electronic health records being held in the NNRD.</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;Extracting trial data in this way will be more efficient than conventional, duplicative, data collection and will increase value and reduce waste in research (Chalmers I <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;Use of the NNRD to support the trial has an additional fail-safe benefit in that a baby's data cannot be used for WHEAT unless there is a positive entry in the baby's electronic health record that the parent information sheet has been given and discussed with the parents; this entry will be signed by the person registering this on the system.</p><p>Inclusion benefit</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;We have stated that there may be a benefit of participating in clinical trials in the patient information sheet as follows: &#x0201c;Each of the two options in the WHEAT study is currently used by doctors in the UK because we do not know which one is better. For babies not taking part in the WHEAT study, the choice of whether or not to stop feeds is made according to the preference of the local medical team. This non-evidence based approach to neonatal care may involve more risk than being in a study like WHEAT which involves a carefully designed protocol and consistent monitoring&#x0201d;. Patients enrolled in randomised controlled trials, including those allocated to the control arm, have better outcomes than comparable non-participants.</p><p>&#x025b8;&#x02002;This has been most recently demonstrated in a large neonatal trial (Carlo <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), but the same benefit has been detected in previous neonatal (Schmidt <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and adult randomised trials (reviewed in Braunholtz <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).

We identify inconsistency between RECs in relation to whether &#x02018;opt-out&#x02019; consent is ethically valid, with 3 of 12 RECs rejecting our application on these grounds. We also show that the time taken by the UK NHS RECs to reach a final opinion was considerably less than the 60-day target set by the HRA.</p><p>Strengths include blinding of RECs to the comparative nature of the study, a priori defined outcomes and the use of a genuine clinical trial developed with extensive parent and multidisciplinary input. To our knowledge, this is the first blinded attempt to examine the consistency of the UK REC decision-making since the introduction in 2004 of a single UK-wide ethics application process. Previously, the Research Ethics Service has used an internal exercise known as <italic>shared ethical debate</italic> to examine consistency. This approach is limited because the committee is aware that it is part of an exercise to check consistency (and not a &#x02018;real&#x02019; application) and may therefore subject it to greater scrutiny than normal, or conversely conduct only cursory discussions and reach a decision without the same degree of scrutiny exercised for &#x02018;real&#x02019; applications. To date, none of these internal exercises has been published in the peer-reviewed literature. Additionally, <italic>shared ethical debates</italic> do not involve discussion with researchers, an important consideration as many issues raised by applications are addressed in dialogue at committee meetings or in correspondence. The key limitations of our study are the uncertain generalisability of our findings to other patient groups and beyond comparative effectiveness trials of commonly used treatments.</p><p>Inconsistencies in REC decision-making are long-recognised. The HRA has proposed a number of initiatives to make decisions more consistent.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These include greater engagement with researchers and a formal mechanism for capturing and sharing past decisions in relation to specific principles. We urge the HRA to continue to monitor consistency, evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives and create a searchable repository of decisions.</p><p>Stakeholders (including parents, parent representatives and health professionals) were involved throughout the development of WHEAT, and specifically considered opt-out consent to be valid and appropriate. This is in keeping with national<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and international<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> guidance for comparative effectiveness research. Although most RECs considered and incorporated this stakeholder involvement when reaching their decision, it is concerning that three RECs appeared to give less weight to the views of stakeholders, rejecting our application on the ground of opt-out consent. While opt-out consent is unlikely to be appropriate for studies where there is risk from exposure to non-routine or novel experimental agents or practices, it may actually be preferable for comparative effectiveness research as it results in higher recruitment and a less biased sample.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In determining the ethically appropriate limits for opt-out consent, it is essential to involve patients, public and frontline health professionals, in addition to academics and ethicists. This may be better served through a case-by-case approach, rather than more rigid &#x02018;top-down&#x02019; guidance.</p><p>Inclusion benefit is well described in the context of neonatal randomised controlled trials,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> most recently in the SUPPORT trial<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> where infants in both treatment groups had lower rates of death than similar infants not enrolled in the trial. The Declaration of Helsinki states that &#x0201c;each potential subject must be adequately informed of the&#x02026; anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We hold that informing research participants of potential benefits is as essential as discussing the risk of harm. We accept that the evidence for inclusion benefit is controversial, in particular in relation to point-of-care comparative effectiveness trials that aim for high participation rates. We suggest that, where possible, clinical trials should endeavour to collect aggregate anonymised primary outcome data from comparable patient groups not enrolled in the trial to inform future discussion about the potential harms and benefits of research participation.</p><p>Using routinely available EPR data in <italic>point-of-care trials</italic> or <italic>randomised registry trials</italic> has substantial potential to increase efficiency.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Such trials are ongoing in the UK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/projects/hta/1449127">http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/projects/hta/1449127</ext-link>) and internationally.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It is reassuring that no REC raised concerns about this approach given the potential to reduce research waste across many medical disciplines.</p><p>In many countries, researchers are required to obtain independent ethics review at each participating site for a multicentre study. This adds considerable administrative burden and also increases the likelihood of inconsistency in research ethics review<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref> that is largely hidden in the UK by the single approval system. Our study in conjunction with international evidence indicates that inconsistency in decision-making is commonplace across countries and healthcare systems; this serves neither patients nor researchers well and risks breakdowns in trust. This highlights the importance of sound policies to improve REC consistency.</p><p>Our study indicates that where an REC raises concerns that a researcher feels are unjustified, a clear written defence explaining the ethical basis, citing supporting precedent and demonstrating meaningful patient-public involvement is warranted. If this still results in an unfavourable opinion, we suggest resubmission to another REC including detailed justification of the approach adopted, in accordance with the HRA guidance.</p><p>Well-designed and appropriately powered clinical trials are essential to resolve uncertainty. Such trials require effective recruitment and data collection. It is reassuring that the majority of the UK RECs consider all four proposed approaches, namely point-of-care trial designs using the EPR data, short patient information sheets, recognition of the possibility of inclusion benefit and opt-out consent for comparative effectiveness research to be valid. We suggest that these approaches should be applied more widely to facilitate large, simple trials, reduce research waste and speed reductions in uncertainties in care.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Hugh Davis and Mrs Joan Kirkbride from the Health Research Authority for support, and Dr Robert Carr and Dr Sabita Uthaya for advice.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> The WHEAT trial development group members: C Gale, Senior Lecturer in Neonatal Medicine, Section of Neonatal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Campus, London, UK.
