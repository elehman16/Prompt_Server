Conducting rigorous, adequately powered trials of these interventions for patients with rare diseases is difficult. The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) is an international collaboration of patient organisations, clinicians and researchers. The aim of SPIN is to develop a research infrastructure to test accessible, low-cost self-guided online interventions to reduce disability and improve HRQL for people living with the rare disease systemic sclerosis (SSc or scleroderma). Once tested, effective interventions will be made accessible through patient organisations partnering with SPIN.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>SPIN will employ the cohort multiple randomised controlled trial (cmRCT) design, in which patients consent to participate in a cohort for ongoing data collection. The aim is to recruit 1500&#x02013;2000 patients from centres across the world within a period of 5&#x02005;years (2013&#x02013;2018). Eligible participants are persons &#x02265;18&#x02005;years of age with a diagnosis of SSc. In addition to baseline medical data, participants will complete patient-reported outcome measures every 3&#x02005;months. Upon enrolment in the cohort, patients will consent to be contacted in the future to participate in intervention research and to allow their data to be used for comparison purposes for interventions tested with other cohort participants. Once interventions are developed, patients from the cohort will be randomly selected and offered interventions as part of pragmatic RCTs. Outcomes from patients offered interventions will be compared with outcomes from trial-eligible patients who are not offered the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The use of the cmRCT design, the development of self-guided online interventions and partnerships with patient organisations will allow SPIN to develop, rigourously test and effectively disseminate psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions for people with SSc.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rheumatology</kwd><kwd>Statistics &#x00026; Research Methods</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation Medicine</kwd><kwd>Mental Health</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Article summary</title></caption><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions are used to attenuate disability and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) in many chronic diseases, but are typically not available for people with rare diseases.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Conducting rigorous, adequately powered trials of these interventions for patients with rare diseases is difficult.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) is an international collaboration of patient organisations, clinicians and researchers whose aim is to develop a research infrastructure to test accessible, low-cost, self-guided online interventions to reduce disability and improve HRQL for people living with scleroderma (systemic sclerosis).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>SPIN will employ the cohort multiple randomised controlled trial (cmRCT) design, in which patients consent to participate in a cohort for ongoing data collection.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The cohort framework will also be used to identify patients eligible for internet-based psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions that will be developed by SPIN investigators and to conduct feasibility and, subsequently, full-scale trials of these interventions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Once tested, effective interventions will be made accessible through patient organisations partnering with SPIN.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In the context of rare diseases, the advantage of the cmRCT design to conduct multiple trials that draw participants from the same patient cohort is particularly important given the difficulty of recruiting a sufficiently large patient group for any single trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Unique features of SPIN, including the use of the cmRCT design, the development of self-guided online interventions delivered using a common platform, and a robust partnership with patient organisations, may serve as a model to help facilitate research in this area for other rare diseases as well.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Providing better patient-centred care for people living with chronic diseases is increasingly prioritised in proposals to improve healthcare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Patient-centred care emphasises patient empowerment through shared decision-making, the development of care plans that take into consideration patient preferences and values, and the tailoring of care to meet the specific needs of individual patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2 R3 R4">2&#x02013;4</xref> Comprehensive care to attenuate disability and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) in chronic diseases involves a combination of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> People with rare diseases do not, however, typically have access to disease-specific psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions that are important components of patient-centred care.</p><p>The lack of accessible, evidence-based, disease-specific interventions is an important gap in patient care. Many people with rare diseases face unique challenges that are not addressed by generic interventions or interventions developed for other chronic diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> However, there are major obstacles to developing, evaluating and delivering psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions to meet the specific needs of people with rare diseases. An important barrier is the small number of people with a given rare disease at any single centre. Furthermore, most clinical research centres are often involved in many different trials and tend to prioritise trials of primary disease treatment over non-pharmacological intervention trials to reduce disability and improve HRQL.</p><p>Illustrating the extent of this problem, we conducted a PubMed search (&#x02018;<italic>randomized controlled trial</italic>&#x02019; (<italic>publication type</italic>) <italic>NOT</italic> &#x02018;<italic>drug therapy</italic>&#x02019; (<italic>subheading</italic>)) of the 6632 rare diseases listed by the US National Institutes of Health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> and found only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a psychosocial or rehabilitation intervention with the sample size of at least 100 patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> a relatively small number given typical sample size requirements to evaluate most psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Thus, for most rare diseases, there are either no trials that have tested psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions or only very small trials that are useful to evaluate feasibility, but inadequate for assessment of treatment efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12 R13">11&#x02013;13</xref></p><p>Beyond difficulties conducting RCTs, many factors also complicate the delivery of psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions to people with rare diseases. Few centres treat enough patients with a given rare disease to sustain a disease-specific psychosocial and rehabilitation intervention programme. Additionally, many patients with rare diseases live far from major treatment centres. These individuals often receive care in local settings from healthcare providers with little or no experience treating their disease and without knowledge about the specific needs of people with the disease. Patients who live in rural areas far from specialised care are often left to cope with their illness essentially alone, may lack even relatively basic information about their disease, and, in many cases, experience substantial difficulty coping.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Thus, finding a way to develop, test and deliver psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions for patients with rare diseases in a cost-effective manner is an important, but unsolved problem.</p><p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc, also known as scleroderma) is a rare disease where patients have important unaddressed psychosocial and rehabilitation needs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24 R25 R26 R27">24&#x02013;27</xref> There are no disease-modifying treatments for SSc and its management is predicated on identifying organ-specific disease manifestations and initiating targeted therapies (eg, calcium channel blockers for Raynaud's phenomenon, proton-pump inhibitors for gastrointestinal reflux disease and ACE inhibitors for SSc renal crisis).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Because there is no cure, a primary goal of care is to reduce symptoms and disability, and to improve HRQL. However, as with many rare diseases, evidence-based psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions to meet the specific needs of patients with SSc are not available. The authors of recent guidelines for SSc management<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> noted the potential importance of psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions in disease management, but could not make recommendations for or against these types of interventions due to a general lack of evidence.</p><p>The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> an international collaboration of patient organisations, clinicians and researchers was recently organised and funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to address this important gap. The long-term goals of SPIN are to develop, test and disseminate accessible interventions to complement standard medical care and improve HRQL outcomes in SSc. Once tested, effective interventions will be made accessible to patients with SSc through patient organisations around the world. SPIN currently is developing a series of interventions, including (1) general SSc self-management, (2) support for better coping with emotional distress; (3) support for managing body image distress and (4) physical and occupational therapy for hands. Other interventions that address areas important to people with scleroderma (eg, fatigue and energy management, sleep problems and sexual function) may be developed subsequently, depending on need and funding availability.</p><p>An important characteristic of SPIN is that all interventions will be delivered in a self-guided online format. Across medical fields, online delivery of interventions is increasingly common, and these interventions have successfully improved HRQL.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29 R30 R31">29&#x02013;31</xref> The utilisation of web-based technology is particularly important in the case of rare diseases where patients typically have difficulty accessing specialised services. A recent study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> found that 85% of Dutch patients with SSc had used the internet to search for information about SSc and that most of these patients (77&#x02013;88%) perceived access to online information on physical, psychological and social consequences of the disease as important.</p><p>SPIN will utilise a novel research design, the cohort multiple RCT (cmRCT) design,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> to collect longitudinal data related to problems experienced by people living with SSc and as a framework for developing, evaluating and delivering psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions. The aim of this article is to illustrate the use of the cmRCT design in a rare-disease context, which may serve as a model to help facilitate research in the area of non-pharmacological interventions for other rare diseases as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Spin cohort aims</title><p>The first step towards SPIN's long-term goals is the establishment of the SPIN Cohort. The specific aims of the SPIN Cohort are to:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Collect observational data at regular intervals on an ongoing basis in order to conduct research on problems identified by patients with SSc as important to them and to determine the best way to measure outcomes related to these problems, among other research questions that may be addressed via the cohort;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use the cohort framework to identify patients eligible for internet-based psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions that will be developed by SPIN investigators and to conduct feasibility and, subsequently, full-scale trials of these interventions.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Design</title><p>The cmRCT design,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> which SPIN will employ, was developed to take advantage of the benefits of cohort designs for longitudinal data collection and to address some important limitations to traditional RCT designs in the context of pragmatic RCTs. Pragmatic RCTs are intended to test the effectiveness of an intervention in everyday practice with relatively unselected participants and under flexible conditions, maximising the applicability of the trial's results to usual care settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> They differ from explanatory trials in that pragmatic trials are meant to inform decisions about practice rather than explain mechanistic aspects of an intervention under ideal circumstances. In this respect, pragmatic trials are well suited to assess whether patients benefit from adding an intervention to treatment as usual, compared with treatment as usual only.</p><p>The cmRCT design involves recruitment of an observational cohort, in which patients fill out a small set of core outcomes regularly. Patients enrolled in the cohort agree to allow their longitudinal data to be used in the aggregate. They also allow their data to be used to identify them to be invited to participate in research interventions, once developed, or for comparison purposes for intervention trials that may be conducted with other patients while they are participating in the cohort. In the cmRCT design, as described to patients when they consent to participate in the cohort, only eligible patients randomly selected to be offered an intervention, but not eligible non-selected patients, are contacted and offered treatment. Eligible patients not selected are not notified about the trial. Consent for specific trials will be obtained from those eligible patients who are invited and accept the offer to participate. Postintervention outcomes among eligible patients who accept the offer to receive the intervention will be compared with outcomes among patients from the cohort who were identified as eligible for the intervention, but were not offered the intervention and not contacted about the intervention.</p><p>In the context of rare diseases, the advantage of the cmRCT design to conduct multiple trials that draw participants from the same patient cohort is particularly important given the difficulty of recruiting a sufficiently large patient group for any single trial. No single trial will adequately address the psychosocial and rehabilitation needs of patients with a rare disease, such as SSc. The cmRCT design will enable the implementation of multiple trials over time with different inclusion and exclusion criteria, which, together, have much greater potential in this regard.</p><p>In many areas of research, interventions are tested in isolation, typically including different patient groups by different research teams. The cmRCT design allows for tests of interventions that can be compared in the same overall population with similar trial methods, thus increasing the ability to compare and contrast different trial results. Furthermore, whereas the ability to collect long-term outcomes is often limited in single RCTs, core patient measures are assessed on an ongoing basis in the cmRCT model. Thus, key outcomes can be obtained over a long period post-trial for patients who participate in trials.</p><p>The cmRCT design also offers advantages in that the patient consent process more closely replicates what occurs in actual healthcare settings compared with the consent procedures typically used in traditional RCT designs. In traditional RCTs, patients are usually told that they will be randomised to obtain the trial intervention or an alternative, which in pragmatic trials of psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions is generally usual care. In real-life healthcare situations, patients are only told of treatments that their healthcare provider can provide with certainty, and they are not told that the treatment they receive will be decided by chance. In the cmRCT design, patients are told about treatments that they will be able to access if they so choose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> As part of the initial consent process, patients are made aware that a number of trials may occur via the cohort, and that they will not likely be offered to participate in all of them and may not be offered to participate in any. It is explained that patients will only be notified about trials for which they will be offered the intervention, but that their data may be used for comparison purposes in the context of some interventions not offered to them.</p><p>Beyond increasing the ecological validity of the recruitment and consent process itself, it is possible that the cmRCT approach may increase the representativeness of trial participants, and thus the generalisability of results. Indeed, concerns about information and consent are the most common reasons for patients not participating at all in traditional RCTs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> These concerns likely play a role in the relatively low trial participation rates and may reduce the ecological validity of trials if patients who consent to participate comprise a small and qualitatively different group than the overall patient population who will receive the intervention in practice. Because the cmRCT design collects data on patients before they have accepted or refused the intervention, the cmRCT design also allows for collection of important information about the reasons that patients refuse an intervention and why certain patients were unable to complete the assigned intervention. This information is valuable both for assessing the validity of modelling assumptions and for predicting the success of the intervention in the general population.</p><p>In many pragmatic trials of psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions patients who consent to participate in a trial may do so because they would like the opportunity to receive the trial intervention rather than treatment as usual. Patients cannot usually be fully blinded regarding whether treatment has been offered. Therefore, patients randomised into the &#x02018;treatment as usual&#x02019; arm, may be disappointed and some may even withdraw from the study, leading to attrition bias that might influence the results of the trial. This disappointment can also influence the perception of care and reporting of trial outcomes for patients who do not withdraw, but who are aware that they did not receive the treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> In the cmRCT design, patients will be aware when they do receive an intervention, but not when they have not been selected for an intervention trial, thus, potentially reducing the possibility of disappointment bias.</p><p>The use of the cmRCT design by SPIN to facilitate research on non-pharmacological interventions for people with SSc is feasible due to the international, multicentre nature of the network, which will facilitate the inclusion of a sufficient number of patients with SSc in the SPIN Cohort. Initially, the SPIN Cohort will be used to describe and better understand the nature of problems that have been identified by people with SSc as important<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> and to determine optimal outcome measures to use in SPIN intervention trials. Once SPIN interventions are developed, patients eligible for a given trial will be identified based on trial-specific criteria using core SPIN Cohort measures (see online supplementary appendix 1), and a random selection of these eligible patients will be offered the trial intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013003563F1">figure 1</xref>). In the SPIN Cohort, patients can participate in one SPIN intervention at the time, but may be offered to participate in more than one SPIN intervention sequentially. Core outcomes (25&#x02013;30&#x02005;min to complete) will be assessed every 6&#x02005;months with brief 3-month assessments (5&#x02005;min to complete) in between. For patients who are eligible for a SPIN intervention trial and are assigned to the intervention or control groups, the 3-month assessment will also include trial-specific measures. Since determination of trial eligibility will be automated using routinely collected cohort measures, all patients who are eligible for an active SPIN trial at a given point in time will automatically be administered the trial-specific measures.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013003563F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Outline of the cohort multiple randomised controlled trial design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013003563f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Study sample</title><p>We expect to initially recruit 1500&#x02013;2000 patients for the SPIN Cohort from SPIN centres in Canada, the USA, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico and Australia over a period of 5&#x02005;years (2013&#x02013;2018).

After completion of registration by a recruiting SPIN physician, an automated welcoming email will be sent to participants with instructions to complete the SPIN patient measures online. Two weeks prior to each 3-month follow-up, participants will receive an email reminding them to go online and complete their forms. On the date of the follow-up assessment, a second notification email will be sent to patients, reminding them to complete the questionnaires online. If 1&#x02005;week after the assessment date the questionnaire has not yet been completed, an SPIN investigator will contact the patient to encourage them to go online and complete the forms. If a patient has not filled out the questionnaires within 2&#x02005;weeks after the assessment date, their data will not be collected for that assessment cycle. Patients who do not complete forms at a particular SPIN Cohort assessment are eligible to continue in the SPIN Cohort and will be contacted for subsequent assessments.

Additional measures will be integrated into the SPIN Cohort periodically for the purpose of conducting measurement-related substudies (with a total of 25&#x02013;30&#x02005;min to complete). The core measures will determine eligibility for SPIN feasibility trials and subsequent full-scale trials, once initiated. At the 3-month interval between two core measurement occasions, a brief assessment of HRQL will be completed (5&#x02005;min to complete).

For each intervention, semistructured interviews will be conducted with 15&#x02013;20 randomly selected participants to assess the acceptability, utility and practicality of intervention components, and usefulness of proposed study outcome measures. Interviews will be conducted using established methods for qualitative process evaluation of trials as developed by Donovan <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> We will use a topic guide to ensure consistency across participants, but with a flexible format to allow participants to generate naturalistic data related to their experience and on what they consider as important and/or successful in terms of treatment outcomes. For all SPIN interventions, feasibility study results will be used to refine the methodology and analysis plans for the full-scale RCTs.</p></sec><sec id="s3e4"><title>Full-scale RCTs</title><p>In traditional RCTs, the effectiveness of an intervention may be assessed using per-protocol analysis, which includes only those patients who successfully completed the treatment originally allocated, or an intention-to-treat analysis (ITT), which compares patients in the groups to which they were originally allocated after randomisation, irrespective of whether or not the patient received or completed the allocated treatment. ITT is widely recommended as the preferred analysis, since it addresses the effectiveness of the intervention for all patients who agree to attempt the treatment, rather than only for patients who successfully complete it, as with per-protocol analysis. The primary analysis for SPIN trials will be ITT, comparing the outcomes of randomly selected patients who are offered the intervention, to eligible patients who were not offered the intervention.</p><p>In the cmRCT design, however, randomisation occurs prior to offer of intervention, and some number of eligible patients who are randomly selected to be offered an intervention will not accept the offer. In addition to ITT analysis, it is of interest to assess the effect of an intervention among patients who accept the offer. Ideally, we would compare outcomes for patients who accept the offer of the intervention to patients who are not offered the intervention, but would have accepted if they had received an offer. This is because patients who agree to attempt an intervention may be different in important ways from patients who decline the offer of an intervention. Because we cannot actually know which patients who are not offered the intervention would have accepted if offered, we will use Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> to make this comparison, as a secondary analysis for SPIN trials. CACE assumes that the proportion of patients in the non-offer group who would have refused the offer is the same as for the group who were offered the intervention. Furthermore, CACE assumes that outcomes are the same among patients who refuse the intervention and patients who would have refused the intervention, if offered. On this basis, an intervention effect can be estimated that compares patients in the offer group who accepted the intervention offer to patients in the non-offer group who would have accepted the intervention if offered (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013003563F2">figure 2)</xref>.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013003563F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Outline of complier average causal effect analysis in the cohort multiple randomised controlled trial design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013003563f02"/></fig><p>All SPIN full-scale trials will be registered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref> and will be conducted and reported in accordance with standards articulated in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Extension for Non-pharmacological Trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>

The novel cmRCT design<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> that will be utilised by SPIN is a promising approach to move forward research in this area. It will allow SPIN to both collect important observational data in a longitudinal cohort and to conduct multiple pragmatic RCTs in the same cohort.</p><p>The use of the cmRCT design in SPIN is highly feasible due to its international multicentre nature. The features of the cmRCT design make it a good option for conducting research in the context of rare chronic diseases, as well as comparing psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions to treatment as usual in pragmatic trials. There may be a number of circumstances, however, in which the cmRCT design is less suitable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> These include, for instance, acute or short-term conditions, double-blinded trials with a placebo arm and treatments for which the uptake by patients may be low. In addition, the use of relatively easy obtainable patient-reported outcomes, as in the SPIN Cohort, facilitates research using the cmRCT design, compared to more expensive and time-intensive measures such as conducting laboratory tests, which would not be feasible in the context of the cmRCT.</p><p>The end goal of SPIN is to make psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions available through patient organisations. The collaboration of investigators with patient organisation partners has been crucial in the establishment of SPIN. Prior to launching SPIN, a series of projects were conducted in collaboration with patients from organisations across Canada (eg, Scleroderma Societies of Canada and Ontario, Scl&#x000e9;rodermie Qu&#x000e9;bec, the Scleroderma Association of British Columbia), the USA (USA Scleroderma Foundation) and Europe (Federation of European Scleroderma Associations), which has helped to better understand important problems faced by persons living with SSc and to prioritise gaps in access to psychosocial and rehabilitation services.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref> Each of the proposed SPIN interventions is grounded in this work, and integrated knowledge transfer will play a major role in developing, adapting and disseminating interventions to best address the needs of persons with SSc.

Unique features of SPIN, including the use of the cmRCT design, the development of self-guided online interventions delivered using a common platform, and a robust partnership with patient organisations, may serve as a model to help facilitate research in this area for other rare diseases as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e888" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003563.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LK and LRJ participated in the design of the study and its coordination and contributed to drafting the manuscript.
