This study aims to investigate the effect of oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation on the progression of renal function and nutritional indices in patients with predialysis advanced CKD. Forty patients with predialysis stage 5 CKD(estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR &#x0003c;15mL/min per 1.73m<sup>2</sup>) and 40 patients with stage 4 CKD (eGFR 15 to 30mL/min per 1.73m<sup>2</sup>) who had a total CO<sub>2</sub> less than 22mEq/L were assigned into the bicarbonate treatment group or control group for 12 months. In stage 4 CKD, there were significant differences in the changes of eGFR during the study between the treatment group and the control group (-2.30&#x000b1;4.49 versus -6.58&#x000b1;6.32mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, p&#x0003c;0.05). However, in stage 5 CKD, there were no significant differences in the change of eGFR during the study between the two groups (-2.10&#x000b1;2.06 versus -3.23&#x000b1;1.95mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>).There were no significant differences in the changes of nutritional indices such as albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, total lymphocyte count (TLC), and Ondodera's prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) during the study between the two groups.

Patients were assigned to receive either oral sodium bicarbonate in the treatment group or standard care without alkali in the control group for 12 months. In the 40 patients with alkali treatment group, the dosage of sodium bicarbonate (Tasna&#x000ae;, HCO<sub>3</sub> 5.95 mEq/500mg) were started 1,000mg thrice daily and then were adjusted as necessary to maintain total CO<sub>2</sub> level greater than 22mEq/L. We excluded patients with malignant disease, liver cirrhosis, infection, sepsis, and overt congestive heart failure. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chungbuk National University Hospital. Blood pressure, body weight, serum electrolyte, total CO<sub>2</sub>, creatinine, BUN, eGFR, calcium, phosphorous, intact PTH were assessed at baseline and 12 month of the study.

TLC was calculated by multiplying the percentage of lymphocytes with the total white blood cell count. The OPNI was calculated based on the serum albumin and total lymphocyte count, using the following equation: OPNI=10&#x000d7;serum albumin (g/dL)+0.005&#x000d7;total lymphocyte count (/mm<sup>3</sup>)<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11)</xref>.</p><p>SigmaPlot 12.0 for windows software was used for all statistical analysis (Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA, USA).
