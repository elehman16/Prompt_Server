In this Phase I randomised controlled clinical trial in HIV-1 negative volunteers we investigate whether the site and mode of DNA vaccination influences the quality of the cellular immune responses. We adopted a strategy of concurrent immunization combining IM injection with either ID or TC administration. As a third arm we assessed the response to IM injection administered with electroporation (EP). The DNA plasmid encoded a MultiHIV B clade fusion protein designed to induce cellular immunity. The vaccine and regimens were well tolerated. We observed differential shaping of vaccine induced virus-specific CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;and CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;cell-mediated immune responses. DNA given by IM&#x02009;+&#x02009;EP promoted strong IFN-&#x003b3; responses and potent viral inhibition. ID&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM without EP resulted in a similar pattern of response but of lower magnitude. By contrast TC&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM (without EP) shifted responses towards a more Th-17 dominated phenotype, associated with mucosal and epidermal protection.

Differences in the density and phenotype of antigen presenting cells (APCs) appear critical in shaping the ensuing adaptive immunity, as the original antigen encounter with APCs determines subsequent imprinting of the quality of the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. There are two main target tissues used for parenteral vaccination: the skin (epidermis and dermis) and muscle. In the absence of tissue damage or inflammation, skeletal muscle contains a relatively small population of resident immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. By contrast the skin is rich in professional APCs, including epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) and dermal dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to migrate to draining lymph nodes and trigger immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Infiltrating polymorphonuclear (PMN) neutrophils may also play a unique role in acting as &#x0201c;antigen carriers&#x0201d; delivering immunogens and engulfed apoptotic cells to APCs in the bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, influencing the quality of CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cell responses.</p><p id="Par3">Intramuscular (IM) vaccination is entirely dependent upon the influx of monocytes that differentiate into APC and PMNs, whilst the uptake and transport of antigen in the skin is likely mediated by both resident and recruited APC/PMNs. Their recruitment and activation is typically triggered by an inflammatory response, which is the basis of most adjuvant strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Plasmid DNA (pDNA) is able to induce innate activation by triggering cytoplasmic sensing through the cGAS/STING/IRF7 pathway leading to type I interferon secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The extent to which different APC subsets respond to pDNA has not been fully characterised.</p><p id="Par4">Muscle remains the site of choice for DNA vaccination due to its relative mass, ability to accommodate relatively large volumes of DNA and the ease of myocyte transduction. Although cellular immune responses can be induced by IM injection alone, DNA electroporation (EP) has increasingly been shown to overcome the limitations of this route in humans. EP creates an electric field at the vaccine site breaking down muscle cells and creating temporary cell membrane instability, thereby facilitating increased uptake of DNA. Importantly, the inflammation associated with EP is also thought to enhance APC recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In recent phase I HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine trials, IM DNA vaccination with EP has been shown to improve both cellular and antibody mediated responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Cutaneous vaccination by skin scarification represents the oldest and most successful route of vaccination used for traditional smallpox vaccines, dependent on the generation of protective T-cell memory immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Surprisingly transcutaneous (TC) vaccination, despite the potential to target different APCs, has been underexplored for vaccine delivery in clinical trials. Recent work, by us and others, highlights the potential benefits of hair follicle targeting following cyanoacrylate skin surface stripping as a promising delivery technique for transcutaneous immunization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A previous comparative clinical study using an inactivated influenza vaccine indicated preferential amplification of CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;effector-T cells after TC application in comparison to IM injection, comparable CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;responses were induced by both routes of administration, while humoral responses were induced by IM administration only<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown effective DNA immunization via hair follicles following hair depilation in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These results provide a strong rationale for adapting DNA vaccination strategies for complex infections such as HIV, influenza, hepatitis C virus and cancer, where cellular responses are considered central to controlling disease. To the best of our knowledge there is no documented evaluation of transcutaneous DNA vaccination in humans. Intradermal (ID) delivery by contrast has been extensively studied in many clinical trials of protein-based vaccines. The higher density of intradermal APC and their efficient loading can result in dose sparing with some vaccines using up to a tenth of the standard dose for intramuscular immunization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Few clinical studies have directly compared the performance of the two routes for delivery of DNA but preliminary data suggests ID administration to be dose sparing and superior with or without EP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The findings are supported by animal data suggesting that greater polyfunctional CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cell responses are seen after ID administration of a DNA vaccine even at 20% of the dose when the same vaccine is administered IM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In this Phase I randomised controlled clinical trial we investigate whether the site and mode of DNA vaccination can influence the quality of the cellular immune responses, using a vaccine specifically designed to induce cellular and not antibody responses. In order to overcome the constraints on the volume that can be delivered via TC and ID routes (maximum of 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;l), we employed a strategy of concurrent immunization combining IM injection (4&#x02009;mg dose, IM<sub>4</sub>) with either ID or TC administration (0.4&#x02009;mg dose, ID<sub>0.4</sub> and TC<sub>0.4</sub>). We hypothesized that such combined vaccination might tailor the quality of the immune responses by maximizing transgene expression through IM injection, while targeting diverse APC populations mediated by TC or ID co-administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Our own studies in mice have suggested that co-administration (ID&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM) of a DNA vaccine enhanced cellular responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. As a third arm we assessed the response to IM<sub>4</sub> injection (full dose) administered with EP. In an attempt to maximize gene expression we used a DNA plasmid employing the gene transfer unit (GTU&#x000ae;) technology which utilizes the bovine papilloma virus type 1 (BPV1) transcriptional activator, the segregation/partitioning factor E2 protein, and its multimeric binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This has been shown to result in enhanced transcriptional activity along with the potential for increasing the number of cells expressing the transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The same plasmid has been shown to have a modest impact on viral load when administered to HIV positive subjects in South Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We report on the safety of this DNA vaccine in HIV-1 negative volunteers and demonstrate differential shaping of CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;and CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;cell-mediated immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>GTU<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>MultiHIV B clade DNA vaccine is well tolerated in healthy HIV negative adult volunteers when delivered by TC, ID and IM administration with and without EP</title><p id="Par7">Study volunteers were self-selected members of the public responding to recruitment material that invited an expression of interest to take part in the trial. 58 participants were screened with 30 deemed eligible and enrolled according to the protocol defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Supplemental Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Three participants (one from each group) did not complete all vaccine visits: in group 1 the participant moved away before the trial was completed and only received two vaccinations; in group 2 the participant chose not to receive the third vaccine due to mild to moderate persisting hypopigmentation following TC administration of the DNA vaccine; in group 3 the participant chose not to continue with vaccinations due to moderate pain as a result of the EP after the first vaccination (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This resulted in a total number of 27 volunteers completing the full trial protocol with a total of 86/90 doses of vaccine administered according to the protocol-defined groups. The majority of participants were White (77%), and male (56%). The mean age was 30.7&#x02009;years (Supplemental Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The immunogenicity analysis is presented per protocol (PP) and excludes the participants that did not complete the immunisations.</p><p id="Par8">Overall the GTU<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>MultiHIV B clade DNA vaccine was safe and similarly tolerated across all 3 vaccination groups. Two individuals (TC, EP) chose to discontinue following adverse events, although this was not due to clinical concerns. The majority of unsolicited adverse events were unrelated to vaccination and there were no serious adverse events during the trial. From participant diary card entries capturing solicited events, there were no major differences in general symptoms across the groups (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). There were a greater number of local (arm) symptoms reported in the TC<sub>0.4</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub> group compared to the ID<sub>0.4</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub> group (Supplemental Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Of note 5/11 participants in the TC<sub>0.4</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub> group reported either hypo or hyperpigmentation over the transcutaneous vaccine site, most likely a post-inflammatory phenomenon to DNA vaccination. This has not been previously observed following TC vaccination when using seasonal influenza vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Although all these skin changes resolved, 1 participant in this group declined the final vaccine at week 12 due to persistent hypopigmentation which started at week 4.</p><p id="Par9">The EP tolerability data collected from participants receiving all three immunizations shows the maximum grade of pain reported immediately and 30&#x02009;minutes after EP with the majority of responses rated as moderate and mild respectively (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Although one participant declined further immunisations with EP due to pain, no-one thought that the procedure was unacceptable if it protected people from a serious disease for which no vaccine was currently available (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Lack of humoral response to the GTU<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>MultiHIV B clade DNA vaccine</title><p id="Par10">The GTU<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>MultiHIV B clade DNA vaccine was designed to induce cellular responses, encoding a fusion protein with no secretion signal.

This alteration in the pattern of CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cell response is striking given the low dose of DNA applied by TC. These data suggest that TC administration has a qualitatively different impact on induced cellular response to that of ID<sub>0.4</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub>, where responses were generally lower and, with the exception of IL-2, more closely aligned to EP&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub> than TC<sub>0.4</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="Par19">The preferential induction of TNF-&#x003b1; over IFN-&#x003b3; responses in the TC<sub>0.4</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub> group reflects the phenotype of CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;responses seen in a previous clinical trial following the TC administration of the influenza/tetanus vaccine (Tetagrip)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

One of the two non-responders (C058) in the EP&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub> had poor IFN-&#x00263; ELISpot responses, however the other (C043) responded in a similar fashion to those showing viral inhibition (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Furthermore, there was no correlation between the magnitude or kinetics of response and the number of viruses inhibited. These data suggest that IFN-&#x00263; ELISpot assays may be a poor predictor of the ability of CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells to effect viral inhibition. Nevertheless, the frequency of responders to EP-IM in the viral inhibition was similar to that observed in a previous study delivering an HIV DNA (HIVMAG) vaccine using the same EP device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

In the context of vaccination, central memory cells can quickly mount greater anamnestic effector responses than those of Tem, which have a limited proliferative capacity and are dependent on persistent antigens. Although there were insufficient cells to determine the antiviral mechanisms or epitope specificity associated with viral inhibition in this study, these will be important issue to address in future studies.</p><p id="Par22">The observation that DNA electroporation enhanced IFN-&#x003b3; cellular responses that were predominantly CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cell mediated with a lesser contribution from CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;cells supports previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, the surprising observation was that TC<sub>0.4</sub> administration when combined with IM<sub>4</sub> administration, in the absence of EP, induced a total cellular response of similar magnitude but with a distinct cytokine profile to that induced by EP&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub>. The higher levels of local reactogenicity and observed changes in pigmentation suggest that DNA by TC administration was capable of inducing local innate responses that might have been critical in shaping the induced immune response. This combined with differences in the number and phenotype of local APC compared to muscle is likely to have caused the strong skewing of the induced cellular response towards a TNF&#x003b1;/IL-17a/CD154 phenotype. Knowing the volume constraints for TC administration (1/10<sup>th</sup> dose given IM) we chose to evaluate the combined use of TC<sub>0.4</sub> and IM<sub>4</sub> administration, therefore we cannot determine the relative contribution of either TC<sub>0.4</sub> or IM<sub>4</sub> to the observed immune response profile. Nevertheless, responses to the combination (TC<sub>0.4</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub>) were greater in magnitude and of a distinct phenotype to that seen with ID<sub>0.4</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;IM<sub>4</sub> administration. It should be noted that we did not include a group receiving empty plasmid by TC<sub>0.4</sub> delivery combined with active IM<sub>4</sub> administration, therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that the innate response to TC<sub>0.4</sub> DNA delivery alone might have driven a similar response profile. However, previous studies have shown that DNA formulated with cationic polyplexes applied to a large surface area (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;40&#x02009;cm) of exfoliated skin can induce immune response in non-human primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and are expressed in the hair follicles of mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Our own data demonstrate that hair follicle targeting following cyanoacrylate skin surface stripping is a promising delivery technique for transcutaneous DNA immunization. Future studies are required to determine the relative contributions of innate and adaptive responses to TC DNA administration and explore potential gains that might be achieved through polyplex formulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and/or non-invasive skin electroporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">Taken together, these data clearly identify that the site and mode of DNA vaccination can influence the quality of induced cellular responses. DNA given with intramuscular electroporation promoted stronger IFN-&#x003b3; responses and potent viral inhibition, while transcutaneous administration combined with intramuscular delivery (without EP) shifted responses towards a more Th-17 dominated phenotype, associated with mucosal and epidermal protection.

After blocking, and washing, sera diluted 1:100 in assay buffer from baseline, weeks 1, 4, 5, 12, 14 and 20 were incubated for 1&#x02009;hour at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Standard curves were prepared starting at 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL for purified IgG and 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL for IgA (Sigma Adrich, UK) and serially diluted 1:5. Plates were washed 4 times with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20). Goat anti-human IgG HRP- or IgA HRP-conjugated antibodies (Sigma Aldrich, UK) were used to detect antigen specific IgG and IgA antibodies. Substrate was added (SureBlue TMB 1-Component peroxidase substrate KPL, UK) and stopped after 5&#x02009;minutes with the addition of TMB stop solution (KPL, UK). Plates were then read at 450&#x02009;nm on a VersaMax 96-well microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The ELISA data is expressed as positive if the blank-subtracted OD<sub>450</sub>&#x02009;
<sub>nm</sub> was above the pre-determined cut-off of O.D 0.2&#x02009;nm and values were on the linear range of the standard curve. To ensure assay sensitivity, a positive control composed of pooled plasma samples from HIV positive donors was used. Analysis of the data was performed using SoftMax ProGxP software (version 5.4, Molecular Devices). Mucosal samples were also collected at baseline and the primary end point. Genital tract secretions from women were collected using the Instead Softcup&#x02122; (Evofem Inc) and urethral swabs (Hunt Biologics, UK) from male volunteers and rectal Floq&#x02122; swabs were taken when possible from males and females, primarily to assess the feasibility of the sampling method. Vaginal samples were self-inserted by female participants, collected after 60&#x02009;mins, processed and analysed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Urethral swabs were self-inserted by male participants in clinic by inserting the swab into the urethra allowing it to absorb secretions for 2&#x02009;minutes. Rectal Floq&#x02122; swabs were clinician-inserted into the anus and rotated to collect secretions, either with or without the use of a proctoscope depending on participant preference. Rectal and urethral swabs were either snap frozen on receipt or processed directly. Rectal and urethral swabs were placed in the top chamber of a spin X tube and exudates either analysed immediately using the ELISA method described above, or were aliquoted and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Viral Inhibition Assay</title><p id="Par38">This assay is based on a modified version of a previously established assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

Therefore for each participant, there was generation of one culture of pre vaccination CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells and two CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cell cultures (one pre and one post vaccination). A panel of six viruses was used in this assay. Three clade B viruses were used in the panel, (IIIB, CH077, CH106) with 3 cross clade viruses (ELI clade AD, U455 clade A, CBL4 clade D). HIV-1 isolates IIIB (accession number HXB2 K03455, subtype B), ELI (K03454, subtype A/D) and U455 (M62320 subtype A), were provided by the HIV AIDS reagent repository, CH77 (JN944909, subtype B) and CH106 (JN944897, subtype B) were generously donated by George Shaw, University of Birmingham, AL, USA) and CBL4 (subtype D) was provided by the National Institutes of Biological Standards and Control, UK).</p><p id="Par39">Frozen PBMCs from the specified time points were thawed and adjusted to 0.8&#x02013;1.5 million viable PBMC per ml with R10 media. For the generation of CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;targets, PBMC were incubated for 3&#x02009;days (37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/5% C0<sub>2</sub>) in R10 media supplemented with 0.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml CD3/8 bispecific antibody (kindly provided by J.

On day 3 the starting volume was doubled by adding R10/50 (50&#x02009;units IL-2 per ml of R10). On day 6, the culture volume was again doubled and incubation continued. On day 7 (day of infection), cells were re-suspended and counted. CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;cells were infected with the virus panel specified at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 (10000 TCID<sub>50</sub> per million CD4 cells) for 4&#x02009;hours at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/5% C0<sub>2</sub>.

Post infection on days 3, 6, 8, and 10, 500&#x02009;&#x000b5;l supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh R10/50. On day 13 post infection supernatant was removed and virus lysed using 10% triton (Perkin Elmer) and frozen. The supernatants were analysed for p24 content at a later stage using an ELISA (Perkin Elmer) and CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cell mediated inhibition was indicated by the level of p24 in the supernatant of infected cells plus CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;cells from the time points, in comparison to infected CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;cells alone.

Data sets included: (i) intention to treat (ITT); all participants who were randomised and received at least one vaccination and (ii) per protocol (PP); all participants who completed vaccinations with no major protocol deviations. The primary safety outcome was expressed as a proportion of participants with 95% confidence interval, and groups were compared using Fishers exact test. There was no pre-specified hypothesis on which to power the study. Immunological analyses were based on the PP population that received all vaccinations. Appropriate comparative statistics are annotated in the text. A two-sided P value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant and data were analysed using Graphpad Prism software version 6.0. For the immunogenicity analysis, the primary end point was defined as 2 weeks after the third and final vaccine (week 14). The difference in magnitude of the INF-&#x00263; response between the groups at the specified time points including the primary end point for each peptide was compared using an unpaired non-parametric t test (Mann-Witney test). Results were considered statistically significant if the 2 tailed P value was &#x0003c;0.05. For the analysis of the difference within each individual group week 0 and week 14, a paired t test (Wilcoxon matched-pairs singed rank test) was used where statistical significance was set at p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Data Availability</title><p id="Par41">All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article (and its Supplementary Information files).
