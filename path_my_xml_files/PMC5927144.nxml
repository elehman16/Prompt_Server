Cellulite is the noninflammatory pathology of the subcutaneous tissue affecting over 80% of postpubertal females, and it is frequently localized on the thigh and buttock regions characterized by the &#x0201c;orange peel&#x0201d; appearance. It is frequently associated with localized fat deposits and flaccid skin, influenced by female sex hormones, and the localized fat in these areas is metabolically more stable and resistant to lipolysis.<xref rid="b1-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Nowadays, there are several noninvasive and minimally invasive technologies to improve the appearance of skin and subcutaneous fat, such as radiofrequency, cryolipolysis, manual massage, carboxytherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound, among others.<xref rid="b4-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Nonfocused ultrasound and electrical stimulation are therapeutic modalities commonly used in physiotherapy practice and, when used simultaneously, they are called Combined Therapy.

The investigator examined the subjects and marked the treatment area which included the gluteous area and posterior thighs. All the participants underwent anthropometric measurements, circumference measurements, skin firmness measurement and measurements of the thickness of the fat layer. All measurement readings were taken by a trained physiotherapist blind to the group interventions. Each subject was evaluated by the same physiotherapist at each visit. The assessments were carried out in the Center for Education and Advanced Training (CEFAI) clinic before and 15 days after the last session of treatment. Patient inclusion criteria were the presence of clinically appreciable skin laxity, localized subcutaneous fat and cellulite in the buttocks and posterior thighs area, and also, a body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Volunteers were excluded if they had undergone some kind of treatment in the gluteal region and thighs for up to 6 months before the start of this study; if they were pregnant or had been pregnant recently (&#x0003c;6 months); if they had cardiovascular problems, metabolic disorders, respiratory disorders, immunosuppression, kidney and/or liver failure and skin lesions in the treatment area; or if they had diabetes mellitus.

The treatment was performed in the Clinical Laboratory of the Ibramed Center for Education and Advanced Training (CEFAI) (Amparo, Sao Paulo, Brazil). This is a nonrandomized clinical trial and was performed in two cities from S&#x000e3;o Paulo state, Brazil. Participants from city 1 (Itapira) were allocated to G1(n=10) and received Combined Therapy. Participants from city 2 (Jacutinga) were allocated to G2 (n=10) and received Combined Therapy with additional vibratory platform treatment. All volunteers were given directions about the treatment steps and procedures to be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>Both groups (G1 and G2) were treated with Heccus (Ibramed Ind&#x000fa;stria Brasileira de Equipamentos M&#x000e9;dicos EIRELI, Amparo, Sao Paulo, Brazil), a device that uses a combination of electrical stimulation (Aussie current, high-voltage pulsed current or polarized current) and ultrasound (1 or 3 MHz), with the intensity ranging between 0.1 and 3.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The protocol used was continuous ultrasound (3 MHz; 2 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) plus Aussie current (4 kHz; modulated in 10 Hz; with an intensity of 40&#x02013;60 mA, enough to produce a strong, but comfortable paresthesia). The device was previously calibrated by the manufacturer, and the treatment time was calculated as described by Watson<xref rid="b9-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and ranged from 30 to 60 min per session, which was variable according to the area size, allowing at least 1 min of treatment time for each area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. In other words, the area to be treated was divided by the effective radiation area, and the result was considered as the treatment time. The treatment was applied on the buttocks and the posterior thigh areas bilaterally. Ultrasound gel (RMC, Amparo, Sao Paulo, Brazil) was first applied and the transducer was used over the target area with a constant pressure. The session of the G2 was associated with 10 min of the vibratory platform Kikos p204I<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (WKS Fitness e Servi&#x000e7;os T&#x000e9;cnicos LTDA &#x02013; ME, Sao Paulo, Brazil). The volunteers stood on the platform, with upright spine and semi-flexed knees. The frequency used was 10 Hz and the treatment time was divided in two periods of 5 min with 2 min of interval between each activity. All the volunteers received 10 sessions of treatment, twice a week for 5 weeks. Prior to the start of the treatment, a clinical evaluation was performed, which was considered as baseline and was later compared to evaluations collected 15 days after the last treatment session.</p></sec><sec><title>Anthropometric measurements</title><p>In assessing the weight and height, the volunteers wore only underwear and did not wear shoes. A classical mechanical stadiometer (model 110 CH; Welmy, Santa B&#x000e1;rbara D&#x02019;Oeste, Brazil) was used. The BMI was evaluated by applying the formula BMI=weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m<sup>2</sup>).<xref rid="b22-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The circumference of treated areas was evaluated using a flexible tape measure. The buttocks were measured considering the upper point of the curve of the hip. Each measurement point was recorded at baseline to ensure that subsequent measurements were obtained at the same location.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Ultrasound analysis</title><p>All the volunteers participating in the study underwent diagnostic ultrasound that was performed at baseline and 15 days after the proposed treatment using a linear transducer (frequency 6&#x02013;18 MHz; MyLab<sup>&#x02122;</sup> 25 Gold; Esaote, Genova, Italy), and VPan software (Esaote) was used for the construction of panoramic images. All panoramic images were taken in the standing position. The probe was slipped at a slow and regular speed in the distal/proximal direction, with coupling gel, along the areas without compressing the tissue. Panoramic images were analyzed quantitatively by measuring the subcutaneous tissue between anatomic planes (dermis and muscular fascia and the thickness of fat at the treatment site was measured using the measurement tool on the ultrasound machine). Qualitative analysis considering the hyperechoic areas was also performed to evaluate the severity of cellulite. Bright echoes represent highly reflective structures (white = dermis and fibrotic septa) and hypoechoic areas are represented by sparse echoes, reflection or intermediate transmission (gray = adipose tissue and skeletal muscle). Fat layer thickness was measured in three points per image from the dermis&#x02013;fat interface down to the deep fat&#x02013;muscle fascia interface in the posterior thighs and the buttocks areas. Measurements were made by a single trained physiotherapist. For the analysis of cellulite, an independent radiologist conducted a blind analysis of all ultrasonography images 15 days after the last session of treatment and it was compared to baseline. The criterion of comparison was the condition of the improvement of cellulite when a hyperechoic decrease was demonstrated in the areas of fibrous connective tissue septa.<xref rid="b23-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Skin viscoelasticity measurements</title><p>A Cutometer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> MPA 580 (Courage &#x00026; Khazaka GmbH, K&#x000f6;ln, Germany) was used to assess skin firmness on the areas at baseline and 15 days after the final treatment. The resistance of the skin to the negative pressure and its ability to return to its original position was evaluated. Before each set of measurements, volunteers were required to equilibrate in a closed environment with a constant temperature (20&#x000b0;C&#x000b1;2&#x000b0;C) and humidity (55%&#x02013;65% relative humidity). A probe of 2 mm hole was used, and the parameters selected were as follows: measurement mode 1, pressure of 450 mbar, on time of 5 s and off time of 3 s and the measurements were performed in triplicate. A single investigator (a trained physiotherapist) blinded to participants&#x02019; group allocation performed all measurements. Analyses of the biomechanical characteristics of the skin were performed in sequence, and the variable analyzed was parameter R0 that corresponds to the distensibility/firmness of skin.<xref rid="b24-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Standardized photographs</title><p>Standardized digital photographs were taken with a digital camera (Canon EOS Rebel T3i; Canon USA Inc., Melville, NY, USA) at baseline and 15 days after the proposed treatment. All patients were photographed in standing position in three views. The focus of the image was in the gluteal cleft with a focal length of 1 m, and the muscles of the photographed areas were relaxed. The images were offered to independent evaluators together with the criteria for the verification of the aspect of cellulite severity. N&#x000fc;rnberger and M&#x000fc;ller describe different degrees or stages of severity based on clinical presentation from 0 to 3 as follows: 0=there is no alteration of the skin surface (visible without changes); 1=the skin of the affected area is smooth while the subject is standing or lying, but the alterations to the skin surface can be seen by pinching the skin or with muscle contraction (visible changes with skin clamping or muscle contraction); 2=the orange peel aspect of the skin or mattress appearance is evident when standing, without the use of any manipulation of the skin pinching or muscle contraction (visible without manipulation) and 3=the alterations described in grade or stage 2 are present together with raised areas and nodules (visible changes associated with nodules).<xref rid="b21-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b23-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Questionnaires</title><p>The results were also assessed subjectively by the patients who completed a self-questionnaire that assessed the tolerability and satisfaction with the treatment during the re-evaluation.

In the esthetic treatment, both the ultrasonic energy and the therapeutic current interact with all the structures of the skin and with the subcutaneous tissue (epidermis&#x02013;dermis to subcutaneous fat). In Combined Therapy Heccus, the effects induced by therapeutic ultrasound can be associated with different therapeutic currents&#x02019; effects: Aussie current, high-voltage current or polarized current.</p><p>Nowadays, there are devices that have been developed to use focused ultrasound mostly for localized fat treatments. This type of system emits focused ultrasound waves to deliver concentrated energy into a focal volume at a precise depth in the subcutaneous tissue.<xref rid="b26-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, this type of technology treats only localized fat, whereas the Heccus system, using Combined Therapy, may have the potential to treat localized fat deposits, cellulite and skin flaccidity simultaneously.</p><p>Ultrasound can induce biological effects through heating that results from the absorption of ultrasonic energy and through nonthermal mechanisms that include ultrasonic cavitation, mechanical stress and other nonthermal processes. In cosmetic application, both thermal and nonthermal mechanisms within an ultrasonic field are used for the destruction of adipose tissue and contraction of collagen-based tissue (dermis).<xref rid="b12-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Ultrasonic waves create compression cycles that exert positive pressure and expansion cycles that exert negative pressure. When ultrasonic waves penetrate and travel through tissue, they lose energy as they are reflected, scattered or absorbed by the tissues. Therapeutic currents can be used to improve the venous and lymphatic return of lower limbs. Their use is based on the premise that muscle contraction increases the compartment pressure and compresses the lymphatic and blood vessels, propelling the fluids contained therein as a milking action.<xref rid="b31-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In addition, studies have shown that therapeutic electrical currents can positively influence lymphatic smooth muscle activity.<xref rid="b32-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In this study, the ultrasound was combined with Aussie current, which is a type of medium-frequency alternating current, and the stimulation intensity was increased by the operator until the participant felt a strong, but comfortable paresthesia. In this study, the 4 kHz Aussie current was modulated at a low frequency (10 Hz). Studies suggest that the stimulation frequencies of the lymphatic smooth muscle vary from 0.5 to 40 Hz, since the lymphatic smooth muscle responds to low-frequency stimuli.<xref rid="b32-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>This study revealed that all the treatment areas in both groups showed reduction in the thickness of subcutaneous fat (mm) on diagnostic images when compared to baseline. The greatest reduction of fat thickness was observed in the posterior thigh areas of the G1 group and in the buttocks areas and the posterior thigh areas of the G2 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ccid-11-203">Figure 1A</xref>). These results may be related to the slight weight gain of G1 during the treatment (baseline: 67.5&#x000b1;8.6/posttreatment: 69.5&#x000b1;8.6), as can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ccid-11-203">Table 1</xref>. The reduction in adipose tissue after the treatment in both groups may be a result of lipolysis or mechanical disruption of subcutaneous adipocytes. Experimental studies suggest that the absorption of ultrasonic energy can lead to changes in the cellular activity and in the structure of adipocytes, and it releases lipids in the blood circulation and extracellular space immediately after the treatment.<xref rid="b34-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>The mechanism of fat mobilization is not clear; however, there are some hypotheses as follows: fat mobilization may be based on frequency resonance, where the energy provided to the enzyme by the ultrasound wave may induce transient conformational shifts in certain enzymatic proteins, altering the activity of the enzyme (i.e., kinases or phosphatases) and the overall function of the cell; it may involve a mechanism of ultrasound irradiation-induced secretion of norepinephrine from the sympathetic nerves; it may happen by altering the permeability of the adipocytes, besides adipocytes&#x02019; disruption.<xref rid="b9-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b28-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b36-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Body circumference is statistically significant only in G2. However, these data may not be as relevant since circumferential measurements may be affected by abdominal distension. Measurements of the adipose layer obtained by diagnostic ultrasound are accurate and indicate reduction of thickness in the treated areas.</p><p>Cellulite is related to collagen and elastic tissue degeneration in dermis and hypodermis associated with fat deposition. Higher echogenicity can be viewed by ultrasonography when the level of disorganization and abundance of collagen tissue is high.<xref rid="b38-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In this study, qualitative analysis demonstrated morphologic improvement in the subcutaneous tissue, fibrotic septa and aspects of the dermis-related cellulite, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ccid-11-203">Figure 1B and C</xref>. It is noteworthy that ultrasound changes are apparently less visible than clinical alterations, and that the evaluation parameters by ultrasonography are not well established; however, it was possible to observe general improvement of the cellulite, especially in the gluteal region. In the panoramic image analysis performed by the diagnostic ultrasound, the reduction of adipose tissue lodged between the skin and the muscles of the treated regions was verified. Cavitation and heating are intensity dependent, and the 3 MHz frequency increases the tissue temperature at a faster rate than the 1 MHz frequency.<xref rid="b39-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Therapeutic ultrasound acts on the subcutaneous tissue, giving positive results in localized fat.<xref rid="b41-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Studies showed that ultrasound in low intensity can induce apoptosis by a mild hyperthermia (40&#x000b0;C&#x02013;44&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02013;30 min), and they suggest that hyperthermia seems to inhibit repair of membrane damage caused by sonication.<xref rid="b42-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> In this study, 3 MHz, 2 W/cm<sup>2</sup> and continuous mode were used because these parameters can be more effective to produce thermal and nonthermal effects in subcutaneous tissue (~2 cm depth).<xref rid="b43-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The evaluation of photographic records of the areas treated, following the scale proposed by N&#x000fc;rnberger and M&#x000fc;ller,<xref rid="b6-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> showed statistically significant difference in all the areas treated in both groups, in the buttocks and the posterior thigh areas of the G1 and G2 groups, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ccid-11-203">Figure 2A</xref>. All volunteers showed improvement of skin appearance after treatment with Combined Therapy sessions, suggesting a decrease of the tensile forces on the skin and possible redistribution of vector forces (vertical forces) in the septum. Ultrasound vibrations have been implicated in the upregulation of some immediate-early response genes known to be mechanosensitive.<xref rid="b44-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Perhaps this may explain the improvement of skin appearance and the apparent tissue remodeling visible through digital photographs of the treated regions, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ccid-11-203">Figure 2B and C</xref>. In our study, two modalities were used together, ultrasound plus Aussie current, which probably promote improvement of localized fat and cellulite by edema reduction and excessive hydrophilia of the extracellular matrix.</p><p>In this study, whole-body vibration was used as a complement to the effects of Combined Therapy. The use of whole-body vibration as a complement to conventional physical training has increased over the last 20 years. This treatment is applied through a vibration platform on which the person may stand while performing activities such as a body weight squat, and is currently enjoying popularity as an alternative exercise modality for enhancing muscle activity, force and power.<xref rid="b45-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The vibration protocol often includes 5&#x02013;10 intervention sets of 30&#x02013;60 s of vibration with rest intervals of 1&#x02013;2 min between sets.<xref rid="b45-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="b46-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The volunteers of G2, in addition to receiving treatment with Combined Therapy, received 10-minute sessions in a whole-body vibration platform (10 Hz), divided into two periods of 5 min with 2 min of interval between each activity, immediately after treatment with the device. The volunteers were positioned in standing position with upright spine and semi-flexed knees on the whole-body vibration platform. The results suggest that the whole-body vibration platform can be used to increase the results of the treatment with Combined Therapy, especially in the localized fat treatment, but it does not seem to influence the cellulite and skin flaccidity because both groups showed similar improvement. The mechanism of reduction of the fat thickness is not clear, but studies suggest that the whole-body vibration platform seems to have positive effects in fat mobilization, such as increase in metabolism, thermogenic effect and increase in oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>).<xref rid="b46-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b48-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The firmness of skin was also evaluated in this study through the Cutometer MPA 580 device, a noninvasive tool to measure the biomechanical properties of the skin, which has often been used to study changes in skin viscoelasticity, such as in burn scars and post-esthetic treatments such as manual lymphatic drainage, cosmetic products, shockwave therapy and in evaluating age-related changes.<xref rid="b5-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b49-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b51-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Few studies have been found showing relation between the use of therapeutic nonfocused ultrasound and the biomechanical characteristics of the skin, and studies using Combined Therapy were not found. The exact mechanism of action of the therapeutic ultrasound on skin firmness is not clear. However, an experimental study demonstrated through histologic and morphometric analysis that the absorption of higher doses of ultrasound can produce changes in the epidermis and dermis, such as increase in the thickness of epidermis and thinning of collagen fibers in dermis; this could be considered as a proliferation mechanism of the collagen fibers, leading to changes in the local younger fibers.<xref rid="b52-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> On the other hand, a study that used continuous ultrasound (3 MHz, 1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) for treatment of 31 volunteers and the parameter R0 showed a significant increase in skin firmness, when compared to the values before application and immediately post-application, which feature a greater distensibility.<xref rid="b53-ccid-11-203" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> In this study, Combined Therapy (ultrasound nonfocused plus Aussie current) was used in the treatment of buttocks, and an optimal improvement of skin firmness was observed on the treated areas in both groups, G1 and G2, which is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ccid-11-203">Table 3</xref>. In this study, 2 W/cm<sup>2</sup> of ultrasound intensity was used; higher intensities seem to be related to the increase of collagen and significant skin tightening.</p><p>Another important point of this study was the evaluation of the levels of tolerance and satisfaction with the treatment through self-questionnaires. The procedure was considered well tolerated (0% intolerable). The percentage of satisfaction level was 95% (30% satisfied, 65% very satisfied) after the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ccid-11-203">Figure 3</xref>). One of the great advantages of this system is the safety and comfort of the therapy, since 200 treatment sessions were performed and no adverse reactions were observed. All patients resumed normal activities immediately after each session of the treatment, without downtime, pain or discomfort.</p><p>This pilot study has some limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results. The sample size is small and there is no placebo group. Therefore, caution must be applied, as the findings might not be transferable to the general population. Further studies using larger sample size and placebo group should be performed to confirm these results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the synergistic effects of the Combined Therapy (nonfocused ultrasound plus Aussie current) might be a good option with noninvasive body contouring treatment for improving the aspect of the cellulite, skin firmness and localized fat. If used in association with the whole-body vibratory platform, the results can be better, especially in the treatment of localized fat. The treatment was well tolerated and the satisfaction index was 95%. Randomized trials with more volunteers should be carried out, and a placebo group should be introduced in further studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research project is supported by the Center for Education and Advanced Training CEFAI (Amparo, Sao Paulo, Brazil).
