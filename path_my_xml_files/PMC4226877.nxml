The development of novel, effective treatment technologies is, therefore, important. There are preliminary data suggesting that low-dose immunoglobulin treatment may significantly reduce pain from longstanding CRPS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>LIPS is a multicentre (United Kingdom), double-blind, randomised parallel group, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 0.5&#x000a0;g/kg plus standard treatment, versus matched placebo plus standard treatment in 108 patients with longstanding complex regional pain syndrome. Participants with moderate or severe CRPS of between 1 and 5&#x000a0;years duration will be randomly allocated to receive IVIg 0.5&#x000a0;g/kg (IntratectTM 50&#x000a0;g/l solution for infusion) or matching placebo administered day 1 and day 22 after randomisation, followed by two optional doses of open-label medication on day 43 after randomisation and on day 64 after randomisation. The primary outcome is the patients&#x02019; pain intensity in the IVIG group compared with the placebo group, between 6 and 42&#x000a0;days after randomisation. The primary trial objective is to confirm the efficacy and confidently determine the effect size of the IVIG treatment technology in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN42179756">ISRCTN42179756</ext-link> (Registered 28 June 13).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1745-6215-15-404) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CRPS</kwd><kwd>immunoglobulin</kwd><kwd>IVIg</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a post-traumatic pain in a limb, associated with sensory, motor, autonomic, skin and bone changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CRPS can resolve spontaneously, but if a spontaneous resolution does not occur early, it is less likely to occur later. Many patients with CRPS have no effective method to relieve their ongoing pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Those patients with CRPS of moderate to severe pain intensity, the target group for this study, report on average a very poor quality of life, and they usually cannot work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Immunoglobulin treatment for chronic pain is a novel technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In one of the first open trials, we found that low dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be effective in some patients with CRPS (for 11 participants: three had &#x0003e;70% pain relief, two had &#x0003e;25% but&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;70%, and six had 0 to 25%, following a variable number of low-dose infusion repeats) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We later showed that in one patient repeat treatments provided reproducible effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, we confirmed in a UK single-centre crossover, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], that a single, low dose (0.5&#x000a0;g/kg) infusion of IVIg significantly reduced pain in patients with CRPS (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13, pain intensity on a validated 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) higher than 4 (NRS 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;pain as bad as you can imagine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]); these patients had a disease duration of 0.5 to 2.5&#x000a0;years. The treatment difference was 1.55 NRS points (95% CI: 1.29 to1.82, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001). In a responder analysis (12 patients had received treatment), three patients had &#x02265;50% less pain (4.5, 5 and 5 NRS points) after IVIg when compared with after saline treatment, and two patients had 2 and 2.5 NRS points less pain (29% and 31% less pain). One patient had 2 NRS points less pain (25% less pain) after saline compared with after IVIg treatment. The average effect duration was 5&#x000a0;weeks. There was also a significant overall reduction of CRPS-related, non-painful symptoms and, in responders, improved sleep and global improvement, with few adverse events (headaches and pain increases for &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;days). Post-infusion questionnaires showed successful blinding of patients and study doctors.</p><p>Recently we commenced a trial to explore whether subcutaneous immunoglobulin, in weekly self-administration at home over one year, would provide sustained pain relief in initial responders to 0.5&#x000a0;g/kg IVIg (ISRCTN63226217). We invited all five patients who experienced at least 2 NRS points less pain after IVIg in the earlier RCT. Of these patients, one declined participation, and a second patient unfortunately developed metastasizing colon cancer. Three patients participated. By August 2011, two patients, with disease durations of 6 and 5&#x000a0;years at study entry and baseline pain intensities of NRS 7 and 6 had experienced sustained pain reduction of &#x0003e;70% for 12 and 3.5&#x000a0;months, respectively. The third patient, who had had 31% relief in the RCT, showed no benefit. The two responding patients reported major improvement in their quality of life. EQ5D scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] improved from 0.26 and 0.30 at baseline to 0.66 and 0.65 at twelve and three months and reduced interference of their pain with daily functioning; Brief Pain Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] interference scores (pain interference&#x02009;=&#x02009;the impact of pain on activities of daily life) improved from 7.7 and 6.1 at baseline to 1.4 and 0 at twelve and three months.</p><p>The implication of the existing research for this trial is that the above evidence provides proof of concept for the efficacy of low-dose immunoglobulin treatment for patients with CRPS of moderate to severe pain intensity (msCRPS) in reducing pain, with an advantageous side-effect profile. These data also suggest that this treatment may improve quality of life and pain interference. Because the numbers of treated patients have been small, and most research was conducted in a single centre, it is now important to confirm these findings in a larger group of patients and across several centres, to gain confidence about both efficacy and affect size of this novel technology, and to demonstrate its generalizability.</p><p>The primary objective of this trial is to gain, within 44&#x000a0;months, both definite proof of the clinical efficacy and a more confident estimate of the effect size of low-dose IVIg treatment to reduce pain in patients with moderate or severe complex regional pain syndrome.</p><p>Secondary objectives are to achieve a better understanding of this technology including the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>stability of effect with repeat administration;</p></list-item><list-item><p>factors predicting a beneficial response;</p></list-item><list-item><p>effects on additional outcome parameters including stimulus evoked pain, pain interference, quality of life, and short-term risk profile;</p></list-item><list-item><p>health economics evaluation; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>creation of a bank of biological samples for future complex regional pain syndrome research.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The primary outcome will be the average 24-h pain intensity over 37&#x000a0;days (to be completed on day 6 to day 42 after randomisation to record pain intensity during the previous 24&#x000a0;hours).</p><p>The number of study sites will be seven: all UK-based specialist pain clinics in secondary care (Liverpool, London, Bath, Glasgow, Norfolk and Norwich, Cambridge, Leicester).</p><p>The study population size will be 108 (54 in each study arm).</p><p>The study duration will be 44&#x000a0;months (from study set-up to analysis).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>LIPS is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial with an open extension. The parallel group design is an established research technique; the open extension is an optional trial element, where patients who have completed the parallel, blinded phase can request to receive one, or maximally two doses of IVIG &#x02018;openly&#x02019;, that is, assured that what they receive is IVIG (there is no placebo control). This extension is included to take account of service users&#x02019; preferences.</p><p>Blinding will be achieved by preparing both study drug and placebo (0.1% albumin in normal saline) solution into identical bottles. The albumin is added to achieve indistinguishable foaming and colour to the IVIg. Batch numbers and expiry dates for both the active and placebo drug will be indistinguishable.</p><p>For the time frame, study day 0 is defined as the day of randomisation, and a screening visit is scheduled maximally three weeks prior (day -21); patients then receive blinded infusions on days 1 and 22. Thereafter, in those who decide to receive open infusion on day 43 and day 64, pain diaries will be completed daily from day 43 to day 85 and then weekly for 9&#x000a0;weeks further to explore the duration of combined drug- and unspecific treatment effects (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>The sample size is 108 patients (54 patients per study arm). An interim analysis will be performed for futility and safety after half of patients have completed the trial. It will be suggested that the trial be stopped if there is a statistically significant difference between the groups in the &#x02018;wrong&#x02019; direction at the 5% level (that is, one-sided test at the 2.5% level). This stopping rule will have a negligible effect on the type I error and power of the trial. There will no statistical stopping rule for efficacy although the DMC may suggest stopping the trial on the grounds of safety if there is an overwhelming positive effect of IVIg.</p><p>Clinical stopping rules will relate to unexpectedly poor recruitment and excessive withdrawals.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The primary outcome is the average 24-h pain intensity over 37&#x000a0;days, recorded in pain diary entries for the previous 24&#x000a0;hours and collected on days 6 to 42 (day 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;day of first infusion). Consenting patients, who provide a mobile phone number, will be prompted automatically by SMS daily from day 2 to 42 to enter their pain intensity into their diary. In addition, return SMSs from the patient, with the daily NRS pain value, will be automatically saved as backup for the paper diary. The paper diary score will override the texted diary score; however, every effort will be made to resolve any discrepancies. In participating patients, an unexplained lack of a response over two or three days will prompt a phone call from the study nurse to confirm that there are no issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary and exploratory outcome measures</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Secondary outcomes will be pain interference measured using the interference subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and quality of life measured using the Euroqol EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>All other outcomes are exploratory</p></list-item><list-item><p>List of measures to be used (measurement times see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Detailed daily -

Assuming 10% loss to follow-up and 5% noncompliance increases, this number increases to 152 participants.

Day to day management of LIPS will be the responsibility of the Chief Investigator and the Trial Manager. The Coordinating Centre will arrange meetings of the Trial Management Group (TMG) and Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and will coordinate independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) meetings.</p><p>The TMG will comprise Dr Andreas Goebel (Chair), the Trial Manager, the Data Manager, the Trial Statistician, and the manager of King&#x02019;s Clinical Trials Unit. The TMG will arrange telephone conferences and provide monthly recruitment email updates during recruitment and status reports, and 6 monthly thereafter. The TMG will organise a meeting for all PIs (and for key staff working on the study) to sign the protocol, and to agree on the content and undergo training on SOPs before the start of recruitment. A second investigators&#x02019; meeting will be held at the end of the study to review the results. The TMG will also meet face-to-face every 6&#x000a0;months in Liverpool or London. The TMG will report to the Trial Steering Committee (TSC). All PIs will be kept informed of TSC and DMC advice and consulted by e-mail or teleconference as required.</p><p>The TSC will consist of an independent chair, two independent members, a site investigator, a patient representative, a nonvoting member, and the Chief Investigator; the names are detailed on page 4 of this protocol. The TSC will be responsible for approving the trial protocol and overseeing the conduct of the study, including advising on continuing or stopping the study in the light of advice from the DMEC. Meetings of the TSC will be held at least annually.</p><p>Membership of the DMEC will comprise an Independent Chair; an independent specialist with interest in neuropathic pain analgesic trials, and an independent statistician. The DMC will have access to the unblinded data and will monitor the progress of the trial in terms of safety and ethical issues. The DMC may advise the TSC to continue or to stop the trial according to pre-agreed upon stopping rules.</p><p>The Principal Investigators will be responsible for the day-to-day study conduct at site. This includes establishing and carrying out the trial at his/her centre in accordance with international, national and local law and regulations and GCP. They will ensure that all site specific documentation is complete and correct; and that all staff involved in the trial are compliant with Trust, GMC and other relevant regulations, and that they are appropriately trained in those aspects of GCP relevant to their role in the study whilst being familiar with the trial protocol.Principle Investigators are also responsible for managing recruitment on target and collecting and submitting accrual and outcome data in a timely manner; responding in timely fashion to requests from the Trial Coordinating Centre for information; providing and responding promptly to SAE and suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSARs) reports; agreeing to monitoring and audit visits as required.</p><p>Central and site monitoring of study conduct and data collected will be performed by the Trial Manager at the KCTU on behalf of the Sponsor.

The initial report can be made by completing the serious adverse event form, and faxing or emailing into the King&#x02019;s CTU. A record of this notification (including date of notification) must be clearly documented to provide an audit trail. In the case of incomplete information at the time of initial reporting, all appropriate information should be provided as follow-up as soon as this becomes available.</p><p>Relationship of the SAE to the treatment should be assessed by the investigator/delegate (must be a clinician) at that site, as should the expected or unexpected nature of any serious adverse reactions. As this is a blinded trial involving a placebo and active drug, seriousness, causality and expectedness should be evaluated as though the patient was on the active drug.</p><p>All SUSAR-reporting responsibilities to MHRA will be that of the Sponsor, with the support of the Kings CTU. The Sponsor will report SUSARs (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions) and other SARs to the regulatory authority (MHRA).</p><p>The Chief Investigator will report to the relevant ethics committees, with the support of the Kings CTU. Reporting timelines are as follow:<disp-quote><p>SUSARs that are fatal or life-threatening must be reported no later than 7&#x000a0;days after the sponsor is first aware of the reaction. Any additional relevant information must be reported within a further 8&#x000a0;days.</p><p>SUSARs that are not fatal or life-threatening must be reported within 15&#x000a0;days of the sponsor first becoming aware of the reaction.</p><p>The Chief Investigator will provide an annual report of all SARs (expected and unexpected), and SAEs which will be distributed to the Sponsor, MHRA and the REC.</p><p>As this is a blinded study, cases that are considered SUSARs would have to be unblinded to the King&#x02019;s CTU manager prior to reporting to the Sponsor and main REC. Only those events occurring among patients on the active drug (unless thought to be due to the excipient in the placebo) should be considered SUSARs.</p><p>All investigators will be informed of all SAE&#x02019;s assessed as fulfilling criteria as a SUSAR (that is, possibly, probably or definitely related to the study intervention and unexpected per the SPC) on a case-by-case basis. This will be regardless of medication administered in order to avoid the risk of inadvertently unblinding investigators, unless this information is needed for medical management of patients. Therefore, occasions may arise where a potential SUSAR is unblinded and if the patient is taking placebo, the MHRA would not need to be informed, and the investigators will not be made aware of this information. All reports to PIs will refer to events fulfilling criteria as a &#x02018;potential SUSAR&#x02019; and only the KCTU and Sponsor will be aware of the events reported onward to the MHRA in an expedited manner.</p><p>The Chief Investigator will ensure University of Liverpool as lead sponsor is notified of any potential SUSARs.</p><p>*The Trial coordinating centre MUST be informed of all SAEs or SUSARs within 24&#x000a0;hours of learning of its occurrence.
