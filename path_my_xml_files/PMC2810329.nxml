Subjects were followed for local and systemic reactogenicity, adverse events including cardiac adverse events, and clinical laboratory parameters. Study follow up was 18 months. Humoral immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-gp120 binding ELISA, immunoflourescent staining, and HIV-1 neutralization. Cellular immunogenicity was assessed by a validated IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot assay and intracellular cytokine staining. Anti-vaccinia binding titers were measured by ELISA.</p><p>ADMVA was generally well-tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events or cardiac adverse events. Local or systemic reactogenicity events were reported by 77&#x00025; and 78&#x00025; of volunteers, respectively. The majority of events were of mild intensity. The IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot response rate to any HIV antigen was 0/12 (0&#x00025;) in the placebo group, 3/12 (25&#x00025;) in the low dosage group, 6/12 (50&#x00025;) in the mid dosage group, and 8/13 (62&#x00025;) in the high dosage group. Responses were often multigenic and occasionally persisted up to one year post vaccination. Antibodies to gp120 were detected in 0/12 (0&#x00025;), 8/13 (62&#x00025;), 6/12 (50&#x00025;) and 10/13 (77&#x00025;) in the placebo, low, mid, and high dosage groups, respectively.

In the People's Republic of China, an estimated 700,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS in an epidemic spread both through sexual transmission and injection drug use. The prevalence of HIV infection among injection drug users in Yunnan province, which borders Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam in the &#x0201c;golden triangle&#x0201d; region, has increased dramatically in the last ten years, to over 40&#x00025; in several prefectures <xref rid="pone.0008816-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Participants agreed to safe sexual practices and to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the duration of the 18-month study.

The study design allowed for a total of 48 volunteers to be enrolled; 36 volunteers receiving active vaccines and 12 volunteers receiving placebo. However, up to ten percent over enrollment was permitted to compensate for discontinuation of vaccinations within 30 days of enrollment, resulting in an extra vaccine recipient in the low and high dosage groups, making the total sample size 50. The small sample size was deemed adequate for an exploratory dose-escalation study of a novel product while investigating safety and tolerability of the vaccine. Based on a 10&#x00025; event rate in the placebo group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12), there was at least 80&#x00025; power to detect a significantly greater event rate of 51&#x00025; or more in the active group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;36) at level &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 using Fisher's exact one-sided test.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Randomization and Blinding</title><p>The randomization schedule was prepared by the statisticians at the Data Coordinating Center at the EMMES Corporation.

Eighteen volunteers withdrew consent after completing the screening process. Of the remaining eight screen failures, seven were assessed by the study team as being unable to comply with the protocol, and one was already enrolled in another clinical trial of an investigational agent. The average interval from date of screening to enrollment was 18 days, ranging from 6&#x02013;42 days. All 13 low dosage volunteers completed the three planned vaccinations. In the mid dosage group, 2 volunteers received only two and one received only one vaccination. In the high dosage group, one volunteer received only 2 vaccinations. One placebo recipient withdrew after the first vaccination due to a non-related serious adverse event. Another placebo recipient missed the second vaccination, but received the third.

ADMVA was well tolerated at the dosage levels tested, with no evidence of cardiac toxicity. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine. Local and systemic reactogenicity following vaccination was usually mild to moderate and generally resolved within four days. Local reactogenicity increased in severity with each dosage group. This dosage-dependent reactogenicity may indicate an immune response to products of the HIV gene inserts, to the viral vector, or both. While anti-vector immunity increased after subsequent vaccinations in each dose group, a titer of 1&#x02236;450 in the high dose group after two vaccinations did not prevent generation of humoral or cellular immune responses after the third vaccination.</p><p>In the mid and low dosage groups, binding antibodies to gp120 were detected only after the third dose of ADMVA, while in a subset of volunteers in the high dosage group, binding antibodies were detected after the first and/or second vaccinations, although the majority of vaccine recipients also required three injections. Antibody titer peaked two weeks after vaccination and then waned, but persisted for one year post vaccination. Binding antibodies were likely functional in part, given the correlation with the ability to neutralize HIV SF162, a strain that is relatively easy to neutralize. Given the inability to neutralize clade-matched HIV isolates in the majority of volunteers, it is unlikely that this humoral response will be sufficient on its own to neutralize incoming infection, reduce viral load set point, or impact disease progression post infection with HIV-1.</p><p>ADMVA elicits a cellular immune response, as quantified by IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot assay. Responses occurred after one, two and three vaccinations, and were directed against multiple antigens. Unfortunately, in both humans and macaques, IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot responses do not correlate with protection from HIV/SIV or reduction in viral load <xref rid="pone.0008816-Mansfield1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008816-Buchbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The magnitude of the ELISpot response may also not reflect the quality of the cellular immune response <xref rid="pone.0008816-Almeida1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008816-Precopio1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In our hands, the 16-hour detection platform of the ELISpot is more sensitive for IFN&#x003b3; detection than the 6-hour detection platform of the flow assay, which may account for the lack of detectable responses on intracellular cytokine staining. As there has been no documented case of natural clearance of HIV-1 in humans, much remains to be understood regarding the immunologic correlates of protection from HIV-1. Therefore, many of the current vaccine strategies to induce cellular immune responses are in effect, proceeding &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d;, as we do not yet know the desired immune response.</p><p>Given the possibility of enhanced susceptibility to HIV infection in adenoviral vaccine recipients with high pre-existing adenoviral titers <xref rid="pone.0008816-McElrath1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008816-Buchbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, studies of HIV vaccines in humans should not be pursued without sufficient consideration for volunteer safety. Poxviral vectors have fewer issues with pre-existing immunity, as such immunity is generally limited to persons who have been previously vaccinated against smallpox. Since routine smallpox vaccinations have been discontinued for several decades worldwide, with the exception of certain groups perceived to be &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d;, such as military personnel and health care workers <xref rid="pone.0008816-Wiser1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, the prevalence of pre-existing immunity to an MVA-based vaccine would arguably be low, relative to adenovirus-based vaccines <xref rid="pone.0008816-Nwanegbo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>This vaccine was designed to be administered in combination with ADVAX, a matched Clade C-B' DNA-based multigenic vaccine (see the accompanying manuscript).
