The objective of this study was to determine whether varying the levels of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA in erythrocyte membrane lipids, following dietary supplementation, is associated with altered numbers and function of circulating leukocytes conducive to protection against inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In a double-blind and placebo-controlled study, 44 healthy subjects aged 23 to 63 years consumed either standard or <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA-enriched versions of typical processed foods, the latter allowing a target daily consumption of 1 gram <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA. After six months, peripheral blood leukocyte and subpopulation proportions and numbers were assessed by flow cytometry. Leukocytes were also examined for lymphoproliferation and cytokine production, neutrophil chemotaxis, chemokinesis, bactericidal, adherence and iodination activity. Erythrocytes were analyzed for fatty-acid content.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Erythrocyte <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA levels were higher and absolute leukocyte and lymphocyte numbers were lower in subjects consuming <italic>n</italic>-3 enriched foods than in controls. There were no changes in the number of neutrophils, monocytes, T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>), T-cell subsets (CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>) and B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>). However, natural killer (NK) (CD3<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup>) cell numbers were lower in <italic>n</italic>-3 supplemented subjects than in controls and were inversely related to the amount of eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid in erythrocytes. No significant correlations were found with respect to lymphocyte lymphoproliferation and production of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2, but lymphotoxin production was higher with greater <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA membrane content. Similarly, neutrophil chemotaxis, chemokinesis, bactericidal activity and adherence did not vary with changes in erythrocyte <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA levels, but the iodination reaction was reduced with higher <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA content.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data show that regular long-term consumption of <italic>n</italic>-3 enriched foods leads to lower numbers of NK cells and neutrophil iodination activity but higher lymphotoxin production by lymphocytes. These changes are consistent with decreased inflammatory reaction and tissue damage seen in patients with inflammatory disorders receiving <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>There is evidence from both experimental models and clinical studies that long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (<italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA) are beneficial in the treatment of autoimmune and allergic inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Counterbalancing <italic>n</italic>-6 fatty-acid intake with <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids is important because <italic>n</italic>-6 fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (AA) are released during cellular activation and inflammation and metabolized to generate highly inflammatory metabolites such as the 4-series leukotrienes and 2-series prostaglandins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Increasing the amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in membrane phospholipids not only reduces the level of AA available for metabolism by the lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases, but EPA also competes against AA for metabolism to form metabolites of the 5-series leukotrienes and 3-series prostaglandins, which are significantly less pro-inflammatory than the AA-derived metabolites, thereby taming the inflammatory reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The effects of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation on inflammation and immune responses have been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This includes the benefits in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, atherosclerosis and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Despite the finding of such beneficial effects there is still insufficient evidence to enable specific recommendations to be made on the use of <italic>n</italic>-3 fats in these disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These include knowledge of efficacious doses of <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids and the type of <italic>n</italic>-3 fat that is most effective. The evidence indicates that EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have differential effects which may be further complicated by the array of immune cells and pathways which can be altered by these PUFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This would explain the variation from study to study in the degree of benefit attained for different conditions.</p><p>Here we examine the effects of providing low-dose long-term <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids in foods on a number of parameters of innate and adaptive immune response. We also took this opportunity to explore the relationship between membrane fatty-acid composition and several components of the immune system relevant to inflammatory diseases such as RA by analyzing leukocyte levels and functional responses in blood samples obtained from subjects receiving <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation in a 6-month intervention trial. The results showed that a higher level of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA in erythrocyte membrane phospholipids is associated primarily with a significantly lower number of circulating natural killer (NK) cells, which could be considered beneficial in reducing tissue damage in chronic inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ficoll 400 was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden).

Foods were either enriched with <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA from microencapsulated cod liver oil (Maritex, Aarhus, Denmark) (<italic>n</italic>-3 supplemented) or were devoid of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA (placebo). The fatty-acid composition of the study foods is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Each enriched food portion provided 125 mg EPA + DHA and subjects were asked to consume eight exchanges daily, to equal 1 g <italic>n</italic>-3 PUFA/day. Subjects were matched for gender and age then randomly allocated to treatment or control groups. Dietary interviews were conducted by trained dieticians using diet questionnaires and food records as described by Patch <italic>et al</italic>.

Subjects were encouraged to keep 'diet diaries' in order to monitor the amount of <italic>n</italic>-3 PUFA-rich foods consumed. The target macronutrients intakes (% of energy) were as follows: 20% protein, 50% carbohydrate, 30% fat (polyunsaturated: mono-unsaturated: saturated = 1:1:1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary intervention study of 6 months duration was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of Adelaide and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) (see Murphy <italic>et al</italic>.

Mononuclear cells (MNL) and neutrophils were purified by the rapid one-step procedure according to Ferrante and Thong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Briefly, heparinized blood was layered onto a density separation medium consisting of Ficoll 400-Hypaque, density 1.114. Following centrifugation at 600 <italic>g </italic>for 35 min, the MNL and neutrophil bands were harvested and washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium by centrifugation (5 min &#x000d7; 600 <italic>g</italic>) and MNL resuspension in RPMI 1640 medium or neutrophils in Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS).</p></sec><sec><title>Neutrophil chemotaxis and chemokinesis</title><p>Neutrophils, 5 &#x003bc;l of 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>cells/ml, were allowed to migrate under agarose for 90 min at 37&#x000b0;C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>-air incubator as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in the presence of a chemotactic gradient generated by 5 &#x003bc;l 10<sup>-7 </sup>M of fMLP, or 5 &#x003bc;l of diluent DMSO (1% v/v in PBS). The distance migrated by the cells was expressed in mm/90 min. For chemokinesis, neutrophils (20 &#x003bc;l; 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>/ml) were pre-incubated with 20 &#x003bc;l fMLP for 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified CO<sub>2 </sub>(5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in air) incubator, centrifuged in a microcentrifuge (30 sec &#x000d7; 1 <italic>g </italic>force), the supernatant was removed and the cells resuspended in 20 &#x003bc;l HBSS with phenol. The random migration in four directions &#x02013; top, bottom, left and right &#x02013; was measured using an inverted Leitz microscope. Chemokinesis was expressed as the mean of the distance (in millimeters) traveled in the four directions.</p></sec><sec><title>Neutrophil adherence</title><p>Neutrophil adherence was assayed by measuring neutrophil adherence to plasma-coated plastic surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To the 96-well microtiter plates was added 250 &#x003bc;l/well of 10% autologous plasma and the plates were incubated for 30 min 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified CO<sub>2 </sub>(5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in air) incubator. The plates were subsequently washed with HBSS and air-dried. Then, 100 &#x003bc;l of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>neutrophils treated with either TNF or with HBSS as a control were loaded into the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C in a CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. Non-adherent cells were removed by inversion of plates and the wells washed three times with HBSS. Adherent cells were stained with Rose Bengal (0.25 % w/v in PBS with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], washed and the dye was then released by adding 50% ethanol and the absorbance was read at 570 nm using a plate reader (Dynatech MR7000, Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA). The degree of adherence was calculated by subtracting the mean absorbance values of blank wells from the mean of the test wells.</p></sec><sec><title>Neutrophil bactericidal activity</title><p>The ability of neutrophils to kill <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>was assessed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Briefly, 25 &#x003bc;l of <sup>125</sup>I (200 &#x003bc;Ci/ml) was added to 1 ml pooled human serum (1:4 dilution in HBSS) and 25 ml added to appropriate wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. Six wells were used for either pooled serum or autologous serum, three of which were stimulated with 50 &#x003bc;l zymosan. As a control, 50 &#x003bc;l of HBSS was added to the remaining three. The plates were incubated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified CO<sub>2 </sub>(5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in air) and then 50 &#x003bc;l of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>neutrophils/ml were added to appropriate wells. The plates were covered and incubated for 90 min. Finally, the cells were harvested using a cell harvester (Titertek Cell Harvester 550) and the quantity of bound <sup>125</sup>I was expressed as picomoles/10<sup>7 </sup>neutrophils. The amount of iodination due to stimulation was calculated by subtracting the basal iodination value (no zymosan added) from the stimulated iodination value (plus zymosan).</p></sec><sec><title>Lymphocyte phenotyping and leukocyte numbers</title><p>Lymphocyte subpopulations were determined using a lymphocyte kit and direct two-color immunofluorescence.

Comparisons between the supplemented and placebo group indicate that <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA reduces NK-cell numbers in the circulation. Analysis of the NK-cell levels against the amount of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA in the erythrocyte membranes established a negative correlation with the level of EPA, DHA and total <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA. A linear correlation was seen over the <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA range of 6.68 to 12.05%. A similar correlation was seen over the EPA range of 0.48 to 1.65% and DHA of 3.61 to 8.04%. The reduced NK-cell numbers can only be contributing in a very small way to the reduced levels of total leukocytes and lymphocytes seen over this range of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA, EPA and DHA levels. While we also observed lower levels of neutrophils, T cells, B cells and T-cell subpopulations, this was not significant. This suggests that NK cells are most sensitive to increasing amounts of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA. Previously, others have reported that <italic>n</italic>-3 PUFA supplementation leads to reduced NK activity. Thies <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] reported that only a moderate intake of EPA + DHA (720 mg + 280 mg)/day (but not DHA alone), &#x003b1;-linolenic (18:3n-3) or &#x003b3;-linolenic acid (18:3n-6) over a 12-week period caused a reduction in NK-cell activity. No corresponding decrease in numbers or proportions of NK cells was observed. As our studies demonstrated that reduced levels are associated with greater amounts of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA in cell membranes, it is likely that the difference is related to the duration of the supplementation period. In fact our observations at 12 weeks of supplementation revealed that NK-cell numbers were not significantly correlated with <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA levels in erythrocyte membranes (data not shown). Kelley <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] reported a reduction in NK-cell activity using 6 g DHA/day over 12 weeks and this was also associated with an increase in DHA (2.3 to 7.4% of total fatty acids) in MNL. However, the NK-cell numbers or proportions were not measured. More recently, Miles <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] reported that supplementation with 4 g/day of EPA had little effect on the magnitude of NK-cell activity. We now report that a major consequence of increasing cell membrane levels of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA is a correlated decrease in NK-cell numbers. Collectively, the above studies suggest that under appropriate <italic>n</italic>-3 PUFA enrichment, both NK-cell numbers and NK-cell activity are reduced.</p><p>While NK cells are important in immune surveillance, particularly against viral infections and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the cells are also likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases as they have the ability to produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-1 and TNF, and are cytotoxic for tissues. For example, decreased NK-cell activity has been implicated as a protective mechanism of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA (EPA and DHA) in patients with ulcerative colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Aaskov <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported that NK cells from patients with epidemic polyarthritis could lyse autologous synovial cells and hence contribute to the arthritis. The ability of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA to reduce circulating NK-cell numbers could be another way in which <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA protect against these inflammatory disorders, acting in concert with the established dogma that <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA reduce the levels of potent pro-inflammatory eicosanoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Our findings also raise the possibility that <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA may protect during infection-induced exacerbation of tissue damage in RA patients through an effect on NK-cell levels. Whether or not the NK cells in our studies were also less cytotoxic remains to be established, but on the basis of previous reports this is likely and would add to the anti-inflammatory effects, which our findings support. The basis for the reduced NK-cell numbers will need to be further studied. However, it is likely to be related to an effect on hematopoiesis, perhaps selectively affecting NK-cell development.</p><p>Earlier studies, which examined the effects of dietary supplementation with <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA on immune function, in most cases used daily doses as high as 5.4 g and, not surprisingly, demonstrated a marked suppression of immunological responses such as neutrophil chemotaxis, MNL cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Another study, which used high doses of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA, (14.4 g per day over 10 weeks) reported a large reduction in neutrophil chemotaxis (93%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is usually accepted that depressed neutrophil functions are not seen at lower doses such as those used in our study.</p><p>At these lower doses we found very little effect on lymphocyte function. There was no difference in lymphocyte proliferation to PHA between the <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA-supplemented and placebo groups. This contrasted with the observations of the production of cytokines by T cells. Whereas there was no significant difference between the two groups in the production of IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3;, LT production was increased in the <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA-supplemented group compared with placebo at 6 months. However, the PHA-induced proliferation exhibited a U-shaped relationship with the increases in <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA content. This effect of PHA-induced proliferation was somewhat mirrored in the production of PHA-induced LT. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation between the LCPUFA levels in erythrocyte membranes and LT production by lymphocytes. The discrepancy in the pattern of regression &#x02013; that is, linear in the case of LT or U-shaped in that of PHA-induced proliferation &#x02013; suggests that the proliferation response is more complex in terms of sensitivity to the membrane content of fatty acids compared to the production of LT. It remains to be established why low-dose <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation promotes production of LT but not the other T-cell cytokines, IFN&#x003b3; and IL-2. Nevertheless, such increases in LT production can be protective against tissue damage in RA. It has been demonstrated that, unlike TNF, IFN&#x003b3; and IL-2, which augment neutrophil-mediated inhibition of cartilage proteoglycan synthesis, LT markedly depressed this activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Others have shown that with increases in dose of EPA there is greater production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Neutrophil functions, chemotaxis, chemokinesis, adhesion and bactericidal activity were unaffected by <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation. Our finding of bell-shaped relationships for the iodination activity may also be of importance in protection against tissue damage in RA. The iodination reaction is a measure of the production of hypochlorous acid by neutrophils through the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and release of myeloperoxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Interestingly this system was found to be important for articular cartilage damage by neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Analyses of the relationship between membrane LCPUFA profiles and the content and immune function of peripheral blood leukocytes has been previous examined in non-supplemented subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], who would be expected to have lower <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA levels than our study subjects who received <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation. Kew <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] reported that DHA was positively correlated with neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte responsiveness. This relationship was maintained even with AA, although there was a negative correlation with the <italic>n</italic>-6:<italic>n</italic>-3 ratio. This may be different when the higher levels attained with <italic>n</italic>-3 supplementation are taken into consideration. As Kew <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] indicated in their studies, there might be a bell-shaped relationship between functional activity of leukocytes and LCPUFA concentration. Indeed, this was evident in the current study where <italic>n</italic>-3 supplementation was used. Others have reported a U-shaped correlation between doses of fish oil supplementation (0.3, 1.0 and 2.0 g/day) and leukocyte function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Our approach was to analyze the immune parameters against the corresponding LCPUFA level in erythrocyte membrane lipids of the individual subject. These levels can be related to supplementation doses and also serve to overcome some limitations associated with compliance and various confounding factors. It is also apparent that <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA levels in plasma, erythrocytes and leukocytes can be correlated. Thus changes in levels of EPA and DHA in erythrocytes and leukocytes appear to correlate during <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], although the rate of incorporation between these cell types is different in the first 6 to 12 weeks of supplementation. Leukocytes, especially neutrophils, are likely to undergo some activation or stimulation during purification and thus the fatty-acid content may not be a reflection of the amount in the unactivated state, possibly explaining some of the controversies in findings by different laboratories. Thus the measurements in erythrocytes may be a more reliable marker for routine testing than those in leukocytes, although inevitably the latter are required to delineate the mechanisms involved. While future studies should consider the relationship between the cell type being examined and levels within that cell, this then becomes a complex question, as leukocytes consist of subpopulations of different cell types.</p><p>While the lower number of NK cells associated with low-dose long-term <italic>n</italic>-3LCPUFA supplementation is likely to be beneficial to patients with inflammatory disorders, it is also evident that individuals consuming these fatty acids may have greater susceptibility to viral infections. NK cells provide a first-line defense against these pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It is, however, reassuring that at these lower doses of supplementation, most components of the innate and adaptive immune response were not affected over the long term.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The approach reported here illustrates the importance of relating immune parameters to the levels of erythrocyte membrane PUFA composition to establish a biochemical basis for endeavors to supplement people with <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA using functional foods. It is thus tempting to suggest that such measurements could be used as indices for predictions of protection against inflammation, and as a way of controlling the level of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation. Furthermore, of all the immune parameters measured, NK cells were the most sensitive to the effects of increasing amounts of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA in the diet. This is conducive to <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation reducing cellular inflammation and tissue damage in diseases such as RA. Future studies designed to elucidate the basis for the reduced numbers of NK cells could give us new directions for the use of <italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA supplementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p><italic>n</italic>-3 LCPUFA = omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; AA = arachidonic acid; EPA = eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA = docosahexaenoic acid; MNL = mononuclear cells; NK cells = natural killer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VRM was responsible for conducting the immunology experiments; KJM was responsible for conducting the fatty-acid analyses.
