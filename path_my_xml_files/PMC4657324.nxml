This study describes an intensive distribution scheme of a topical repellent implemented in 2012 and 2013 for the purpose of a cluster-randomized trial using the existing public health system. The trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of repellents in addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and occurred in a province of Cambodia. Determinants for accessibility and consumption of this tool were explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>135 individuals were appointed to be repellent distributors in 57 villages. A 2-weekly bottle exchange programme was organized. Distributors recorded information regarding the amount of bottles exchanged, repellent leftover, and reasons for not complying in household data sheets. Distributor-household contact rates and average 2-weekly consumption of repellent were calculated. Household and distributors characteristics were obtained using questionnaires, surveying 50 households per cluster and all distributors. Regression models were used to explore associations between contact and consumption rates and determinants such as socio-economic status. Operational costs for repellent and net distribution were obtained from the MalaResT project and the provincial health department.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A fourfold increase in distributor-household contact rates was observed in 2013 compared to 2012 (median<sub>2012</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;%, median<sub>2013</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;88.9&#x000a0;%). Consumption rate tripled over the 2-year study period (median<sub>2012</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;%, median<sub>2013</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;57.89&#x000a0;%). Contact rates were found to associate with district, commune and knowing the distributor, while consumption was associated with district and household head occupation. The annual operational cost per capita for repellent distribution was 31 times more expensive than LLIN distribution (USD 4.33 versus USD 0.14).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>After the existing public health system was reinforced with programmatic and logistic support, an intense 2-weekly distribution scheme of a vector control tool over a 2-year period was operated successfully in the field. Lack of associations with socio-economic status suggested that the free distribution strategy resulted in equitable access to repellents. The operational costs for the repellent distribution and exchange programme were much higher than LLIN distribution. Such effort could only be justified in the context of malaria elimination where these interventions are expected to be limited in time.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12936-015-0960-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Distribution</kwd><kwd>Access</kwd><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Repellents</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>During the past decade an increase in the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) has contributed to an unprecedented decrease in the worldwide malaria burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the presence of early and outdoor biting malaria vectors, responsible for residual malaria transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] hamper further reductions in malaria transmission in many endemic areas. In a low transmission setting, a subsequent reduction in malaria transmission will require public health programmes to address this residual transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Several additional vector control tools have been suggested for targeting residual transmission, such as the use of topical and spatial repellents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], insecticide-treated veils or wraps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], clothes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and long-lasting insecticidal hammocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These additional vector control tools are mostly based on personal protection, and were targeted for use by at-risk populations experiencing higher exposure to malaria-infected mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Region-wide application of such tools in public health programmes may require more intensive distribution schemes as compared to LLINs and IRS.</p><p>The public health value of a vector control tool does not only depend on its epidemiological efficacy, but also on its ease of implementation as well as its acceptability and use by the human population, all of which translate into the effective coverage of the tool. For IRS, effective coverage depends on the proportion of houses correctly treated with insecticides while other control tools require the active participation of the target population. IRS has to be repeated every 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months, whereas its use does not require any further active commitment of the target population beyond preparing the house the day of the spray and not washing or plastering the walls after the spray round. On the other hand, LLIN distribution needed to be organized at a 3-year interval only as the bio-efficacy of those nets last at least 3&#x000a0;years. However, for an LLIN to be effective, the target population has to sleep under the nets, and therefore its effective coverage will strongly depend on its effective daily use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In many countries, mainly on the African continent, different approaches have been implemented in public health systems to reach sufficient accessibility and daily use of LLINs, both defining coverage. For example, continuous distribution of LLINs was integrated in other public health interventions such as measles and polio vaccination in Mozambique, Zambia and Ghana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, several ways to increase the uptake of malaria preventive measures through community involvement are used such as hang-up keep-up strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], health promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and participatory approaches relying on individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and community involvement. In order to better understand how access to, and use of, preventive measures to control malaria could be improved, several studies have looked into determinants of ownership such as socio-economic status (SES), demography and geography for the distribution and use of LLINs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Many of the suggested additional vector control tools targeting residual transmission were initially designed for personal protection against mosquito nuisance and thus require repeated individual use. A different public health approach is required for large-scale implementation of these tools and needs for example including intensive distribution schemes or more profound health education systems. In many countries, networks of village health workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], such as the Village Malaria Workers (VMWs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Village Health Support Group (VHSG) in Cambodia have been set up to assist in public health programmes. Integration of intensive distribution and health education systems in these networks might be feasible and cost-effective in the context of a malaria elimination strategy where sustainability is less a concern and where such networks were already in place.</p><p>The Royal Government of Cambodia is very much engaged in achieving malaria elimination by 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The Cambodian health system, which relies on VMWs and VHSGs, is particularly well-suited to serve as backbone to the integration of an extensive distribution programme. The National Malaria Control Programme of Cambodia supports the network of VMWs in all villages with a relatively high malaria incidence to provide diagnosis and treatment at the village level. These VMWs are also actively involved in the distribution of LLINs and the spread of health information in the villages. The installation of this VMW network has contributed to reducing the malaria burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. VHSGs, created by ministry of health, provide a link between community and health facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>In this study, which is part of a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the epidemiological efficacy of topical repellents in addition to LLINs at the community level (MalaResT; registered as NCT01663831), the effectiveness of an extensive distribution scheme of topical repellents integrated into the VMW and VHSG systems was evaluated. The study established the feasibility of implementing intensive (with contact every 2&#x000a0;weeks) distribution schemes of additional vector control tools, in this case topical repellents, into the existing public health systems but with staff reinforcement. The impact of increased distribution and health education campaigns on the repellent consumption as well as the influence of different determinants to the distribution of the topical repellent were evaluated. The annual operational cost per capita of repellent distribution was calculated and compared with that of LLIN distribution in the same setting, recognizing that LLINs are effective during 3&#x000a0;years. The results presented could be viewed as an intermediate step towards operational implementation of intensive distribution schemes outside trial conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area and population</title><p>The trial was conducted in 113 villages (grouped into 98 clusters) in Ratanakiri province, the northeast of Cambodia, from January 2012 to December 2013. The study area is mountainous and mostly either covered by forest or deforested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. People in the area belong to 10 different minority groups, and are mostly subsistence farmers cultivating seasonal crops such as dry rice, cassava and beans on slash-and-burn forest fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In most villages, a large number of households have farms outside the villages where they usually work and stay in plot huts during planting or harvesting season. Here they are more exposed to malaria, but preventive materials such as mosquito nets are usually present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Road conditions between the villages and the farms are generally poor especially in the rainy season (June&#x02013;October) when some villages and farms are only accessible by boat and or on foot.</p><p>In both arms of the MalaResT project, LLIN distribution was carried out by the Provincial Malaria Control Programme and supervised by the National Malaria Centre (CNM), aiming to cover 100&#x000a0;% of the population with a ratio of one net to one person regardless of age. In the intervention arm, all participants aged from 2 to 10&#x000a0;years were additionally provided with 10&#x000a0;% Picaridin topical repellent (lotion), and over 10&#x000a0;years old with 20&#x000a0;% Picaridin (spray). No placebo repellent was provided in the control arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Strategy for repellent distribution and promotion of repellent use</title><p>A bottle of repellent contains 100&#x000a0;ml of repellent (spray or lotion), which is the amount required for two applications per day during 2&#x000a0;weeks for an adult (&#x0003e;10&#x000a0;years, spray) and during 4&#x000a0;weeks for a child (2&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years, lotion). To fit the existing VMW and VHSG systems and the repellent application rates, a pyramidal distribution strategy was opted for with a 2-weekly bottle exchange schedule (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All 57 intervention villages, grouped into 49 clusters, had an individual belonging to the VHSGs and 44 of them had VMWs in place. Many of VMWs and VHSGs were one and the same person. All VMWs and 13 individuals from the VHSGs were recruited as distributors during the trial. To complete the ratio of one distributor for every 50 households in a village, an additional selection of 66 distributors was made in 2012. Motivation and ability to read and write Khmer language were key criteria for selection. Compensations for the distributors&#x02019; work existed of per-diems and travel costs during repellent distribution times in the village and travel costs to 2-weekly meetings at the health centre (HC). Each distributor was assigned to work for households near his/her house in the village or on the farm. In 2013, five inactive distributors were replaced and 12 additional distributors were selected in hard-to-reach villages. All distributors were supervised by HC staff with assistance from extra supervisors and project staff. In 2012, the distributors were supervised by nine HC and two project staff. In 2013, one to two extra supervisors per HC (total 13 extra supervisors), according to the study area size of each HC, were recruited to assist the HC staff to support the distributors in improving the repellent distribution, promoting its use and facilitating data collection.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Pyramidal system for repellent distribution and supervision. Number of people involved in the trial by level, number of households covered by the trial and number of repellent bottles distributed in 2012 (<italic>red</italic>) and 2013 (<italic>purple</italic>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12936_2015_960_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Every 2&#x000a0;weeks, the distributors exchanged bottles in their respective catchment areas by setting central points to meet household representatives who came with the used bottles. Afterwards, distributors went from house to house in the villages and to the plot huts searching those who were absent. Bottles with less than half of the remaining amount of repellent were exchanged for new ones; otherwise they were given back to the users for further use. All required information was recorded in a household datasheet (HDS). A distribution round required 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days and had to be finished just before the 2-weekly meeting at the HC. In each meeting, steered by HC and project staff or supervisors, HDSs were checked for completeness and quality of the collected information. The empty bottles were collected for recycling by a specialized waste management company. Re-using the old bottles was not an option for safety reasons, as the empty bottles contaminated by repellents may be used for other purposes without changing the label. Moreover refilled bottles may lose their label over time. The distributors were given the required number of new repellent bottles for the next distribution session. In each HC, a separate storing space was refilled with repellents a few days prior to each meeting.</p><p>All 13 extra supervisors were employed by the project with a monthly salary of USD 180 per person. Monthly incentive for HC staff of USD 40 per person and their per-diem of USD 5 per day and travel costs to do supervisions were also paid by the project. The routine meeting schedule of VMWs is monthly and VHSGs quarterly. Thus once a month and once a quarter the distributors meeting overlapped with VMWs and VHSGs meetings, respectively. It was estimated that, on average, a distributor worked about 1.75 full days a week in the distribution scheme.</p><p>To promote repellent and LLIN use, a series of health education campaigns were conducted between April and May 2012. Leaflets and posters explaining when and how to apply repellents were distributed in the intervention arm and the use of LLINs in both arms. Two applications per day of the repellent were recommended: in the evening (between 5 and 7&#x000a0;pm) and after getting up in the morning. During the health education campaign of March&#x02013;May 2013, a movie about LLIN and repellent use (the last one only in the intervention arm) was projected on big screen followed by knowledge verification and this in addition to the information provided during the campaign of 2012. Furthermore, in 2013, the supervisors regularly performed house-to-house health education for those who did not use repellent and those who used less.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>Two sources of information were used in this study:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Household data sheets (HDS)</p><p>In both study years, during each bottle exchange, the distributors interviewed the available household representatives based on a standard fill-in form (quantitative survey) and checked all used bottles (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Following information was recorded in the HDSs: codes of used bottles, amount of repellent leftover in each bottle, adverse events experienced by any household member, reasons for not complying or not using the repellent by any household member, codes of new bottles and dates of bottle exchange. Each household received a unique identification code which was used during the entire project.

Random effects at both the village and the distributor level were included in the models. The associations between the response variables and the determinants were investigated in a univariate way. Since the contact is a proportion, a binomial error distribution was used. Consumption was modeled using a Gaussian distribution, and given the dependency of the consumption on the availability of the repellent, the contact was included as a covariate in all the models. Operational cost comprising transportation, training, distributors and supervisors was calculated. The analyses for potential determinants of contact were done separately for 2012 and 2013.

Household representatives consented verbally to use the repellents and they were routinely informed by distributors about the objectives of repellent distribution and data collection in their local language. In addition they were asked to provide a finger print on the HDS at every bottle exchange contact for proof of contacting the distributor. Every eligible person had his or her own rights to refuse, stop or restart using the repellent anytime without any discussion. Before the start of an interview each participant was informed verbally, either in Khmer for the distributors or in the local languages for the users (mostly via a translator), about the objectives of the surveys, confidentiality of information, anonymity in the database and their rights to deny to participate.

It demonstrated that, given these well-supervised trial conditions, mass distribution was achieved. A fourfold increase in the contact rates between the repellent distributor and the households in the community and about a threefold increase in the consumption rates was documented in the second year. This increase was associated with more intensive efforts to improve the distribution and use of repellent in the second year of study, such as the recruitment of additional distributors and supervisors, and the increase of logistic and financial supports to distributors. Moreover, more attractive health education campaigns (consisting of a movie show in the communities) followed by door-to-door health education by the supervisors in 2013 were carried out.</p><p>Although contact and consumption were correlated, the variance around the correlation increased with higher contact rates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This illustrates that increasing ownership of vector control tools is easier than increasing its actual use, which was also shown in the context of bed net distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. As such, both the intensive distribution system and the health promotion should run parallel to ensure a performant system in terms of ownership and use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Earlier studies demonstrated that socio-economic factors influence ownership and use of malaria vector control tools. However these control measures were not provided free of charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In contrast, in the present study, no relation was observed between SES and the contact and consumption rates, suggesting that equity of ownership was obtained using a free distribution strategy, characterized by a 2-weekly repellent exchange schedule, and implemented by re-enforcing the existing VMW and VHSG systems with additional human and financial resources.</p><p>Contact rates were observed to be higher in both study years in households that reported to know the distributor as their relative, friend or neighbour. This is an expected but important element of intensive distribution schemes that might be further exploited in the implementation of such systems. A similar result was obtained in a study on condom use through a condom coupon redemption programme in Kampala, Uganda. The most popular condom distributors in both intervention and control arms redeemed also the most condom coupons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It should be noted that the contact and consumption rates in the present study were probably underestimated as 12 and 7&#x000a0;% of the Household Datasheets for 2012 and 2013 respectively were incomplete and not considered for analysis. Moreover during parallel observational studies in the villages it was occasionally reported that people received repellents from the distributors without being recorded in HDS (Gryseels et al, personal communication).</p><p>Significant variation in contact per district was observed in 2012, but not in 2013. In 2012, in two districts (Lum Phat and Oyadao) distribution was less performant as compared to the other districts (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The study protocol expected each distributor to spend at least 2&#x000a0;days per 2&#x000a0;weeks to distribute the repellents to all households before meeting at the health centers to replenish stock. In 2012, they did this on a voluntary basis, receiving only a small per-diem and gasoline for travelling in the village. Working on a voluntary basis caused large variations in the amount of effort of the distributors in arranging repellent exchanges with villagers, which later resulted in large variation from one commune to another and from one district to another. This was confirmed by the absence of association between district or commune and contact rates in 2013 after replacing inactive distributors who were busy with their own private businesses and improving distributors&#x02019; supports and supervision system.</p><p>District was also significantly associated with consumption in 2013. Three districts (Kon Mom, O Chum and Taveng) showed higher consumption rates than the others (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Possibly the study villages in these districts were more disturbed by insect nuisance than the others (Gryseels et al. personal communication). In 2013, consumption was significantly associated with household head occupation. The households led by farmers were more likely to consume more repellent than those led by sellers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In this context, the sellers usually stay in the village for business while the farmers work or stay near or in the forest where they are probably more exposed to insect nuisance leading them to consume more repellents than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Likely loggers would be the most exposed to insects as they spend most of the time in the forest. However, their number was too limited (8) to find a significant association. The SES was not significantly related to the consumption rates, which suggests that there might be other factors (which were not measured in the study) that are more related to use. Indeed, a mixed methods study on repellent use performed in parallel to the present study concluded that repellent acceptability was high but that repellent use depended on other variables such as location of use (the deep forest, the forest farm), seasonal and economic activities, and level of insect nuisance (Gryseels et al. personal communication). Personal preference factors, such as perceived smell of the repellent and fear of side-effects were, especially among children and women, the main causes for not using repellents (Gryseels et al. personal communication). This suggests that, in the context of malaria elimination, making intervention tools available alone will not be sufficient to ensure use. Moreover, consumption of repellent does not necessarily mean correct use, as users reported several alternative uses (spray on the insects, around the body, on clothes, on nets) instead of applying the product on the exposed skin surfaces (Gryseels et al. personal communication).</p><p>The annual cost per capita for repeated repellent distribution and follow up is much more expensive than the one for LLINs. However given that repellent distribution is expected to last only during a period of intensified control efforts to eliminate malaria in a given area, these extra costs may be fully justified.</p><p>In the context of Cambodia, where a strong community-based malaria control system (VMW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] is an effective means to make malaria diagnosis and treatment accessible to people in remote areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], adding other health services to the system did not degrade its quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], because VMW&#x02019;s basic scope of work is very small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, adding more tasks, incentive and adequate programmatic supports to the VMWs and VHSGs (such as repellent distribution in the current study) can be a way of motivating community health worker s to work efficiently in a comprehensive malaria control programme, or an integrated control programme comprising also of other diseases. Indeed, intensive distribution systems could also be useful for other personal protection tools. However increasing responsibilities of community health workers or VMWs will have cost implications and cost-effectiveness of this approach should be evaluated in the context of an elimination strategy. Moreover, additional ways of implementing such a repellent distribution should be explored, for example through commercial and social channels such as schools, agricultural and religious networks to make the product accessible to rural users.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A 2-weekly repellent distribution system is an intensive scheme that ensures access to the tool for the entire target population. In the present study it was shown that such an intensive distribution scheme is feasible when built on the existing community health worker system and providing additional incentives, logistical and programmatic support. Health education campaigns were conducted in parallel. As such, intensive distribution systems, which are needed in the final run for malaria elimination, can be deployed in low resource countries, taking into account the effectiveness of the vector control measure provided and time until elimination is expected to be reached. Moreover, such systems can at the same time be used for distribution of other disease intervention tools. The present study has shown that, in similar contexts, the distributors should be selected from a well-functioning existing community-based health network, such as the VMWs and VHSGs in this study and complemented by volunteers selected among local authorities, community NGO networks and ultimately local people. Alternative or supplementary distribution channels should be considered. In the present study the SES of users had no influence on access to and consumption of repellents which pleads for free distribution of disease control tools by national programmes to achieve equity which may not necessarily be achieved using commercial channels.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12936_2015_960_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>
