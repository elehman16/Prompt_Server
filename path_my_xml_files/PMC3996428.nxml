on pulmonary function test (PFT) values such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced
expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of asthmatic patients .[Subjects and
Methods] Thirty subjects with severe asthma aged between 20&#x02013;39 years were enrolled after
they had signed a written consent. Subjects were selected using the inclusion criteria,
and PFT were randomly administered. Spirometer measurements (FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>) were
taken in the supine, side lying on right, side lying on left, sitting and standing
positions. Each measurement was taken three times, and the average values were analyzed.
[Results] One- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey&#x02019;s Test (post hoc) for pair- wise
comparison indicated that there was a significant difference in the FEV<sub>1</sub> values
of the asthmatic patients however a significant difference was obtained between standing
and supine positions. There was also a significant difference in the FVC values between
the standing and supine lying position in the pair -wise comparison. [Conclusion] This
study showed standing is the best position for measuring FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC of
asthmatic subjects. The more upright the position, the higher the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC
will be.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pulmonary function test</kwd><kwd>Standing position</kwd><kwd>Spirometry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>COPD is a common disease worldwide. It is the 4th leading cause of death. Worldwide
prevalence of COPD ranges from 4&#x02013;6%<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) studied adults of 20&#x02013;44 years at
European centers, and found a high prevalence of reported asthma symptoms in Latin America
and Western Europe, but a much lower prevalence in Eastern Europe, and even lower
prevalences in Africa and Asia, with the exceptions of more affluent countries like
Singapore and Malaysia<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence
India is documented as up to 4.1%, with figures of 5% for males and 3.2% for females<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Many researchers have reported significant changes in pulmonary function with positioning.
Reductions of 12% for forced vital capacity and 15% for force expiratory volume in one
second have been observed in normal individuals between the different body positions of
sitting and slumped half lying<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared
with the upright position, however, recumbent positions have well-documented deleterious
effects on lung function, such as reduced lung volume and capacity, increased closing volume
of the dependent airways, reduced flow rates, and reduced arterial saturation. Positions
affect respiratory muscle activity by changing the length of the respiratory muscles during
rest and inducing changes in ventilation and perfusion, in particular, the maximum air
exchange that occurs depends on gravity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Mean expiratory pressure and peak expiratory flow rate are influenced by lung volumes and
muscle length-tension relationships, which in turn are influenced by body position<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vital capacity has been found to be lowest
in the fetal position compared to other body positions<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of breathing maneuver and sitting posture on the
muscle activities of the inspiratory accessory muscles of patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease have been reported<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Spirometry can be helpful in determining the effects of smoking on ventilator functions. It
is the best method for detecting borderline to mild airway obstruction, which occurs early
without the appearance of any symptoms or signs. FEV<sub>1</sub> is the most important
spirometry measure for the assessment of airflow obstruction<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Current guidelines for asthma care categorize asthma severity
based on the frequency of asthma symptom, medications used and mean lung function. For a
reliable diagnosis lung function tests are necessary. In pronounced cases, a simple
spirometry test measuring FEV<sub>1</sub> is sufficient.</p><p>Coughing and huffing are expiratory maneuvers that use high expiratory pressures and flow
rates to aid airway secretion clearance. Physiotherapists encourage patients to cough and
huff as part of a strategy to clear airway secretions in order to minimize complications.
High expiratory flow rates and expiratory pressures are required for the production of
strong and effective expiratory maneuvers<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The objective of this study was to
investigate changes in pulmonary function values of asthmatic patients with change in
position.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A sample of 30 subjects of both genders within the age group of 20&#x02013;39 years who had

They were recruited from Maharishi Markendeswar Institute of Medical
Sciences, India. Ethical approval was gained from University Hospital Ethical Committee and
the subjects gave their formal informed consent. Subjects with active infection, those
taking medication within the past 6 weeks, or those with cardiovascular and neurovascular
diseases, restrictive disorders, or a history of abdominal or thoracic surgery, and smokers
were excluded. The Spiro Excel pc based pulmonary function test (PFT Medicaid Systems) was
used for measurement. Force expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) is the volume
of air exhaled in the first second under force after a maximal inhalation. Forced vital
capacity (FVC) is the total volume of air that can be exhaled during a maximal forced
expiration effort</p><p>One hour before the measurement, instruction and demonstration was given to subjects on how
to perform spirometry. FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> were measured in the supine, right side
lying, left side lying, sitting and standing positions. The order of the body positions was
randomized, and the test positions were standardized: a) Sitting in a wooden chair with the
trunk extended, hip and knee flexed, as near as possible at right angle. b) Lying on a bed
with a pillow supporting the head and both legs are extended. c) Side lying: Left side lying
with the right hip and right knee flexed at 90 degrees. Pillows were set under the right
thigh and right arm and head to maintain the body position without effort and vice versa for
the right side-lying position. Subjects lay on a flat stretcher with one pillow under the
head, one pillow behind the back and against the stretcher rail or wall. The tester observed
the subjects throughout the rest periods and the test maneuvers to ensure their maintenance
of a full side-lying position with the head and neck in line with the torso. d) Erect
standing without any support. Each measurement was done three times, and the average values
were analyzed. Measurements were performed with subjects in a fasting state to avoid
encumbering the diaphragm movement with gastric contents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey&#x02019;s test for pair wise comparison of group
means were used to evaluate the within group and between group differences of pulmonary
function test values of asthmatic subjects in different positions. Both FEV<sub>1</sub> and
FVC in the standing position were significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) higher than in the supine lying
position. Tukey&#x02019;s test (post hoc) for pair- wise comparison of group means also showed that
there were significant differences in both FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC values between the
standing and supine positions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, the effect of different positions on FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC values
of asthmatic patients was evaluated. The results of the present study have two major
findings. First, there was a significant difference in the FEV<sub>1</sub> values of
asthmatic patients between the standing and supine positions. There was also a significant
difference in FVC between these two positions. Thus the null hypothesis was rejected. Some
researchers have reported a relationship between respiratory function and posture. Previous
studies reported FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> were lower in the supine and prone positions
compared to the sitting position. In the present study, these two positions and three other
positions were compared in young asthmatic subjects. Differences in position and disease
might influence the result; however spirometric values of obese asthmatic subjects with BMI
&#x02265;30 are not affected by sitting and standing positions<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pressure caused by the intra- abdominal organ on the diaphragm
is larger in the supine position than in sitting. Our results show that FEV<sub>1</sub> and
FVC were lower in the supine position, and are inconsistent with the results of other
studies which reported increased airway resistance in the supine position due to an increase
in intra- thoracic blood volume<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>).</sup></p><p>The results of the present study demonstrate that FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC had higher values
in the standing than in the supine position. The results are consistent with the other
studies which have examined the change in FVC when changing position from standing to supine
in young adults. This might be due to an increase in the diameter of the main airway in the
standing position. When a person is upright the vertical gravitation gradient is at the
maximum, the anterior &#x02212; posterior diameter of the chest wall is greater, and the compression
of lung and heart is minimized<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. However
significant differences were not found between standing and the other positions of sitting,
and right and left side- lying (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table

augmented with progressively upright position in patients with COPD as well as in healthy
individuals. Standing results in the highest maximal expiratory pressure values, and lowest
in the supine position<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This result was
not supported by Jenkins SC and Soutar SA, who showed that limited chest wall motion caused
by posture did not have any effect on FVC of healthy young subjects<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. To assess FEV<sub>1</sub>, fast forced expiration is
necessary. The expiratory muscle, mainly used in forced expiration in sitting and side-
lying with most upper leg flexed, and one or both hip joints flexed is the rectus abdominus;
therefore, FEV<sub>1</sub> values are lower in the supine position. Another study conducted
with normal subjects showed that change in position from sitting to supine or prone resulted
in significant changes in the respiratory pattern<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In lateral positions the lung function decreases because of lower
capillary volume<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study will help in the selection of the best alternative position for
the PFT for measuring FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC. The standing position can be used for other
therapeutic purposes. Body position has an effect on FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC as measured by
the PFT. Generally, the more upright the position, the higher the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC
will be. These data suggest that at times, patients should be placed in the standing
position while undergoing the PFT, to increase FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors extend their appreciation to the College of Applied Medical Sciences Research
