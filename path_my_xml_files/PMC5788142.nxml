This paper presents the key magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings from the CLARITY Extension study.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1756285617753365"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients who received a cumulative dose of either CT 3.5 or 5.25 mg/kg in CLARITY were rerandomized to either placebo or CT 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY Extension. Patients from the arm that received placebo in CLARITY were assigned to CT 3.5 mg/kg. MRI assessments were carried out when patients entered CLARITY Extension and after Weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96, and in a supplemental follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1756285617753365"><title>Results</title><p>At CLARITY Extension baseline, patients who received placebo during CLARITY had more T1 gadolinium-enhanced (Gd+) lesions than patients who received CT during CLARITY. These patients, who were then exposed to cladribine 3.5 mg/kg during the extension, experienced a 90.4% relative reduction (median difference &#x02212;0.33, 97.5% confidence interval &#x02212;0.33&#x02013;0.00; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in T1 Gd+ lesions at the end of the extension compared with the end of CLARITY. Overall, the majority of patients in each treatment group remained free from T1 Gd+ lesions throughout CLARITY Extension. However, a small proportion of patients who were treated with cladribine in CLARITY and received placebo in CLARITY Extension showed evidence of increased MRI activity, and this was associated with a prolonged treatment gap between CLARITY and CLARITY Extension.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1756285617753365"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A 2-year treatment with CT 3.5 mg/kg has a durable effect on MRI outcomes in the majority of patients, an effect that was sustained in patients who were not retreated in the subsequent 2 years after initial treatment.</p><p>

This highlights another important aspect of these findings, that there was no evidence of rebound disease in the groups that received placebo during CLARITY Extension.</p><p>There were some increases in lesion volume and fewer patients remained free from new lesions in patients who switched from CT in CLARITY to placebo in CLARITY Extension, particularly the CP 3.5 mg/kg group, compared with patients who received CT in both studies. Compared with patients randomized to placebo in the CLARITY study, those treated with CT had a considerably lower mean number and smaller volume of T1 Gd+ lesions at CLARITY Extension baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1756285617753365">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, patients who received placebo in CLARITY followed by CT 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY Extension went on to experience a relative reduction in the mean number of T1 Gd+ lesions of 90.4% (median difference &#x02212;0.33, 97.5% CI &#x02212;0.33&#x02013;0.00; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) compared with the end of CLARITY. This observation provides further support for the findings of the original CLARITY study.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1756285617753365" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Patients in both groups that were switched from CT in CLARITY to placebo in CLARITY Extension (CP 3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg) showed a relatively small increase in mean numbers of T1 Gd+ or active T2 lesions at the end of the study compared with the groups that continued to receive treatment with CT (CC 7.0 and 8.75 mg/kg). This increase in MRI activity was nominally significant for the CP 3.5 mg comparison, but not the 5.25 mg/kg group, possibly reflecting an effect of the dosage administered during CLARITY, although the study was not powered to compare treatment effects between groups in this way. Despite these minor increases, the mean numbers of T1 Gd+ lesions in the CP 3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg groups remained low, and below the values observed at CLARITY baseline. Furthermore, a high proportion of patients remained free from T1 Gd+ lesions in the CP 3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg groups during CLARITY Extension (CP 3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg, 73.0 and 80.2%, respectively). This indicates that in the majority of patients, 2 years of treatment with CT in CLARITY resulted in a sustained absence of MRI activity. The uptick in the proportion of patients with an increased number of T1 Gd+ lesions in the CP 3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg groups may have been seen in patients who experienced a prolonged treatment gap between CLARITY and CLARITY Extension. This suggests that CT has a durable impact that prevents or slows MRI activity in patients with RRMS.</p><p>Patients with a longer treatment gap between CLARITY and CLARITY Extension were more likely to experience MRI activity than patients with a shorter treatment gap. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses indicated that patients in the CP 3.5 mg/kg group who had experienced prolonged treatment gaps between CLARITY and CLARITY Extension were more likely to experience T1 Gd+ lesions than patients who had experienced shorter gaps between CLARITY and CLARITY Extension. The patients who experienced prolonged treatment gaps finished CLARITY Extension between 5.5 years and 6.5 years after entering CLARITY. Therefore, patients receiving placebo in CLARITY Extension received the last dose of CT at the start of year 2 in CLARITY, approximately 4.5&#x02013;5.5 years before the end of CLARITY Extension. These circumstances may explain some of the 11.6% of patients who had a mean number of T1 Gd+ lesions &#x02a7e; 1.0 in the CP 3.5 mg/kg group.</p><p>The patterns of observed low-level MRI activity did not translate into a detectable clinical activity within the study period. The safety and efficacy outcomes from CLARITY Extension have been described in a separate publication.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1756285617753365" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The efficacy outcomes showed that there were no significant differences in the annualized relapse rates or EDSS scores of patients who received CT in CLARITY and placebo in CLARITY Extension compared with patients who received CT in both phases of the study.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1756285617753365" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Given the previous observations of a relationship between MRI activity and disease progression, it is possible that the minor differences observed in MRI activity during CLARITY Extension may ultimately translate into clinical differences over much longer timescales (i.e. spanning decades). Further studies to provide insights into the long-term efficacy of treatment with CT are needed, including assessment of the effects of disease activity detectable by MRI measurements. Such studies will help to determine whether some patients may benefit from new treatment with CT after a prolonged period without active treatment, such as 4&#x02013;5 years.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that the baseline characteristics of patients at the start of CLARITY Extension may not match the characteristics of patients in the original CLARITY study. This may have resulted in some selection bias during CLARITY Extension. In addition, the variable treatment gap was not preplanned and must be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. The design of CLARITY Extension was not finalized until after the CLARITY study had started. Delays also occurred as a result of administrative issues related to obtaining the necessary approvals from the study centres. Although not prespecified, the gap does substantially increase the overall length of follow up, thus providing insights into the long-term effects of treatment with CT on safety and efficacy. Other limitations that affect these results include inequalities in the distribution of patient numbers in the treatment arms, which is expected because patients receiving CT in CLARITY were rerandomized to CT 3.5 mg/kg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio in CLARITY Extension.</p><p>In summary, the findings from CLARITY Extension suggest that treatment with CT 3.5 mg/kg has a durable effect on MRI outcomes. The mean numbers of T1 Gd+ lesions remained well below CLARITY baseline across all treatment groups, including the CP groups, which had a higher mean number of T1 Gd+ lesions than the CC groups. Furthermore, the majority of patients in each treatment group remained free from T1 Gd+ lesions, even without retreatment after 2 years.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing assistance was provided by Phil Jones and Ash Dunne of inScience Communi-cations, Chester, UK, and supported by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was sponsored by EMD Serono, Inc., a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (in the USA), and Merck Serono SA, Geneva, an affiliate of Merck KGaA Darmstadt, Germany (ROW).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of interest statement:</bold> GC has received consulting fees from Novartis, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Sanofi-Aventis, Merck, Receptos, Biogen Idec, Genentech-Roche, and Bayer Schering; lecture fees from Novartis, Teva Pharmaceutical Ind.
