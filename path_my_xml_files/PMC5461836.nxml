At second-level intervention (voice call level), patients from both groups who missed their first appointment were given a voice call requesting them to come for follow-up, and the reasons for first missed appointments (MA) were also elicited.

There are various challenges in continuing care in mental health-care settings, among which missed appointments (MA) are a common occurrence in outpatient care settings,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] yet little is known about the reasons for MA, especially in the Indian population. Follow-up studies from around the world including India[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] show that 16&#x02013;60% of patients will not follow up in spite of the need for further treatment. About 30&#x02013;60% of patients miss their appointments while 20&#x02013;30% discontinue their treatment with subsequent lost to follow-up.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Most common reason for MA in the studies is patient errors such as forgetting or oversleeping followed by social stigma, financial reasons, logistics, or getting the date wrong.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The use of mobile phones has grown exponentially, especially in India. Mobile phones have been used to improve health outcomes in number of studies but its role to improve follow-up in psychiatry is yet to be established.</p><p>To fill this existing knowledge gap, this study evaluates the role of short message service (SMS) and voice calls in improving timely follow-up. We hypothesize that SMS and voice call reminders will improve the follow-up of patients in community mental health settings. The aim of study is to evaluate whether SMS and voice calls of mobile technology will improve the follow-up of patients in community mental health center. This study also aims to evaluate the reasons for MA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted at the outpatient clinic of &#x0201c;Sakalawara Community Mental Health Centre&#x0201d; of &#x0201c;National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences&#x0201d; (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India. It is a community-based mental health clinic situated (18 km away from the main campus of NIMHANS) in rural areas of Jigani Hobli, Anekal Taluk of Bengaluru district. Data were collected over a period of 6 months from November 2014 to April 2015. It is a randomized control study with stepped-up design. The Ethical Committee of NIMHANS approved this study.</p><p>Patients or caregivers (irrespective of clinical diagnosis) having valid mobile number and have competence to manage the English SMS were included in this study. Actively symptomatic patients who are without any caregiver and patients or caregivers who are incompetent to manage either voice call or English SMS were excluded from the study. All patients and/or their caregivers with these inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study after taking informed consent. All recruited participants received usual treatment, and a specific follow-up appointment date was given at the end of consultation. A person (either patient or caregiver) who will manage the SMS and/or voice call was decided at the time of recruitment. Sociodemographic and clinical data along with valid mobile number were collected in a semi-structured pro forma. The Charleston Psychiatric Outpatient Satisfaction Scale (CPOSS)[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] was administered to the patient.</p><p>The study design is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Flow Diagram 1</xref>. Enrolled patients were randomized into two groups (SMS group vs. non-SMS group). All patients were unaware of their group at the time of enrollment. A SMS reminder was sent to SMS group 24&#x02013;48 h before scheduled appointment day to patients/caregivers. Non-SMS group did not receive any intervention at the first level (as usual follow-up).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Flow Diagram 1</label><caption><p>Results</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPsyM-39-276-g001"/></fig><p>All patients from both groups who reached appointment-on-time (RA) were given usual treatment. Patients/caregivers who failed to follow-up on the scheduled appointment were contacted on their mobile number voice call. The reason for the MA was elicited through preformed questionnaire during voice call soon (described below), and obtained data were classified in seven broad categories. A new appointment date was fixed within the next 2 days of MA over the phone. For those patients that do not follow up even after a fresh appointment at the second intervention, the procedure as above was carried out for three more times after which the patient was considered lost to follow-up in the study.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 19.0 version (IBM, USA). Quantitative variables were summarized as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for normally distributed data or median (interquartile range) for nonnormal data, whereas categorical variables as number and percentage. Comparison of means of quantitative variables across different intervention groups was done by independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test for normal data or Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test for nonnormal data. Association between categorical variables was checked using Chi-square test. After first SMS versus non-SMS intervention, a bivariate logistic regression analysis was performed first to identify the variables associated with MA status, and those variables showing a Wald test <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 20% were considered for multiple logistic regression analysis. Odds ratio (OR) of MA status and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 624 patients were screened for the study.

Rest of the variables which were significant in the bivariate analysis were subjected to multiple logistic regression.</p><p>Multiple logistic regression analysis shows that sending SMS is a significant predictor to RA (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.02&#x02013;3.33). Diagnosis of alcohol dependence and distance from the center are other significant predictors for MA. Surprisingly, gender is a neutral predictor for MA or RA [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Factors affecting missed appointments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPsyM-39-276-g003"/></table-wrap><p>Result shows that SMS reminders can help patient follow-up on appointment date significantly more as compared to no intervention (62.26% vs. 45.37%) while using SMS and voice call together can improve follow-up further significantly [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Flow Diagram 1</xref>].</p><p>As the second-line intervention, patients with MA were communicated in voice call.

This may need the prior inquiry about anticipated social reasons to ensure follow-up on appointment dates.</p><p>This study has some of the limitations such as small sample size and recruiting English SMS competence patients only. Future studies shall involve design with larger sample size with their native languages in view of significant positive result from this pilot study.
