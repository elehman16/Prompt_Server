Although patients are treated according to existing guidelines and reach clinical remission, erosive progression still occurs. This demonstrates that additional methods for prognostication and monitoring of the disease activity are needed. Bone marrow edema (BME) detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proved to be an independent predictor of subsequent radiographic progression. Guiding the treatment based on the presence/absence of BME may therefore be clinically beneficial. We present the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to evaluate whether an MRI-guided treatment strategy compared to a conventional treatment strategy in anti-CCP-positive erosive RA is better to prevent progression of erosive joint damage and increase the remission rate in patients with low disease activity or clinical remission.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study is a non-blinded, multicenter, 2-year RCT with a parallel group design. Two hundred anti-CCP-positive, erosive RA patients characterized by low disease activity or remission, no clinically swollen joints and treatment with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) will be included. Patients will be randomized to either a treatment strategy based on conventional laboratory and clinical examinations (control group) or a treatment strategy based on conventional laboratory and clinical examinations as well as MRI (intervention group). Treatment is intensified according to a predefined treatment algorithm in case of inflammation defined as a disease activity score (DAS28) &#x0003e;3.2 and at least one clinically swollen joint (control and intervention groups) and/or MRI-detected BME (intervention group only). The primary outcome measures are DAS28 remission (DAS28&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.6) and radiographic progression (Sharp/vdHeijde score).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The perspectives, strengths and weaknesses of this study are discussed.</p><p>This study has been approved by The Regional Scientific Ethical Committees for Southern Denmark, S-20110109.

Patients typically experience joint pain, disability and loss of quality of life, and they are at risk of developing progressive joint damage, which eventually leads to irreversible joint deformity and severe functional impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The long-term prognosis of RA is poor. After 20&#x000a0;years of disease, 80% of the patients will have evidence of disability, and 19% are severely disabled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately 50% of the patients will have stopped working 10&#x000a0;years after disease onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Erosive joint damage occurs early in the disease course and precedes subsequent progressive joint damage and functional limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Other known prognostic factors of radiographic damage are existing radiographic damage, shared epitope alleles, rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody positivity and biochemical signs of inflammation [increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)] at disease onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, even though these prognostic factors are all associated with poor radiographic outcome on a group level, at the individual patient level they cannot distinguish which patients will progress or not. MRI bone marrow edema, which reflects inflammatory infiltrates in the bone marrow (osteitis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], has proved to be a strong independent predictor of radiographic progression in patients with early RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and may therefore have significant prognostic value at an individual level.</p><p>The modern treatment strategy involves early and aggressive treatment with frequent clinical follow-up aiming at reaching a target of clinical remission in patients with early RA and at least a state of low disease activity in patients with longstanding RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This treat-to-target strategy has been shown to slow the destructive progression and prevent functional loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, it has been demonstrated that 20-30% of patients who reach the treatment target of clinical remission still show progressive erosive joint damage, no matter what remission criteria are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the clinical and laboratory methods currently used in routine clinical practice for assessments of disease activity are not sufficiently sensitive. This illustrates and emphasizes that new more sensitive methods for monitoring and prognostication are highly needed to ensure that the treatment can be optimally adjusted in order to achieve the best possible outcome.</p><p>MRI depicts the pathological changes in all tissues involved in RA and shows greater sensitivity in detecting inflammatory and destructive changes than both clinical examination and x-ray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This superior sensitivity of MRI compared to conventional clinical examinations and radiographs, combined with the knowledge that MRI detected BME is a strong predictor of subsequent radiographic progression, has generated the hypothesis that adding MRI to the conventional clinical and laboratory examinations and intensifying treatment in the presence of subclinical MRI BME will reduce radiographic erosive progression and improve the patient&#x02019;s functional level.</p><p>The aim of the present study is in an RCT to evaluate whether an imaging-based treat-to-target treatment strategy using MRI and DAS 28 (Disease Activity Score involving 28 joints) can prevent progression of erosive joint damage and increase the remission rate in patients with RA compared to a treat-to-target treatment strategy guided only by DAS 28. To our knowledge, this is the first study using MRI as a guide for treatment intensification in RA patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study is conducted in Denmark as a multicenter, non-blinded, 2-year, RCT with a parallel group design.

The e-CRF has been developed to function within the nationwide DANBIO registry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], where most Danish RA patients are already registered and followed in daily practice, making it easy to handle for the rheumatologist. The e-CRF is built of three separate communicating modules: one for the investigators, another for the radiographers and a third for the MRI evaluator. All are entering data into their module using individual usernames, passwords and user rights, i.e., the radiographers and MRI evaluators have no access to clinical data, and the MRI evaluator is blinded to patient data and only has access to anonymized imaging data. When the MRI has been evaluated, &#x0201c;bone marrow edema present&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;bone marrow edema absent&#x0201d; is entered into the CRF, and the result will then become visible to the investigator.</p><p>The e-CRF is &#x0201c;interactive,&#x0201d; i.e., only shows variables that are relevant for the visit assessed and with respect to the allocated intervention.

The randomization sequence is created by an independent statistician (RC) using a &#x0201c;random number&#x0201d; generator, SAS statistical software (version 9.2). The randomization sequence is entered into the e-CRF by an independent data manager (NSK).

The use of MRI as a treatment guide may be valuable in individualizing the treatment, so patients assessed as being at high risk of erosive progression can receive appropriately intensive treatment so disease progression can be avoided. If an MRI-guided treatment strategy is shown to be beneficial, implementation in daily clinical practice will also be feasible. The availability of MRI can vary, but the examination time doing a scan for BME is short (less than 30&#x000a0;min), and no contrast agent has to be administered. Thus, the procedure will be noninvasive and safe for the patient. In addition, the MRIs only need to be evaluated for the presence or absence of BME, meaning that the evaluator will not need to be trained in a specific scoring system.</p><p>The design of this study is unique and methodologically very strict and systematic, which is essential to achieve scientifically valid data. A weakness is however the non-blinded design. The rheumatologist and patient are not blinded to the allocated intervention, which potentially could lead to bias. However, full blinding would require that all seven MRIs also were done in the control group, but not used, which was not considered feasible and ethically justified. A major strength is that all the MRI scans will be evaluated for BME within 7 working days after acquisition at a central reading center by one evaluator (BE), who has extensive experience from previous MRI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The evaluator will be blinded to chronology, clinical, laboratory and other image data. Consequently, the evaluations will be consistent, which will improve study quality and the subsequent results.</p><p>The IMAGINE-RA trial is, as far as we are aware, the first study using MRI to guide RA treatment. The results of the study will be of great importance for all rheumatologists that treat RA patients and can potentially change our way of monitoring RA patients and individualizing the treatment so a better disease outcome can be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is recruiting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Endnotes</title><p><sup>a</sup>The AMBRA study at King Christian 10th Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Graasten and Vejle Hospital, involved 300 patients with RA in accordance with the ACR 1987 classification criteria, DAS28&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3.2, &#x02265;1&#x000bd;&#x02009;year&#x02019;s disease duration, unchanged anti-rheumatic treatment&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;months and no biological treatment.
