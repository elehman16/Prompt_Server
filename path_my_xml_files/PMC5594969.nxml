The trial design was approved by the Institutional Review Board (STP/SDMDS2015PED42). The informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children participated in the study.</p><p>A total of 45 children aged 4&#x02013;8 years requiring pulpectomy in any one of the primary mandibular molars were randomly allotted to one of the three groups where instrumentation was done using: Group 1: manual K-files; Group 2: proTaper rotary system; Group 3: Mtwo rotary system. Computer-generated randomization sequence was generated by a person, not involved in the study. The sample size was calculated from a previous <italic>in vivo</italic> study with 95% power using G Power analysis.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The selection of the children was based on the following criteria: (a) vital or nonvital mandibular primary molars without sinus tract, (b) absence of internal or external pathologic root resorption, (c) presence of adequate coronal tooth structure to receive SS crown. The children lacking cooperative ability, children with underlying systemic diseases, and children with special health-care needs were excluded from the study.</p><p>All the procedures were done by a single operator. A full mouth examination with intraoral periapical radiographs of the teeth indicated for pulpectomy was taken before the start of the clinical procedure. After confirmation of the diagnosis, local anesthesia was administrated using 2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline (LOX* 2% ADRENALINE, Neon Laboratories limited, India). The tooth was isolated using rubber dam (GDC Marketing, India).</p><p>Using a round carbide bur in a high-speed handpiece, the superficial caries and roof of the pulp chamber were removed. Coronal pulp amputation was done with spoon excavator. No. 10 size K-file was used to determine the patency of the canals. The working length was determined with radiograph and was kept 1 mm short of the apex. The canal preparation was done using:</p><p>

</p><p>During the canal preparation, the instrumentation time was recorded in seconds using a stopwatch by an assistant. The canals were then irrigated with saline and dried using sterile paper points. The obturation was done using calcium hydroxide and iodoform paste by gently pushing with cotton pellets (Metapex, Meta Biomed Co., Ltd., Korea). A postobturation radiograph was taken to assess the quality of obturation. It assessed by another pediatric dentist who was blinded to the type of instrumentation used for canal preparation. The obturation quality was graded as underfill, optimal fill, overfill.</p><p>The glass ionomer cement (Shofu, Shofuinc. Japan) was given as the entrance filling. The pulpectomy treated teeth were restored with SS crowns either on the same day or in the next appointment.</p><p>The statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 17.0. (Chicago, SPSS Inc). Chi-square test was used for inter- and intra-group analysis of quality of obturation. ANOVA and <italic>post hoc</italic> Tukey test were used for the compare the instrumentation time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 23 girls and 22 boys were participated in the study.

Pulpectomy should be the treatment option to maintain the integrity of facial tissue. Cleaning and shaping of the root canal is an important step in pulpectomy. The success of an endodontic procedure depends on the proper mechanical debridement and obturation quality.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] There are many <italic>in vitro</italic> studies done in primary teeth comparing different rotary instrumentation systems with manual instrumentation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] As there are no <italic>in vivo</italic> study done comparing manual files with ProTaper and Mtwo, this randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial was conducted to evaluate the quality of obturation and instrumentation time using K-file, ProTaper, and Mtwo.</p><p>ProTaper files are triangular in cross-section while the Mtwo files have S-shaped cross section. These files get engaged into the walls of the canals, producing smooth and tapered canal walls.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Nagaratna <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the increased risk of instrument fracture with rotary instruments is a potential limitation for its use in primary teeth.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This is due to the softer and less denser root dentin, thinner and more curved roots with undetectable root tip resorption, and ribbon-shaped root morphology of the primary teeth.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] There are no clear guidelines for the sequence of using rotary files in primary teeth. Hence, a modified sequence of using only S2 file in ProTaper system and 0.04% taper with 0.25 tip of Mtwo rotary file was selected in this current study. This modified sequence combined with its use in a torque-limited handpiece resulted in no instrument separation within the canals.</p><p>With regard to the quality of obturation, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in both mesial and distal canals. In the study done by Abbas Makarem in 2014 and Tania Ochoa&#x02013;Romero in 2011, a statistically significant difference was noted in the quality of obturation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Intragroup comparison showed superior obturation of the mesial canals in both rotary groups. The distal canals instrumented with rotary files were over obturated in majority of the cases. This could be due to the anatomy of the root canals. Distal canals are usually straight and wide while the mesial canals are curved and slender.</p><p>In the current study, a significant difference in the instrumentation time was noted between the three groups. The reduced instrumentation time was also evident in other studies done with different rotary systems.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This decrease in the instrumentation time could positively influence the behavior of the child in the dental chair.</p><p>Inclusion of only the mandibular molars is considered as the potential confounder in the current study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>With the use of rotary instruments for pulpectomy in primary teeth, marked reduction in the instrumentation time has been appreciated resulting in decreased chair side time thereby positively influencing the child's behavior.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and
