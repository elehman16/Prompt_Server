This study begins to address this need by exploring the use of dignity therapy with people with MND. Dignity therapy is a brief psychotherapy that promotes hope, meaning and dignity, and enhances the end of life for people with advanced cancer. The aims of this study are to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of dignity therapy for people with MND.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This cross-sectional feasibility study used a one-group pre-test post-test design with 29 people diagnosed with MND. Study participants completed the following self-report questionnaires: Herth Hope Index, FACIT-sp, Patient Dignity Inventory, ALS Assessment Questionnaire, ALS Cognitive Behavioural Screen, and a demographic and health history questionnaire. Acceptability was measured with a 25-item feedback questionnaire. Feasibility was assessed by examining the length of time taken to complete dignity therapy and how symptoms common in MND affected the intervention. Generalised linear mixed models and reliable change scores were used to analyse the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant pre-test post-test changes for hopefulness, spirituality or dignity on the group level, but there were changes in hopefulness on the individual level. The results of the feedback questionnaire indicates dignity therapy is highly acceptable to people with MND, who report benefits similar to those in the international randomised controlled trial on dignity therapy, a population who primarily had end-stage cancer. Benefits include better family relationships, improved sense of self and greater acceptance. Dignity therapy with people with MND is feasible if the therapist can overcome time and communication difficulties.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Dignity therapy for people with MND is feasible and acceptable. Further research is warranted to explore its ability to diminish distress.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>

There is no cure and few options exist for treatment. While a few die within six months, others live ten years or more. On average, people live two to three years after diagnosis before eventually succumbing to paralysis and death, most often from respiratory failure <xref rid="pone.0096888-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-McDermott1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the considerable physical and emotional suffering involved, there is little focus on addressing the psychological needs of people with MND. Quality of life is generally high <xref rid="pone.0096888-Ganzini1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096888-Neudert1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, but people with MND often experience significant psychological distress including anxiety and hopelessness <xref rid="pone.0096888-Felgoise1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Psychological distress in MND is associated with decreased quality of life and decreased survival rates <xref rid="pone.0096888-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Hopelessness is correlated with interest in hastened death <xref rid="pone.0096888-Ganzini1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-Bascom1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-Ganzini2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Among those with terminal diagnoses, people with MND report the highest levels of interest in hastened death <xref rid="pone.0096888-Ganzini3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and they also have the greatest risk of suicide <xref rid="pone.0096888-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These effects are mitigated in people who report higher levels of spirituality and sense of meaning <xref rid="pone.0096888-Foley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-Fegg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Such findings have led to calls for psychological interventions to bolster hopefulness, spirituality, and meaning in people with MND <xref rid="pone.0096888-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-Fanos1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; however, intervention studies are lacking.</p><p>One promising intervention is dignity therapy; a brief psychotherapeutic intervention based on an empirical understanding of dignity at the end of life <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Dignity therapy offers people facing death the opportunity to create a document about their life <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In a recorded life reflection interview, a person with terminal disease is afforded the opportunity to discuss significant memories, meaningful events and important accomplishments, as well as leave messages for loved ones. In previous studies, dignity therapy has been shown to alleviate existential distress in a palliative care population where most people had malignant conditions <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. With a key aim to bolster hope and meaning, dignity therapy has the potential to alleviate psychological distress in people with MND <xref rid="pone.0096888-Fanos1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, because most of the people in previous dignity therapy research had terminal cancer, the findings of its effectiveness are not transferable to people with MND. Diagnosis, ability to communicate, cognitive acuity, stage of illness, baseline levels of distress and demographic features are factors that differentiate people with MND from people with end-stage cancer. Finally, delivery of dignity therapy to people with MND may require modification, for example, to be performed at an earlier time or via assisted communication methods.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of dignity therapy to enhance the end of life experience for people with MND.

MNDAWA sent recruitment letters to people who had been diagnosed with MND and referred to their services by a general practitioner or neurologist. In the last six months of the study, we used social networking, a press release, and information on the university web site to assist in reaching the recruitment goal. One participant in Queensland participated via video-conferencing. Twenty-two participants reported living in an urban/metropolitan area and seven in rural areas. Twenty-seven participants were living at home at the time of the intervention, one in an aged-care facility and one a hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Participants</title><p>Individuals diagnosed with MND, over 18 years old, who could communicate in English and provide informed consent (based on the ALS-Cognitive Behavioural Screen (ALS-CBS) <xref rid="pone.0096888-Woolley1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> where a cut-off score of 10 was used or the Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration (BOMC) test <xref rid="pone.0096888-Katzman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> where a cut-off score of 9 was used) were eligible for the study. Participants were provided with information sheets and written consent was obtained. Enrolment occurred between June 2011 and July 2013. People were excluded if they were too ill to complete the requirements of the protocol. There were no selection criteria based on distress levels, disease stage or proximity to death.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The intervention</title><p>The intervention was administered by a researcher trained in dignity therapy by Harvey Max Chochinov who developed the therapy <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The therapy interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by a transcriptionist. The researcher shaped the transcribed interviews using the prescribed editing process <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and then returned to edit and complete the transcripts with the participants. The document was read aloud to each participant at the conclusion of the intervention. To mitigate response bias, post-testing took place via mail or through a visit from a second researcher. The researcher engaged in regular supervision sessions from Prof. Chochinov. To optimize adherence to the dignity therapy protocol, three recordings, transcripts, and completed documents (10%) were reviewed by three experienced researchers (two trained in dignity therapy) and deemed to be adherent.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Measures and Outcomes</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Effectiveness</title><p>Outcome data to measure potential effectiveness were collected from participants at baseline and one week after completion of dignity therapy.

Demographic data on age, gender, education level, marital status, and health history were also collected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Analysis</title><p>Data were analysed with generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) as implemented through SPSS's (Version 20) GENLINMIXED procedure. Model parameters were estimated with robust standard errors in order to accommodate potential violations of the model assumptions. Participant was treated as a random effect and Time (pre-test, post-test) was treated as a fixed effect. Age, gender, time since diagnosis, marital status, level of education, and number of days from pre-test to post-test were also treated as fixed effects and analysed individually as potential moderators of the intervention effect. In order to optimise the likelihood of convergence, a separate GLMM analysis was run for each of the three outcome measures. The GLMM maximum likelihood procedure is a full information estimation procedure that uses <italic>all</italic> the data present at <italic>each</italic> assessment point. <italic>All</italic> of the pre-test data and <italic>all</italic> of the post-test data are incorporated into the analysis, which reduces sampling bias associated with participant attrition. GPower (Version 3.1) indicated that 29 participants would be sufficient to capture &#x02018;moderate to large&#x02019; (<italic>f</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.28) pre-post changes on the outcome variables. A reliable change (RC) score for each participant <xref rid="pone.0096888-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> was computed to investigate the presence of reliable pre-post change at the individual rather than group level. The RC score is the degree to which the person changes on the outcome variable divided by the standard error of difference between the pre- and post-test scores. When the absolute value of the RC score is greater than 1.96, (Wise <xref rid="pone.0096888-Wise1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> has argued that this value can be reduced in some situations), it is likely that the post-test score reflects a <italic>real</italic> or <italic>reliable</italic> change.

We expected to detect measureable post-intervention increases in hope, dignity and spirituality at the group level but this did not occur. This may be due to a number of reasons, including the difficulties with demonstrating psychosocial change at the end of life with self-report measures <xref rid="pone.0096888-Albers1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, the result of evidence which suggests the benefits of psychosocial interventions at the end of life can most readily be shown in patients who have elevated levels of distress <xref rid="pone.0096888-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and/or that the outcome measures chosen were not sensitive to the impacts that occurred. Very small pre-post effects were present for dignity and spirituality, and the effect for hopelessness was small to moderate. However, without a control group, we were unable to ascertain whether the intervention had a prevention effect against expected declines in hope, dignity, and spirituality over time as a person with MND deteriorates and approaches death. At the individual level, tentative findings are that dignity therapy may be effective at increasing hopefulness in people who are more spiritual and also in some with advanced disease, as reported in previous research <xref rid="pone.0096888-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>Nonetheless, the positive results on the feedback survey indicate most people with MND believe dignity therapy to be beneficial. The intervention was found to be overwhelmingly positive. Feedback indicated dignity therapy helped enhance the end of life by supporting the unique identity of the person, helping with acceptance, allaying aftermath concerns, finding meaning and purpose, and improving family relationships which mirrors the previous findings of the pilot study and international randomised controlled trial of dignity therapy performed with people with end-stage cancer <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Feasibility</title><p>Dignity therapy with people with MND is feasible if the therapist can overcome time and communication difficulties, as it takes longer to administer with people who have MND than those with cancer. Therapist time was increased in order to travel to participants in their homes to deliver the intervention (previously completed in palliative care settings <xref rid="pone.0096888-Chochinov4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096888-Montross1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>) and was compounded for participants in rural areas. Ninety-three percent of participants were in the community rather than an in inpatient or care facility. As such, we were less in control of the schedule. Additionally, for people with speech impairment, dignity therapy was prohibitively difficult and time consuming to perform. Adapted methods appear to present viable solutions to these issues, such as some of the therapy being conducted via email or utilizing videoconferencing.</p><p>Unique aspects common to MND, including speech impairment and mild to moderate cognitive impairment, did not detract from the benefits of the therapy. These results indicate that dignity therapy is feasible and acceptable, and it offers potential benefits for people with MND.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of this feasibility study were the high response rate, high completion rate, a group representative of people with MND in demographic and health status characteristics, the use of MND-specific cognitive and health status measures, and the measure used to assess acceptability being nearly identical to the one used in the dignity therapy international randomised controlled trial, which allows for comparison. The limitations include inadequate power to discover small effects, mild to moderate levels of distress at baseline, the lack of a control group, and the use of outcome measures not developed or validated for use with people who have MND. The study group may not be representative of the MND population as a whole as those who selected to participate may have been more likely to think dignity therapy would be beneficial.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications for future research</title><p>This feasibility study sets the stage for a phase II randomised controlled trial. Potential effectiveness should be further explored through research with people with MND with elevated distress. Research into conducting the intervention via email and through videoconferencing is also indicated. There has been one small study with eight participants showing dignity therapy can be delivered using videoconferencing <xref rid="pone.0096888-Passik1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> but a larger study is warranted. Future studies should include hope as an outcome as well as explore the possible relationship between a person's spirituality and changes to hopefulness through dignity therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Dignity therapy for people with MND is feasible and the unique features of MND, including speech impairment and mild to moderate cognitive impairment can be managed, but the intervention is likely to take a greater length of time to complete compared to previous studies, especially with those individuals experiencing speech impairment who do not utilize assisted communication. Dignity therapy is acceptable to people with MND, who report numerous benefits. Further research is warranted to explore its ability to diminish distress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Samar Aoun and Harvey Max Chochinov for their assistance on the project and for securing the funding for this study.
