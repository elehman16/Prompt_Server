Evidence suggests that cooperation has direct and indirect benefits for the cooperators. Given how beneficial cooperation is overall, it seems relevant to investigate the various ways of enhancing individuals' willingness to invest in cooperative endeavors. We studied whether ascription of a transparent collective goal in a joint action promotes cooperation in a group.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 48 participants were assigned in teams of 4 individuals to either a &#x0201c;transparent goal-ascription&#x0201d; or an &#x0201c;opaque goal-ascription&#x0201d; condition. After the manipulation, the participants played an anonymous public goods game with another member of their team. We measured the willingness of participants to cooperate and their expectations about the other player's contribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between subjects analyses showed that transparent goal ascription impacts participants' likelihood to cooperate with each other in the future, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. Further analysis showed that this could be explained with a change in expectations about the partner's behavior and by an emotional alignment of the participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study found that a transparent goal ascription is associated with an increase of cooperation. We propose several high-level mechanisms that could explain the observed effect: general affect modulation, trust, expectation and perception of collective efficacy.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was conducted at the Department of Culture and Society and was supported by the Religion Cognition and Culture Unit and the Department of Culture and Society, Aarhus University, Denmark.

Social agents might clearly understand that cooperation would be beneficial in the long run. They might be willing to take a certain amount of risk by delaying an immediate benefit for a greater future prospect given what they make of the likelihood of success in a set of prevalent conditions. But if they do not trust that the outcome of the cooperation will be mutually beneficial, they probably will not take the risk to cooperate <xref rid="pone.0064776-Baumard1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Our experiment tests if a specific modification of the modality of interaction &#x02013; <italic>goal-</italic> v. <italic>process-ascription</italic> &#x02013; has an impact on levels of trust and hence, on the participants' willingness to cooperate with each other later in ulterior interactions. Teams of participants were first being asked to follow a set of specific instructions organizing their participation in a collective sequence of actions. In one condition, the <italic>transparent</italic>, participants were being shown the goal/result of their collective action (process), while, in the other condition, the <italic>opaque</italic>, participants were kept unaware of the goal/result of their interactions. Thereafter, they played a public goods game. Our prediction was twofold: (i) participants in the transparent condition will be more cooperative than the ones in the opaque condition and (ii) that difference in cooperative levels will correlate with participants' expectations about other group members' willingness to cooperate. We also looked for effects on participants' emotion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethical Statement</title><p>This experiment was approved by the De Videnskabsetiske Komiteer for Region Midtjylland.

The unique Nash Equilibrium of the game is zero contribution from both subjects, since a player could potentially gain more by defecting if the game partner were to contribute. The game reflects the tension between individual incentives and collective benefits. Both investors are caught in a dilemma; if one player invests, and the other defects, she may end up with less than she had at the start of the game. If both cooperate and invest their money, both benefit equally from the cooperation. Substantial evidence shows that culture has an influence on cooperation, mainly in the presence of reward or punishment opportunities <xref rid="pone.0064776-Ostrom3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064776-Gtcher1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

In the transparent condition the participants were asked to follow a set of instructions displayed sequentially on a computer screen instructing them when and how to participate. They were also shown what the final outcome of their interaction would be: a building made of wooden blocks of different shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064776-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In the opaque condition, participants were asked to follow the same set of instructions as in the <italic>transparent</italic> condition but were not made aware of the end-result of the actions of the group. After the manipulation, the participants played a two-players public goods game. They were told that they would be playing with one of their previous teammates for real monetary stakes, and that they had to decide if they wanted to invest money (and how much) in the common project. Participants were then asked to provide their estimation of the other player's contribution and after completion of the game, they were administered a questionnaire. Participants' basic demographic information was collected. Other specific questions addressed participants' level of group participation in their everyday lives, and their impressions of the manipulation task. All instructions and questions were provided in Danish (the native language of the participants), and a Danish assistant, blind to the hypotheses, conducted the experiment. We used 4 participants in the manipulation process in order to assure that anonymity would not be perfectly revealed in the following economic game and so we controlled for attraction effects.</p><fig id="pone-0064776-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0064776.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Collective goal.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0064776.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants were recruited via flyers among the student population of the university. Participants were invited to take part in a behavioral economic experiment. A few days before the experiment was to take place, the experimenter contacted each potential participant by phone to invite him/her at a specific time to the laboratory facilities. After the phone contact, the participants received an email reminding them of the time and location where the experiment was to take place. They were also reminded of the nature of the experiment and asked to send a signed written informed consent via email before participation.</p><p>Upon arrival to the laboratory the participants were assigned to distinct waiting rooms in order to avoid any communication prior to the experiment. They were then led to another room, where they were asked to sit next to each other, facing a table and a large monitor on which the instructions to follow would be displayed. In front of each participant was a paper-bag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064776-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) containing 20 building blocks of different shapes (80 blocks, each to be manipulated once by one of the teammates, for a total of 20 actions per participant). The participants were told that their objective was to build together a construction, using the wooden blocks, following the instructions sequentially displayed on the monitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064776-g001">Fig. 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064776-g002">2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0064776-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0064776.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Participants during the manipulation task.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0064776.g002"/></fig><p>The participants where not told whether or not to communicate with each other. Which participant's turn it was and which block was to be placed in a particular position were systematically specified in the instructions displayed progressively on the monitor. The participants were also instructed not to touch any of the other players' blocks. The procedures were identical in both conditions, but for the fact that the participants in the transparent condition could see displayed on the monitor the final product of their actions, whereas in the opaque condition the participants could not. The sequence of instructions to be systematically followed controlled for the risk of social loafing effects.</p><p>At the end of the phase of manipulation, each one of the four participants was immediately isolated in individual rooms. On a desk in each of the four rooms were a stack of 5 sheets of paper and a pen. The first sheet presented the instructions for the public goods game, followed by a control test that required from them to solve simple examples of the economic game. The third sheet was the decision form, on which they were instructed to write the amount they wanted to invest. In the fourth sheet, participants were asked to write their estimation of the amount that the other player would invest in the common project. Finally, the last sheet was the questionnaire (41 questions in total). When done with the questionnaire, the participants were asked, one by one, to come to the control room, where they were debriefed in isolation (hence preserving the anonymity of all participants), received their respective payment, and asked if they wanted to get more information or to provide any feedback. The experiment lasted about 45 minutes: 11 minutes for the building interaction phase and 30&#x02013;34 minutes for the economic game and questionnaire. The minimum amount paid was 75 DKK (&#x02248;10 euros), and the maximum was 175 DKK (&#x02248;23.5 euros).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Cooperation</title><p>Our main prediction was that the participants in the transparent condition would show higher levels of cooperation than the participants in the opaque condition.

Because the data did not fully satisfy the assumption of normality, a one-way Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted. The test confirms the results by showing a significant difference in investment as a function of action type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064776-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

Process-ascription warrants equality of access and treatment in complex modern institutions. But such ascription seems to have also some unintended consequences. In the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, social scientists such as Durkheim and Weber had already addressed the inherent advantages and pitfalls of stipulating administrative and bureaucratic processes <xref rid="pone.0064776-Durkheim1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064776-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064776-Weber2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A typical tendency associated to process-ascription is the disconnection between rigidly prescribed processes and their ultimate intended goals.</p><p>In the experiment, in one condition we recreate such a disconnection between process and goal while in the other condition we reinforce the perception that individuals interact in a logical and stepwise manner toward a stipulated goal. The experimental data collected seem to support the idea that, all else being equal, a minimal manipulation, <italic>i.e.</italic> the clear and sustained ascription of a goal, can have a tremendous impact on the reinforcement of lasting cooperative units. Below, we address the question of how coordinated action, with a clearly identifiable goal, leads to higher levels of cooperation. We also discuss potential psychological mechanisms explaining our results.</p><p>In the transparent condition, participants have the experience of a shared collective goal, unlike in the opaque condition. It has been shown that having a readily accessible goal in mind enables agents to address at the same time other competing goals, such as reputation monitoring <xref rid="pone.0064776-Custers1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. When a goal is publically stipulated, social agents are more willing to coordinate their actions because they care to be perceived as good prospects for further interactions. However, we may still wonder why in our specific manipulation the ascription of a goal has a long-lasting impact on the participants. The participants follow a strict sequence of actions allowing no individual initiative. Yet, later in the economic game their willingness to cooperate increases. So, how does interaction give rise to the perception that coordination and cooperation are occurring eventually leading to more willingness to cooperate in ulterior interaction? One potential answer to that puzzle might be that the collective goal ascription creates the illusion of a constructive interaction, allowing for the reframing of the individuals' prescribed actions as part of a cooperative scheme. In both conditions, the participants evaluate the situation, but their respective evaluations differ in how individual contributions are perceived. In the transparent condition, the contribution of the participants is evaluated not just as response to a set of instructions, as in the opaque condition, but as actual contribution to the fulfillment of a collective goal. This leads participants to reconstruct what happened, in terms of a collective goal, re-conceptualizing it as an actual case of cooperation. By contrast, in the opaque condition individual actions seem harder to be integrated into a collective goal-structure hence are plausibly less likely to be interpreted as cooperative.</p><p>Studies indicate that the coordination among work group members is enhanced if the members have a shared mental model of the procedures to be followed <xref rid="pone.0064776-Daily1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064776-Kozlowski1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064776-CannonBowers1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064776-Banks1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064776-Guastello1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Coordinated behavior occurs when all agents perform actions that correspond to the necessity of satisfying a goal conjointly. The visually transparent goal facilitates the perception of coordination. Subsequently, coordination impacts how cooperative the participants will be, as they probably regard the other participants as coordinators having a shared goal and similar utility about the known outcome. In a theoretical vein, we speculate that transparent goal ascription also contributes to a lower prediction error rate <xref rid="pone.0064776-Kilner1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064776-Caplin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Transparent goal leads to enhanced cooperation because the available information is more advanced about the choice options available, as opposed to guesses when the outcome is unclear.</p><p>The amount that participants contribute to the public goods game is our basic measure of cooperation levels. The game takes place after the phase of manipulation indicating a carry-over of the effect to the new and different task. We propose two main alternative explanations for our findings. (1) The experimental manipulation induces particular types of affects moderating participants' overall dispositions to cooperate. Contrary to what would occur when no clear objective is identified, the ascription of a goal might induce positive affects in participants by the sheer fact that it facilitates the integration of the entire experimental activity. The positive affect borne out of the relatively more pleasing experience would eventually influence how increasingly other-regarding participants become. Conversely, the absence of a goal ascription could make the overall experience less pleasing in the opaque condition eventually moderating the level of willingness to interact positively with other social agents. (2) We identify another likely mechanism that could be at play here: the level of trust that the participants feel toward one another. The participants in the transparent condition seem to have identified their teammates as good cooperators and to be confident and willing to invest in further cooperation despite the inherent risk of being exploited. Therefore, we argue for a model of trust as enhancing cooperative behavior lasting in time <xref rid="pone.0064776-Gchter1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064776-Hardin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Social psychologists have identified this link between trust and cooperation in the &#x0201c;goal/expectation theory&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0064776-Pruitt1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Mutual trust is essential to good cooperation and cooperative behavior arises when both parties have a goal specifying their mutual cooperation as well as a common expectation that the other will also cooperate. Ascription of a transparent goal in a group of people creates not only shared goals but also aligns the expectations concerning the group's performance. In both conditions, we see that participants have coordinated their expectations with the others of the group, when it comes to cooperative investment. High investments are followed by high expectations and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Given how our experiment was designed, we cannot decide if the investment decisions are based on expectations or if the participants rationalize their evaluations of others' investment based on what they have invested in the first place <xref rid="pone.0064776-Ariely1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, we believe that a transparent collective-goal creates perceptions of collective efficacy. Participants in the transparent condition have the impression of a collective success. In contrast, in the opaque condition, participants do not have a perceptible anchor to relate to and therefore they seem to have difficulty forming a collective unit dedicated to achieving a goal <xref rid="pone.0064776-Kerr1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This interpretation is supported by the correlation between participants' investments in the game with the data about their feelings during the &#x0201c;building&#x0201d; process, as reported in the questionnaire. Participants seem to align or synchronize their emotional states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064776-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In social interaction, emotions can pass from one individual to another by imitation, mimicry, and empathy. Emotions are indicators of a re-framing process. We see that the more cooperative participants are the ones who found the process more entertaining, whereas the less cooperative participants report more mixed emotions. The transparent condition might lead to individual reconceptualization of having reached collectively a goal.</p><p>Cooperation characterizes many human social interactions. We may wonder, as Axelrod and Hamilton did, &#x0201c;under what conditions will cooperation emerge in a world of egoists without central authority?&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0064776-Axelrod1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> Our results speak to the great importance of the ascription of transparent goal in creating and enhancing cooperation. We have not fully provided a cognitive model that could explain the observed effect but we were able to identify new areas of research that have the potential to refine our understanding of cooperation. The study suggests that ascription of a transparent collective goal functions as a top management mechanism that can significantly enhance cooperation and facilitate overcoming the problem of freeriding in a public-goods dilemma. As we have shown, a refined knowledge of the goal of a collective endeavor has an impact on the agents' disposition to engage in cooperation. Ultimately the capacity to foster thoughts about collective goals might have played an important role in the build-up of wider cooperative networks not explicable by kin selection or direct reciprocity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Many thanks Julia Nafziger, Alexander Koch, and Dimitris Xygalatas for valuable advice; Jamie Foehl for reading and commenting on the paper; Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, where I was when writing this paper; the anonymous reviewers and editor Attila Szolnoki for their constructive feedback.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0064776-West1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
