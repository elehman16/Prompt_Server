Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine whether nutritional support with high protein (ONS) in adult oncologic patients in the first step of cancer cachexia&#x02014;asymptomatic precachexia, has an influence on the toxicity of systemic therapy. However, secondary endpoints were established: to determine whether high protein ONS influences the nutritional status, the quality of life, and the performance status. Materials and Methods: A total of 114 persons aged 40&#x02013;84 years old with colorectal cancer were examined. Based on the randomization, 47 patients were qualified to the interventional group (ONS group) and 48 to Control group. To evaluate the nutritional status NRS-2002 (Nutritional Risk Screening), SGA (Subjective Global Assessment), SCRINIO (SCReenIng the Nutritional status In Oncology) Working Group classification, VAS (Visual Analog Scale) for appetite was used. FAACT (Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy) questionnaire was used for assessment of the quality of life. The health status of patients was evaluated based on the Karnofsky Performance Scale. Anthropometric measurements were done. Results: Severe complications of chemotherapy, which caused the end of treatment, a slight complication of the gastrointestinal tract such as diarrhea grade 2 according to ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) score regardless of the studied group, were observed. There were no statistical differences in the number and severity of the observed complications, i.e., neutropenia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea. During the follow-up the significant changes of SGA, VAS, albumin and prealbumin were observed between groups. In the ONS group an improvement in nutritional status was noticed (increased appetite VAS, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05; increased points in SGA, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015, and increased levels of albumin and prealbumin, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05). In Control group nutritional status was stable during observation. The performance status and quality of life were stable in both groups. No statistical differences between groups (ONS vs. Control) in the numbers for disqualification, resignation, delay in treatment, or dose reduction were observed. Conclusions: Results of the study did not indicate that nutritional support in precachectic oncologic patients influenced the toxicity of systemic therapy. High protein nutritional support improved nutritional status assessed by SGA, VAS for appetite, albumin, and prealbumin. The performance status and quality of life were stable throughout the observation and were not changed under the supplementation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>nutritional status</kwd><kwd>appetite</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd><kwd>oral nutritional supplementation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-09-01108"><title>1. Background</title><p>Cancer is a systemic disease, since even in the early stages malignancies are accompanied by homeostatic imbalance, including metabolic deregulation and increased catabolism. These abnormalities may initially seem poorly discernible in the clinic, but with disease progression they may aggravate; and may cause overt cancer-related cachexia. </p><p>It is known that cachexia is an independent negative prognostic factor, a leading cause of impairment of the quality of life, and that it produces functional deterioration of oncologic patients. Various frequencies of cachexia in different malignancies are also well described, and may result from their different biology or, presumably, from unknown individual factors [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Finally, it should be noted that in recent years the concept of cancer cachexia was frequently misregarded as simple undernutrition, resulting in the inefficacy of the undertaken interventions.</p><p>However, according to the international consensus, cancer-related cachexia is a complex multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of lean body mass (mainly skeletal muscle mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support as a single intervention, and leads to a progressive functional impairment of the whole organism [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. </p><p>The pathogenesis of cachexia is not completely elucidated, yet negative protein and energy balances are its crucial elements: these being the consequence of deregulation of multiple intermediate metabolic pathways, latent inflammatory state and anorexigenic action of multiple biologically-active factors [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. </p><p>Moreover, it should be stressed that clinical pictures of metabolic disorders in cancer form a continuum; beginning from precachexia (stage I), through cachexia (stage II) and ending with refractory cachexia (stage III) [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or according to SCRINIO (SCReenIng the Nutritional status In Oncology) Working Group classification&#x02014;4 classes&#x02014;from asymptomatic precachexia (class 1) to symptomatic cachexia (class 4) [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. </p><p>The cancer cachexia could be associated with increased toxicity of cytotoxic treatment, and frequently necessitate premature termination of therapy. Furthermore, cachectic patients have poor performance status. So, a vicious cycle develops: cachexia reduces the possibility of use of cytotoxic agents, thus leading to disease progression, and this in turn promotes the development of resistant cachexia. The result is not only an unfavorable prognosis, but also poor quality of life for patients. Unfortunately, a sole nutritional intervention is inefficient in these cases, and its support with targeted pharmacotherapy requires further research. Thus, it is important to undertake actions aimed at prevention of developed cachexia (stage II and III) or postponing its occurrence [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Cancer-related precachexia&#x02014;the first step of cancer-related cachexia&#x02014;requires special attention. The optimal nutritional management of patients with precachexia could contribute to improvement of tolerability of oncologic therapy; as well as administration of due dose density, translating into higher treatment efficacy and improvement or preservation of the current nutritional and metabolic status. A positive impact on the quality of life and performance status is also proposed [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. </p><p>The patients with precachexia may have particular benefits from the implementation of nutritional support. Nevertheless, such data is lacking in the literature. Of course, maintaining or improving nutritional status in patients undergoing chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy is extremely important, as it is associated with improved prognosis. And indeed, this is the primary endpoint of many clinical trials. However, it seems that both the nutritional status and the toxicity of chemotherapy are closely related. </p><p>However, the optimal nutritional management of precachectic oncologic patients, remains unclear. Presently, no nutritional support leading to an increase of nutrient delivery is routine use in asymptomatic precachectic patients. Furthermore, there are no specific guidelines on the requirements for nutritional support in these persons. Oral nutritional supplements (ONS), however, may be of some importance. </p><p>Unfortunately, currently there are no standards for nutritional management in precachectic stage., It is especially unclear whether nutritional support should be implemented in preemptive strategy in the first step of cancer cachexia&#x02014;asymptomatic precachexia. </p><p>Furthermore, an unresolved question concerns the clinical justification of ONS use, which could also have economical consequences. The discussed products allow for delivery of nutritional elements in amounts covering the demand, in small volumes and in a form convenient for consumption. It should be noted that such a supply is often difficult to assure with nutrition using natural products only. Nevertheless, lack of data regarding the tolerability of ONS/intake ONS compliance remains another unsolved problem. Many products are characterized by high nutritive density and high osmolarity, which are associated with a potential risk of the induction of gastrointestinal disorders or paradoxical anorexia. </p><p>Elucidation of the discussed issues seems especially important in view of possible improvements to tolerance of chemotherapy, quality of life, nutritional status and prognosis in cancer patients; as well as potential savings of healthcare funds.</p><sec><title>The Aims of the Study</title><p>The aim of the study was to determine whether nutritional support with high protein ONS in adult oncologic patients in the first step of cancer cachexia&#x02014;asymptomatic precachexia, influences the toxicity of systemic therapy.</p><p>However, secondary endpoints were established: to determine whether high protein ONS influences the nutritional status, the quality of life and the performance status.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-09-01108"><title>2.

Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-nutrients-09-01108"><title>4.1. Nutritional Status</title><p>An extremely important clinical issue in oncology is the problem of malnutrition or high risk of deterioration of nutritional status, lack of appetite and subclinical inflammation.</p><p>High percentages of patients with significant weight loss have already been diagnosed early as onset of cancer&#x02014;depending on the location of the cancer, and the stage of the disease, it ranges from 40 to over 80% [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The percentage of patients who are diagnosed with anorexia&#x02014;often in the form of a malignant anorexia-cachexia syndrome&#x02014;and subclinical inflammatory disease is also not less.</p><p>Both subclinical inflammation, as well as metabolic disorders and abnormal nutritional status as a consequence, are highly unfavorable prognostic factors. In addition, the negative impact of the above on quality of life and functional independence of patients at various stages of cancer have also been found.</p><p>It is known that nutritional interventions in patients with malnutrition is unequivocally indicated, although it may not be fully effective due to co-existing metabolic abnormalities with increased catabolic processes. It would be prudent to undertake earlier nutritional interventions, for example, already at the stage of precachexia.</p><p>This study included the population of patients who met the criteria for diagnosis of cancer precachexia. They were patients with colorectal cancer in stage II&#x02013;IV according to the TNM classification.</p><p>In the study group, despite the normal or elevated BMI, it was found that the majority of patients were at high risk of malnutrition, or mild malnutrition criteria were met. The assessment of nutritional status was done comprehensively. Recommended scales for assessment of nutritional status and biochemical indicators as mentioned above. It is worth stressing that such a comprehensive assessment is necessary to obtain adequate results, since the measurement of body mass and BMI itself is insufficient and not entirely reliable.</p><p>At the start of the study, appetite in most patients was moderate (median VAS was 6.5 mm). However, it should be noted that the study program excluded patients with fully symptomatic anorexia. Despite the differences in BMI and body mass between study groups, at the beginning of the study unintentional body mass lost in both groups were similar and less than 10%.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the ONS group albumin and prealbumin concentration were significantly higher in comparison to the Control group at the beginning of the study, but statistical analysis after 3-months of observation considered the degree of changes during follow-up. But we can not exclude that in the case of patients with lower albumin and prealbumin a positive effect of supplementation would be even more noticeable. Statistically significant improvement in nutritional status was observed on the third visit in ONS group; while in the Control group, at the same time, a decrease of albumin and prealbumin levels was observed. Moreover, after completion of follow-up in the ONS group, compared to the Control group, patients presented statistically better appetite and higher albumin and prealbumin levels.</p><p>Thus, the implementation of oral high protein diet support already at the stage of precachexia appears to be significant and clinically relevant. In this study, it was found to improve the nutritional status of patients receiving ONS. In addition, the use of a high protein supplement did not negatively affect appetite. On the contrary, patients from the ONS group presented an improvement in appetite as compared to the Control group.</p><p>It is also worth emphasizing the significantly higher serum albumin and prealbumin levels in patients receiving ONS, which may have a long-term beneficial prognostic significance. The literature highlights the significant role of these nutritional markers in patients with cancer of various organs, including those with colorectal cancer [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Higher serum albumin levels are associated with improved prognosis, fewer complications after oncological treatment, and longer survival time. In a large retrospective analysis of more than 40,000 patients with colorectal cancer, hypoalbuminemia (&#x0003c;3.5 g/dL) was a strong correlator with longer hospitalization time and greater complications after surgical management of colorectal cancer [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In another study, baseline hypoalbuminemia (&#x0003c;3.5 g/dL) was found to be an independent factor associated with shorter survival time after primary tumor resection [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, in patients with relapsed or unresectable colorectal tumors, low albumin concentrations correlated with shorter total survival (OS) [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-09-01108" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Probably, in our study the too short observation time made it impossible to find a similar relationship&#x02014;better prognosis in better nourished patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-nutrients-09-01108"><title>4.2. Inflammation</title><p>As mentioned above, subclinical inflammation, which occurs in a significant proportion of patients with solid tumors, contributes to many metabolic disorders (e.g., insulin resistance), anorexia and, consequently, to abnormal nutritional status.</p><p>Indeed, the investigated inflammatory marker&#x02014;C-reactive protein (CRP) indicated the presence in most of the subjects of chronic inflammation, although no clinical evidence of infection was observed. Moreover, what was extremely important was the negative correlation between CRP and biochemical parameters of nutritional status (albumin, prealbumin) and appetite assessed by VAS. It is also worth noting that after 2 months of observation CRP levels have decreased in the ONS group, and regression indicates that CRP was a statistically significant factor affecting albumin concentration.</p><p>The above observation also seems to be very clinically relevant. It appears that the implementation of high-protein oral nutritional support in patients with precachexia reduces the expectations of subclinical inflammation while contributing to improved nutritional status.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-nutrients-09-01108"><title>4.3. Chemotherapy-Related Toxicity </title><p>In both study groups, patients with mild to moderate complications (systemic adverse events) were the most commonly reported. Diarrhea, as well as nausea and lack of appetite, were observed in grade 1&#x02013;2 (acc. NCI CTCAE) several days after receiving the drug. These are the most frequently mentioned in the literature, the adverse effects of chemotherapy primarily due to the gastrointestinal toxicity of cytostatics.</p><p>Laboratory results (e.g., peripheral blood morphology) were stable during follow-up&#x02014;delayed administration of the next chemotherapy cycle, or half-dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia, leucopenia or neutropenia were similar in both groups.There were no direct statistically significant differences in chemotherapy related toxicity between the two study groups. However, it seems highly likely that such a difference would occur in the case of longer follow-up times, and more chemotherapy cycles. This indicates an improvement in nutritional status and a reduction in inflammatory parameters in patients receiving nutritional support.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-nutrients-09-01108"><title>4.4. Limitations and Advantages of the Study</title><p>Our study is one of the first studies of early nutritional support during chemotherapy, and the first in CRC. The monthly visits with extensive data collection in both groups, including a strong focus on nutrition status, helped minimize placebo effect. The high compliance is also a strength of the study. The limitation of this study is primarily the short observation period, as well as patient resignation during the study. Patients most often reported lack of time, fatigue, malaise, and in ONS group, difficulty maintaining the recommended dose of the supplement, bad taste of the supplement. However, it is worth emphasizing the good tolerance of dietary treatment, the absence of differences in gastrointestinal symptoms between groups, and the high level of compliance of patients with recommendations for nutritional treatment.</p><p>It appears that the implementation of high-protein oral nutritional support at an early stage of metabolic disorders and nutritional status (i.e., precachexia) is a good method to reduce the risk of deepening malnutrition. It is also worth stressing that such action reduces the exponents of subclinical inflammation, which is the main pathophysiological cause of the development of malignant anorexia-cachexia syndrome. Taking into account the results of the study, the main endpoint should be the nutritional status rather than toxicity. Determining the effect of supplementation on chemo-toxicity has resulted in much longer follow-up and more patients.</p><p>Further studies, and longer follow-up time, are advised to answer the question&#x02014;does the use of high-protein dietary support at the stage of precachexia involve a prolongation of overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer? We are still looking for new therapies that will help to improve the prognosis of patients with cancer. It is also worth to pay attention to nutritional aspects, and their possible role in the prognosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-09-01108"><title>5.
