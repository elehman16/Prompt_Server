Sixteen male volunteers (age range, 20&#x02013;28 years; mean 24.3&#x000b1;2.1 SD) were enrolled in this study. All participants were non-smokers, free from medical, psychiatric, and sleep disorders as assessed by history, a medical and biochemistry examination. Furthermore, a comprehensive toxicological analysis of urine for prescription medication, non-prescription medication and drug abuse was carried out prior to the beginning of the study, along with an ophthalmologic examination in order to exclude volunteers with visual impairments. All participants were instructed to abstain from excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption (i.e., at most 5 alcoholic beverages per week, and 1 cup of coffee or 1 caffeine-containing beverage per day). Exclusion criteria also included shift work within the last 3 months, body mass index &#x0003c;19 and &#x0003e;28, and transmeridian flights during the month prior to study. Furthermore, they were instructed to keep a regular sleep-wake schedule (bedtimes and wake times within&#x000b1;30 min of self-selected target time). Compliance to this outpatient segment of the study was verified by wrist actigraphy (actiwatch L, Cambridge Neurotechnologies, Cambridge, UK) and self-reported sleep logs. All volunteers gave written informed consent.

On the basis of the volunteers' habitual bedtimes, the protocol started 10 h after usual wake-up time in the early evening (i.e. 18:00 h) and ended the next day, after usual wake-up time (i.e. 08:00 h). Participants underwent an episode of 1.5 h under dim light conditions (&#x0003c;8 lux), which was followed by a 2-h dark adaptation episode under complete darkness (0 lux). Subsequently, light exposure was initiated for the next 2 h. During this 2-h episode, participants received light from either CF lamp with 6500K or 2500K or incandescent light bulb at 3000K. Afterwards, participants remained awake for approximately 1-h episode under dim light conditions (&#x0003c;8 lux), before a sleep episode of approximately 8 h. The treatment order (6500 vs. 2500K vs. 3000K) was counter-balanced in order to avoid possible order effects of the light treatment. The entire control protocol was conducted at the same time of day (evening), with the same light intensity, during all sessions and on all subjects.</p><fig id="pone-0016429-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0016429.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Protocol design.</title><p>Light exposure at 6500K (blue bar), 2500K (orange bar) and 3000K (yellow bar).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0016429.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Lighting settings</title><p>A commercially available compact fluorescent light source with a highly correlated colour temperature (6500 K, Osram Duluxstar mini twist, Lumilux, cool daylight, France) was compared with a similar light source with lower colour temperature (2500 K, Osram Duluxstar mini twist, Lumilux, warm comfort light) and with an incandescent light source with a colour temperature of 3000 K (Osram incandescent lamp Classic A). Light was homogenously distributed within the entire field of view, since the room was very uniformly painted with high reflective white painting. Thus, the whole room acts almost like an integrating sphere. Both types of fluorescent lamps and the incandescent lamp were 18 W, with spectral range from 380&#x02013;780 nm, and had a similar spectral power distribution at wavelengths above 530 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016429-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). However, the 6500 K light source produced a considerably higher output between 420 to 520 nm (although the peak at 435 nm was similar). The photon flux was not the same for all light sources, since the incandescent lamp emits more IR-photons, which are not relevant. The action spectra were normalized to the photometric values, which mean that the luminance was the same for all lights, such that all light conditions have the same brightness for the participants. Spectral composition was compared with the 6500 K, 2500K and 3000K, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016429-g002">figure 2</xref>. Illuminance at the eye level was in the order of 38 to 40 lux. Mean illuminance levels measured at the wall were 40 lux and the wall reflectance was about 0.95 in the visible wavelength range. The average luminance of see by the test person within his field of view is therefore of 12 cd/m2. A calibrated high quality luminance meter (LMT L 1009, LMT Lichtmesstechnik GMBH Berlin) was utilized in order to ascertain that the light sources were adapted to have the same luminance. During the study protocol, subjects remained seated in a chair that was facing the wall (at a distance of 95 cm), and the light source was placed behind them, in order to minimize any possible visual constraints.

Since Berson and co-workers <xref rid="pone.0016429-Berson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> detected intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) in the mammalian retina, it began to emerge that the eye plays a dual role in detecting light for a range of behavioral and physiological responses apart from the classical visual responses. Melanopsin-containing ipRGCs have a specialized non-visual retino-hypothalamic tract which provides direct neuronal connections to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), as well as direct and indirect (via SCN) projections to brain areas implicated in the regulation of arousal <xref rid="pone.0016429-Gooley2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, the SCN has connections to the pineal gland, which is responsible for the regulation of melatonin, as well as with many areas that share input from the visual photoreceptor system, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectum, and superior colliculus <xref rid="pone.0016429-Lockley2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, very recent findings suggest that cone photoreceptors also contribute substantially to non-visual responses at the beginning of a light exposure and at low irradiances, whereas melanopsin may be the primary circadian photopigment in response to long-duration light exposure and at high irradiances <xref rid="pone.0016429-Gooley1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Our results on nocturnal melatonin decrease after light at 6500K thus go in line with the now established non-visual effects of light on the circadian system. However, while previous studies focused on monochromatic light exposure, we could demonstrate that even with light at 6500K from commercially available compact fluorescent lamps melatonin is suppressed by nearly 40&#x00025; in comparison to traditional light lamps (3000K). Many studies have shown that exposure to white polychromatic light during night-time increases alertness <xref rid="pone.0016429-Cajochen2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016429-Badia1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016429-Cajochen3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016429-Lavoie1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The dose-response relationship between light alerting effects and its irradiance is such that half of the maximum alerting response to bright light at 9100 lux can be obtained with room light of approximately 100 lux <xref rid="pone.0016429-Cajochen3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In contrast, our study revealed that light at 6500K from compact fluorescent lamps at low intensity (approximately 40 lux) was most effective after approximately 90 minutes of exposure. Although this luminance level is rather low to elicit such alerting effects, it is likely that the higher amount of blue component in the action spectra of light at 6500K may suffice to elicit these alerting effects. This finding adds up to the high specificity for light in the short wavelength range, and shows that the non-image forming visual system seems to crucially depend on light exposure at particular wavelengths.</p><p>Interestingly, we could demonstrate that exposure to blue-enriched light was most effective in enhancing cognitive performance for tasks of sustained attention, while no apparent benefit seemed to occur for higher executive cognitive tasks, such as the PVSAT. Light exposure impacts on cognitive performance through its synchronizing/phase-shifting effects on the circadian clock or acutely via its alerting effects, to the extent that performance in tasks such as digit recall, serial addition-subtraction and simple reaction time tasks can immediately improve after nocturnal light onset <xref rid="pone.0016429-Badia1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016429-Lockley3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016429-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016429-Foret1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Recent fMRI data supports light-induced modulations of cortical activity during auditory cognitive tasks for alertness-related subcortical structures, such as the brainstem <xref rid="pone.0016429-Vandewalle4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, the hypothalamus, in a location encompassing the SCN <xref rid="pone.0016429-Perrin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and dorsal and posterior parts of thalamus <xref rid="pone.0016429-Vandewalle2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016429-Vandewalle3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and amygdala <xref rid="pone.0016429-Vandewalle4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These responses point towards a wide-range of subcortical and cortical networks activated by non-visual effects of light during specific cognitive tasks. While cognitive tasks associated with sustained attention can improve under short-wavelength light exposure, there remains some controversy with respect to higher executive functioning. fMRI assessed brain responses undergo a wavelength-dependency for higher executive task (2-back task), such that blue light (480 nm) enhances modulations in the brainstem (in a LC-compatible location), in the thalamus and insula, in relation to green (550 nm) and violet exposures (430 nm). However, while subcortical regions are activated faster and show short-lasting responses to light, cortical activity requires stronger and longer stimulations, as indicated in a study <xref rid="pone.0016429-Vandewalle2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, in which 20 minutes of bright white light induced both thalamic and cortical modulations that steadily declined after light exposure albeit its rather lasting effects.</p><p>One critical finding in our study is that lower levels of salivary melatonin were strongly correlated with faster reaction times in tasks of sustained attention (PVT and GO/NOGO), particularly in the light at 6500 K condition. Interestingly, light at 6500K shifted the PVT distribution curve towards the faster range of RT in comparison to light at 2500K and 3000K. Thus, rather the optimal (i.e. 10&#x00025; fastest RT) than the lapse domain of the PVT, which responds earliest to elevated homeostatic sleep pressure <xref rid="pone.0016429-Doran1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> was affected by light at 6500K. Similar effects in the optimal domain of the PVT (i.e. quicker 10&#x00025; fastest RT) were reported after caffeine intake (200 mg), particularly in caffeine sensitive volunteers <xref rid="pone.0016429-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Thus, from a sustained attention perspective, blue enriched light has similar effects as caffeine such that both treatmens affect the optimal performance domain. In well-rested conditions, this optimal PVT domain has been associated with greater BOLD responses in the fronto-parietal sustained attention network <xref rid="pone.0016429-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. This, in turn, allows for the allocation of attentional resources, by reflecting a top-down modulation of attentional for sustaining focus on a task <xref rid="pone.0016429-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Light irradiance signal reaches the SCN in the hypothalamus, and then the LC in the brainstem which triggers thalamic activity and a widespread modulation over cortical activity <xref rid="pone.0016429-Vandewalle5" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Given the significant inverse correlation of PVT RT with melatonin levels during light exposure at 6500K, one might speculate that enhanced activation in the sustained attentional network may be modulated by the non-visual system via the photopigment melanopsin.</p><p>When considering the implications of blue-enriched light on non-clinical settings, it is also important to take into account how this light setting can impact on subjective well-being. In our study, exposure to blue-enriched light improved subjective well-being, which has also been described for blue-enriched daytime light exposure <xref rid="pone.0016429-Viola1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Taken together, our results imply that alertness, subjective well-being and cognitive performance can be improved by enriching the spectral composition of light sources with short wavelengths.</p><p>Light-producing devices such as compact fluorescent lamps emitting more short-wavelength energy are effective at stimulating subjective and objective correlates of alertness and performance in the evening, which is correlated with the degree of concomitant suppression of endogenous melatonin levels. Since some of the effects persisted after light exposure, it is fair to suggest that conventional visual photoreception was not the major mediator of these responses. Furthermore, these light settings may provide an effective rationale for enhancing alertness and performance, as well as in the treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as shift work disorder.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Claudia Renz, Giovanni Balestrieri, and Marie-France Dattler for their help in data acquisition, Dr. Peter Blattner for assistance in the light settings and the volunteers for participating.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This research was supported by the Schweizerisches Bundesamt f&#x000fc;r Gesundheit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/strahlung/00053/00921/00922/index.html?lang=de">http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/strahlung/00053/00921/00922/index.html?lang=de</ext-link>).
