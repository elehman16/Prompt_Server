Use of a collagen membrane has shown encouraging results in adhesion prevention in several regions of the body. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of this collagen membrane in the prevention of pericardial adhesions.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1179065217720909"><title>Materials and methods:</title><p>A total of 12 pigs were divided randomly into 2 groups: an experimental group in which collagen membranes were used and a control group. After sternotomy and an anterior pericardiectomy, the epicardial surface was exposed to room air and irrigated with saline, and an epicardial abrasion was performed using a sponge. The pericardial defect was repaired using a collagen membrane in the experimental group or left uncovered in the control group. After 8 to 12&#x02009;weeks, the pigs were killed, and a resternotomy was performed by a single-blinded surgeon enabling the evaluation of adhesions. The heart was then removed and sent for microscopic assessment conducted by a single-blinded pathologist.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1179065217720909"><title>Results:</title><p>The resternotomy operations performed using a collagen membrane demonstrated a nonstatistically significant trend of fewer macroscopic and microscopic adhesions in all regions (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.05), particularly in the retrosternal and defect regions.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1179065217720909"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study showed nonstatistically significant differences between the outcomes in the collagen membrane group and the control group in both macroscopic and microscopic adhesion prevention.

Some patients need several operations to correct the anomalies. Subsequent operations account for 32% of all congenital anomaly operations each year in Thailand as well as for 10% to 20% of cases in adult cardiac surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The most common problem occurring in a reoperation situation is adhesion resulting from the wound-healing process. These adhesions, specifically adherence between the heart, sternum, and surrounding organs, cause many problems such as decreased right ventricle contraction, reduced diastolic left ventricle filling time, increased operative time, and an increased risk of cardiac and great vessel injury during any subsequent sternotomy.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr7-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The pericardium cannot be completely closed in most cardiac operations because of pericardial contraction, the swelling of cardiac tissue, or inadequate pericardium tissue after pericardial excision for grafting. A too tight pericardial closure may result in cardiac tamponade.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> There are some studies which have shown the efficacy of the Gore-Tex polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane for the prevention of adhesions. However, a PTFE membrane may enhance the inflammatory process leading to the obscurity of the exact anatomy of the heart and hence increase the risk of iatrogenic cardiac injury. This is described in the publication by Kuschel et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> From the outcomes of this previous study, the PTFE membrane was found to have the greatest extension of fibrosis from microscopic findings and denser adhesions from macroscopic findings in all regions except that of the coronary artery. Moreover, an inappropriate size of a PTFE graft used in the case of a pediatric patient may contribute to constrictive pericarditis as the child matures.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> To date, most cardiac surgeons in Thailand do not use any patches for pericardial substitution in cases where complete pericardial closure is impossible.</p><p>CollaGUARD (Innocoll, Inc., Monksland, Athlone, County Roscommon, Ireland) is made from type I collagen fibers, a tissue commonly found in skin, tendons, bones, and vascular structures and can be absorbed within 8 to 12&#x02009;weeks. It was initially introduced as a postoperative intra-abdominal adhesion-preventive material. The biochemical advantages of collagen are that it is fully biodegradable and bioresorbable via natural pathways and plays an integral role in the repair and replacement of both soft and hard tissues by providing an extracellular scaffold, stimulating certain growth factors, and propagating tissue granulation which can stimulate the natural process of wound healing. A previous study reported that use of a collagen membrane was able to reduce postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions in laboratory animals. The data from this study were statistically significant.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr11-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Use of collagen membranes has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States and Thailand. Nevertheless, to date, there have been no published reports of the use of collagen membranes in the prevention of postoperative intrathoracic adhesions in humans. There was, however, an initial study in 2013 into using collagen membranes for preventing postoperative cardiac surgery adhesion in pediatric patients. This study reported positive outcomes regarding the reduction in adhesions and was deemed safe to use as there were no complications.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>According to the properties and the good outcomes to date of the use of collagen membranes, it may be claimed that using this technique is reasonable for use in cardiac surgery especially in the case of repeat operations. It may reduce adhesions, decrease risk of cardiac and great vessel injury, minimize operative time, and also be cost-effective. However, there have been no studies in humans yet, so this study intends to extend the knowledge surrounding the use of this potentially exciting product using a large animal model.</p><p>This study was designed to determine the effectiveness of use of the collagen membrane in the prevention of postoperative pericardial adhesions and evaluate any side effects of use of the collagen membrane in an animal model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section6-1179065217720909"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section7-1179065217720909"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a single-blinded, prospective pilot study in laboratory animals.

A prophylactic antibiotic marbofloxacin (2&#x02009;mg/kg) was given by intramuscular injection. After a routine sternotomy, a pericardiectomy was performed to create a pericardial defect. The epicardial surface was exposed to the aggravating effects of room air, warm saline irrigation, and gauze abrasion. In the control group, the pericardial defect was left open without any tissue coverage. In the collagen membrane group, the pericardial defect was covered with the collagen membrane which was sutured to the pericardial edge with 3/0 polyglactin before closure of the sternum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179065217720909">Figure 1</xref>). Then, in both groups, 2-0 polyglactin sutures were used to re-approximate the sternum.

The pigs were killed with an intramuscular xylazine (1&#x02009;mg/kg) and intravenous pentobarbital sodium (&#x0003e;80&#x02009;mg/kg) injection before the resternotomy was performed. The reason for this euthanasia before the operation was due to limited access to resources to fully anesthetize the pigs for the operation. The severity of adhesion formation was macroscopically evaluated by a single-blinded surgeon according to the grading score devised by Lopes et al<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1179065217720909">Table 1</xref>), which was found to significantly correlate with dissection time and the amount of sharp dissection required for the takedown of pericardial adhesions. The 6 regions of interest included the retrosternal region, defect region, right ventricle, aorta, right atrium, and the regions bordering the pericardial defect. Then, the hearts were removed and sent to the pathologist to enable the evaluation and recording of any microscopic findings.

One of the factors which may be responsible for these inconclusive results is the small sample size limiting the power of the data to exhibit a significant difference. Originally, it was planned to use 8 pigs in both groups, but the number was decreased to 6 in accordance with a suggestion made by the animal research committee.</p><p>Previous animal studies concerning pericardial adhesion formation prevention covered a time frame of a few weeks to months between the initial and subsequent operation. Kuschel and colleagues found a significant reduction in pericardial adhesion formation in rabbits when using TachoSil, a bioabsorbable collagen sponge coated on one side with the human coagulation factors fibrinogen and thrombin. The study by Kuschel involved a 6-month period before resternotomy.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1179065217720909" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In this study, however, an 8- to 12-week period lapse in time before performing a resternotomy to see whether there was any residual collagen membrane was aimed for and achieved. This was done to investigate the manufacturer&#x02019;s claim of full resorption within 8 to 12&#x02009;weeks. A longer duration between the first and second surgeries, which would be more comparative with the typical interval between operations in staged repairs for the correction of congenital defects, may demonstrate clearer differences in adhesion formation between the 2 groups in future trials.</p><p>There were several limitations in this study. As previously intimated, the sample size is too small to achieve a level of statistical significance. Further limitations are the short duration between the first and second operations and that all pigs had to be killed before the resternotomy because they were all much bigger than they were at the first operation and were not able to be fully anesthetized and intubated, causing difficulties in performing the resternotomy. It would have been preferable to perform the resternotomy on a beating heart as it could affect the grading score in macroscopic adhesion formation. There were no markers at the pericardial edge which meant that the surgeon could not easily identify the defect regions. This study did not include the performance of pre-resternotomy echocardiography which would show the impact of the adhesions on the hearts, cardiac function, and pericardial or pleural effusions. This should be included in future studies especially in a study involving the human model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section12-1179065217720909"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study showed nonstatistically significant differences between the collagen membrane group and the control group in both macroscopic and microscopic adhesion prevention. Due to the many limitations to study designs involving animal models due to extensive variation, further studies in human models may be needed to conclude whether the use of a collagen membrane has significant potential in the prevention of pericardial adhesions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Apichat Tantraworasin, PhD, Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, for assistance with the statistical analysis and extend particular gratitude to Joan Peagam, MSc (London) and NPQH, from Medical and Scientific English Language Consultancy, Chiang Mai University for her gracious assistance with the English editing of the final manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Peer review:</bold>Three peer reviewers contributed to the peer review report.
