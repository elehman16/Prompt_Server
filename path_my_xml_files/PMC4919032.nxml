We investigated the effects of intramyocardial injections of mouse ASC (mASC) with mouse endothelial cells (mEC) on left ventricular function and generation of pericardial fat in AMI rats. AMI rat models were created by ligating left anterior descending coronary artery and were randomly assigned into four groups: control (<italic>n</italic> = 10), mASC (<italic>n</italic> = 10), mEC (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and mASC+mEC (<italic>n</italic> = 10) via direct intramyocardial injections, and each rat received 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells around three peri-infarct areas. Echocardiography and cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) were compared at baseline and on 28 days after AMI. Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction measured by PET, increased significantly in mASC and mASC+mEC groups compared to mEC and control groups. Furthermore, significant decreases in fibrosis were confirmed after sacrifice on 28 days in mASC and mASC+mEC groups. Successful cell engraftment was confirmed by positive Y-Chromosome staining in the transplantation region. Pericardial fat increased significantly in mASC and mASC+mEC groups compared to control group, and pericardial fat was shown to originate from the AMI rat. mASC group expressed higher adiponectin and lower leptin levels in plasma than control group. In addition, pericardial fat from AMI rats demonstrated increased phospho-AMPK levels and reduced phospho-ACC levels. Intramyocardial mASC transplantation after AMI in rats increased pericardial fat, which might play a protective role in the recovery of myocardial function after ischemic myocardial damage.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&#x00026;D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare (Grant number: HI14C0209 and A120275), and by a grant of the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT &#x00026; Future Planning (No. NRF-2014R1A2A1A11051998), Republic of Korea.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ischemic cardiac diseases such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are a leading cause of death worldwide. Despite recent advances in clinical treatment for such diseases, the mortality rate associated with a failing heart remains very high. Inducing recovery of damaged myocardium has become an important therapeutic goal for treating AMI patients. Therefore, cardiac repair including regeneration of damaged left ventricular (LV) function through stem cell-based transplantation deserves much attention. Stem cell transplantation therapy has been used to treat failing hearts for more than a decade, and a large number of studies have provided profound evidence that implanted cells can participate in generation of new tissue to mechanically and biochemically support the damaged heart and thus enhance its function [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158067.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Several studies using various types of stem cells have shown promising results in halting myocardial damage and improving LV function [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158067.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among many different stem cells, regenerative abilities of adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) are thought to be a practical cell source for cell-based transplantation due to ease of isolation from patients, less invasive collection, large quantities of autologous cells, multi-potency to differentiate into multi-lineages, developmental plasticity, and avoidance of ethical issues [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated treatment of damaged myocardium with ASC in combination with other cell types in order to maximize efficacy, and implanting ASC with endothelial cells (EC) provides efficient blood supply through formation of vasculature [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Increased pericardial fat is frequently observed in coronary artery disease (CAD) or in obese patients and has been implicated as an important risk factor of coronary atherosclerosis [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158067.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Excessive increase in pericardial fat layer is known to interfere with punctual contraction and relaxation of myocardium and is associated with deposition of excess cholesterol within underlying arteries. However, pericardial fat is also considered to exert local effects as a paracrine organ by secreting various adipokines, and low adiponectin levels in plasma has been associated with progression of CAD and higher incidence of AMI [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158067.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this study, we investigated the effects of intramyocardial injections of ASC with EC and their effects on LV function after AMI in rats, in addition to the role of pericardial fat generated after ASC intramyocardial injections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animal care</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Korea University Institutional Ethics Committee for Animal Research (KUIACUC-2014-110).

Greater amounts of pericardial fat have generally been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158067.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Even so, compensatory increases in pericardial fat after intramyocardial ASC injections could play a different role, such as facilitating improvement of LV function as seen in this study. By supporting the energy needs of arterial walls and myocardium and secreting fatty acids that prevent lipotoxicity [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], pericardial fat near ischemic tissue could reduce the degree of hypertrophy of the heart and thus facilitate a protective role in ischemia. The positive effects of increased adiponectin levels have been reported as enhancement of cardiac function in anesthetized pigs [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and treatment with exogenous adiponectin which significantly reduces the infarct size in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158067.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, high expression of adiponectin in patients with cardiac disease has been shown to provide protective local actions on adjacent coronary arteries [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In this study, transplantation of mASC not only increased the delta values of plasma adiponectin concentration, but also reduced the delta concentration in plasma leptin levels compared to control group. Our observation coincides with previous reports of correlations between plasma adipokine levels and heart function. A positive correlation between increases in plasma adiponectin levels and increases in hyperemic myocardial blood flow was found in morbidly obese individuals with surgical gastric bypass-induced weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Fontes-Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] also reported that patients with normal diastolic function had significantly lower leptin plasma levels compared to patients with diastolic dysfunction. In addition, increased leptin levels could result in hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, increased incidence of AMI, aggravated atherosclerotic progression, or retarded recovery of damaged myocardium [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In terms of correlation between adipose tissue and cardiac function, Yuhki <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] indicated that adiponectin secreted from adipose tissue activated AMPK signaling pathway, which increased energy supply resulting in preventing cell death in the ischemic heart, suggesting that adiponectin is a promising new therapy for AMI. Accordingly, it was necessary to study downstream events on cardiovascular system in response to changes of adiponectin and leptin levels secreted by pericardial fat. The changes in adiponectin and leptin levels were implicated by AMPK pathway and confirmed by Western blot results for AMPK and ACC. In this study, we observed that pAMPK levels in pericardial fat tissue were significantly increased as a result of mASC and mASC+mEC transplantation, indicating positive association with higher circulating adiponectin levels. In accordance with our observation, treatment of pioglitazone on obese rats has been shown to attenuate LV hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction by activating cardiac AMPK signaling as a result of the stimulation of adiponectin secretion [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Pei <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] also reported that cardiac-derived adiponectin induced by long-term insulin treatment ameliorated myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in type 1 diabetic mice via myocardial AMPK activation. In addition, adiponectin improved cardiac function through anti-apoptotic effects caused by up-regulation of AMPK in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in mice [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A number of studies have reported that AMPK phosphorylates both ACC1/2 on serine residues, resulting in inactivation of ACC for control of lipid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158067.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similarly, we also found that phosphorylation of ACC in pericardial fat tissues significantly increased in mASC and mASC+mEC groups, demonstrating that ACC is a downstream target of AMPK [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158067.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It seems that implantation of ASC results in increased pericardial fat that secretes higher levels of adiponectin. Higher adiponectin secretion activates pAMPK in the infarcted heart, and in turn activated ACC is inactivated via phosphorylation induced by pAMPK [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Regulation of fatty acid synthesis and oxidation via AMPK results in the enhancement in heart function [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>To confirm that the engraftment was successfully introduced, the infarcted myocardium was subjected to fluorescence staining for Y-Chr. Although direct intramyocardial injection is known for its low retention rate and high death rates of transplanted cells, we detected several transplanted mASC by extensive FISH analysis within the peri-infarct areas on 28 days. Cell fusion between donor cells and transplanted cells was not observed in this study. Anti-rat specific antibody binding was detected in pericardial fat, while anti-mouse specific antibody binding was not, indicating that pericardial fat generated after cell transplantation originated from the host rat and was not proliferated tissue from the donor cells. These results suggest that injected mASC exert positive paracrine effects on the infarcted pericardium with increased production of a protective layer, ultimately resulting in improved myocardial function.</p><p>In this study, we found that mASC abundantly secreted FGF-21 whereas mEC did not secrete FGF-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158067.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). It is quite possible that mASC-secreted FGF-21 could contribute to formation of pericardial fat after mASC injection, finally resulting in the improvement of cardiac function. In accordance with these results, increased pericardial fat weight via transplantation of mASC showed a significant positive association with the improvement in cardiac function such as LVEF and LVFS measured by echocardiography at 28 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158067.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The correlation of pericardial fat with body weight, heart weight, or deposition of visceral fat was examined, but these did not significantly affect each other in this study.</p><p>In our study, although xenograft transplantation was performed by implantation of mASC into AMI rat models, we considered immunosuppression overcome by following reasons. Xenograft transplantation of MSC including ASC facilitates homing of cells to the ischemic site and induces immune tolerance to suppress rejection response to xenograft transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0158067.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158067.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, recipient immune responses after ASC and EC transplantation into AMI models of immunodeficient animals should be further investigated. In the future, additional investigation about changes in various adipokines such as resistin, visfartin, chemerin, and apelin in plasma should be helpful.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated enhanced LV function upon intramyocardial injection of mASC after AMI in rats with increased pericardial fat. Increased circulating adiponectin levels together with decreased leptin levels after intramyocardial ASC injections suggest beneficial paracrine effects of secondary increase in pericardial fat in AMI models. Increased adiponectin secretion from pericardial fat with its association with enhanced LV function could provide new clinical implications of ASC transplantation in AMI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158067.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Cardiac functional recovery by cell transplantation.</title><p>(A) Representative images of two-dimensional echocardiography obtained at 28 days after cell transplantation.
