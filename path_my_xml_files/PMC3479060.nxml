[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent studies estimate the prevalence of this condition in 2,4 per 1000 children, which means a significant number of people with this kind of disturbances 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the children with CP are classified according to their functional independence in gross motor function. Through Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) for CP 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the classification is by age (0&#x02013;2, 2&#x02013;4, 4&#x02013;6, e 6&#x02013;12 years), in five functional levels. The system goal is to classify gross motor function with emphasis on the movements of "sit" and "walk" 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Children who have motor function problems similar to those classified at level 1, can generally walk without restrictions but tend to be limited in some of the more advanced motor skills. Children classified at level 5, are usually very limited in their ability to move even with the use of assistive 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>It is known that the main alteration present in children with CP is the motor impairment, which causes several modifications rose from encephalopathy, with consequent changes in body biomechanics. In addition, the child may have intellectual disorders, sensitive, visual and hearing, which added to the motor changes, task constraints and the environment, have repercussions in different ways in their functional performance 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Besides the difficulties in locomotion previously described, as a result of the lack of motor coordination, orofacial alterations are also common in these individuals. These disorders are followed by pain, joint noise and irregular or deviated jaw function 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Individuals with spastic muscles present severely compromised function due to a diminished range of motion, diminished voluntary strength, and increased joint stiffness 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In general, important functions such as mastication, speech and swallowing are compromised, due to tongue thrusting, cheeks and lips incompetence, resulting in salivary incompetence, presence involuntary bite reflex, asymmetric positioning of the neck, making it difficult to maintain the posture of the head, as well as lack of dynamic balance of the masticatory muscles 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Some therapies may be suggested to treat muscular alteration in CP, such as electrical stimulation, LED therapy and laser therapy 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been proposed as a potentially useful modality for muscle strengthening in children with CP. The electrical neuromuscular stimulation, it is the application of electrical stimulation of sufficient intensity to produce a visible muscle contraction which is applied to the motor point of the muscle, in order to promote muscle strengthening. However, none study that analyzed and compared their effectiveness in adult patients with CP was found so far. Considering the relation between the function of masticatory muscles and the craniofacial complex, the electromyographyc analysis (EGM) is an important tool for the undestanding of muscular pattern when developmental and functional alterations are present 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Evaluating and treating patients with special needs requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this context, it is important to consider that individuals with CP are also predisposed to sleep-disordered breathing, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is one of the most common respiratory disorders. Besides, it could occur oxyhemoglobin desaturation, altered sleep-wake cycle, insomnia, disruption of sleep architecture, thus, resulting in hypoxia events during sleep. Patients with CP have a higher prevalence ranging between 50&#x02013;60% of sleep-disordered breathing, when compared to individuals without CP. Health professionals should then consider the obstruction of the upper airway during wakefulness and sleep in these patients, since in most cases, OSA is not diagnosed 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, sleep disorder leads to an impairment on mood, behavior, and neurocognitive function and, along with pre-existing problems in patients with PC, causes greater damage in their quality of life 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The measurement of sleep quality and the evaluation of sleep disorders in patients with PC are very important for the assessment of these individuals holistically, and should be added to the protocol for treating these patients. There is much to clarify about the physiology of the impact of sleep and its disorders, both in normal subjects and in patients with special needs. Forward studies are needed to search for an effective treatment protocol for improvement of quality of life of these individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>This study aims to assess the sleep variables and masticatory dynamics by means of PSG and EMG, respectively, prior and after neuromuscular electrical stimulation, associated or not with low power laser irradiation (Gallium Arsenide- Aluminun, = 780 nm) and LED (= 660 nm) in patients with cerebral palsy. It is expected that Laser e LED biostimulation will promote the morphophysiologic recovering of muscle fibers and the decreasing of inflammatory process that will be observed through the achievement of muscular physiology within normal patterns established in this study. It is hypothesized that oxyhemoglobin desaturation, caused by pauses in breathing during sleep, can lead to harmful function in neuromuscular system in individuals with CP. We also hypothesize that electrical stimulation, led therapy and laser therapy will contribute to balance the muscular function, adjusting to physiologic patterns of muscular activity, in rest and isometric positions 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The sample will be divided according the randomization rules, in 5 groups with 10 patients (G1,G2,G3,G4,G5). In the G1 will be applied the electrical stimulation, in the G2 laser therapy, in the G3 led therapy, in the G4 the association of led therapy and electrical stimulation and in the G5 the association of laser therapy and electrical stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a randomized, five arms clinical trial [Figure

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], will be used, in order to evaluate oral motor function, by performing simple movements such as coordination and performance of voluntary facial muscles, jaw protrusion and lateral movement, tongue movements, such as elevation and laterality, lip muscle strength (puff-out cheeks/maintain pressure), glossopharyngeal/hypoglossal motor activity and rapid coordinated jaw, lip, tongue and palatal movement. According to the ability of the patient to perform properly or not each movement, it will be applied the score 0 (inability to perform the movement) to 2 (ability to complete the movement). The sum of scores for each item will result in the total value of the patients oromotor function.</p></sec><sec><title>Surface electromyography</title><p>For the EMG record, it will be used an eight-channel electromyography equipment (EMG-800 C, EMG System of Brazil Ltda, Sao Jose dos Campos, SP) [Figure

The other two channels will be used for the force transducer and mandibular goniometer. Bipolar, small, passive, circular and disposable Ag/AgC surface electrodes (Meditrace&#x000ae; Kendall-LTP, Chicopee, MA) will be used for evaluation of masticatory system activity. A reference electrode will be positioned in the patients right wrist to reduce undesirable interferences of the electromyographic signal. Volunteers will remain seated, with natural head position during sEMG exam. Electromyographic signals will be recorded after cleaning the skin with 70% alcohol to reduce skin impedance and to allow proper placement of surface electrodes. Surface electrodes will be bilaterally placed according to anatomical references and procedures guided by the direction of muscle fibers in three points, the anterior temporal muscle &#x02013; 2 to 3 cm superior-posterior distant to the lateral corner of the eyes in the region of greatest evidence of muscle mass, no hair, parallel to the muscle fibers, but with its sensing surface perpendicularly oriented; the superficial portion of masseter &#x02013; 1 to 2 cm above the gonial angle of the mandible, in the region of greatest evidence of muscle mass, with muscle fibers parallel to the surface, and supra-hyoid muscles &#x02013; in the region of greatest evidence of muscle mass, parallel to the muscle fibers

In addition, polysomnography will be used to evaluate the sleep variables and to detect sleep-breathing disorders, and we believe that the sleep quality will be improved after therapies application.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All the authors contributed to the conception and design the study.
