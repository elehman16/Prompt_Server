This follows reporting of the primary outcomes of implant accuracy and gait analysis that showed significant advantages in the robotic arm-assisted group.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 139 patients were recruited from a single centre. Patients were randomised to receive either a manual UKA implanted with the aid of traditional surgical jigs, or a UKA implanted with the aid of a tactile guided robotic arm-assisted system. Outcome measures included the American Knee Society Score (AKSS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Forgotten Joint Score, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, Short Form-12, Pain Catastrophising Scale, somatic disease (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Score), Pain visual analogue scale, analgesic use, patient satisfaction, complications relating to surgery, 90-day pain diaries and the requirement for revision surgery.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1"><title>Results</title><p>From the first post-operative day through to week 8 post-operatively, the median pain scores for the robotic arm-assisted group were 55.4% lower than those observed in the manual surgery group (p = 0.040).</p><p>At three months post-operatively, the robotic arm-assisted group had better AKSS (robotic median 164, interquartile range (IQR) 131 to 178, manual median 143, IQR 132 to 166), although no difference was noted with the OKS.</p><p>At one year post-operatively, the observed differences with the AKSS had narrowed from a median of 21 points to a median of seven points (p = 0.106) (robotic median 171, IQR 153 to 179; manual median 164, IQR 144 to 182). No difference was observed with the OKS, and almost half of each group reached the ceiling limit of the score (OKS &#x0003e; 43). A greater proportion of patients receiving robotic arm-assisted surgery improved their UCLA activity score.</p><p>Binary logistic regression modelling for dichotomised outcome scores predicted the key factors associated with achieving excellent outcome on the AKSS: a pre-operative activity level &#x0003e; 5 on the UCLA activity score and use of robotic-arm surgery. For the same regression modelling, factors associated with a poor outcome were manual surgery and pre-operative depression.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Robotic arm-assisted surgery results in improved early pain scores and early function scores in some patient-reported outcomes measures, but no difference was observed at one year post-operatively. Although improved results favoured the robotic arm-assisted group in active patients (i.e. UCLA &#x02a7e; 5), these do not withstand adjustment for multiple comparisons.</p><p><bold>Cite this article</bold>: M.

Three specialist knee surgeons (MJGB, BJ, AM) with a minimum of five years independent practice as an orthopaedic surgeon performed the surgery. The clinical unit performs approximately 100 UKAs per annum.</p></sec><sec id="section14-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1"><title>Surgical technique: robotic arm-assisted UKA</title><p>A pre-operative CT scan was segmented by a trained technician to construct a 3D model of the patient's knee. This allows planning of individualised component positioning prior to surgery. The operating surgeon (MJGB, BJ, AM) defined the size and position of the femoral and tibial components in the pre-operative plan, optimising bone coverage, restoring joint anatomy and minimising bone resection. Implant alignment, therefore, was tailored to each patient. Using the pre-operative plan, the Mako system calculates the 3D volume of bone requiring resection, allowing the robotic arm to resect bone using a high speed, saline-cooled burr. Any burring outside of the predetermined zone is resisted by the robotic arm using tactile feedback and audio signals, with complete shutdown of the burr if the arm is forced outside of the zone.</p><p>The system uses optical motion capture technology (Polaris Spectra, NDI, Northern Digital Inc. Ontario, Canada) to track photoreflective marker arrays fixed to the femur and tibia through separate stab incisions. This technique allows dynamic referencing of the femur and tibia. Thus, the 3D bone resection volume moves with the limb in real time as the surgeon moves the limb. Visual feedback is given to the surgeon by the on-screen computer aided design images, and tactile feedback is provided by the robotic arm restricting the burr to stay within the resection volume.</p><p>The Restoris MCK implant consists of a cobalt chrome femoral component and a titanium tibial component with a fixed bearing polyethylene insert.</p></sec><sec id="section15-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1"><title>Surgical technique: conventional UKA</title><p>Conventional UKA operations were carried out using standard manual instrumentation and the Oxford Phase 3 UKA. Standard instrumentation involved pinning a tibial cutting guide to the tibia, providing a flat surface to guide manual resection of the bone using a handheld reciprocating saw for the vertical cut and an oscillating saw for the horizontal. This guide is aligned using visual and palpable anatomic landmarks. On the femoral side, an intramedullary rod is inserted into the distal femur to align the femoral cutting guide, again using visual landmarks. The standard instrumentation jigs and accompanying operating technique manual provide fixed target values for all patients, without the opportunity for tailoring of implant position to each patient&#x02019;s anatomy.</p><p>The Oxford UKA consists of a cobalt chrome femoral and tibial implant and a fully congruent polyethylene mobile bearing.</p></sec><sec id="section16-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Data were collected at three months and one year post-operatively.

Different soft-tissue balancing based on implant positioning affects the kinematics of the knee <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>While for standard significance levels (&#x003b1; = 0.05) the use of robotic arm-assisted surgery for UKA results in better early post-operative clinical outcomes (at three months) based on the AKSS and lower early post-operative pain scores (over the first eight weeks), these didn&#x02019;t reach significance with adjustment for multiple comparsions. By one year, the difference between the groups had narrowed, with most patients in both surgical groups reaching towards the ceiling level of the AKSS with no difference observed in the scores. The OKS was noted to have no difference with either standard or adjusted significance levels at any timepoint. Although the proportion of patients achieving a forgotten joint (FJS &#x0003e; 80%) was more than double in the robotic-arm group, this did not reach standard or adjusted statistical significance.</p><p>The currently available knee outcome measures are designed to measure differences between pre-operative and post-operative disease in TKA patients. They are inadequate for UKA patients who start with smaller burden of disease and are generally younger, fitter and healthier. In the cohort, 43% of patients had a one-year post-operative Oxford score &#x0003e; 42, which is generally acknowledged as being an excellent score. With so many patients scoring so highly, the restrictive ceiling limits of the OKS make it impossible for the score to differentiate between degrees of excellence. The FJS is a more discriminatory scoring system, but does not adequately tackle patients&#x02019; function, only awareness or feeling of the knee joint.</p><p>In the absence of outcome measures that are truly able to differentiate between good and excellent, statistical methods were sought to examine the factors that are associated with good (and poor) outcomes. Positive predictive factors (&#x003b1; = 0.05) for good early clinical outcome after UKA include the use of robotic-arm surgery (for two of three outcome measures; AKSS, FJS) and high patient pre-operative activity (all outcome measures; AKSS, OKS, FJS). Poor results were universally associated with pre-operative depression, which has been previously reported by a number of authors.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="bibr28-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>Outcome following joint arthroplasty surgery is affected by both patient and surgical factors. The analysis of the results in patients who are more active pre-operatively effectively allows us to focus on the influence of surgical factors, with a clinically important difference in outcome demonstrated in favour of robotic-arm surgery.</p><p>Although the ability to assess clinical outcomes has been limited by the available outcome measures, change in pain over time is easier to quantify and stratify reliably. The data show quite marked differences in post-operative pain from day 1 through to week 8 post-operatively. Although definitive explanations for these differences could not be provided, there are several key distinctions between the two surgical philosophies that may potentially provide an explanation. The robotic-arm system allows surgery to be tailored to the patient&#x02019;s anatomy, with more accurate reconstruction of the joint surfaces and the potential for more natural knee kinematics. Robotic arm-assisted surgery does not use a femoral intramedullary rod thereby avoiding additional surgical trauma. This benefit may be offset, however, by the additional use of bone pins, inserted into the femur and tibia during surgery, for the navigation trackers. The use of a robotic arm-mounted irrigated burr rather than a traditional high-speed saw blade may prevent excessive heat-associated bone necrosis and might facilitate more minimal bone resection, both of which may lead to less post-operative pain. Alternatively, there may be a placebo effect if patients determine that they have received robotic arm-assisted surgery. Patients were not specifically informed of what type of surgery they would receive, but it would have been possible for an inquisitive patient to discover this themselves as sham procedures (such as stab wounds on the limbs of patients receiving manual surgery to mimic the entry of bone pins) were not performed.</p><p>There are several limitations to the study. The sample size is relatively small, as the study was originally devised to determine the accuracy of the robotic-arm system. Without correction for multiple comparisons, statistically significant findings may be spurious (Type I error). Similarly, adjustment for multiple comparisons can introduce Type II errors (false negatives, where true differences are not observed due to the more stringent test to detect significant differences p &#x0003c; 0.005).</p><p>In addition, the implants differed between the two groups in the study: fixed bearing for the robotic arm-assisted group and mobile bearing for the manual surgery group. There are recognised differences in kinematics between these implant designs.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2046-3758.611.BJR-2017-0060.R1" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The pragmatic decision to use these implants was based on the lack of availability of a mobile bearing implant for use with the Mako system, and a desire to compare the robotic-arm technology with the current benchmark treatment for UKA, which, in the United Kingdom at least, is the Biomet Oxford Unicompartmental Knee System (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, Indiana). This limitation in the study design makes it impossible to determine if the differences observed are due to the differences in the implants or due to the robotic-arm surgical technique.</p><p>A third limitation is that the cohort of patients has not yet reached the relevant timepoint at which to assess the impact on implant survivorship that may develop due to the increased accuracy that robotic-arm technology affords.</p><p>Only per-protocol data were available for analysis as patients who were treated with total knee arthroplasty were not followed up. There is therefore a risk to the integrity of the randomised groups from attrition bias.</p><p>Ensuring surgical equipoise is difficult in trials which involve new technologies are compared against current standards of care. Surgical experience among the investigators favoured the traditional Oxford procedure, with all surgeons experienced in this surgical technique. Experience with the robotic arm to date, however, suggests that the technology is easily adopted and this is underlined by the improved implant accuracy shown in an earlier study. To explore further the influence of surgeon experience on the results, a much larger trial would have to be conducted incorporating an expertise-based design.</p><p>The final limitation of the study relates to the use of standard outcome measures that are ineffective at differentiating degrees of excellence in clinical outcome. The decision to use the AKSS and OKS was based on both scores being widely accepted in the orthopaedic community. Differences in outcome might yet be demonstrated by a quantitative assessment of kinematics using gait analysis.</p><p>Although improved outcomes were seen in favour of robotic arm-assisted surgery in active healthy patients (i.e. UCLA &#x0003e; 5), this outcome does not withstand more stringent multiplicity adjustments. A much larger-scale multicentre study is required to determine whether the technology is effective for patients presenting with OA of the knee who require a UKA.</p><p>Currently, the fundamental barrier to adoption of this technology, particularly in the public health sector, remains the cost of robotic-arm systems. Any future multicentre randomised trials, in addition to studying clinical effectiveness, should also include a full health economic assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the technology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Sister Pauline May, Sister Rachael Halifax, Miss Sinead O&#x02019;Donnell, Dr Arman Motesharei (Trained technician), Dr Julie Smith (Research Associate) and Miss Iona Donnelly for their support of this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author Contribution:</bold> M.
