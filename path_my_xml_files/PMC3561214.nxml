We hypothesized that butyrate, endogenously produced by intestinal microbial fermentation or applied as a nutritional supplement, might cause similar <italic>in vivo</italic> modifications in the chromatin structure of the hepatocytes, influencing the expression of certain genes and therefore modifying the activity of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An animal study was carried out in chicken as a model to investigate the molecular mechanisms of butyrate&#x02019;s epigenetic actions in the liver. Broiler chicks in the early post-hatch period were treated once daily with orally administered bolus of butyrate following overnight starvation with two different doses (0.25 or 1.25 g/kg body weight per day) for five days. After slaughtering, cell nucleus and microsomal fractions were separated by differential centrifugation from the livers. Histones were isolated from cell nuclei and acetylation of hepatic core histones was screened by western blotting. The activity of CYP2H and CYP3A37, enzymes involved in biotransformation in chicken, was detected by aminopyrine N-demethylation and aniline-hydroxylation assays from the microsomal suspensions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Orally added butyrate, applied in bolus, had a remarkable impact on nucleosome structure of hepatocytes: independently of the dose, butyrate caused hyperacetylation of histone H2A, but no changes were monitored in the acetylation state of H2B. Intensive hyperacetylation of H3 was induced by the higher administered dose, while the lower dose tended to increase acetylation ratio of H4. In spite of the observed modification in histone acetylation, no significant changes were observed in the hepatic microsomal CYP2H and CYP3A37 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Orally added butyrate in bolus could cause <italic>in vivo</italic> hyperacetylation of the hepatic core histones, providing modifications in the epigenetic regulation of cell function.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Butyrate is of special interest due to its numerous positive effects on the health of gut and extraintestinal tissues. Butyrate is the most important energy source of the colonocytes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], regulating also the proliferation and differentiation of the gastrointestinal epithelium
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and inducing apoptosis in genetically disordered cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As a consequence, butyrate has a protective effect against colorectal cancer, which was reported in some <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and also <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Due to its selective antimicrobial action on most enteral pathogens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], butyrate improves the balance of the intestinal microflora, which can influence the health of the host animal or the human host
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Fiber-rich diet or uptake of resistant starch increases microbial butyrate production, but butyrate is also orally applicable in several forms. In animal nutrition, due to its numerous beneficial properties improving health and also the growth performance of pigs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and chickens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], butyrate is of special interest as a nutritional supplement, especially after the banning of the traditional antibiotical growth promoters in the European Union
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, as an epigenetic factor, butyrate regulates the transcription via influencing core histone acetylation, which is one of the most relevant epigenetic regulations of the cell function together with DNA methylation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The dynamic balance of acetylation of histone proteins at certain lysine residues is regulated by the opposing effects of histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Butyrate inhibits Class I and most of the Class II HDAC enzymes, causing histone hyperacetylation at lysine residues of the N-terminal tail, therefore modifying the expression of certain genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition to the several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], increased total histone acetylation was reported in case of porcine caecal tissue after dietary supplementation with the butyrate precursor lactulose
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Butyrate-induced histone modifications may be highly involved in butyrate&#x02019;s antitumor, antibacterial and metabolic effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Although butyrate is greatly metabolized by the intestinal epithelium, a certain amount is also absorbed into the portal blood
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and taken up by the liver in rat and human <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Butyrate is an important energy source for the liver as a substrate of the oxidative pathways, but it is also a potent effector of the hepatic metabolism. It can decrease the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation yield and the ATP content of the liver due to its uncoupling-like effect
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and can influence the mitochondrial ATP turnover linked to glycogen metabolism
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>It is known that the expression of certain microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases, playing a predominant role in biotransformation, drug and steroid metabolism, can be affected by histone modifications
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For instance, the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A was shown to influence the <italic>in vitro</italic> expression of the CYP3A subfamily
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Alimentary added inulin, which is fermented by the colonic bacteria to SCFA, alleviates the reduction in the expression and activity of hepatic CYP1A1/2 and CYP2E1 enzymes in rats kept on a high-fat diet
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], possibly due to the epigenetic effects of the absorbed SCFA. On the basis of these findings, the enteral microbiome-produced or the orally added butyrate may also alter the activity of CYP enzymes, have an impact on hepatic detoxification capacity and drug metabolism, defined as possible pharmacoepigenetic influences.</p><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the epigenetic effects of butyrate added orally to broiler chickens in a daily bolus. These animals have a large capacity of growing and intensive hepatic metabolism. Young chickens have quite low rates of butyrate production in the large intestine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], so they can be proper candidates in order to study the effects of the orally applied butyrate. Unlike in our previous study with butyrate evenly mixed in the feedstuff of the chicken, butyrate administered in bolus after starvation provides a fast, but short-term release of greater amount of butyrate to the portal vein and an intensive stimulus for the liver. The lower dose of butyrate, 0.25 g/kg body weight (BW) was chosen regarding the usual applied concentration of butyrate as a nutritional supplement. With the higher administered concentration, 1.25 g/kg BW we aimed to provide high amount of butyrate for the hepatocytes to study also the dose-dependency of its action.</p><p>After butyrate treatments, at first we wanted to monitor the modifications in the acetylation state of hepatic core histones at the most frequent acetylation sites. Our second goal was to measure the activity of CYP2H and CYP3A37 enzymes to screen, whether butyrate in bolus can influence the detoxification capacity of the liver.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany) except when otherwise specified.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals</title><p>One-day-old broiler chicks of the Ross 308 strain (mixed gender) were obtained from a commercial hatchery (B&#x000e1;bolna Tetra Company, Urai&#x000fa;jfalu, Hungary).

The butyrate boli did not cause any macroscopic pathomorphological alterations in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, which may have been caused by higher osmolarity of the applied solutions. In addition, (iv) six broilers were treated on days 20&#x02013;24 by intracoelomal phenobarbital (PB) injection (Phenobarbital sodium, Ph. Eur. 7.1, dissolved in sterile, pyrogen-free and endotoxin-free physiological saline solution, applied dose: 80 mg/kg BW daily) to induce CYP activity as a positive control.

All animals were starved for additional 2 h after each treatment in order to enhance the absorption of butyrate. Daily body weight gain and feed intake matched the requirements of the Ross technology and no significant difference could be observed between the groups. However, the applied butyrate provided some extra energy for the treated animals (calculated mean metabolizable energy content of the boli was 2.8 kJ/animal daily at the lower and 13.9 kJ/animal daily at the higher dose), it appeared not to be relevant compared to the energy content of the diet (calculated mean metabolizable energy provided by the diet taken up was 1190 kJ/animal daily).</p></sec><sec><title>Liver sampling and separation of subcellular organelles</title><p>Animals were slaughtered in carbon dioxide anaesthesia by decapitation on day 24.

Histones were separated by SDS-PAGE on polyacrylamide (4-20%) precast gradient gels (Biorad Laboratories, CA, USA), the amount of loaded protein was 3 &#x003bc;g per lane for the detection of histones H2A and H3, while 6 &#x003bc;g per lane for histones H2B and H4. After tank blotting of proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 &#x003bc;m pore size, Biorad Laboratories, CA, USA), histones were identified by immunodetection using antibodies of the Acetyl Histone Antibody Sampler Kit: after blocking with 5% fat-free milk-containing PBST for 2 h, the immunoblots were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against histone H2A (1:1000), H2B (1:500), H3 (1:1000), H4 (1:500) and their acetylated forms. Each acetyl histone antibody was specific for the target histone modified at the lysine residue of the most frequent acetylation site (H2A and H2B: Lys 5, H3: Lys 9, H4: Lys 8). Detection of the primary antibody was performed using an anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) coupled with horseradish peroxidase. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBST, containing 5% BSA, while secondary antibodies in PBST, containing 5% fat-free milk.

Acetylation of H2A is of special importance since its acetylation state is highly involved in conformational changes of the nucleosome and decreased histone-DNA interactions, working synergistically with acetylation of the N-terminal histone tails
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, butyrate bolus did not influence the acetylation of histone H2B at lysine 5 with the lower (P=0.274) nor the higher dose of butyrate (P=0.714) (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). There are still some other lysine residues in H2B, which may be potential targets of HDAC inhibitors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and possible effects of butyrate on these other acetylation sites cannot be excluded.</p><p>There was no significant difference in the acetylation ratio of total histone H3 at lysine 9 after the application of butyrate in the lower dose (P=0.146). However, higher dose of butyrate caused relevant, approximately 18-fold increased H3 acetylation ratio (P=0.009) (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Hyperacetylation of H3 after butyrate exposure was reported by several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in a variety of cultured mammalian cells, but not yet described <italic>in vivo</italic>. It was found already in 1973 that butyrate in millimolar concentrations caused hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 in all examined vertebrate cell lines, while H2A and H2B were also affected in certain rat-derived cell cultures
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Butyrate-induced dynamic histone acetylation was compared between mammalian and avian cells <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], where huge amount of highly acetylated H3 isoforms was found after butyrate treatment in human breast cancer cells, in contrast of terminally differentiated avian immature erythrocytes, 2% of which participated in the acetylation process. Among the many acetylation sites, in agreement with our results, it was recently described that butyrate induced H3 hyperacetylation first of all at lysine 9, an acetylation site that plays a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of cell function
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Since this acetylation site is linked to histone phosphorylation and methylation processes, these site-specific modifications together can cause distinct chromatin alterations and cell cycle modifications
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The H3 isoforms H3.1 and H3.2 could be also separated on the immunoblots and it was found that butyrate increased the relative protein expression level of the H3.1 isoform, which was poorly expressed in control animals, but was detected in high amount in both butyrate-treated groups. The difference in the relative protein expression level of H3.1 between the control and butyrate-treated groups was considered to be significant after the application of the lower dose (P=0.021) and a near-significant trend following treatment with the higher dose (P=0.090) of butyrate. It is known that three H3 variants (H3.1, H3.2, H3.3) do exist in mammals, specifically, H3.1 is involved in both chromatin activation and repression, while H3.2 plays an important role in gene repression and H3.3 is especially enriched in active marks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Unlike in the case of mammals, only H3.1 and H3.2 could be separated from chicken cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Due to the pleiotropic effect of H3.1 on transcription, increased protein expression level of H3.1 after butyrate treatment, detected in our present study, may be also of special importance.</p><p>Regarding the acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 8, butyrate tended to induce hyperacetylation at the lower administered dose (P=0.063) (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Similarly to H3, H4 is also a highly involved target of butyrate-induced hyperacetylation in cell cultures
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is known that acetylation and deacetylation of H4 is a well-coordinated process, and butyrate-induced tetra- and tri-acetylated forms of H4 are always acetylated at lysine 8
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore, the lysine residue examined in this study is considered as one of the most important acetylation sites of H4. It was recently also stated that H3 at lysine 9 and H4 at lysine 8 are critical targets of butyrate-induced histone hyperacetylation, which process is associated with the G-protein-coupled receptor-41, also activated by butyrate
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Interestingly, the acetylation ratio of H4 after force-feeding with the higher dose of butyrate was not increased significantly compared to the control group (P=0.210) (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Butyrate can also alter the activity of HAT enzymes, and this contradictory finding may be in association with the pleiotropic effects of butyrate on HAT and HDAC
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], depending also on the dose of butyrate.</p><p>Very little data can be found in literature regarding the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of butyrate on the chromatin structure. In a recent study, significant increase in total histone acetylation was reported in the caecal tissue of pigs after receiving orally administered lactulose, which was intensively fermented to butyrate in the large bowel
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>It is also interesting to compare the present results after butyrate application in bolus with our recent experiment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], where butyrate was applied as a nutritional supplement for broiler chickens for three weeks at the concentration of 1.5 g/kg diet. Dosage of butyrate as a supplement was approximately equivalent with the lower dose bolus (0.25 g/kg BW) in the present study. The most important difference between the treatments is that the administration of butyrate in bolus after overnight starvation provides a short-term supply of greater amount of butyrate for the hepatocytes. In the earlier experiment animals could take up butyrate-supplemented diet the whole day, but this uptake might be followed by a prolonged absorption and a long-acting butyrate exposure of the liver.</p><p>In both experiments, hyperacetylation of H2A at lysine 5 was found and no dose-dependency could be detected after bolus treatment. In spite of these results, it can be stated that butyrate did not affect the acetylation state of histone H2B at lysine 5 after butyrate administration in bolus, nor in the nutritional supplement study. Similarly to our earlier experiment, where butyrate was applied as a nutritional supplement, the lower dose of butyrate bolus did not cause any changes in the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine, but the higher dose induced a highly relevant hyperacetylation of H3 at lysine 9. Due to the key-role of H3 modifications in gene expression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], this action seems to be a very important change in the epigenetic regulation of transcription. Lower dose of butyrate tended to increase acetylation of H4 at lysine 8, differing from the nutritional supplement experiment, underlining the critical role of the application.</p><p>We can summarize that orally applied butyrate in bolus influenced hepatic histone acetylation <italic>in vivo</italic>, core histones H2A, H3 and H4 were involved in this partly dose-dependent action. Since butyrate modified the chromatin structure, it can be considered as an important epigenetic effector on gene expression of hepatocytes. Therefore, hepatic CYP activity was measured as key surrogate to assess changes in gene expression and subsequently, function.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity of hepatic microsomal CYP enzymes</title><p>We hypothesized that butyrate-induced histone modifications might cause changes in hepatic CYP activity; because it was reported that histone acetylation had a huge impact on gene expression of several members of the CYP2 family
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It is also known that alterations in histone H3 acetylation are involved in the expression of CYP3A subfamily in the adult mouse
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, in our experiment, butyrate-induced epigenetic changes of chromatin structure did not result in changes of enzyme activity.</p><p>Screening the aminopyrine N-demethylation activity of hepatic microsomal fractions, catalyzed by CYP2H and CYP3A37 enzymes, no significant difference was found between the mean enzyme activity (reaction velocity) of the butyrate-treated animals and those of controls (lower dose: P=0.196, higher dose: P=0.523) (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Similarly, administration of butyrate bolus caused no significant differences in the V<sub>max</sub> values, independently of the applied dose (lower dose: P=0.368, higher dose: P=0.911). The lower concentration of butyrate did not affect the K<sub>M</sub> value (P=0.713), but the higher dose tended to decrease it (P=0.095), however, due to high standard error of mean it can be considered only as a near-significant trend (Table

It is also not clear, whether under special dietary conditions or simultaneously applied with other agents, such as xenobiotics, butyrate may modify the liver enzymes of biotransformation. For example, dietary supplementation of inulin, a precursor of colonic butyrate production, in rats, suffering from high-fat-diet-induced hyperlipidaemia and hepatic steatosis, counteracted the decrease in the expression and activity of hepatic CYP1A1/2 and CYP2E1 enzymes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study indicated that (1) orally applied butyrate in bolus had an impact on chromatin structure of hepatocytes in chicken in the early post-hatch period: independently of the dose, butyrate caused hyperacetylation of histone H2A, but no changes were observed in the acetylation state of H2B. The higher administered dose (1.25 g/kg BW) induced an intensive hyperacetylation of H3, while the application of the lower dose (0.25 g/kg BW) tended to increase acetylation ratio of H4. In addition, both treatments with butyrate bolus increased the expression of the H3.1 isoform. (2) These changes in the epigenetic regulation of cell function did not result in alteration of drug-metabolizing hepatic CYP2H and CYP3A37 enzyme activity, so there might be no relevant pharmacoepigenetic influences of orally applicated butyrate under physiological conditions.</p><p>Results of this and former studies indicate that growing chicken are a suitable model to evaluate the epigenetic effects of orally applied butyrate both by diet and by intra-crop application. Due to low endogenous butyrate production the histone acetylation is most likely derived from exogenous butyrate directly. Although this is a strictly descriptive study, this chicken model provides a high potential to identify butyrate-induced epigenetic mechanisms and their consequences in metabolic regulation in future.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AME: Apparent metabolizable energy; ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; BSA: Bovine serum albumin; BW: Body weight; CYP: Cytochrome P450; EDTA: Ethylene diamino tetraacetic acid; HAT: Histone acetyltranferase; HDAC: Histone deacetylase; K<sub>M</sub>: Michaelis-Menten&#x02019;s constant; NADPH+H<sup>+</sup>: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form); PAGE: Polyacrilamide gelelectrophoresis; PB: Phenobarbital; PBST: Phosphate buffered saline supplemented with Tween; SCFA: Short chain fatty acids; SDS: Sodium dodecylsulphate; V<sub>max</sub>: Maximal reaction velocity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>GM designed and carried out animal treatments and sampling, prepared the cell nucleus and microsomal fractions, conducted western blot examinations and enzyme assays and drafted the manuscript.
