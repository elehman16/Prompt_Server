All received heparin for a median period of 2 days (range 10 h to 12 days); the dose was adjusted to maintain aPTT at 2-3 times of normal levels. Duration of anticoagulation before IST was individualized on the basis of clinical status or symptomatic improvement/deterioration after anticoagulation.

Further 13 patients were those who did not respond and/or worsen neurologically despite optimal heparin therapy. The procedure was abandoned in one patient as the catheter could not be passed through the thrombus due to chronicity (duration of the disease was 45 days). Fifteen patients received alteplase [tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)] and eight received urokinase. The maximum dose of tPA was 82 mg (range 20-82 mg) and that of urokinase was 72 million IU (range 8-72 million IU).

Five of 23 patients had bleeding complications, among whom four had received tPA and one was on urokinase. Two among these five patients had multiple intracranial bleeds while on tPA intrasinus infusion. However, they recovered following the stopping of the infusion and were discharged after 1 week in stable condition. Of the four deaths, two were due to transtentorial herniation due to expanding venous infarcts and the other two were due to sepsis.

Moreover, both tPA and urokinase were used as thrombolytic agents in different subjects, providing an opportunity to have experience with both. In our study, 17 of 23 patients (73.9%) had mRS &#x02264;2 at 6 months follow-up&#x02014;at par with the previous series,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but at the time of discharge, only 10 patients (43.5%) had good improvement with mRS &#x0003c;2. This is probably because of the large proportion of patients with a moderate to large hemorrhagic component (<italic>n</italic> = 14) among those with venous infarcts (<italic>n</italic> = 16), and many patients with deep venous system involvement (<italic>n</italic> = 10), which is very high when compared to the previous series.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Despite this huge proportion of hemorrhagic infarcts, none of our patients developed iatrogenic expansion of the hematoma with the IST. Five patients developed bleeding manifestations as a complication of therapy, two of whom bled intracranially. Others also showed similar rates of hemorrhage.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Both bleeds occurred in those patients treated with intrasinus tPA having complete or near complete recanalization of the involved sinuses. In our series, intracranial bleeding did not occur with urokinase infusion, suggesting less bleeding complications with the use of urokinase while similar efficacy is maintained to tPA&#x02014;time to restore patency of sinuses with usage of urokinase (average = 40 h) was more or less equal to that of tPA (average = 35 h). Bleeding had been more with tPA probably because of its higher potency, despite clot specificity. Two of the four deaths in this study were due to transtentorial herniation, the other two were related to sepsis. There were two deaths reported in one series and one in another series from iatrogenic ICH,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in contrast to no deaths in our study.</p><p>Recanalization was documented in all of our patients receiving IST, while others showed a recanalization rate of 63-75%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] There is no correlation between extent of recanalization and clinical outcome, i.e., partial or functional recanalization scores higher over complete recanalization of sinuses for CVST, lessening the thrombolytic dosage and bleeding complications. Death and disability appear to be primarily related to the extent and swiftness of onset of the sinus thrombosis and venous infarctions. Six of nine patients with venous infarcts and mass effect who did not undergo decompressive craniectomy had prolonged hospital stay with increased morbidity and mortality. Three of these nine patients underwent both IST and decompression, and made a faster recovery. IST and decompressive craniectomy were complementary in these patients.</p><p>However, in the absence of randomized controlled trials, the exact role of IST in the management of cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis is unclear, especially with regard to patient selection and optimal time to intervene. There are no established criteria in the literature regarding indications for thrombolysis in CVST. The criteria for IST in this study were rapid worsening of symptoms or lack of response to systemic anticoagulation. Early therapeutic intervention may lead to successful recanalization of the involved sinuses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>CVST can be fatal or disabling if untreated, and even with systemic anticoagulation the condition may progress. Heparin remains the first-line treatment because of its efficacy, safety, and feasibility. The adjunction of local thrombolysis is indicated in the rare cases where rapid deterioration occurs despite adequate anticoagulation. Urokinase may be a safe and preferred thrombolytic agent. Functional rather than complete recanalization is adequate for achieving good results. The uncertain natural history, multiplicity of causes, and variable severity of clinical presentation result in current management being &#x0201c;case by case.&#x0201d;</p><p>Conclusions about optimal treatment in CVST patients cannot be drawn based on our study alone as it was not randomized, had a small sample size, no head-to-head comparisons were made between subgroups receiving tPA and urokinase, and there was no set control group treated with heparin alone. Nevertheless, our study highlights potential role of IST in a subset of CVST patients.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bousser</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferro</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cerebral venous thrombosis: An update</article-title><source>Lancet Neurol</source><year>2007</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>162</fpage><lpage>70</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17239803</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Canhao</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferro</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindgren</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name><name><surname>Bousser</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Stam</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Barinagarrementeria</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><collab>ISCVT Investigators</collab><article-title>Causes and predictors of death in cerebral venous thrombosis</article-title><source>Stroke</source><year>2005</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>1720</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16002765</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Bruijn</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name><name><surname>de Haan</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Stam</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical features and prognostic factors of cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis in a prospective series of 59 patients.
