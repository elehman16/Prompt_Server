Large cohort studies have shown late cancellation rates of between 5% and 18% for inpatient and/or ambulatory surgery [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Cancellations may be due to patient-related factors (e.g. unilateral decisions to postpone or suspend surgery, non-attendance, forgetfulness, intercurrent illness, or poor adherence to medical instructions), unavailability of preoperative tests, or logistic issues (scheduling errors, lack of specific equipment, information breakdown, etc.). Patient-related factors are reported to be the most common reasons for cancellation [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Late cancellations are particularly problematic in ambulatory surgery units (ASUs) [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Indeed, their organization is based on the stepwise &#x0201c;clinical pathway&#x0201d; concept, from the first consultation with the surgeon to a home call the day after surgery. Thus, reducing the rate of late cancellations is a major challenge for ASUs [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>We postulated that a standardized pre-operative telephone checklist administered to each patient by an automated phone system a few days before surgery could help to reduce the number of late cancellations in multidisciplinary ASUs located in Paris hospitals. Such a checklist would need to be sufficiently broad to cover all surgical settings (adult and pediatric patients, small and large ASUs, all surgical specialties). It should also be computerized, inexpensive, and require little ASU staff intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Study design</title><p>We developed a pre-operative telephone checklist and tested it in 11 multidisciplinary ASUs, in a two-arm, parallel-group, multicenter randomized controlled trial (AMBUPROG).

Nine ASUs managed both adults and teenagers (Port-Royal, Saint-Antoine, Jean Verdier, Tenon, Georges Pompidou, Ambroise Par&#x000e9;, Bic&#x000ea;tre, Bichat, and Avicenne), whereas two were exclusively pediatric (Trousseau and Robert Debr&#x000e9;).</p><p>Eight of the ASUs were autonomous, with their own patient pathway, while three were embedded within conventional surgical departments. Five ASUs operated on fewer than 50 patients per week (Port-Royal, Jean Verdier, Tenon, Ambroise Par&#x000e9;, Trousseau).</p><p>To avoid overrepresentation of patients from the largest ASUs (Saint Antoine and Georges Pompidou), recruitment by these two ASUs was randomly restricted to every second week from May 2013 to September 2013.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were eligible if they were scheduled for ambulatory surgery under general anesthesia, locoregional anesthesia and/or sedation within the next 30 to 7 days and could be reached by telephone. Patients were not eligible if they were undergoing emergency ambulatory surgery, local anesthesia (whatever the indication), non-surgical gastrointestinal endoscopy, or termination of pregnancy. Verbal consent was obtained from the informed patients or from their parents/guardians in case of children. They could withdraw the study, at any moment, by calling a toll free number available 24/24 hours 7/7.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="sec022"><title>Development of the intervention</title><p>The aim was to develop a simple, inexpensive intervention to avoid late cancellations of ambulatory surgery in ASUs with broad patient recruitment and a wide variety of surgical specialties.</p><p>Given the reported effectiveness of checklists in reducing surgical complications and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we developed a standardized pre-operative checklist that could be delivered to each patient via an automated phone system.</p><p>The checklist was developed in 4 phases. First, each ASU made a list of their main causes of patient-related late cancellation. Then, a series of meetings was organized to discuss these causes and to agree on the items to be included on a preliminary checklist, along with corrective actions. Each item was to concern a specific problem and solution, without generating additional work for the ASU staff. Regarding the need for an overnight fast, for example, the patient would be asked if he or she had any questions about this instruction and, if so, would be asked to contact the ASU as quickly as possible. Two versions were developed, one for adults and one for pediatric patients.</p><p>The checklist was pilot-tested on twelve caregivers who had not directly been involved in its drafting, and on twelve volunteer patients. It was then modified according to their comments and suggestions.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Contents of the checklist</title><p>The checklist consisted of 7 items and their corrective actions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0147194.t001">Table 1</xref>), and was made available in five languages (French, English, Portuguese, Chinese and Arabic) and two versions (pediatric and adult).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0147194.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0147194.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>The AMBUPROG checklist.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0147194.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0147194.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Items</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Checklist<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn001"><sup>a</sup></xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Corrective action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>1</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002"><sup>b</sup></xref>: You are scheduled for ambulatory surgery in the next few days.

Use of the checklist did not reduce the rate of late cancellations but allowed us to identify several key factors that could lead to late cancellation. In particular, 28% of patients had not had the tests requested by the surgeon or anesthetist; 20% said they did not fully understand the instructions regarding the need to have an "empty stomach", and 17% had not completed the necessary pre-admission administrative formalities. However, identification of these issues through the checklist between day 7 and day 3 before the scheduled date of surgery had no impact on the rate of late cancellation by comparison with standard management. This suggests that standard management already in place in the ASUs (in particular, a standard phone call to the patient the day before surgery) was able to address these issues. Another explanation could be that other reasons for late cancellation were not addressed by our generic checklist. Indeed, patient-specific reasons could have contributed to the rate of late cancellation in both groups. Our study was not tailored to identify patient-specific reasons for late cancellation and further studies are therefore needed to address these issues.</p><p>This study has several strengths. First, the randomized controlled trial design and the small proportion of missing data minimizes the selection bias. Second, the study was particularly large, with more than 4000 patients recruited in eleven multidisciplinary ASUs that were representative in terms of their volume of activity, patient recruitment and surgical specialties. Third, the intervention (checklist) was developed through multidisciplinary collaboration among surgeons, anesthetists and nurses working in 12 different surgical specialties. Finally, the checklist was tailored to the patients&#x02019; characteristics (adults, children) and geographic origin (5 different languages).</p><p>Several studies of interventions designed to reduce late cancellations have been already published [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Three of them concerned ambulatory surgery [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The interventions consisted of pre-operative medical assessment [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], telephone interviews [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], nurse-led pre-assessment [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], SMS text messaging [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or telephone calls [<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147194.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Pre-operative patient assessment a few days or weeks before the scheduled date of surgery appeared to reduce the risk of cancellation. However, none of these studies was randomized, and the results might therefore have been subject to a selection bias.</p><p>The lack of impact of our checklist is puzzling. It is conceivable that the checklist was not sufficiently tailored to the specific causes of late cancelation in the 11 ASUs, or to the patient population. Indeed, to allow its general use, the checklist was very broad and generic. Furthermore, it was based on patient self-management in order to avoid excess costs and an extra workload for the ASU staff. A checklist customized to individual patients and their surgical indications might be more effective. Second, uptake of the checklist was poor, possibly because some patients were put off by the automated phone system. Indeed, the checklist had to be delivered by a research assistant to nearly one-quarter of patients. It also proved difficult to reach the patients by telephone. Thus, among the 1950 patients allocated to the checklist arm, more than one-third did not complete the checklist (n = 608), mainly because they could not be contacted (n = 425). Finally, the impact of the checklist might have been limited by the pre-existing procedure used in most of the ASUs, based on a routine phone reminder the day before surgery.</p><p>Our study also has some limitations. A total of 174 patients were erroneously included (91 patients in the checklist arm, 83 patients in control arm). However, a sensitivity analysis including these patients yielded the same results. Also, more than one-third of patients did not receive the intervention, although this is likely representative of our clinical practice.</p><p>In conclusion, the AMBUPROG pre-surgical checklist delivered by an automated phone system did not reduce the rate of late cancellation of ambulatory surgery. This study is none the less encouraging, not least because it demonstrates the feasibility of a large-scale randomized controlled trial of this type in 11 ASUs with very different working practices. Further studies are needed to assess more personalized pre-surgical checklists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec036"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147194.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147194.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147194.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Original study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147194.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147194.s003"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Supplementary data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147194.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147194.s004"><label>S3 Protocol</label><caption><title>Supplementary data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147194.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147194.s005"><label>S4 Protocol</label><caption><title>Supplementary data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147194.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147194.s006"><label>S5 Protocol</label><caption><title>Supplementary data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147194.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147194.s007"><label>S6 Protocol</label><caption><title>Supplementary data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147194.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147194.s008"><label>S7 Protocol</label><caption><title>Supplementary data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147194.s008.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147194.s009"><label>S8 Protocol</label><caption><title>Supplementary data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0147194.s009.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank:
