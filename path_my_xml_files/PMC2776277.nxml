Labor that occurs before 37 weeks of gestation (the period during which a baby develops in its mother) is defined as a preterm birth. In industrialized countries, 5&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; of all births are preterm. Figures for preterm births are harder to obtain for low-income countries because of uncertainties about gestational dates but, in both rich and poor countries, preterm birth is a major cause of infant death and illness around the time of birth. Babies who are born prematurely also often have long-term health problems and disabilities. There are many reasons why some babies are born prematurely. Structural problems such as a weak cervix (the neck of the womb, which dilates during labor to allow the baby to leave the mother's body) can result in a premature delivery, as can pregnancy-induced diabetes, blood-clotting disorders, bacterial infections in the vagina or the womb, and malaria. However, it is impossible to predict which mothers will spontaneously deliver early.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>At present there is no effective way to prevent premature births. Because infection is often associated with preterm labor and can occur early in pregnancy but remain undetected, one way to reduce the incidence of preterm births may be to give pregnant women antibiotics even when they have no obvious infection (prophylactic antibiotics). In this study, the researchers test this hypothesis by giving the antibiotic azithromycin to pregnant women living in Southern Malawi in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. One baby in five is born before 37 weeks gestation in Southern Malawi and the women living in this part of sub-Saharan Africa have a high burden of infection. Azithromycin is a safe antibiotic that can treat many of the bacterial infections that have been implicated in preterm birth. It also has some antimalarial activity. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, participants are randomly assigned to receive a drug or identical-looking &#x0201c;dummy&#x0201d; tablets (placebo).</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers enrolled more than 2,000 pregnant women into the APPLe study (Azithromycin for the Prevention of Preterm Labor) and determined the gestational age of their unborn babies using ultrasound. Half of the women were given an oral dose of azithromycin at 16&#x02013;24 weeks and at 28&#x02013;32 weeks gestation. The remaining women were given a placebo at similar times. The mothers and their babies were followed up until 6 weeks after delivery. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of the study&#x02014;the incidence of delivery before 37 weeks gestation&#x02014;between the two groups of women. Secondary outcomes&#x02014;including mean gestational age at delivery, mean birth weight, and still births and infant deaths within a week of birth&#x02014;were also similar in the two groups of women. Finally, the researchers did a meta-analysis (a statistical technique that combines the results of several studies) of their study and seven published studies of routine antibiotic prophylaxis in pregnancy, which indicated that the prophylactic use of antibiotics did not alter the risk of preterm birth.</p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings provide no support for the use of antibiotics as prophylaxis to prevent preterm birth. The women included in this study had an unusually high incidence of preterm delivery and a high burden of infection so these findings may not be generalizable. The results of the meta-analysis, however, also provide no support for prophylactic antibiotics. Given that observational data have associated infection with preterm labor, why are the results of the APPLe trial and the meta-analysis negative? One possibility is that different antibiotics or dosing regimens might be more effective. Another possibility is that infection might be a secondary consequence of some other condition that causes preterm birth rather than the primary cause of early delivery. Whatever the reason for the lack of effect of prophylactic antibiotics, the researchers recommend that pregnant women should not be given antibiotics prophylactically to prevent preterm birth particularly since, in a recent study, the babies of women given antibiotics to halt ongoing preterm labor had an increased risk of developmental problems.</p></sec><sec id="s1a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000191">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000191</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The March of Dimes, a nonprofit organization for pregnancy and baby health, provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marchofdimes.com/professionals/14332_1157.asp">preterm birth</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Nemours Foundation, another nonprofit organization for child health, also provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/growth/growing/preemies.html">premature babies</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tommy's is a nonprofit organization that funds research and provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tommys.org">the causes and prevention of miscarriage, premature birth, and stillbirth</ext-link>

Estimates in low-income countries are difficult because of common uncertainties about gestational age. However, we have previously reported much higher rates of 24&#x00025; (95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI] 21&#x00025;&#x02013;28&#x00025;) and 20&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI 17&#x00025;&#x02013;24&#x00025;) in rural, community-based, ultrasound-dated studies in Malawi of, respectively, anaemic <xref rid="pmed.1000191-vandenBroek1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and unselected <xref rid="pmed.1000191-vandenBroek2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> pregnant women.

There is considerable evidence to suggest that intrauterine infection may occur quite early in pregnancy but remain undetected for months <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Goldenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For example, women with high levels of C-reactive protein in early pregnancy have a much higher risk of spontaneous preterm birth (odds ratio [OR] 4.64, 95&#x00025; CI 0.94&#x02013;22.96) <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Pitiphat1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thus, antibiotic prophylaxis to treat clinically unsuspected infection during pregnancy could, potentially, avoid later preterm births.</p><p>Our studied pregnant populations in Malawi carry high burdens of infective morbidity, including HIV (seropositivity 30&#x00025;) <xref rid="pmed.1000191-vandenBroek3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, malaria (33&#x00025;) <xref rid="pmed.1000191-vandenBroek1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, syphilis (10&#x00025; positive <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> haemagglutination [TPHA]), and other sexually transmitted infections, e.g., trichomoniasis 26&#x00025;, candidiasis 37&#x00025; (unpublished data).

</p><p>We hypothesised that routine antibiotic prophylaxis would decrease the incidence of preterm labour and birth, and conducted a placebo-controlled randomised trial of single-dose azithromycin 1 g orally at two time windows of pregnancy: 16&#x02013;24 and 28&#x02013;32 wk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000191.s002">Text S2</xref>). Azithromycin was chosen because of its broad spectrum of antibacterial activity including effectiveness against <italic>Ureaplasma urealyticum</italic> (implicated as an important cause of preterm labour), its efficacy against sexually transmitted infections including syphilis and chlamydia, its antimalarial effects (malaria is also a cause of prematurity), its safety profile in pregnancy <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Sarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and the convenience of a single oral dose with few side-effects. A recently reported randomized trial showed that prophylactic azithromycin reduces the risk of miscarriage after amniocentesis <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Giorlandino1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>We also hypothesised that routine azithromycin would decrease the incidence of malarial parasitaemia, because of its antimalarial properties <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Chico1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000191-Kalilani1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and anaemia, because of the association of anaemia with chronic inflammation in this population <xref rid="pmed.1000191-vandenBroek5" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>At the time of planning our study, a Cochrane systematic review had been published on routine antibiotic administration to pregnant women; of six randomized trials, four reported preterm delivery rates (1,310 women) <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Thinkhamrop1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Pooled results from these diverse populations did not show a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of preterm delivery with prophylactic antibiotics (relative risk 0.88, 95&#x00025; CI 0.71&#x02013;1.08). but the wide CIs were compatible with a clinically important reduction in preterm birth.</p><p>Our aims were 2-fold. First, to investigate whether antibiotic prophylaxis would be of future practical benefit in the studied population in Malawi. Second, to test the intervention in the population with the highest reported incidence of preterm birth&#x02014;as this could have generalizable importance to other high risk populations.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants and Setting</title><p>Women were recruited from three rural and one peri-urban antenatal clinic in Southern Malawi. Eligibility criteria were: gestational age less than 24 wk as determined by ultrasound (biparietal diameter measurement), intention to remain in the study area for the duration of the pregnancy, and signed informed consent. Biparietal diameter measurement <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Chitty1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> was performed by specially trained midwives and used to calculate gestational age (Concept 200l Dynamic Imaging). All women with confirmed gestational age &#x0003c;24 completed wk at this first visit were invited to participate in the trial.</p><p>Recruited women were randomly allocated to either 1 g azithromycin or placebo given at both 16&#x02013;24 and 28&#x02013;32 wk gestational windows. Antenatal care was provided to all women according to the usual schedule (planned 4-weekly visits until 32 wk; 2-weekly thereafter). At the booking visit, all women were screened for malaria (thick film), anaemia (Hb &#x0003c;11 g/dl by battery operated HemoCue device), and syphilis (VDRL). Haemoglobin and syphilis results were available on the same day; those found positive for syphilis were treated on the same day with intramuscular benzyl penicillin (1 g). All women received iron tablets daily (60 mg elemental iron as ferrous sulphate) with 0.25 mg folic acid, and antimalarial prophylaxis (two doses of Fansidar: 500 mg sulphadoxine with 25 mg pyrimethamine). All azithromycin (or placebo) and Fansidar tablets were taken under supervision at the clinic. Women who failed to attend for their 28&#x02013;32 week visit were followed up, where possible, in the community.</p><p>Women were asked to report when they had delivered and to return for routine visits at 1 and 6 wk postnatally; women who withdrew from the study were followed up in an effort to obtain their delivery date and the survival status of the woman and her neonate.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>At booking and throughout antenatal care all women were encouraged to consider voluntary counselling and testing for HIV status, which was available in the clinic, as were antiretroviral drugs to prevent maternal to child transmission. We did not seek to collect prospective data about the HIV status of women. Our objective was to determine whether routine prophylactic treatment with an antibiotic in a population with a known high prevalence of infection and preterm labour would reduce the incidence of preterm labour (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes were mean gestational age at delivery, perinatal mortality, birthweight, and maternal malarial status and anaemia at 28&#x02013;32 wk.</p><p>Preterm birth was defined as gestational age at delivery of at least 24 wk and less than 37 wk. Perinatal mortality included stillbirths and deaths within the first week of life.</p><p>We documented outcomes including date, type and place of delivery, type of assistance, and condition of mother and baby. For babies born in a hospital or health centre, birthweight was recorded. Babies were also weighed at postnatal visits at weeks 1 and 6.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample Size</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (COMREC), Malawi, and permission to work at the Health Centres was obtained from the Ministry of Health in Malawi. The study was designed to have 90&#x00025; power to detect a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth from 20&#x00025; <xref rid="pmed.1000191-vandenBroek2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> to 15&#x00025;, using a one-tailed test of significance at the 5&#x00025; level. This required 987 women per arm. To account for an anticipated 15&#x00025; dropout rate the total number recruited was to be 2,300. A one-tailed test was planned for the primary outcome since an increase in the incidence of preterm delivery would be of no more interest than equivalence <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Bland1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000191-Overall1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Two-tailed tests were planned for secondary outcomes, to ensure that an impact in either direction could be identified and reported. After agreeing to the analysis plan, a single interim analysis was performed using a significance level of 0.001 to avoid inflation of the final false positive error rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Design</title><p>The randomization schedule was prepared by a statistician not involved in the trial analysis using a random generation procedure with variable block size to assign both treatments equally within each block of consecutive numbers. The azithromycin and placebo treatments allocated were provided as identical capsules (Pfizer) and packed in pairs of sealed envelopes for each individual study number, according to the randomization schedule, by staff who were not involved in the conduct of the trial. The randomization schedule was placed in sealed envelopes and not disclosed to anyone involved in the trial; it was only provided to the trial statistician for the interim and final analyses.</p><p>Numbers were assigned sequentially, by the study midwives, stratified by the two midwife teams, each serving two health centres, at the time of enrolment to the study. Both participants and study midwives were blinded to the study assignment.

Analysis of covariance was used to estimate the effect of azithromycin on gestational age at delivery and on birth-weight. Variables included in these analyses as potentially influencing outcomes were: health centre, gravidity, body mass index (BMI), previous preterm delivery, anaemia, malaria, and syphilis status at the week 16&#x02013;24 visit. Gestational age at delivery and multiplicity of pregnancy was also included in the analysis of birth-weight. Gestational age at delivery was also included (as linear and quadratic functions) in the analysis of perinatal mortality. All analyses were performed, using Stata software versions 9 or 10, on an intention-to-treat basis using all available data; for all secondary outcomes two tailed tests were performed using the 5&#x00025; significance level.</p><p>An interim report, including analyses of safety and efficacy data for the 1,151 women with an estimated date of delivery prior to 8 February 2005 was prepared for the data and safety monitoring board in June 2005.</p><p>A limited meta-analysis was planned to include the results of this study together with the results of other randomized trials of routine antibiotic prophylaxis during pregnancy. These were identified using a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Database of Clinical Trials (details of search strategy not included). Only the primary outcome of the APPLe (Azithromycin for the Prevention of Preterm Labor) study (delivery &#x0003c;37 wk) was to be meta-analysed (Review Manager 5; Cochrane Collaboration). A random effects model was to be used if there was significant heterogeneity. There were no plans for subgroup or sensitivity analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Results</title><p>Over a period of 19 mo (February 2004 to September 2005) 11,713 women were seen for their first antenatal care visit in one of the four antenatal clinics.

It is possible that different antibiotics or different antibiotic regimens with more intensive treatment schedules might impact on preterm birth rates. However, more complicated antibiotic regimens would have less appeal in resource-poor settings.</p><p>Another explanation is that ascending intrauterine infection may have been overemphasised as a primary cause of preterm birth. If factors such as psychosocial stress or heavy work, for example, are important in the premature triggering of the placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) pathway that ultimately leads to parturition <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, associated premature cervical shortening and dilatation might permit secondary ascending bacterial invasion of the uterine cavity. This has been suggested in the past <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Romero1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> in the context of twin pregnancy in which preterm birth is common, and early cervical dilatation does occur <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Neilson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Transvaginal ultrasound scanning has shown short cervices to be a powerful predictor of preterm birth in singleton pregnancies <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Honest1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>At the time of planning of the trial, it was assumed that antibiotic prophylaxis during pregnancy was unlikely to confer any harm, whether or not it conferred any benefit. The publication of the follow-up of the ORACLE trial has shown that this assumption was wrong. This report showed that children of women treated with antibiotics for preterm labour (not prophylactically) were more likely to have neuro-developmental delay <xref rid="pmed.1000191-Kenyon1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Our study adds further weight to the conclusion that pregnant women should not be treated with antibiotics unless for specific infections and with good evidence of likely benefit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000191.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol.</p><p>(0.07 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000191.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000191.s002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000191.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The data monitoring panel was P.A.
