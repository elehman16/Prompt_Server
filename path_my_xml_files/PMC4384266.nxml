Hence it can be difficult for patients with poor health literacy to recall medication names and understand printed information.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>While a clear and standardized form is important for documentation of drug allergy<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, empowering both public and healthcare professionals is also necessary for more complete drug allergy documentation.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The Thai Ministry of Public Health has mandated that drug allergy cards should be provided to patients experiencing serious Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) or ADRs which are intolerable or reduce quality of life to prevent future exposure to these drugs. While cards can be useful, their effectiveness in preventing future recurrence depends on patients&#x02019; knowledge and understanding of drug allergy. Patients need to carry their drug allergy cards and show them to healthcare professionals at the point of prescribing. Small studies suggest that pharmacists providing counseling to patients about drug allergy and providing basic information about ADRs and their management, together with written information, could result in improved knowledge.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Neither of these studies assessed whether pharmacist counseling was more effective than written information alone or assessed behaviours related to drug allergy. This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of management in improving knowledge and understanding about drug allergy and behavior-related to drug allergy cards in patients with a history of drug allergy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by the Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human Research (Institutional Review Board Number: IRB00001189), and conducted at Srinagarind Hospital, an 800-bed university teaching hospital in northeast Thailand. This was a before-and-after study investigating management that involved providing different designs of educational brochures and the addition of pharmacist counseling to a brochure, in order to improve knowledge and understanding about drug allergy and behavior-related to drug allergy card.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Development of educational brochures</title><p>Two newly designed brochures, Brochure A and Brochure B, were specially developed for this study and used to educate patients about drug allergy and the importance of drug allergy cards. Both brochures contained similar information explaining about the definitions of drug allergy and side effects, basic observation of drug allergy symptoms, self-management of drug allergy, and how to prevent recurrence. However, the colors used, and information and illustrations of drug allergy differed between brochures. Brochure A used fair color (light-green) as a background and presented information and illustrations of common drug allergy symptoms, for example, maculopapular rash and urticaria. Brochure B used gaudy color (crimson) as a background and presented information and illustration of serious drug allergy symptoms, for example, anaphylactic shock and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Content was adapted from publications and electronic sources. A dermatologist and a hospital pharmacist, responsible for ADR monitoring, evaluated the clarity, meaningfulness, appropriateness of wording and the format of the brochures. Following this, the brochures were distributed to 20 outpatients to investigate their understanding of the information provided and their preference on brochure design. Patients&#x02019; comments were then used to revise the final versions of the two brochures used in the study.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Questionnaire Development</title><p>The questionnaire was initially developed using an adapted drug hypersensitivity questionnaire developed by the European Network for Drug Allergy (ENDA) and a model for understanding patient attribution of ADRs.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Content validity of the questionnaire was tested by four experts, two internal medicine doctors and two hospital pharmacists, and calculated for Index of Consistency (IOC). The &#x02018;think aloud&#x02019; technique, requiring patients to explain how they think or perceive while completing the questionnaires, was performed in five outpatients who had received drug allergy cards at the pharmacy department to assess ease of use and understanding. Comments and suggestions were used to revise the final questionnaire to ensure its appropriateness. Test-retest reliability was then conducted with fifteen eligible patients by completing two copies of the questionnaire two weeks apart.</p><p>This paper-based questionnaire consisted of three sections including demographic data and clinical data (7 questions), questions assessing knowledge and understanding of drug allergy and drug allergy cards (5 questions), and questions assessing behavior-related to drug allergy card (2 questions). There were five domains for evaluating patients&#x02019; knowledge and understanding of drug allergy. Each domain resulted in a score of one, giving a maximum score of five. To attain the maximum score, respondents were required to:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(i)</label><p>provide the full name of the drug to which they were allergic</p></list-item><list-item><label>(ii)</label><p>provide at least one drug allergy symptom</p></list-item><list-item><label>(iii)</label><p>select one or two correct options from six statements relating to management of drug allergy</p></list-item><list-item><label>(iv)</label><p>provide all correct responses to four &#x0201c;Yes/ No&#x0201d; statements concerning prevention of recurrent drug allergy</p></list-item><list-item><label>(v)</label><p>provide all correct responses to five &#x0201c;Yes/ No&#x0201d; statements concerning the purpose of the drug allergy card.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The total score was then dichotomized to provide two levels of knowledge and understanding: low to average (score 0 to 3) and good (score 4 or 5).</p><p>Patients had to read and completed the questionnaires by themselves, however, for those who had literacy difficulties, care givers were allowed to carry out these procedures according to patients&#x02019; responses.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Main study procedures</title><p>The study involved 1,085 patients participating in two consecutive study phases: Phase 1 recruited patients for self-education (Group 1), who received the brochure only; Phase 2 recruited patients to a pharmacist-counseled group (Group 2), who received the brochure plus pharmacist counseling.</p><p>Phase 1: the subjects were 985 patients who had previously been recorded as having a history of drug allergy identified from the pharmacy database or who were recorded with maculopapular rash, anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis in their medical records. Baseline questionnaires were mailed to these patients. Brochures and follow-up questionnaires were then mailed to patients who returned a completed questionnaire one month later. Each patient received only one brochure, which were randomly allocated by simple random sampling method using table of random digits, therefore enabling the effectiveness of different brochure designs to be tested (Brochure A=149 patients and Brochure B=150 patients). Replacement drug allergy cards were provided to patients who indicated they did not have one in their baseline questionnaire response. Both questionnaires were returned to the researcher by mail. This study enabled selection of the most effective brochure for the Phase 2 study. It was conducted between May 1 and July 31, 2009.</p><p>Phase 2: subjects were recruited prospectively during a three month period from in-patients who experienced a drug allergy during current hospitalization or were admitted as a result of a drug allergy or out-patients who were screened positively by pharmacists for previous drug allergy during prescription dispensing (Group 2). All patients received baseline questionnaires directly from a pharmacist and this was returned to the pharmacist directly after completion. After completing the baseline questionnaire, a pharmacist reinforced the information about drug allergy that was contained in the brochure, and also: used a standardized diagram to counsel patients about mechanisms, prognosis and complications of drug allergy; emphasized the need to remember the name of the allergic drug and other drugs that could possibly cause the same allergic reactions; advised patients to tell their close family about this drug allergy; and suggested how replacement drug allergy cards could be obtained. This counseling was performed at the outpatient pharmacy department or at inpatient wards depending on the recruitment site and took approximately 15-20 minutes. Drug allergy cards were also provided to patients whose questionnaire responses indicated they did not have one. Follow-up questionnaires were immediately delivered to patients at the study site and they were returned by mail one month after the intervention. This phase was conducted between August 1 and October 10, 2009.</p><p>Patients, who did not return the questionnaires within three-week period after sending mails, received telephone and/or postcard reminders twice at three and six weeks.

Patients receiving both Brochures showed significant improvements in mean total score after receiving the intervention (all P&#x0003c;0.05). The frequency of self-reported presenting and carrying drug allergy cards was slightly lower after the intervention, but this was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

In addition, pharmacist counseling plus the brochure was found to be more effective than brochure alone in promoting patients&#x02019; knowledge and understanding of drug allergies, self-reported card-carrying and presenting cards to health professionals. Therefore, our results suggest that the effort involved in providing important information for patients and also in ensure it is explained is potentially valuable.</p><p>The majority of patients (88.2%) in our study were aware that they had experienced
allergic reactions to at least one drug. This was a higher rate than that in other studies
(17.2%-30.0%)<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> because our study recruited only patients with
a clear history of drug allergy. The finding that 67.7% of all patients were able to name the
allergic drugs was also slightly higher than found in a previous study (60.0%).<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Inability to recall drug names could be due to long time
intervals since experiencing the allergic reaction in some patients or failure to realize that the
drug had caused the allergic reaction<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, but could also be
due to English drug names being used.</p><p>Both interventions, self-education through provision of a brochure alone and pharmacist counseling plus brochure, resulted in a significant increase in knowledge scores, however, a greater improvement in behaviors regarding always carrying and presenting drug allergy cards was found in patients who received pharmacist counseling plus brochure than those who received brochure alone. In addition, higher educational level and owning a drug allergy card were significantly associated with greater knowledge and understanding, which is in line with previous work showing a positive correlation between educational level and knowledge of drug allergy.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The brochure intervention alone only impacted on overall knowledge score, not on self-reported behaviors. However, the patients in this study self-reported a higher frequency of carrying drug allergy cards than was found in other studies.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Educational materials (e.g. brochures, charts) have previously been found to increase patients&#x02019; knowledge and understanding of drug allergy, to encourage them in reporting drug allergy history, and discussing their drug-related problems with healthcare professionals.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The availability of drug allergy cards or bracelets which contain drug names and their allergic symptoms, do help patients to remember and prevent future exposure to the allergic drugs especially when patients are unable to communicate.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Pharmacists could encourage patients to always carry and present their drug allergy cards during routine service, while intensive counseling at the first exposure of drug allergy may provide better understanding in allergic drugs and other drugs with similar pharmacologic activity, mechanisms of drug allergy, and characteristics of allergic reactions to patients and family members, enabling greater understanding to prevent further occurrences.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Our study suggests that educational brochures should be provided for all drug allergy patients to promote knowledge and understanding of drug allergy, whereas pharmacist counseling should focus on patients with poor knowledge and behaviors related to drug allergy.</p><p>There were a number of limitations in the present study. Firstly, the questionnaire required patients to retrospectively complete information about their history of drug allergy. Therefore, especially in Group 1 patients who were recruited from the records on hospital database, might have had difficulties in recalling their allergic experiences. Despite the reminding by telephone and/or postcards were undertaken, recall bias may discourage patients to return mailed questionnaires and have contributed to the low response rate of baseline questionnaires in Phase 1 study (38.8%). Nonetheless, this was similar to the response rate of mailed questionnaires in a previous study involving Thai patients (42.0%).<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This may have resulted in a biased sample, with higher interest and thus knowledge of drug allergy. Secondly, some</p><p>information required for questionnaire validation, especially physical examinations, may have been recorded incompletely on patients&#x02019; medical profiles, making assessment of the accuracy of patients&#x02019; reports difficult. Thirdly, patients were derived from different populations and were not randomly allocated to groups. Nonetheless, characteristics of patients in both groups did not differ significantly in all key measures with the exception of the availability of drug allergy cards. Finally, although it was instructed that Group 1 patients must read brochure before completing the follow-up questionnaire, their actual compliance in doing so could not be assessed and the observed improvement in mean total knowledge score could not with certainty be as a result of receiving the brochure.</p><p>Prospective studies of longer duration should be performed to assess the long term efficacy of both these and other interventions in improving patients&#x02019; knowledge, actual behaviors and allergy recurrence rate. In addition, future studies should investigate the cost-effectiveness of brochures in the prevention of recurrent drug allergy and patients&#x02019; attitudes towards both brochures and counseling by pharmacists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S17"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Pharmacist counseling with brochures was found to be more effective than brochures alone for improving patients&#x02019; knowledge and understanding of drug allergies and drug allergy cards and in promoting drug allergy card carrying behavior.
