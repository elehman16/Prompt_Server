Noakes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] observed that CRP concentrations decreased with weight loss in a group HP group (34% PRO, 20% fat, and 46% CHO) and a HC (17% PRO, 20% fat, and 34%) diets, with no significant effect of diet (<italic>P</italic> = 0.447) (time was more important than diet). A longitudinal randomized, parallel trial assessed the effect of soy PRO on CRP concentrations among patients with Type 2 diabetes.

In a study, Ratliff <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] demonstrated that carbohydrate-restricted diet (CRD) (% energy from CHO: Fat: PRO = 17:57:26). Seshadri <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that decrease in CRP concentration after dietary intervention was modestly decreased in both diet groups (low-CHO diet [reduce CHO intake to &#x02264;30 g/day], conventional diet [&#x02264;30% of these calories from fat]). However, the response of CRP to diet differed depending on whether baseline level was in a high-risk (&#x0003e;3 mg/dl) or low- to intermediate-risk (&#x02264;3 mg/dl) range (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04).</p><p>Our findings indicated that there was a minor, but insignificant decrease in TC by following the diet for 8 weeks. Circulating TG was not significant increased; however, there was a significant increase in HDL-C and LDL-C levels in both diets, but increasing in LDL-C in BD was greater than HP diet. Te Morenga <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] demonstrated that both an HP diet (30% PRO, 40% CHO) and an HC-high fiber regime (50% CHO, &#x0003e;35 g total dietary fiber, and 20% PRO) were associated with reduction in LDL-C and TG levels. HP low-carbohydrate diet leads to a significant reduction in TG and LDL-C concentrations while it is accompanied with nonsignificant decrease in HDL-C levels.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Foster <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Brinkworth <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found that low carbohydrate and HP (LCHP) diets (40%, 30%, and 30%, respectively CHO, PRO, and fat) can have favorable effects on serum HDL-C.</p><p>Several studies have reported an improvement in TG levels with low-CHO diet (approximately 40% CHO, 30% fat, and 30% PRO)[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and while Rolland <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] did not observe the same results. Rolland <italic>et al</italic>. observed that there were significant decrease in TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C in LighterLife program (36% CHO, 36% PRO, and 28% fat) compared with measurement at baseline, but in LCHP group (20% CHO,40% PRO, and 40% fat) there was a significant improvement in LDL-C, with no significant changes in TC, HDL-C, and TG. Volek and Feinman[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported that serum TC and LDL-C reduced, significantly with replacing dietary CHO content with PRO. The study on 29 men participated in 12-week trial demonstrated that CRD (10% CHO, 65% fat, and 25% PRO) lead to weight loss and it can decrease TG and Apo lipoprotein C-I, Apo C-III, Apo E, involved in TG metabolism, significantly; in addition, it accompany with lower levels of atherogenic particles such as small and very small LDL, and increasing HDL particle size. Furthermore, there are significant relations between reduction in abdominal fat mass and improving lipoprotein size.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Thus, CRD can improve lipoprotein profiles (HDL-C, TG, and LDL-C levels) in overweight men. Evangelista <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] showed that in overweight and obese patients with heart failure who adherence a HP diet (40% CHO, 30% PRO, and 30% fat) experienced greater reduction in TC, TG, and LDL-C levels and more increase in HDL-C concentration compared to BD diet (55% CHO, 15% PRO, and 30% fat). More improvements in lipid profiles were observed in patients following HP diet compared to BD diet are attributed to greater reduction in adiposity and body weight [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Due to the high-fat content of HP diets, these regimes can raise TC and LDL-C levels, so patients should consume more plant sources than animal sources of PRO, which minimizes this potential risk. Nonetheless, long-term variations of HP diet on lipid profiles warrant further investigation. The mechanism that more weight reductions correlated with higher PRO diet are still unknown, but it speculates that more weight reductions may be related to more energy expenditure in patients who consume higher PRO in diets. Weight loss improved cardiovascular disease markers in the following of HP and HC diets; TG levels diminished with HP diets more than HC diets in women with elevated TG levels. This finding confirms that lower CHO content in HP diet causes very low-density lipoprotein and TG production reduction.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Effects of HP diet on blood lipids are controversial. Farnsworth <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Skov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] realized that HP diet decreased TG concentration and Parker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] observed a significant decrease in LDL-C of individuals with this regime. An important concern about consuming HP diets, especially those rich in animal PRO sources, is its direct correlation with higher cholesterol and saturated fatty acids intake and higher cardiovascular diseases risk. However, roles of CHO and PRO contents of diet have gotten less attention. It is accepted that animal PROs showed atherogenic effects and that diets with high complex CHOs content can decrease heart disease risk. It seemed that effects of HP and HC diet can be confounded by other dietary components including dietary fiber, total fat, and TE intake. In some studies seem that replacing a portion of dietary CHO with PRO can show positive effects on TG/HDL-C ratio.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Several limitations of this study require consideration. First, we studied our trial on overweight and obese women, and therefore, we cannot generalize our findings to the general population. Second, measurement error and bias of food record could have impacted on our observed relationship. Third, the short period of the trial can affect on the observed relationship.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Age, weight, and body mass index at baseline and after intervention between two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-7-110-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In this trial, we observed that both diets had positive effects on CRP, and HDL. LDL increased significantly in both groups following the different diet with a greater increase in those following the BD.

Further investigations need to confirm these findings and due to the controversial fact of similar trials findings, it seems that more research is necessary to elucidate the potential mechanisms that may explain the changes in anthropometric measurements following an HP diet.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study is founded by Vice Chancellor for Research, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was designed by RGH, GHA; data were collected and analyzed by PA, ZM, and AF; data interpretation and manuscript preparation were undertaken by PA, RGH, and LD.
