The mechanism for this relationship has been explained, in part, by increased satiety, which may occur as a result of changes in appetite-suppressing gut hormone levels, and decreases in food intake at subsequent meals.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objective</title><p>We hypothesized that increasing doses of mixed fiber, consumed in muffins for breakfast, would proportionally influence satiety, gut hormone levels, and subsequent food intake.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Healthy men (<italic>n</italic>=10) and women (<italic>n</italic>=10) with a BMI of 24&#x000b1;2 (mean&#x000b1;SEM) participated in this study. Fasting subjects consumed a muffin with 0, 4, 8, or 12 g of mixed fibers and approximately 500 kcal. Visual analog scales rated hunger and satiety for 3 h; blood was drawn to measure ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> (PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub>) at various intervals; and food intake was measured at an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results</title><p>Responses to satiety-related questions did not differ among treatments. However, despite lack of differences in satiety, gut hormone levels differed among treatments. Ghrelin was higher after the 12 g fiber dose than after the 4 and 8 g fiber doses. GLP-1 was higher after the 0 g fiber dose than after the 12 and 4 g fiber doses, and PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> did not differ among fiber doses. Food intake was also indistinguishable among doses.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Satiety, gut hormone response, and food intake did not change in a dose-dependent manner after subjects consumed 0, 4, 8, and 12 g of mixed fiber in muffins for breakfast.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fiber dose</kwd><kwd>fiber</kwd><kwd>ghrelin</kwd><kwd>GLP-1</kwd><kwd>PYY</kwd><kwd>appetite</kwd><kwd>hunger</kwd><kwd>visual analog scales</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Observational studies suggest that fiber intake is inversely associated with body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>). For example, a study reported that in a 20-month period, every 1 g increase in total fiber consumed per day, decreased body weight by 0.25 kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). Improved satiety and decreased food intake are common theories used to describe why fiber intake may be associated with a lower body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>).</p><p>Fiber has well-documented effects on satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>); and because of this, it is often implied that consuming high-fiber foods will reduce food intake. Some studies have compared satiety and food intake after one dose of fiber compared to a control; however, few, if any, studies have evaluated how increasing doses of fiber actually influence food intake at subsequent meals.</p><p>Certain types of fiber may influence satiety more than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>). For example, a large review suggests that viscous fibers, such as guar gum, pectin, and &#x003b2;-glucan may improve satiety more than less viscous fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>).</p><p>Gut hormones are also proposed as important factors for the control of appetite and satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). Ghrelin has been shown to be positively correlated with hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>), while glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> (PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub>) are believed to be inversely correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>). However, most studies evaluate gut hormone changes after predominantly carbohydrate, protein, or fat intake; very few studies have evaluated how these three hormones change in response to fiber intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). It is possible, that fiber decreases appetite by favorably influencing gut hormone levels.</p><p>At a time when food manufactures are adding fibers to everything from yogurt to snack foods, it is important to know more about the physiologic benefits of various fiber types and doses. Therefore, we hypothesized that a mixed-fiber muffin, fed at four practical doses (0, 4, 8, and 12 g), would increase satiety and decrease food intake in a dose-dependent manner. We also hypothesized that ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> would change in proportion to fiber dose.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0001"><title>Methods and materials</title><p>The University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board Human Subjects Committee approved all aspects of this research. Twenty subjects were recruited in the fall of 2007 by flyers placed around the University of Minnesota campus. They were chosen based on power calculations (80% power with &#x003b1; = 0.05) calculated from the differences in visual analog scale (VAS) scores.</p><p>Subjects were screened over the phone and subject eligibility was determined in accordance with all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included subjects were English-speaking, healthy men and women between 18 and 65 years of age. They were non-smoking; not taking medications; non-dieting (weight stable over last 3 months); had a BMI between 18 and 27; and were normoglycemic. Subjects also had to be able to give blood through an IV. Subjects were excluded if they: did not regularly consume breakfast; had a distaste for muffins; had any history of disease or significant past medical history; were vegetarians or consumed more than approximately 15 g of fiber per day; were pregnant or lactating; or if they had irregular menstrual cycles.</p><sec id="S20002"><title>Screening and study visits</title><p>Prior to any procedures the study coordinator obtained a signature on informed consent. After formal acceptance into the study, each subject received instructions for the day before study visits. In the 24 h prior to each visit, subjects followed a low-fiber, lead-in diet, which prohibited use of fiber supplements and alcohol. Subjects were required to maintain their body weight and activity level throughout the study period; specifically, they had to avoid excessive exercise 24 h before each visit.</p><p>Fasted subjects arrived at the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) on the University of Minnesota campus between 7:00 and 9:00 am on weekdays. All visits were held in a quiet room, which allowed subjects to read, use laptops, work quietly, or listen to music. Visits were scheduled at least 1 week apart. However, women participated only during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle so some visits were more than a week apart.</p><p>Upon arrival at the GCRC, a registered nurse inserted an antecubital IV that was used for blood drawing purposes only. The IV was left in place for 10 min before drawing the baseline blood sample; this was done in attempt to reduce the possibility of elevated hormone levels after venipuncture stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>).</p><p>After 10 min of rest, subjects were given instructions for completing the computerized VAS and proceeded to complete their baseline appetite assessment. Immediately after, fasting blood samples were drawn to evaluate ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub>. Subjects then consumed either a low-fiber control muffin or one of three fiber-containing muffins for breakfast. The muffin and 250 ml of water were consumed within 10 min.</p><p>Appetite sensations were rated by VAS at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after baseline. Ghrelin samples were drawn at 15, 30, 60, and 90 min, and GLP-1 and PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> were drawn at 30 and 60 min. The IV was removed at the end of the 180-min period and subjects were given a buffet lunch of pre-selected, pre-weighed pizzas, and 1 l of water. Subjects were told to eat until comfortably satisfied. After 30 min, the remaining pizza and water were weighed, and energy intakes were calculated. Pizza has been successfully used as an <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>). Before subjects were discharged from the GCRC they were instructed to keep a detailed food record for the remainder of the day.</p></sec><sec id="S20003"><title>Treatment muffins</title><p>In a randomized fashion subjects received the four treatment muffins containing: 0, 4, 8, and 12 g of mixed fiber for breakfast. The mixed fiber was presented in equal proportions in each muffin: pectin (Apple Pectin SF 50-LV, Herbstreith &#x00026; Fox, Neuenb&#x000fc;rg/W&#x000fc;rtt, Germany), barley &#x003b2;-glucan (Barliv, Cargill, Hammond, IN), guar gum (Guar, TIC Gums, White Marsh, MD), pea fiber (Centara Dietary Pea Fibre, Norben, Willoughby, OH), and citrus fiber (Citri-Fi 100FG, Fibrestar, Inc., Willmar, MN). These fibers were chosen based on a literature review of fiber and satiety, which suggested that viscous fibers were more likely to affect appetite, and for their ability to be baked uniformly into muffins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). The muffins were spice flavored and commercially made (Nestl&#x000e9; R&#x00026;D Center; Solon, OH). Attempts were made to balance macronutrient content; however, disguising viscous fiber in products is extremely difficult and some variances in macronutrient content were inevitable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T0001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Composition of treatment muffins<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF0001"><sup>a</sup></xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mixed fiber dose (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total fiber (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Soluble fiber (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Insoluble fiber (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">kcal</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total fat (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total carbohydrate (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Moisture content (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ash (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Serving size (g)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n/a</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n/a</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">502</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">144</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">488</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">176</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">493</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">89</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">175</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">544</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">93</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">204</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF0001"><p><sup>a</sup>Content listed per serving.

Surprisingly, none of our endpoints changed in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p>Our findings are inconsistent with previous reviews suggesting that fiber intake is positively associated with satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, only two crossover studies have evaluated how various doses of the same fiber influence satiety in the same subject population. In each of these studies, the higher fiber dose was more satiating than the low- or no-fiber dose. Mathern et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>) studied the effects of 0, 4, and 8 g of viscous fenugreek fiber on a variety of appetite sensations. They found that 8 g of fenugreek mixed into orange juice was significantly more satiating than 0 or 4 g. Similarly, Gustafsson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>) found that portions of carrots containing 6 and 9 g of fiber were significantly more satiating than portions containing 3 g of fiber, when incorporated into a mixed meal. It is difficult to explain why our results are incongruous with these two studies; however, it is likely related to the type of fiber administered. Certain types of fiber have been found to be more satiating than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>). The fibers used in this study were chosen because of their viscous characteristics and their previous association with appetite suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). Our results, however, suggest that a combination of fibers may not be as effective as one fiber given in isolation.</p><p>Studies that use lower doses of fiber generally find no effect on satiety. For example, Mattes et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>) found no difference in satiety when subjects consumed a snack bar with 4 g of mixed fiber and a bar with 1 g of fiber. Similarly, Hlebowicz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>) found no differences in appetite ratings after subjects consumed a control cereal and cereals with 1.5&#x02013;7 g of fiber. Lastly, a third study found snack bars with 4&#x02013;10 g of added fiber had no influence on appetitive sensations compared to a 2 g fiber control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>). Although, our study included up to 12 g of fiber, it is possible that this dose still was not large enough to influence appetite. Collectively, the results of these studies suggest that higher fiber doses may be needed to induce satiety.</p><p>It should also be noted that the water content increased and the caloric density decreased slightly with each dose of fiber. It is possible that these differences could have influenced our satiety results. However, this is unlikely since research suggests that an increased water content and increased caloric density should improve satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>); and this was not the case in our study. In fact, the 12 g fiber muffin (with the highest water content and lowest caloric density) was no more satiating than any of the other muffins. Also of note, we recognize that the 0 g fiber muffin contained more fat than the other muffins. We do not, however, feel this influenced our findings since the satiety-related results for this muffin were not significantly different from the other muffins with less fat.</p><p>A large dietary fiber review reported that subjects tend to eat less at subsequent meals (and over time) if they are fed higher fiber foods compared to lower fiber foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). Our data contradict this association. Food intake at the <italic>ad libitum</italic> pizza lunch, and in the post-intervention period, was indistinguishable among our fiber doses. This, however, was somewhat expected since appetite sensations were not significantly different among our fiber doses. If subjects' hunger and prospective food intake levels were not different then we would not expect food intake to differ at a subsequent meal or for the remainder of the day. Mattes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>) reported similar findings after feeding subjects a combination of viscous fibers in a breakfast bar.</p><p>Many reviews have suggested that gut hormones &#x02013; like ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> &#x02013; play influential roles in appetite regulation and food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>). However, it is clear that different macronutrients exert different post-prandial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref>).</p><p>Research suggests that digestible carbohydrates or proteins are more effective for suppressing post-prandial ghrelin than fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">30</xref>). However, the effect of consuming a predominantly fiber food, or consuming fiber as part of a mixed meal, is rarely described.</p><p>Elevated ghrelin is typically correlated with hunger and stimulation of food intake, while ghrelin suppression is correlated with satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref>). In our study, AUC ghrelin was higher after the 12 g fiber dose than after the 4 and 8 g doses. This finding was unexpected, since there were no differences in hunger or satiety among these doses. There is some evidence, however, that fiber intake may inhibit ghrelin suppression. For example, ghrelin suppression was inhibited when comparing meals that had little or no fiber, to meals that contained high doses of psyllium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">33</xref>), viscous fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref>), and wheat fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">35</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that the viscous nature of our fibers inhibited ghrelin suppression by altering gastric emptying and changing patterns of digestion and absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref>). However, if this were true then we should have expected to see the most ghrelin suppression after the 0 g fiber dose, which we did not. Further research is needed to better understand the role ghrelin plays in appetite after fiber intake.</p><p>GLP-1 is typically very low in the fasting state, but rises quickly after food intake, especially after carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). The rise of GLP-1 has been correlated with increased satiety and less hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">39</xref>). In our study, AUC GLP-1 was highest after the 0 g fiber treatment and lowest after the 12 g dose. GLP-1 was also significantly higher after the 0 g fiber dose than after the 4 g fiber dose. This is contrary to what we would expect, since the 4 g fiber dose produced greater feelings of satisfaction and fullness compared to the 0 g fiber treatment.</p><p>Again, we hypothesize that gastric emptying time and overall nutrient absorption may have been slower after our fiber treatments; thus, fewer stimuli (nutrients) were available to promote GLP-1 release. It is conceivable that nutrients interfaced with intestinal cells and nerve fibers more rapidly after the 0 g fiber dose, which subsequently produced a greater GLP-1 response. This theory is supported by Juvonen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">36</xref>). They compared high- and low-viscosity beverages with equivalent fiber content and found that the high-viscosity beverage significantly slowed gastric emptying and suppressed GLP-1 release compared to the equivalent low-viscosity beverage. Miholic et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">40</xref>) also report that gastric emptying time is positively correlated with GLP-1 levels. Specifically, they state that faster gastric emptying time was related to higher GLP-1 concentrations. This is contrary to the findings of others, who have reported that GLP-1 is inversely associated with gastric emptying time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">42</xref>). However, these studies have evaluated gastric emptying after GLP-1 infusions or GLP-1 stimulated by fiber-free meals.</p><p>Similar to GLP-1, PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> concentrations are expected to increase shortly after food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>). The change in PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> concentration is believed to reflect calorie content and the macronutrient composition of a meal. However, there are no published human studies evaluating changes in PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> after fiber is consumed as part of a mixed meal. Several studies have indicated that satiety increases in proportion to plasma levels of PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub>; however, this is most often seen after exogenous administration and not by way of endogenous production after food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">45</xref>).</p><p>PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> did not rise substantially after any of our muffins were consumed. However, the majority of our subjects' blood samples remained below the assay detection range for PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub>. We have no reason to believe this was an assay error, since preparation and analysis techniques were the same as those previously described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">47</xref>). PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> was consistently detectable in seven of our 20 subjects; though, there was significant variability in the baseline values among subjects and among test days (22&#x02013;161 pg/ml). This suggests that basal levels of PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> are highly variable within, and between, individuals, and that this study was not powered appropriately to determine statistical differences in PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub>.</p><p>In conclusion, increasing doses of a practical dose of mixed fiber did not influence satiety, gut hormone levels, or food intake in a dose-dependent manner. Despite common notions that fiber may improve satiety, this does not appear true for all types and doses of fibers. Therefore, blanket statements between fiber and satiety should be made with caution, and should be specific to a particular fiber type and dose. As well, three commonly accepted objective appetite markers (ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub>) were not consistent with the subjective satiety ratings of our subjects. This emphasizes the complexity of appetite and gut hormone signaling in the setting of fiber intake.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was sponsored by the Nestl&#x000e9; Research Center, a Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship from the University of Minnesota, and Grant No. M01 RR00400 from the National Center for Research Resources.</p></ack><sec id="S0014"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>ALE, LH, and HG are employees of Nestl&#x000e9; but have no conflicts of interest.
