As the rate of revision UCL reconstructions continues to rise rapidly, it is critical that a better understanding of this process be obtained. Accordingly, the purposes of this study were to (1) describe the vascular supply to the ME and proximal ulna and (2) quantify and compare the vascular disruption created during tunnel drilling for the modified Jobe technique and docking technique. We hypothesized that both surgical techniques would equally decrease blood flow to the proximal ulna; however, because more bone is removed from the humeral side with the modified Jobe technique, we hypothesized that it would result in a greater decrease in flow to the ME compared with the docking technique.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2325967118763153"><title>Methods</title><p>After approval by our institutional review board, 8 pairs (total of 16 specimens) of fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities were randomized by a random number generator to 1 of 2 study groups: modified Jobe technique or docking technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2325967118763153">Figure 1</xref>).

Two small holes (2 mm) were created at the base of this socket using the humeral drill guide. Each of these small holes was created anterior to the intermuscular septum, and a minimal distance (bone bridge) of 10 mm was maintained between the two.

During the review of CT scans and gross dissection, special attention was paid to the extraosseous and intraosseous course of each vessel surrounding the ME and sublime tubercle. The location of the perforating terminal vessels was documented to assess the topographic location of each with respect to the perfusion pattern of the ME and sublime tubercle.

While the docking technique maintained 86% of flow in the ME, only 40% of flow was maintained in the ME with the modified Jobe technique (<italic>P</italic> = .029).</p><p>Although the docking and modified Jobe techniques are the most commonly utilized methods for reconstructing the UCL, there are very few head-to-head comparisons of the techniques. One study has suggested that the docking technique may be biomechanically superior to the modified Jobe technique<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>; however, the clinical implications of these findings remain uncertain. While it is unknown if one technique leads to higher rates of revision surgery compared with the other, it is well established that the overall rate of revision surgery is on the rise.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The cause of this increase is multifactorial and likely related to extrinsic factors such as increased throwing velocity, lack of sufficient rest between seasons, and pressure to return to play as early as possible; however, other intrinsic and surgical factors contribute to healing of the bone-to-tendon interface. Some of these potential factors include graft isometry, tension applied at the time of reconstruction, strain on the graft during the early healing phase, graft structural integrity, bone quality, as well as the local vascular, cellular, and immunomodulatory environment of healing tissue.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> While many of these factors may be out of the control of the patient and surgeon, those that are modifiable should be optimized in an attempt to maximize the potential for robust healing.</p><p>It is well established that vascularity is needed for biological healing of tissue, including healing of the tendon-bone interface. Although this study was not able to determine a minimal amount of vascularity that must be maintained for optimal graft healing, it is reasonable to postulate that higher degrees of vascularity would have a beneficial effect on graft incorporation. It is also worth noting that the primary source of vascularity to the graft-bone interface is uncertain. It is likely that both intraosseous flow and extraosseous structures (local perforating vessels) play an important role in this process, but the precise contribution of each remains unknown.</p><p>In contrast to the stated hypothesis, vascularity was only minimally disrupted in the proximal ulna after drilling ulnar tunnels. The primary vascular supply to this region, the anterior ulnar recurrent artery, branches off of the ulnar recurrent trunk distal to these tunnels and travels proximally to vascularize the subchondral surface. Although the ulnar tunnels likely violated this path, perfusion was well maintained at 96% to 99% of baseline. This maintenance of vascularity is likely because of collateral flow from the posterior ulnar recurrent artery posteriorly and the IUCA proximally. There is a rich network of small vessel contributories in this region of the proximal ulna.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-2325967118763153" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>
</p><p>For the ME, alterations in interosseous flow appear to be more vulnerable to tunnel drilling. Terminal branches of the IUCA supply both the anterior and posterior aspects of the ME, and these structures are at risk during drilling of the ME. Although the docking and modified Jobe techniques both create a total of 3 cortical disruptions in the ME (1 distal and 2 proximal), they differ in their size and locations. While the docking technique allows for a pair of 2-mm holes to be placed proximally in the anterior ME, the modified Jobe technique relies on a pair of larger diameter holes (typically 3.5 mm) placed proximally in the anterior and posterior ME (1 on each side). Although it is difficult to know for certain whether it was the size of the tunnels (3.5 mm) or the location (1 anterior and 1 posterior) that resulted in increased vascular insult for the modified Jobe technique, both factors may have contributed to this finding. During gross dissection, terminal branches of the IUCA were more commonly violated on the posterior aspect of the ME for the modified Jobe technique, while this area was spared for elbows undergoing the docking technique. The increased diameter of the tunnels also increases the probability that the drill will encounter terminal vessels either at or deep to the cortical surface.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this study that warrant discussion. Namely, this work was performed in cadaveric specimens and relies on &#x0201c;time-zero&#x0201d; data. Therefore, the revascularization process that occurs after tunnel drilling in the clinical population could not be assessed or accounted for. In this study, tendon grafts and fixation devices (sutures, screws, buttons, etc) were not placed, and implantation of these tissues/devices could have an additional impact on vascularity that was not accounted for. Another limitation is the potential for small vessel disruption secondary to dissection and analysis rather than tunnel drilling. Although loupe magnification was utilized and meticulous care was taken to minimize unintended damage, this is certainly a possibility. Additionally, some of these specimens may have had pre-existing microvascular disease, variable vessel size at baseline, or increased age that could have affected vascular flow. Accordingly, all experimental elbows were compared with their matched contralateral elbows in an attempt to control for these variables. Ultimately, it remains unknown where the vascular flow comes from after UCL reconstruction, and this work was not able to differentiate intraosseous from extraosseous contributions. Finally, the minimal amount of vascularity required for robust healing remains unknown, and accordingly, the clinical significance of a 14% or 60% reduction cannot be determined from this work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section10-2325967118763153"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Drilling the ulnar tunnel during UCL reconstruction has minimal impact on vascularity of the proximal ulna. On the humeral side, both the docking technique and modified Jobe technique resulted in decreased vascularity in the ME, and this reduction was 4 times greater for the modified Jobe technique compared with the docking technique (60% vs 14%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .029). Although the minimal amount of vascularity required for healing is unknown, care should be taken to avoid terminal branches of the IUCA when drilling tunnels in the ME in an attempt to maximize the healing potential. This is particularly true on the posterior aspect of the ME. Additional study of these implications in the clinical population is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2325967118763153"><p>One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: J.S.D. is a paid consultant for Arthrex, ConMed Linvatec, and Wright Medical; is a paid presenter or speaker for Arthrex; receives research support from Arthrex; and receives royalties from Biomet and Wolters Kluwer Health&#x02013;Lippincott Williams &#x00026; Wilkins.
