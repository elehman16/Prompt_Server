A recent German cluster randomized trial was not able to improve guideline adherence and decrease sepsis-related mortality within the participating hospitals, partly based on lacking support by hospital management and lacking resources for documentation of prospective data. Thus, more pragmatic approaches are needed to improve quality of sepsis care in Germany. The primary objective of the study is to decrease sepsis-related hospital mortality within a quality collaborative relying on claims data.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">The German Quality Network Sepsis (GQNS) is a quality collaborative involving 75 hospitals. This study protocol describes the conduction and evaluation of the start-up period of the GQNS running from March 2016 to August 2018. Democratic structures assure participatory action, a study coordination bureau provides central support and resources, and local interdisciplinary quality improvement teams implement changes within the participating hospitals. Quarterly quality reports focusing on risk-adjusted hospital mortality in cases with sepsis based on claims data are provided. Hospitals committed to publish their individual risk-adjusted mortality compared to the German average. A complex risk-model is used to control for differences in patient-related risk factors. Hospitals are encouraged to implement a bundle of interventions, e.g., interdisciplinary case analyses, external peer-reviews, hospital-wide staff education, and implementation of rapid response teams. The effectiveness of the GQNS is evaluated in a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design by comparing the change of hospital mortality of cases with sepsis with organ dysfunction from a retrospective baseline period (January 2014 to December 2015) and the intervention period (April 2016 to March 2018) between the participating hospitals and all other German hospitals. Structural and process quality indicators of sepsis care as well as efforts for quality improvement are monitored regularly.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The GQNS is a large-scale quality collaborative using a pragmatic approach based on claims data.

This cluster randomized controlled trial involving 42 hospitals used a quality reporting based on prospectively gathered clinical data.

The intervention led to no substantial improvement in guideline adherence and no decrease in 28-day mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Expert interviews and surveys of local quality improvement teams identified lacking support by hospital management, lacking support of the project by other departments, and lacking time for data documentation and implementation of interventions as major barriers to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Incomplete inclusion of cases with sepsis and delayed documentation led to decreased validity of reporting of quality indicators and reduced power to detect effects of the intervention. Major lessons drawn from these experiences are as follows: (a) clear commitment by hospital management is needed to assure resources for QI and guarantee the involvement of all relevant departments in the QI effort, (b) an approach for gathering quality data assuring inclusion of the majority of cases with sepsis is needed, and (c) structures for hospital-wide QI efforts need to be established for achieving a sustainable long-term reduction of sepsis mortality.</p><p id="Par15">Using claims data for performance measurement has the advantages to cover all diagnosed cases with data being readily available and needing minimal time and costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Based on this methodology, a peer-review committee consisting of specifically trained clinicians is set up within the GQNS and working instructions have been defined. An external peer-review is suggested to hospitals with SMRs for patients with sepsis with organ dysfunction including shock substantially higher than the German average. Additionally, hospitals can call for a peer-review by themselves. External peers investigate a sample of the retrospective case records.

This approach is more valid than uncontrolled before-after comparisons that were used in previous quality initiatives on sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], since it is able to distinguish the intervention effect from secular changes that would have occurred without the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Beside secular changes, the so called Will Rogers phenomenon might bias changes in observed mortality across time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This phenomenon occurs if an intervention increases awareness for a disease, which results in increased detection and coding also of less severely ill cases. By incorporating an adjustment for risk factors in the difference-in-differences comparison, the analyses will try to correct for this bias. The analyses will evaluate the overall effect of participating in the GQNS, but they will not be able to distinguish which intervention elements cause possible changes.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Measures for studying processes and implementation of the interventions</title><p id="Par41">The study coordination bureau of the GQNS receives a study report by 3M on a quarterly base that informs about the quality indicators of each participating hospital as well as about hospitals that failed to provide their claims data. Hospitals that do not provide their claims data despite several reminders are excluded from the quality collaborative. To assess fidelity and dose of the local implementation of interventions in the participating hospitals, the coordination bureau of the GQNS regularly surveys local QI team leaders by standardized online questionnaires. These questionnaires contain items regarding departments participating in the QI teams, extend of interdisciplinary analyses of quality indicators, extend of interdisciplinary case analyses, extend of education of staff, and implementation of further interventions like existence and scope of rapid response teams. The questionnaire also contains items regarding barriers to change like lacking resources or support by management, as well as items that evaluate the quality of tools and support provided by the coordination bureau. The questionnaire was developed based on results of qualitative interviews conducted during the MEDUSA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Peer-review visits are documented and evaluated using paper-pencil surveys using standardized questionnaires both by the external peers and the involved local clinicians.

Since the evaluation of the study effect relies on claims data, it is not possible to fully assess and guarantee completeness and accuracy of data. To allow hospitals to identify possible under-coding of cases with sepsis the incidence of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock is presented and compared between hospitals in the quality reports.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Analyses</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Analysis of the primary outcome</title><p id="Par43">The final analysis of the intervention effect will be conducted using German national DRG data. The change in hospital mortality between the baseline period (January 2014 to December 2015) and the intervention period (April 2016 to March 2018) will be compared between the 48 hospitals initially enrolled in the GQNS and control hospitals. These are all non-participating German hospitals, whose DRG data are also available from the Federal Bureau of Statistics. Hospitals entering the GQNS after March 2016 will be excluded from this comparison. This comparison will be conducted in 2020 when the national DRG data for 2018 will be available from the Federal Bureau of Statistics. The primary analysis will evaluate the difference-in-differences in a hierarchical generalized linear model controlling for clustering of cases in hospitals by testing the statistical interaction between period (baseline vs. intervention) and group (48 hospitals enrolled in GQNS vs. control hospitals). Patient-related risk-factors will be considered as covariates. As a secondary analysis, the trajectories of change across time before and after intervention will be compared between intervention and control hospitals by a piecewise hierarchical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">A preliminary evaluation of the study effect will be performed after completion of the intervention period in March 2018 but only relying on the data of the 48 intervention hospitals (before-after-comparison).

Therefore, incidences of sepsis without organ dysfunction, sepsis with organ dysfunction and septic shock as well as incidences of mortality risk-factors will be compared across time between intervention and control hospitals. Analyses of the primary outcome will be repeated within these three subgroups of sepsis cases.</p><p id="Par46">Additionally, hospitals will be categorized based on the degree of their QI efforts during the intervention period but without inspection of their primary outcome. The categorization will be based on the results of the regularly conducted surveys of local QI team leaders. The analyses of the primary end-point will be repeated within the subgroups of hospitals with high QI effort and hospitals with low QI effort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sample size considerations</title><p id="Par47">Concerning the baseline period (January 2014 to December 2015), 45,419 cases with sepsis were included among the initially enrolled 48 hospitals, of which 27,331 (60%) were diagnosed with sepsis with organ dysfunction (including septic shock), resulting in approximately 1000 cases per hospital across both the baseline and intervention period. Comparing the intervention hospitals with all other German hospitals across a baseline and intervention period resembles a controlled before-after trial on the cluster level. Therefore, our sample size calculation used a design factor developed for cluster-randomized before-after trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. We observed a baseline mortality of 44% and an interclass correlation (ICC) of 0.02 among the included 48 hospitals. Based on the results of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], a reduction in mortality to 40% was expected for the 2-year intervention period. A Fisher&#x02019;s exact test comparing intervention and control conducted at &#x003b1;-level 0.05 with a power of 0.9 would require a total sample size of 6476. Correcting this sample size by the obtained design factor of 3.75, a total of 26 hospitals (13 control and 13 intervention) each including 1000 cases would be necessary in a cluster randomized before-after trial. Given 48 intervention hospitals and more than 1000 control hospitals in the national German DRG data, our study should be adequately powered to detect the expected intervention effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par48">The study underwent review by the internal review board of the Jena University Hospital (IRB protocol 4536-08/15) and the data protection supervisor of the Free State of Thuringia, Germany. Since individual case data are only obtained in the form of pseudonymized claims data, the need for informed consent by patients was waived. Quality reports present only aggregated data by hospital. Hospital names are pseudonymized, and each hospital knows only its own pseudonym. Only 3M and the study coordination bureau can de-pseudonymize all hospitals. Individual case data are only reported to the hospital where the cases were treated. For all kinds of surveys of QI team members, hospital staff, or peer-reviewers, participants will be informed about aims of the surveys and methods for protection of data privacy. Informed consent will be implied by participation in the survey, survey data will be stored in pseudonymized or anonymized form only, and all public reports of survey data will contain only aggregated data allowing no identification of individual participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Project status</title><p id="Par49">The GQNS was officially started with a kick-off meeting in February 2016. The first quality reports were distributed in March 2016 to the initially enrolled 48 hospitals. Till October 2017, quality reports have been distributed five times. Based on the public awareness of the GQNS, additional hospitals entered the network after the active recruitment. In September 2017, the number of participating hospitals reached 75, clearly surpassing the initially planned number. Participating hospitals are located all over Germany and include hospitals of all levels of care, among them 18 university hospitals (of 39 in Germany). In August 2016 and August 2017, two surveys of local QI team leaders were performed to assess the current progress and barriers to change in the participating hospitals and results were reported to senior hospital managements. Between March 2017 and September 2017, the first four online lectures and between May 2017 and September 2017 the first three external peer-reviews took place.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par50">The goal of this project is to establish structures for quality improvement of care for patients with sepsis and thereby to decrease sepsis-related in-hospital mortality. The GQNS is the first quality collaborative using claims data and a complex risk-adjustment to measure and improve quality of care for patients with sepsis. Because of this pragmatic approach 75 hospitals signed contracts for participation.</p><p id="Par51">Previous QI initiatives to improve sepsis care relied on gathering prospective clinical data in an uncontrolled before-and-after design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Based on these studies, it is impossible to distinguish the intervention effects from general secular trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The first cluster-randomized trial which set out to test for effects of elements of a QI collaborative on sepsis-related mortality (MEDUSA trial) failed partly because of incomplete and delayed inclusion of cases with sepsis. Our study design overcomes both of these shortcomings. Using claims data makes all patients with coded sepsis available for analysis. Based on a German national claims database, it is possible to evaluate the effect of the QI initiative in a difference-in-differences design comparing intervention hospitals to all other German hospitals.</p><p id="Par52">The approach of our study of course has some limitations. First, under- or over-coding of sepsis might occur in claims data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. However, for every hospital, the degree of under-documentation has decreased considerably, as since 2007 appropriate coding of sepsis cases has become a financial interest for the hospitals. On the other hand, over-coding of sepsis cases for financial reasons is systematically controlled for by the Medical Review Board of the Statutory Health Insurance Funds. A second limitation is the time-lag of 1.5&#x000a0;years until German national claims data are available for analysis delaying the final analysis of the intervention effect. A preliminary evaluation of the effect can only rely on data of the intervention hospitals. Finally, quality improvement in sepsis care has been described to be a marathon and not a short sprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The 2-year intervention period of the start-up phase of the GQNS might be too short for attaining substantial effects on hospital mortality in a large sample of hospitals. The aim of this start-up period is to build a long-lasting quality initiative and to establish structures for sustained quality improvement. A reevaluation of the effects of participating in the GQNS after a longer period of time&#x02014;comparable to the duration of other successful large-scale QI initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]&#x02014;might be necessary.</p><p id="Par53">If this study finds that the approach of using claims data in combination with a complex risk-adjustment is useful for measuring and improving quality of sepsis care, the approach may also be applied to other diseases.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Definition of cases with sepsis by German ICD-10 codes</title><p id="Par60">Sepsis without organ dysfunction: A40.0, A40.1, A40.2, A40.3, A40.8, A40.9, A41.0, A41.1, A41.2, A41.3, A41.4, A415.1, A41.52, A41.58, A41.8, A41.9, R65.0.</p><p id="Par61">Sepsis with organ dysfunction but without septic shock: R65.1.</p><p id="Par62">Septic shock: R57.2.</p></sec></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>3M</term><def><p id="Par5">3M Health Information Systems</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSCC</term><def><p id="Par63">Center for Sepsis Control and Care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRG</term><def><p id="Par64">Diagnostic related groups</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GQNS</term><def><p id="Par6">German Quality Network Sepsis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MEDUSA trial</term><def><p id="Par7">Medical EDUcation for sepsis Source control and Antibiotics, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT01187134</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QI</term><def><p id="Par8">Quality improvement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RSMR</term><def><p id="Par9">Risk standardized mortality rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMR</term><def><p id="Par10">Standardized mortality ratio</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par54">The study is funded by grants from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF; FKZ 01EO1502) via the integrated research and treatment Center for Sepsis Control and Care (CSCC).
