While numerous successful interventions have been implemented to improve prescription of VTE prophylaxis, a substantial proportion of doses of prescribed preventive medications are not administered to hospitalized patients. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of nurse education on medication administration practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a double-blinded, cluster randomized trial in 21 medical or surgical floors of 933 nurses at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, an academic medical center, from April 1, 2014 &#x02013;March 31, 2015. Nurses were cluster-randomized by hospital floor to receive either a linear static education (Static) module with voiceover or an interactive learner-centric dynamic scenario-based education (Dynamic) module. The primary and secondary outcomes were non-administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis medication and nurse-reported satisfaction with education modules, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Overall, non-administration improved significantly following education (12.4% vs. 11.1%, conditional OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80&#x02013;0.95, p = 0.002) achieving our primary objective. The reduction in non-administration was greater for those randomized to the Dynamic arm (10.8% vs. 9.2%, conditional OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72&#x02013;0.95) versus the Static arm (14.5% vs. 13.5%, conditional OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.81&#x02013;1.03), although the difference between arms was not statistically significant (p = 0.26). Satisfaction scores were significantly higher (p&#x0003c;0.05) for all survey items for nurses in the Dynamic arm.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Education for nurses significantly improves medication administration practice. Dynamic learner-centered education is more effective at engaging nurses. These findings suggest that education should be tailored to the learner.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02301793">NCT02301793</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006093</institution-id><institution>Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CE-12-11-4489</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a contract (CE-12-11-4489) from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) entitled &#x0201c;Preventing Venous Thromboembolism: Empowering Patients and Enabling Patient-Centered Care via Health Information Technology.&#x0201d; The funder had no role in the conduct of this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data are available from the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Data Trust for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data.

The other arm provided interactive learner-centric dynamic scenario-based education (Dynamic), where each scenario resulted in either positive reinforcement or corrective feedback with an opportunity to apply knowledge to a new scenario. Both education modules were computer-based containing the same general concepts about VTE prevention practices, including harms associated with VTE, incidence of VTE, and best-practices regarding communicating the importance of VTE prophylaxis and how to administer VTE prophylaxis.

Beginning on July 23, 2014, nurses were cluster randomized by floor to receive one of two education modules about VTE prevention. Nurses were asked to complete their assigned education module by October 23, 2014. All nurses associated with one of the 21 adult inpatient floors were eligible for enrollment in the trial. Nurses who were not permanently associated with one of the 21 hospital floors (e.g. traveling nurse, float nurse) were excluded from this study. Because of known differences between medical and surgical floors in VTE prophylaxis administration practice and culture,[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] floors were stratified by department (i.e. medicine and surgery) for randomization. Within strata, a coin toss (ERH) was used to randomize floors into either the Dynamic education arm or the Static education arm. Based on the outcome of the coin toss, nurses were then remotely assigned the online education module by an institutional nurse educator (DLS). The assigned educational module then appeared in the nurse&#x02019;s list of education assignments for completion within the institutional Learning Management System. Nurses are required to complete clinically relevant education regularly as part of ongoing professional practice and a waiver of consent was provided by the IRB; therefore nurses were not aware of their participation in a trial nor were they aware that two education modules existed. Additionally, the VTE prophylaxis medication non-administration dataset provided to the biostatistical team (i.e. outcomes assessors) for analysis was blinded by treatment arm and department.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Data collection</title><p>Patient demographic data were extracted from the Johns Hopkins Hospital administrative database.

Secondary outcomes included nurses satisfaction and the reason for non-administration (i.e. patient refusal vs other). The hypothesis comparing the different educational arms was evaluated using an intention-to-treat approach (i.e. all nurses were included regardless of training completion) accounting for clustering in the data and comparing rates of VTE prophylaxis dose non-administration at baseline and during the Post-Education period. Two per-protocol sensitivity analyses were performed. The first compared the Baseline vs. Post-Education periods for those nurses who had received training. The second, which was also limited to those nurses who completed training, allocated visits (including those during the training period) to the Pre- vs. Post-Education periods based upon the training date for each individual nurse.</p><p>Our biostatistician team (GY, JW, EAS) were blinded to the intervention arm assignment and department strata. Patient visit-level demographic characteristics for the Baseline period were described by arm. The changes in pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis administration practices between the Baseline and Post-Intervention periods were compared overall and between the two education arms using generalized linear mixed-effects models with a logistic regression model and random intercepts for floor and nurse to account for the intragroup correlation within the same floor or within the same nurse. Due to the complexity of the multilevel structure of the data (i.e. multiple doses per patient across various hospitalizations, nurses and floors), multiple outputation[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] was employed to reduce the levels of hierarchical structure to the floor level and nurse level by randomly selecting one dosage per patient. By reiterating the procedure 1000 times, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals conditional on the floor and nurse. The reported p-values are also derived from this procedure. A test of interaction was used to interpret the comparison of reported outcomes between the two intervention arms. Responses to the follow-up survey to assess nurse perception with the education modules were analyzed using a two-sided Chi-squared test. All statistical tests were conducted at 5% statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 14.1 MP (College Station, Texas 77845).

This effect was driven by reductions in non-administration due to causes other than patient or family request. Nurses found the interactive Dynamic module to be more engaging, enjoyable, and enable better patient engagement. While we were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant greater reduction in non-administration, the magnitude of improvement was slightly greater for the Dynamic module. These findings indicate that interactive, learner-centric education might be most appropriate to change practice and should be futher applied to other domains of clinical education.</p><p>This is the first study to rigorously study the comparative effectiveness of different nurse education approaches on clinical practices. A systematic review of interventions to improve VTE prevention practices reported that education strategies alone are not sufficient to drive and sustain change.[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, education is a necessary component of any successful intervention and our findings help to identify a strategy to effectively engage nurses in clinically relevant educational content on specific topics for delivery of high-quality care. Interventions to improve prescription of appropriate VTE prophylaxis in hospitals have been wildly successful at doing just that[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and are promoted by AHRQ as one of the top ten most important patient safety practices.[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, improving prescription is only one step in a multi-step process to ensure defect-free VTE prevention; medication doses prescribed must be administered.[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>This is not the first study to attempt to improve administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis among hospitalized patients. One study at a large academic medical center relied on a clinical pharmacist engaging all patients prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in an individualized education session. The investigators found that non-administration improved from 10.1% to 5.6%, though this intervention required one hour of a pharmacist&#x02019;s time per patient, which is not sustainable.[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Another study implemented a three-step approach to improve VTE prophylaxis administration that included a standardized nurses&#x02019; response to patient refusal of VTE prophylaxis, integration of daily assessment of VTE prophylaxis into a multidisciplinary rounds checklist, and frequent audit and feedback of unit performance. In this study, non-administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis decreased from 24.7% to 14.7%.[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] While our study showed a more modest change in VTE prophylaxis medication non-administration, the burden of implementation and completion was also markedly lower. While education is an essential component for quality improvement interventions, education alone is not enough to elcit and sustain change. Future quality improvement efforts should include engaging education combined with more intensive, active interventions. Studies focused on giving individual physicians feedback about their prescribing habits have shown marked improvement in practice.[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] It is reasonable to believe that providing nurses with feedback about their administration practices would have a similar improvement on practice habits. This is the first study to specifically identify individual nurse data for medication administration, the first step towards being able to provide individualized feedback to nurses. Additionally, because no signficiant difference in patient or family member refusal was observed, it is possible that more intensive education should be provided to patients to ensure that they are empowered to make informed decisions about their care.[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>This study had several strengths. We chose a clearly defined clinically-relevant outcome (i.e. dose non-administration) that was directly attributable to individual nurses before and after completion of the assigned education module. The education modules were relatively inexpensive and easily implemented using our hospital-wide learning management system. The interventions were effectively deployed and all relevant data were captured, including a high survey response rate from the nursing staff in both arms. Nurses, outcome assessors, and biostatisticians were blinded to minimize bias. In the Dynamic arm there was a particularly high response rate to the voluntary follow-up survey, suggesting that nurses desire more interactive and engaging education than what is provided by traditional linear static education using PowerPoint slides with voiceover.</p><p>There were some limitations to this study. First, although randomized, baseline performance was better among nurses in the Dynamic arm of the study compared with nurses in the Static arm. Despite this difference at baseline, a slightly greater magnitude of effect was observed among nurses who were assigned to the Dynamic arm although it was not statistically significant. Second, this trial was conducted in a single center potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. Nonetheless, this is the first randomized study of which we are aware that compares the effectiveness of differing educational approaches for bedside nurses and illustrates important information about how nurses respond to education. Third, we did not explore differences associated with education by specific clinical department (e.g. medical vs. surgical nurses) in the current study as it was too small to detect such high order interactions. It is possible that differences in response to education between medical and surgical nurses may be due to the difference in perceived importance of VTE prophylaxis between medical and surgical nurses;[<xref rid="pone.0181664.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] however, we stratified floors by clinical department for randomization to ensure similar representation. This would be worth consideration as part of future dissemination.</p><p>Education for nurses significantly improves clinical practice. Our findings suggest that education should be tailored to the learner rather than applied in a standardized manner. Dynamic learner-centered education may be more effective at engaging nurses and, when considering the corpus of evidence including a slightly greater magnitude of reduction in non-administration, may have the potential to be more effective for improving clinical practice. The improvement in administration practice was driven by reductions in non-administration due to causes other than patient or family refusal. Future studies will more accurately demonstrate improved effectiveness of this educational strategy, and should explore differences in the effect of education on different populations of learners, the sustainability of educational strategies on practice, and refine the education approach to optimize practice improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181664.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181664.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181664.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181664.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181664.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Stata.do file for outputation analyses.</title><p>(DO)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181664.s003.do"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181664.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Stata.log file for outputation analyses.</title><p>(LOG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181664.s004.log"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Deborah Dang, PhD, RN, Karen Haller, PhD, RN, Denise Vera, MSN, RN, and Deborah Baker, DNP for their support in the development of the nursing educational modules.
