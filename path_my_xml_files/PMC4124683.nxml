Untreated periodontitis results in the inflammation within the supporting tissues of the teeth, resorption of alveolar bone, loss of the periodontal ligament attachment, and is characterized by periodontal pocket formation and/or recession of the gingiva.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Treatment of periodontal disease is routinely based on mechanical debridement of the tooth surface and appropriate maintenance of oral hygiene. Complete removal of plaque is more difficult in deep than in shallow pockets and may result in the failure of periodontal treatment due to the remaining bacterial plaque after therapy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hence, it seems reasonable to combine mechanical periodontal therapy with the use of chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p>In 1979, Max Goodson developed the concept of controlled release-local drug delivery. This treatment modality inhibits most of the problems associated with systemic therapy (such as drug toxicity and interactions, and formation of resistant bacteria), limits the drug to its target site and therefore results in higher concentrations.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The use of natural products has served as a major source of drugs for centuries and is well-established as an alternative to health problems in some cultures, especially in Asia, America, and Africa.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Phenolic compounds are used in antiseptics, disinfectants, and mouth-rinse preparations because of their low toxicity and anti-bacterial properties.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In 2005, Sastravaha <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that adjunctive local delivery of extracts from <italic>Contella asiatica</italic> and <italic>Purina granatum</italic> significantly improved clinical signs of chronic periodontitis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Kushiyama <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated an inverse association between the intake of green tea and periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>There is a growing interest in the use of tannins for the treatment of periodontal disease. Tannins are a family of polyphenols (a plant metabolite) that precipitate proteins. Polyphenols exhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-bacterial activity against periodontal pathogens by increasing the antioxidant ability of oral fluids.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Tannins precipitate microbial proteins and prevent the development of microorganisms.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Polyphenols and tannins are the main substances in an oak tree. <italic>Quercus brantii</italic> is abundant specie of this plant and from the Fagacea family which is grown in Western Iran and has been used traditionally for the treatment of gastric ulcers, superficial injuries and local inflammation with hemostatic, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, and anti-oxidant effects.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> is from the Umbelliferae family and was used in Iranian folk medicine as a carminative and spasmolytic agent. It has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-bacterial, and anti-oxidant activities. <italic>C. sativum</italic> extract has also tannins.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Despite the recognized therapeutic effects of these two agents for a wide range of diseases, they still have not been used for the purpose of periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of subgingival application of herbal gel (extracts of oak and coriander) in periodontal pockets after full debridement in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blinded controlled trial. Our samples were selected randomly from patients with the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis referred to the Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry, affiliated with Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, over a 6-month period in 2012. Each volunteer had to fulfill the following criteria: Having moderate chronic periodontitis, a minimum of four periodontal pockets with an average depth of 3-5 mm, not pregnant, having no systemic disease, no antibiotic treatment during the 1-month period prior to the study, no smoking, no periodontal treatment during the previous 3 months, no severe caries or extensive restoration on the objective teeth, no orthodontic treatment during the study, and no history of allergy to the tested drugs.</p><p>Totally, 74 pockets (36 sites in experimental and 38 sites in control groups) of single root teeth (to inhibit the effect of confounding factors such as furcation involvement and inaccessibility for instrumentation) of 18 patients (aged 31-52 years old) were selected. An informed consent was obtained from all the volunteers prior to enrollment for the study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. All patients received complete scaling and root planing (SRP) using ultrasonic device (Mectron-Carasco GE, Italy) and hand instruments (Hufrieday, Chicago, Illinois, USA) and also oral hygiene instruction that included brushing by modified Bass method and use of dental floss. They were avoided using any mouth-rinses during the experiment.</p><p>The following indices were measured for each volunteer: Periodontal pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), papilla bleeding index (PBI), and plaque index (PI).</p><p>Periodontal pocket depth is the distance between the gingival margin and base of the periodontal pocket.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Level of attachment is the distance between the base of the pocket and a fixed point on the crown, such as the cementoenamel junction (CEJ).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In this study, the distance between CEJ and the bottom of pocket was measured in buccal, lingual, mesial, and distal surfaces of each tooth and was registered in a chart in millimeter. To evaluate the inflammation of gingival, the PBI developed by Saxer and M&#x000fc;hlemann was used.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In this index, 0 stands for no bleeding, 1 for a pointed bleeding, 2 for the bleeding shown as a slender bleeding line, 3 represents the condition that the triangular embrasure is filled by blood, and 4 means spontaneous bleeding. For measurement of PI, the teeth (except the third molars) were evaluated by an explorer 17-23 along the gingival margin in four sites: Buccal, lingual, mesial, and distal. If there was no plaque at the gingival margin, the score was recorded as 1, score 2 indicates a thin layer of plaque, score 3 is subject to moderate layer of plaque, and if an excessive accumulation of plaque is at the gingival margin the score is 4.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] So for each tooth 4 scores existed, and their average was recorded for the whole mouth.</p><p>Two weeks later, in the second visit, periodontal pockets were reevaluated and SRP was performed if needed to ensure full debridement of the whole mouth. Then patients were divided randomly (using the table of random numbers) into two groups; in the experimental group, the tested gel (containing gel-forming agent type 940, ethanol extract of oak hull of the specie <italic>Q. brantii</italic> 20% and ethanol extract of coriander fruit of <italic>C. sativum</italic> specie 1%) and in the control group, the placebo gel (making from gel-forming agent, similar color to test gel without the mentioned extracts) were transferred to a 2-mL syringe, gauge 21 and injected to the pocket.</p><p>The percolation method was used for extraction. About 100 g of plant materials (Jaft of <italic>Q. brantii</italic> and the fruits of <italic>C. sativum</italic>) were powdered and soaked in 300 ml of ethanol 70%. After 2 h, the plant materials were extracted with ethanol 70% (700 mL) by percolation method. After 48 h, extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporator (Heidolph VV 2000). Further concentration was done over the boiling water bath.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>For this goal, semisolid concentrated extracts of the seed hull (Jaft) of <italic>Q. brantii</italic> and fruits of <italic>C. sativum</italic> were used. Carbopol 940, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymers were used as gelling agents.</p><p>Local delivery of the gels was repeated 1 week later, so in this manner each formulation was used twice in the pockets. 1 and 3 months after baseline (first visit), patients were recalled, and clinical parameters were recorded again. All measurements were performed by a single masked examiner using a Michigan probe.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 17 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), and paired <italic>t</italic>-test, Mann-Whitney, Friedman, and Wilcoxon tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, 74 samples were analyzed (36 sites in the test group and 38 in the control group).

Repeated measure ANOVA showed no significant differences between two groups regarding PPD (<italic>P</italic> = 0.714) and CAL (<italic>P</italic> = 0.087).

In the other word, herbal products are safe in comparison with the synthetics for human use.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, there has been no clinical study to evaluate the effects of extracts of <italic>Q. brantii</italic> and <italic>C. sativum</italic> for the treatment of periodontal diseases. However, other therapeutic aspects of these two plants have been searched as mentioned before.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Various herbal remedies have been used for the treatment of periodontal disease. Durre and Muhammad, and Gazi demonstrated the anti-bacterial activity of <italic>Acacia arabica</italic> against strains of <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia</italic>, and <italic>Treponema denticola</italic>. They concluded that the tannin contains of about 24-42% in the bark constituents of A. arabica is responsible for this effect.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In a human clinical trial performed in 2009 to evaluate the effects of pomegranate extract mouth rinsing on saliva measures relevant to gingivitis risk, it was shown that using the pomegranate rinse had reduced total protein associated with the presence of plaque-forming bacteria, reduced activities related to cell injury, and increased the activity of the enzyme ceruloplasmin, which protects against oral oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The ellagitannin, punicalagin, was thought to be responsible for pomegranate's anti-bacterial activity.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Vasconcelos <italic>et al</italic>. also suggested that pomegranate might be used in the control of adherence of different microorganisms in the oral cavity.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Due to these findings and the tannin contents of <italic>Q. brantii</italic> and <italic>C. sativum</italic>, we decided to evaluate the effects of herbal gel made of oak and coriander extracts compared to placebo gel in clinical variables such as PPD, CAL, PBI, and PI. Means of all studied parameters before the start of the study did not differ significantly between two groups, which indicate their homogeneity and similar conditions. PI was considered an index for oral hygiene to distinguish if differences in this parameter can found our findings or not. This was retrieved from Sastravaha <italic>et al</italic>.'s investigation[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that compared the effect of two herbal agents <italic>C. asitica</italic> and <italic>P. granatum</italic> in the treatment of periodontal diseases. Since the difference in PI values was not statistically significant before and after treatment in two groups, the amount of plaque cannot be considered as a confounding factor.</p><p>Periodontal pocket depth reduction was significant in intra-group comparisons in 1-month and 3-month evaluations, which can be attributed to anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial effects of the ingredients, but inter-group differences were not meaningful. This finding was not in agreement with previous studies in which herbal compounds were tested, such as Sastravaha <italic>et al</italic>.'s article and Kushiyama <italic>et al</italic>.'s investigation where green tea was demonstrated to reduce PPD, significantly.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The pattern of CAL gain changes in and between two groups was like that of PPD reduction, so improvement of CAL can be attributed to the lower penetration of periodontal probe to the epithelium and connective tissue, to the epithelial attachment to the root, or can be as an adaptation of soft tissue portion of pocket with the tooth than do not allow probing through the tissues. Therefore, we cannot determinately relate the gain of CAL to the connective tissue attachment. Histological experiments are needed to exactly evaluate this fact.</p><p>When comparisons were made between the control and the test groups at different intervals of time, the PBI was found not to be different between them, but in both the reduction was observed during the 1-month posttreatment period, although this improvement did not continue between 1 month and 3 months after mechanical therapy.</p><p>As we know, bleeding in probing (BOP) is not considered as a specific test for diagnosis of inflammation, but due to its high sensitivity, it is an appropriate index for detection of inflammation in early stages. In evaluating the effect of green tea, Kushiyama <italic>et al</italic>. indicated a significant reduction in BOP values. This disagreement is somewhat because of the different study agents (although both of them act through host response modulation) and somewhat due to the smaller sample group in our study. Of course, durability of the drug is an important parameter that must be attended. In the present research, missing some of the participants during the study was of the limitations. However, evaluating the sustained releasing effect of the tested drug and its comparison with other herbal agents with a larger sample of subjects is suggested in further studies.</p><p>Although the use of herbal gel containing extracts of oak and coriander resulted in more clinical improvements than placebo gel totally, but it was not considered as a significant benefit. This fact again emphasizes the major role of SRP as the main method of periodontal treatment. It may be possible that by increasing the gel concentration, its sustainability or consumption repetition, significant effects be observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS' CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Dr Jaber Yaghini: Measurement of clinical parameters.</p><p>Dr Mohammad Shahabooei: Proposal preparation and literature review.</p><p>Dr Abolfazl Aslani: Prepartion of herbal gels, detection of their dosage and method of usage.</p><p>Mozhhgan Reza zadeh, Sima Kiani: Sample collection.</p><p>Dr Narges Naghsh: Writing and preparation of final article.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Annals of Periodontology</article-title><source>World Workshop in Periodontics</source><year>1996</year><volume>Vol. 1</volume><publisher-loc>Chicago</publisher-loc><publisher-name>American Academy of Periodontology</publisher-name><fpage>1</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Slots</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bragd</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Wikstr&#x000f6;m</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dahl&#x000e9;n</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The occurrence of <italic>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides intermedius</italic> in destructive periodontal disease in adults</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1986</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>570</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3462204</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cobb</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Non-surgical pocket therapy: Mechanical</article-title><source>Ann Periodontol</source><year>1996</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>443</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9118268</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Waerhaug</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Healing of the dento-epithelial junction following subgingival plaque control.
