Recently, the Effect of Amount and Type of Dietary Carbohydrates on Risk for Cardiovascular Heart Disease and Diabetes Study (OmniCarb) trial reported that a low-GI diet did not improve insulin sensitivity. We conducted this ancillary study of the OmniCarb trial to determine the effects of GI and carbohydrate content on glucose homeostasis and inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Research design and methods</title><p>OmniCarb was a randomized cross-over feeding study conducted in overweight or obese adults without diabetes (N=163). Participants were fed each of 4 diets for 5&#x02005;weeks with 2-week washout periods. Weight was held constant. Diets were: high GI (GI&#x02265;65) with high carbohydrate (58% kcal), low GI (GI&#x02264;45) with low carbohydrate (40% kcal), low GI with high carbohydrate, and high GI with low carbohydrate. We measured glycated albumin (GA), fructosamine, and high sensitivity C reactive protein (CRP) at baseline and following each dietary period. These biomarkers were compared within-person between diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The study population was 52% female and 50% black. Mean age was 53 (SD, 11) years; mean body mass index was 32 (SD 6) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Reducing GI had no effect on GA or fructosamine, but increased fasting glucose in the setting of a high-carbohydrate diet (+2.2&#x02005;mg/dL; p=0.02). Reducing carbohydrate content decreased GA in the setting of a high-GI diet (&#x02212;0.2%; p=0.03) and decreased fructosamine in the setting of a low-GI diet (&#x02212;4&#x02005;&#x000b5;mol/L; p=0.003). Reducing carbohydrate while simultaneously increasing GI significantly reduced both GA (&#x02212;0.2%; p=0.04) and fructosamine (&#x02212;4&#x02005;&#x000b5;mol/L; p=0.009). Neither reducing GI nor amount of carbohydrate affected insulin or CRP.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Reducing carbohydrate, regardless of high or low GI, decreased GA and fructosamine. This suggests that reducing carbohydrate content, rather than GI, is a better strategy for lowering glycemia in adults at risk for diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00608049?term=NCT00608049&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00608049</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Glycemic Index Diet</kwd><kwd>Carbohydrate(s)</kwd><kwd>Randomized Controlled Trial</kwd><kwd>Glycated Proteins</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance of this study</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known about this subject?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The glycemic index of dietary carbohydrate is thought to affect glucose homeostasis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recently, the OmniCarb Trial reported that lowering dietary GI did not improve insulin sensitivity.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What are the new findings?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In the setting of an isocaloric feeding study in adults without diabetes, reducing dietary carbohydrates lowered markers of 2-3 week glycemia (i.e. gycated albumin and fructosamine).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changes to glycemic index had no effect on glycated albumin or fructosamine</p></list-item><list-item><p>Neither reducing dietary carbohydrates nor modifying glycemic index affected C-reactive protein</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Reducing carbohydrate content, rather than GI, is a better strategy for lowering glycemia in adults at risk for diabetes.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Randomized clinical trials examining the effects of dietary patterns on traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors have helped inform national dietary guidelines.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

However, the oral glucose tolerance test does not represent the overall glycemic effects of dietary patterns that vary in amount and type of carbohydrate. Glycated albumin and fructosamine, markers of 2&#x02013;3-week cumulative exposure to blood glucose, may be especially well suited for evaluating the effects of dietary carbohydrates on glycemia in an intermediate-term trial setting. Both glycated albumin and fructosamine are formed by glycation reactions during which glucose binds with intravascular proteins, including albumin<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

We hypothesize that reducing GI and reducing content of carbohydrate will each lower intermediate-term glycemia measured by glycated albumin or fructosamine. Our secondary hypothesis is that lowering GI or content of carbohydrate would lower inflammation measured by C reactive protein.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Research design and methods</title><p>OmniCarb was an investigator-initiated National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored study, whose rationale and main results have been published.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> OmniCarb was a randomized, controlled, cross-over trial, comprising four dietary intervention periods.

Calorie targets were determined for each participant based on their body size, sex, and physical activity level. Calorie intake was adjusted throughout the trial to keep weight within 2% of participants' baseline values. Participants were encouraged to maintain the same activity levels and alcohol consumption throughout the study. Attendance at meals was recorded. Participants were required to eat one principal meal on-site and were observed while eating. Participants were sent home with the remaining two meals.

Glycated albumin (Asahi Kasei Lucica GA-L; Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), fructosamine, and high sensitivity C reactive protein were measured in year 2012 using stored plasma specimens with a Siemens Dimension Vista V.1500 chemical analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Glasgow, DE, Germany). Glycated albumin was assessed via an enzymatic method, involving oxidase and peroxidase reactions that yield a salt with a blue&#x02013;purple pigment, measured via spectroscopy. Fructosamine was measured with a colorimetric assay to detect the rate at which ketoamines reduce nitrotetrazolium-blue to formazan in an alkaline solution. The rate of formation of formazan is directly proportional to the concentration of fructosamine. The observed interassay coefficients of variation for glycated albumin and fructosamine were 7.6% (glycated albumin, mean 13.7%) and 2.0% (fructosamine, mean 309&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L), while manufacturer reported performance is &#x0003c;3% and 2.9%, respectively. Glycated albumin was expressed as a percentage of total serum albumin according to the manufacturer's instructions: ((glycated albumin concentration in g/dL/serum albumin concentration in g/dL)&#x000d7;100/1.14)+2.9.

However, these increases in fasting glucose had little influence on markers of 2&#x02013;3-week glycemia, glycated albumin and fructosamine, likely because of the opposite direction of effects conferred by reducing postprandial glycemia from the reduced GI diet. In contrast, reducing the amount of dietary carbohydrate generally reduced glycated albumin and fructosamine, suggesting that reducing dietary carbohydrate may represent a more effective strategy than reducing GI for lowering glycemia in overweight or obese adults.</p><p>In this ancillary study to the OmniCarb trial, we present the effects of type and amount of carbohydrate on glycated albumin and fructosamine. Glycated albumin and fructosamine are intermediate-term markers of glycemia that are highly associated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and are elevated prior to the development of diabetes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> They are formed by a non-enzymatic glycation reaction in which glucose forms a covalent bond with intravascular proteins, primarily albumin,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and, as observed in this study, they are correlated with each other (r=0.58). The half-life of these markers ranges between 17 and 21&#x02005;days; thus, glycated albumin and fructosamine represent an average exposure to glucose concentrations in the blood in the previous 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

It is typically determined by comparing the area of the glucose curve following the consumption of 50&#x02005;g of a carbohydrate food relative to a referent 50&#x02005;g food such as white bread or glucose.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> GI has been the target of nutrition policy advocates based on numerous observational studies,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> showing that lower GI is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> cardiovascular disease,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and mortality.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Mechanistic explanations for these relationships have included the hypothesis that a high-GI diet increases late postprandial hepatic glucose, reflected in higher fasting glucose measures.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In our study, we found the contrary to be true, that is, low-GI diets increased fasting glucose. We suspect that the reduction in GI caused a compensatory increase in gluconeogenesis and a reduction in insulin sensitivity in order to stabilize fasting glucose levels, protecting against night-time and early morning hypoglycemia. This mitigated the expected increase in glycemia from high postprandial glucose excursions during the high-GI diet. As a result, there was no effect on glycated albumin or fructosamine. This is consistent with a number of trials, which found no effect from GI on fructosamine or other glycation products like HbA1c in non-diabetic populations.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Like GI, the proportion of calories derived from carbohydrates has been associated with risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in observational studies<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>

<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and clinical trials.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;41</xref> Unlike GI, we found that reducing the amount of dietary carbohydrates was associated with reductions in either glycated albumin (high-GI diets) or fructosamine (low-GI diets). Interestingly, there were significant reductions in glycated albumin and fructosamine when GI was increased while the amount of carbohydrates was decreased, but not when GI was decreased as amount of carbohydrates was decreased. This likely reflects the fact that decreasing GI increased fasting glucose, which would oppose the effect of reducing carbohydrates on glycated albumin and fructosamine. Overall, these results suggest that dietary carbohydrate is more important than GI as a dietary factor influencing aggregate glycemic exposure. Whether these differences in the effect of dietary carbohydrate on glycemia affect progression to diabetes or cardiovascular disease should be a focus of subsequent research.</p><p>Prior studies have shown that a higher GI diet is associated with higher levels of C reactive protein,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> a marker of inflammation associated with risk for diabetes or cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This has led to the hypothesis that inflammation may mediate the association of GI with cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In this ancillary study, we found no effect from either GI or amount of carbohydrates on C reactive protein levels. This suggests that carbohydrates do not act via inflammation with regards to the pathogenesis of diabetes or cardiovascular disease.</p><p>This study has several limitations. The feeding periods were too brief for the observation of clinical events, making it necessary to examine surrogate markers as outcomes; however, we consider the feeding periods sufficient to determine effects on the surrogate outcomes. Based on our experience with prior feeding studies,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> effects of diet are observed soon after the initiation of feeding with the majority of effects taking place within the first 2&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Thus, we are confident that even those with a short feeding period would still manifest an effect from GI if one existed. We reviewed the literature on duration for effects of GI, and if anything find a diminution of effects on risk factors with duration, especially beyond 6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 421 participants in four trials with at least 6&#x02005;months duration, reducing GI had no effect on HbA1C (mean difference &#x02212;0.1%, p=0.7).<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Finally, 15% of the plasma specimens were hemolyzed and subsequently excluded from our analyses of glycated albumin and fructosamine, which reduced statistical power.</p><p>With regards to strengths, our study was a randomized, controlled feeding study that employed a cross-over design to assess dietary effects on glucose homeostasis. Diets were highly regulated and isocaloric with virtually no weight change over the course of the trial, reducing the impact of weight on our outcomes. Furthermore, we used non-traditional markers of glucose homeostasis that reflect intermediate-term glycemic exposure, permitting more accurate assessments of diet-induced changes in 2&#x02013;3-week glucose homeostasis. Finally, our study population was quite diverse with 50% of participants being black, a population at risk for prediabetes and diabetes.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that a lower GI diet increases fasting glucose, while diets with a lower amount of dietary carbohydrates reduce glycated albumin and fructosamine, markers of 2&#x02013;3-week glycemia. Together these findings suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet most effectively lowers glycemia in adults at risk for diabetes. Additional research is needed to determine the long-term effects of these physiological changes in glucose homeostasis on clinical outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SPJ, ERM and FMS wrote manuscript, researched data.
