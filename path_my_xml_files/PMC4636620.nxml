Patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited by postal invitation letter from their medical practice and randomised via automated system to intervention or usual care. Diabetes-related clinical data, quality of life, patient reported beliefs, adherence and satisfaction with medicines information were collected with validated tools at baseline and 6&#x02005;months postintervention. The process for collecting resource utilisation data was tested. Stakeholder meetings were held before and after intervention to develop study design and learn from its implementation. Recruitment and attrition rates were determined plus the quality of the outcome data. Power calculations for a definitive trial were performed on the different outcome measures to identify the most appropriate primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>792 patients were identified as eligible from five medical practices. 133 (16.8%) were recruited and randomised to control (n=66) or usual care (n=67). 32 students provided the complete intervention to 58 patients. Initial data analysis showed potential for impact in the right direction for some outcomes measured including glycated haemoglobin, quality of life and patient satisfaction with information about medicines. The intervention was found to be feasible and acceptable to patients. The pilot and feasibility study enabled the design of a future full randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Student and patient recruitment are possible. The intervention was well received and demonstrated some potential benefits. While the intervention was relatively inexpensive and provided an experiential learning opportunity for pharmacy students, its cost-effectiveness remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN26445805; Results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>EDUCATION &#x00026; TRAINING (see Medical Education &#x00026; Training)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The study followed recommendations published by the Medical Research Council for implementation of feasibility and pilot studies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention was developed with significant stakeholder involvement, a range of primary outcome measures were tested for suitability and the process for collecting resource utilisation data was identified.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Self-selection bias was found within those students who consented to participate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The trial was unblinded with the service providers, patients and research all aware of group allocation and intervention content.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The large number of statistical tests carried out creates the possibility that findings could be false positives and as this was a pilot and feasibility study which, therefore, used a low power we could potentially fail to detect small to moderate sized effects.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is estimated that preventable harm from medicines costs the National Health Service (NHS) in England &#x000a3;750 million per year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A systematic review in 2009, based on UK research, estimated that only between 4% and 21% of patients achieved the optimum benefit from their medication.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A systematic review of publications between 1966 and 1999 reported the prevalence of preventable drug-related admissions to hospital as 4.3%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Additionally, patients not taking their medicines as agreed with the prescriber has been reported to cost the UK NHS an estimated half a billion pounds a year.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Consequently, interventions designed to reduce adverse drug events and improve patient medicines-taking behaviours are required.</p><p>Medication review (MR) has been defined as &#x02018;a structured, critical examination of a patient&#x02019;s medicines with the objective of reaching an agreement with the patient about treatment, optimising the impact of medicines, minimising the number of medication-related problems in addition to reducing waste.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> MR in the UK was described as operating at four different levels,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> with the key component of level 3 medication reviews being the involvement of the patient while accessing medical records.</p><p>Pharmacist-led medication reviews have been shown to reduce costs associated with unnecessary prescribing of medication while potentially providing patient benefit.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, recent UK-based research utilising pharmacists to provide medication reviews found a counter-intuitive increase in hospitalisation,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> with one partial explanation being the didactic nature of the pharmacist communication.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>While UK pharmacy graduates develop expertise in the pharmacology and therapeutics of medicines, undergraduate training currently lacks significant patient contact.

For new models of care to be adopted, it is necessary to demonstrate that they are likely to be cost-effective. There is currently no evidence of this for the provision of pharmacy student-led medication review services.</p><p>Two and a half million of the UK population currently have type 2 diabetes with an estimated direct cost to the health system of &#x000a3;8.8 billion/annum.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Pharmacist-led medication reviews for patients with diabetes have demonstrated significant reductions in blood pressure<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

A reserve list was created and used to resolve any anticipated drop-out caused by the additional workload created by the study within the students&#x02019; final year.</p><p>Standard education process already included basic training in consultation skills, data governance and observation of a primary care doctor in practice. In addition, participating &#x02018;study students&#x02019; undertook four half-day training sessions comprising the following:

Consequently we determined the likely precision of the study for estimating the effect of the intervention on the continuous end points by estimating the expected value of the half-width of the 95% CI around the difference in means between the intervention and control groups. Assuming 80 patients in each group and a SD of 1.5% in the primary outcome variable of HbA1c then the estimate from this pilot study of the effect of the intervention on this end point would be within 0.5% of its &#x02018;true&#x02019; value. An observed difference in group means &#x0003e;0.5% (eg, HbA1c 7% compared to 7.5%) would be statistically significant.</p><p>From each of the five practices, 32 patients were, therefore, required providing 160 in total (80 in each of intervention and control arms). It was planned that each student would be allocated two patients in the intervention arm for review and consequently 40 students were required.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Baseline data</title><p>Both intervention and control participants were posted a questionnaire comprising the secondary outcome measures, which included an additional question asking whether they used a medicines compliance aid.</p><p>The patient notes within the medical practice were investigated to obtain:

This provided additional support and shared learning in addition to the wider clinical experience provided by access to additional patient records. Each pair, therefore, worked to undertake level 2 medication reviews for four intervention patients under the supervision of a PCT pharmacist. Students compared prescribing with national guidance<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref> and created individualised pharmaceutical care plans (PCP) on a predefined pro forma.</p><p>PCPs included demographics, allergies, special needs, lifestyle for example, diet and smoking status, relevant medical history, medication adherence, pharmacy use, current prescribed medication, over the counter, herbal and homeopathic preparation use and any care issues identified. After discussion and agreement with the supervising pharmacist, care issues identified were fed back on a custom-designed form, to either the patient's specialist diabetes nurse or medical practitioner who then decided on the final action.</p><p>Patients were then offered a range of flexible dates and times, to maximise participation of a meeting between each student and an individual patient.</p><p>The presence of a supervising pharmacist was ensured during all student-led medication reviews to ensure competence. The consultation (level 3 medication review) took place at the patient's medical practice and was separated by at least 2&#x02005;weeks from the level 2 review to enable the doctor or nurse to rectify or question any problems identified by students, prior to the subsequent student-led consultation. As planned in the protocol, each student provided two patient consultations which had no time limit imposed on their duration.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Six months postintervention, a questionnaire was posted to both intervention and control participants. The questionnaire was identical to the baseline version but with an additional question regarding frequency of community pharmacy service utilisation. Intervention participants were also asked to report any change in utilisation of community pharmacists following the student consultation to identify any change in attitude to or view of community pharmacists. The same data as baseline were collected from the medical practice, with HbA1c, blood pressure and lipid profile collected at 6&#x02005;months postintervention with a cut-off point of 1&#x02005;year; and medication and resource utilisation for the 6-month period postintervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Stakeholder meetings</title><p>Stakeholder meetings were held with patients, students, primary care pharmacists and medical practice staff both before and after the intervention.

All stakeholder groups displayed support for the concept, with patients also displaying a willingness to participate in a subsequent RCT. Medical practices were purposively selected, and no problems were experienced with patient recruitment, though recruitment rates were relatively low (17%) and may display a better response rate without postal issues experienced at one medical practice. Nevertheless, future recruitment for a full RCT would be possible and may display a better response without postal issues experienced at one medical practice. Importantly, there was also a very low patient dropout rate (&#x0003c;10%). The logistics of patients having to attend an additional clinic within the intervention group resulted in the loss of patients due to illness and bereavement which were unavoidable losses to the study and two due to forgetting to attend. A longer period to allow for rebooking and reminders closer to the time of the appointment may have prevented these drop-outs. A longer time period to allow for rebooking and reminders closer to the appointment may have helped but would increase the costs. Potential patient benefit was also identified within some of the outcome measures. The results, therefore, provide evidence that within an RCT, sufficient patients could be expected to agree to attend for a medication-related consultation.</p><p>As this was a pilot study, and had small participant numbers we did not expect to demonstrate significant effects in our outcome measures. Students were volunteers and may not represent a full population of undergraduate pharmacy students. All participating medical practices were requested to start recruitment at the same time; however, results demonstrate patient recruitment proceeding over a period of greater than 4&#x02005;months, resulting in logistical issues within the project. Ethical reasons required recruitment to be initiated via the medical practices, but results suggest that closer communication and support may be required between the researcher and medical practices to facilitate earlier recruitment. Written appointment information may aid patient attendance and prevent the small number of patients failing to attend due to forgetfulness. The large number of statistical tests carried out, increases the likelihood of false positives. Conversely as a pilot and feasibility study with limited sample size there is an increased likelihood of false negatives.</p><p>While student willingness to participate was high, pressures of concurrent timetabled course work and a lack of confidence in ability to perform the consultation resulted in significant drop out during the progress of the study. Integration of the service into the curriculum did not result in drop out from similar non-UK studies.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Participating students were volunteers and, therefore, self-selecting. Given that they were, on average, academically superior when compared to non-participating students, they would potentially have performed better than non-participants during a student-led consultation. Most studies do not mention this effect and any future study utilising volunteer students should recognise and allow for it.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;43</xref> The educational element of this study was not considered within this paper as this will form the focus of a future submission. The quality of medicines information given to patients affects individual's perception of whether it has met their needs and if they are satisfied with the information provided.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> It is reasonable to speculate that repetition of information over a period of years to patients with a long-term condition would have resulted in a greater understanding of and, therefore, satisfaction with information about their medicines. This may have reduced the ability to improve scores for many of the individual questions. While higher scores for SIMS is theoretically a predictor for better adherence (MARS)<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> no improvement in adherence was observed. The relatively high proportion of patients who reported using medication compliance aids prior to the intervention might have reduced the potential for the intervention to further improve adherence. Adherence, beliefs about medication, satisfaction with diabetes treatment and quality of life all displayed a change in the direction which favours the intervention, all of which support a full study going ahead. No evidence is available to definitively explain the change in blood pressure seen in the control group and reasons for this would only be speculative, but it may simply have been a chance finding. It may be more appropriate to focus the intervention on those patients with the greatest HbA1c or the lowest reported satisfaction with information or adherence, however this may affect the recruitment rate and would require careful consideration prior to implementation in a full RCT if using the results from this study for it basis.</p><p>Results demonstrate that HbA1c would appear to be a sensible primary outcome measure for a future study. A sample size of 214 patients per group (428 in total) would be required to demonstrate a 90% power. This would equate to 107 students (two patient consultations per student), which is achievable within a full RCT undertaken over more than one school of pharmacy. However, recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends the utilisation of a cardiac risk measure (QRisk2)<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44&#x02013;46</xref> which represents a compilation of clinical data. Insufficient data is available to calculate a sample size for QRisk2, therefore, the pragmatic decision would be to utilise a primary outcome measure of HbA1c with QRisk2 possibly utilised as a secondary outcome measure.</p><p>Implementation of student activity described within this study is in line with current government agenda for pharmacy education.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Evidence does not exist in the UK to support the training of undergraduate pharmacy students when undertaking activities with real patients, although examples exist outside the UK.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> This study does not provide definitive evidence for this, but does provide support for a future definitive RCT to test this hypothesis.</p><p>With a known patient recruitment rate and low dropout rate this demonstrates that if utilising the same protocol for a future RCT, not only can sufficient numbers of patients be expected to be recruited and retained. Medical practices were chosen because they all used the same software system for electronic medical records, as this would facilitate student training, however, utilising additional systems would increase the number of general practitioner practices available for recruitment. Changes may be warranted to patient selection criteria, as recruitment of patients who are not yet clinically stabilised may be more receptive to information regarding their medicines. NICE CG66<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> recommends a blood pressure target level of &#x0003c;140/80&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg for most people with type 2 diabetes, and &#x0003c;130/80&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg for those at more particular risk. The latter group includes people with raised albumin excretion rate (microalbuminuria or worse), estimated glomerular filtration rate &#x0003c;60&#x02005;mL/min/1.73&#x02005;m<sup>2</sup>, those with retinopathy, and those with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Data to enable such differentiation was not obtained within the pilot study and should be included in the design of a future definitive RCT. Provision of opportunities for students to undertake more than two consultations in future studies may demonstrate further student and patient benefit. Results provide evidence that within an RCT, sufficient patients could be expected to agree to attend for a medication-related consultation. Written appointment information may aid patient attendance and prevent the small number of patients failing to attend due to forgetfulness. Where acceptable to participants, email appointments and reminders for consultations may be effective. This pilot study confirms that the data required for evaluation of health economics is possible in a RCT. To address the rate of availability of cost and effect data, in any future study we would make every effort to ensure that baseline measures are completed prior to randomisation. The design of a definitive trial should ensure that medical practitioners receive feedback from the students to potentially increase the effectiveness of the intervention. The results from this study display good generalisation, as recruitment and the intervention followed existing scenarios where possible, however student academic ability may affect interpretation. Results support a future RCT as the intervention appeared to have the potential to improve blood glucose sugar control, quality of life and medicine information and these findings need more formal testing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks are due to the patients, medical practices and their staff, and pharmacy students who took part in the study.
