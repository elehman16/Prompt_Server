The skin around the eye is an area without many oil glands and collagen in comparison to the body rest, so it is more prone to fine lines and dehydration, which makes it look dull. The aim of this research is to develop and evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of an anti-wrinkle and dark circle eye pad consisting of 3% w/w caffeine and 1% vitamin K in a convenient, healthy, and cosmeceutical base.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Pre-emulsions containing selected ingredients in a specified effective concentration were prepared. The selected formulation, based upon pharmaceutical parameters, was coated on a nonwoven fabric in an eye counter shape, and stored in a jar.

The delicate skin in this area is extremely thin[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and contains little subcutaneous fat tissue.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>During aging, the skin cells divide more slowly, and the inner layer, called the dermis, begins to thin. Networks of the elastin and collagen fibers loosen and unravel, causing depressions on the surface.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The skin also loses its elasticity, is less able to retain moisture, oil-secreting glands are less efficient, and the skin is slower to heal. All of these contribute to the development of wrinkles.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Dark circles under the lower eyelids are another problem that can have several causes like aging, genetics, lack of sleep, and stress,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] but two of the most important ones are:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Vessel fragility: Dark under-eye circles begin in the capillaries. If the blood vessels become fragile, they can be broken easily and hemoglobin leaks out into the surrounding skin. As the hemoglobin breaks down, pigmented degradation products form and accumulate in the dermis and epidermis. This may cause a dark discoloration around the eye[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Poor circulation under eyes: Poor circulation results in less oxygenated blood, and hence, causes a bluish appearance.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Nowadays, there are a wide range of procedures and products that can effectively treat the skin around the eyes. Fine wrinkles can be treated with dermal therapies that result in the contraction of collagen or by therapies that plump up the epidermis and dermis, such as retinoic acid[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or &#x003b1;-hydroxy acids (AHA)[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Studies show that skin care products containing antioxidants can have benefits that improve skin health and help prevent aging and dark circles. Vitamins E, C, and caffeine are some important antioxidants that are used in cosmetic products.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The SkinMedica company has produced a product consisting of 15% vitamin C plus a vitamin E complex to help reduce wrinkles and fine lines around the eye.</p><p>The objective of this research work is to verify the effect of the anti-wrinkle and dark circle eye pads, consisting of 3% caffeine and vitamin K in Emu oil bases, in a single blind, randomized, placebo- controlled study.</p><p>Caffeine as a crystalline compound has vasoconstriction properties.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It stimulates the blood circulation around the eyes and also accelerates the flow of blood in the capillaries around the eyes.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This automatically makes the skin around the eye appear fresh and rejuvenated. Caffeine has antioxidant properties[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that may help reduce the risk of wrinkles and protect the skin against free radical damage.</p><p>Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The relation of Vitamin K to the circulation system (increases blood coagulation and improves circulation) has been the reason for its use as an ingredient, to reduce the vascular condition that causes skin problems such as dark circles. A study by Elson in 1999, which evaluated the use of 1% vitamin K combined with retinol 0.15% for the treatment of periorbital hyperpigmentation, demonstrated that this preparation was effective in the treatment of under-eye circles in 93% of the patients studied.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Studies have shown that Emu oil penetrates through the layer of the dermis and prevents cells from dehydration because it contains high levels of unsaturated fatty acids like linolenic and oleic acids.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It improves the structure and function of the cell membranes, as also the skin barrier function. Improving the skin barrier function reduces the transepidermal water loss, leaving the skin more hydrated. This keeps the skin cells strong and decreases the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The anti-aging effect of Emu oil was proven in a double-blind study at the Boston University School of Medicine, in 1996, by Dr. Michael Holick. According to this research, Emu oil was topically applied to the skin of mice for a two-week-long period. Finally, it was seen that the Emu oil produced a 20% increase in the growth activity of the skin of these animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Caffeine was supplied by Merk KGaA Company.

The benefit of this formulation, in comparison with other formulations, is the synergic effect of its ingredients. Emu oil is oil-compatible with the human skin lipid and can be used as an enhancer and drug carrier, to help in the permeation of caffeine and vitamin K through the skin. There are many carriers to apply over the skin such as ointments, creams, and gels, but the pad carrier is a single dose and a healthy way to apply over the eye-sensitive area.</p><p>Clinical assessment of the patients during this study revealed that there was a progressive and regular increase in the moisturization, elasticity percentage, and pigmentation content of the skin around the eyes after the application of active formulation versus before treatment. According to Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the effect of the pad on elasticity was more than its effect on hydration and pigmentation improvement. Analysis of the mean and standard deviation showed that active formulation had a consequential effect when compared with the placebo pad (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This ruled out any variables&#x02019; effect on the experiment and proved the efficacy of the active formulation.</p><p>Statistical analysis carried out by using the ANOVA and Tukey's test showed that the changes in these three criteria were not significant in seven and fourteen days after applying the active pad compared with before treatment. Also these results showed that the maximum efficacy of the pads appeared in the third week (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but there were no significant changes between the third and fourth weeks. Accordingly this result revealed that this formulation had an accumulative moisturizing, elasticity, and pigmentation effect during three weeks of its use and then a plateau situation was observed.</p><p>Improving skin hydration and elasticity was due to the Emu oil and caffeine that was used in this formulation. Emu oil penetrated the epidermis to truly hydrate and nourish the skin without clogging the pores. This helped in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, by promoting skin renewal and improving skin elasticity.</p><p>Caffeine as a powerful antioxidant helps rejuvenate the skin and improve elasticity.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] It helps to neutralize the skin damaging free radical, which can cause a breakdown of the collagen and cause wrinkles.</p><p>One study by Joseph RK and his team, in 2009, showed that caffeine cream significantly improved crow's feet wrinkles around the eyes after four weeks,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but the prepared formulation was able to treat periorbital wrinkles in three weeks. This finding proved the synergic effect of the material that was used in the formulation, especially Emu oil.</p><p>The improvement in dark circles around the eye after the application of the formulation was related to the vitamin K used in this product. Vitamin K, by strengthening the capillary walls and reducing the visibility of blood vessels through the thin skin under the eyes, can help dark circles to improve prosperity.</p><p>A gradual increase in the values of the hydration and elasticity parameters indicate that the formulation possesses anti-aging properties and improves the pigmentation value, which proves the anti-dark circle quality of this product.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study shows that the anti-wrinkle pad is effective and safe to use for the management of under eye skin wrinkles and the efficacy of this pad can be seen in three weeks.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dhanalaxmi</surname><given-names>UR</given-names></name><name><surname>Pralhad</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety of under eye cream in the treatment of under eye dark circle and pigmentation</article-title><source>J Indian Med</source><year>2009</year><volume>103</volume><fpage>115</fpage><lpage>20</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Donofrio</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Technique of periorbital lipoaugmentation</article-title><source>Dermatol Surg</source><year>2003</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>92</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12534520</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Talwar</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reduced type I and type III procollagens in photo damaged adult human skin</article-title><source>J Invest Dermatol</source><year>1995</year><volume>105</volume><fpage>285</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7543550</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakra</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Shorr</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Facial recontouring with autogenous fat</article-title><source>Facial Plast Surg</source><year>2004</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>145</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15643581</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Roh</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>TK</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>KY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of infra orbital dark circles by autologous fat transplantation: A pilot study</article-title><source>J Dermatol</source><year>2009</year><volume>160</volume><fpage>1022</fpage><lpage>5</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Obraien</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What causes dark circles under the eyes?</article-title><source>Free article directory</source><year>2010</year><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2013 Jan 26</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
