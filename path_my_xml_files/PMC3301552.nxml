Study parameters were haemodynamics, coagulation, laboratory parameters, and adverse events from induction of anaesthesia until day 3 postoperative. The treatment groups were compared descriptively by ANOVA or ANCOVA. Subgroup analyses were performed for age and dose of colloid. Predefined covariates were surgical procedure and duration, body weight, baseline value, and centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Treatment groups were well balanced with respect to demographics, age groups, and surgical procedures. The mean dose of colloid infused (HES vs HA) until 6 hours postoperative was 16 ml/kg versus 17 ml/kg. No major differences were observed for infused crystalloids (67 ml/kg [HES] versus 65 ml/kg [HA]), changes of haemodynamics (blood pressure, heart rate) and also of laboratory parameters. In both groups, platelets and Quick decreased and aPTT increased postoperative; however, they were not clinically relevant. Adverse events were reported in 80% (HES) and 78% (HA) of patients, respectively. None of the adverse events were considered as probably drug related to HES or HA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>For the first time the novel HES 130/0.4 was clinically evaluated in newborns and infants. We conclude that HES 130/0.4 was well tolerated and as safe as human albumin in paediatric surgery.</p></sec></body></article>
