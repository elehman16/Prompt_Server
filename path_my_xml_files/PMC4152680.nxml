The intragastric balloon appears attractive for a group of patients who do not respond to medical therapy and who are not surgical candidates. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are distressing adverse effects for these patients. Midazolam has been used as an antiemetic, both as a preventive or rescue medication. The study aims at studying effect of combined use of ondansetron and midazolam to decrease the PONV following intragastric balloon insertion.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The study was conducted on 54 patients presented for intragastric balloon insertion during the period between 1<sup>st</sup> of January 2012 and 31 December 2012. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups; Ondansetron group and ondansetron/midazolam group. Patients were assessed for the incidence of nausea and vomiting, nausea and vomiting score, degree of sedation and occurrence of adverse effects during the first 24 h after the operation.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Incidence of nausea and/or vomiting during the first 24 h postoperatively was 66% in the ondansetron group, while 34.5% among the ondansetron-midazolam group.

Contrary to past concepts, there is general agreement that treatment should focus on sustained 10%-15% weight loss to prevent or reduce risk of cardiovascular and other obesity-related diseases. For motivated patients who seriously attempt but fail to achieve weight loss of 5%-10% in 3-6 months, pharmacotherapy is recommended. Body mass index (BMI) is used to classify overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (BMI &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) individuals and further classify the severity of obesity to as class I (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), class II (BMI 35-39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and class III (BMI 40 &#x02265;Kg/m<sup>2)</sup>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Surgical approach is restricted to extremely or morbidly obese patients (BMI &#x0003e;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, or &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with co-morbidity) and after failure of conservative weight loss measures.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, the intermediate group of patients who do not respond to medical therapy but are not yet surgical candidates are attractive candidates for intragastric balloon insertion.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>It has been estimated that the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for all surgeries and patient populations is between 25% and 30%, while severe intractable PONV was estimated to occur among approximately 0.18% of all patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] PONV are distressing and frequent adverse effects in patients undergoing intragastric balloon insertion for weight reduction. Ganesh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported 20% early removal of the balloon due to intolerance which was defined as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or retching, while Loffredo <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported 3.3% early removal due to such intolerance.</p><p>Midazolam has been used as an antiemetic in adults and children, both as a preventive and rescue medication. It has been postulated that a possible mechanism for the antiemetic effect of benzodiazepines could be an action at the chemoreceptor trigger zone-reducing synthesis, release, and postsynaptic effect of dopamine.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The research aims at studying the effect of combined use of ondansetron and midazolam to decrease the PONV following intragastric balloon insertion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was conducted on all patients who presented for intragastric balloon insertion in the Medical Research Institute Hospital during the period between 1<sup>st</sup> of January 2012 and 31 December 2012.

Patients were randomly allocated into two groups; ondansetron group and ondansetron/midazolam group. Patients with odd hospital file numbers were included in the first group, while those with even hospital file numbers were allocated in the second group. A total of three patients were excluded from the first group due to episodes of continuous vomiting (balloon intolerance) and balloon was removed within 24 h postoperatively. Thus, the total participants were 54 patients.</p><p>The first group composed of 25 patients, who received ondansetron 8 mg, and the second group composed of 29 patients, received ondansetron 8 mg with midazolam 0.075 &#x003bc;g/kg based on ideal body weight. Anesthesia induction was conducted using fentany l 1 &#x000b5;g/kg, propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg, cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg, followed by tracheal intubation 2 min later and maintenance with propofol 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/min based on total body weight. Patients were assessed for the occurrence of nausea and vomiting, scores of nausea and vomiting (0 = no nausea, 1 = only nausea, 2 = only vomiting, 3 = nausea and vomiting), degree of sedation immediately, 30 min, and 1 h postoperatively (awake, mild, moderate, and deep) and occurrence of adverse effects during the first 24 h after the procedure.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Power of the study was calculated (using Open Epi software) to be 81.8% based on prevalence of vomiting of 86 %[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and detection of reduction in vomiting to 50% (36% reduction) at 95% level of confidence.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS system files (SPSS package version 18). The following statistical measures were used: Descriptive statistics including frequency, distribution, mean, and standard deviation were used to describe different characteristics. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to examine the normality of data distribution. Univariate analyses including: <italic>t</italic>-test was used to test the significance of results of quantitative variables.

In agreement with our results, Byon <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] compared the antiemetic effect of ramosetron alone or combined with midazolam.

They found that the incidence of nausea and vomiting significantly decreased compared to placebo. Safavi and Honrmand described the use of midazolam (35 &#x003bc;g/kg) intravenously before induction or before extubation compared to placebo. They found that indicated that midazolam 35 &#x003bc;g/kg (2 mg) given intravenously 30 min before the end of surgery was more effective in decreasing the incidence of PONV than midazolam premedication.

Sanjay and Tauro[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] compared the effect of midazolam versus ondansetron after cardiac surgery. They reported a 6% incidence of nausea and no incidence of vomiting in the midazolam group, compared with a 21% incidence of PONV in the ondansetron group. They also reported a significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) use of rescue antiemetics (21%) in the ondansetron group compared with the midazolam group.
