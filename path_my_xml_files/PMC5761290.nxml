Here, we report the long-term (3&#x02009;years) efficacy and safety of secukinumab in the MEASURE 2 study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>MEASURE 2 (NCT01649375) is a 5-year phase III, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of subcutaneous loading and maintenance dosing of secukinumab in adult subjects with active AS. Subjects were randomised to receive subcutaneous secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg, 75&#x02009;mg or placebo at baseline, weeks 1, 2 and 3 and every 4 weeks from week 4. At week 16, placebo-treated subjects were rerandomised to receive secukinumab 150/75&#x02009;mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Retention rates were high during weeks 16&#x02013;156 and were 86% and 76% for secukinumab 150 and 75&#x02009;mg, respectively. Secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg provided sustained improvements in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society ASAS 20/40 response rates at week 156 (70.1%/60.9%) compared with week 52 (74.2%/57.0%); however, there was a slight decrease for secukinumab 75&#x02009;mg (54.3%/37.0% vs 62.5%/43.2%, respectively). Sustained improvements were observed in all other end points, including Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, AS Disease Activity Score with C reactive protein inactive disease, ASAS 5/6, Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary and ASAS partial remission. Clinical benefits were observed regardless of prior exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor agents. The safety profile remained favourable and was consistent with previous reports.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study showed sustained improvement through 3 years in signs, symptoms and physical function in subjects with AS.

Subjects with active AS were randomised to receive subcutaneous secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg, 75&#x02009;mg or placebo at baseline, weeks 1, 2 and 3 and every 4 weeks from week 4. At week 16, placebo-treated subjects were re-randomised to receive subcutaneous secukinumab 150 or 75&#x02009;mg every&#x000a0;4 weeks, irrespective of the clinical response. Unblinding occurred after the week 52 analysis was performed, following which subjects continued to receive the same active dose of secukinumab as open-label treatment. After approval of a protocol amendment, any subject treated with secukinumab 75&#x02009;mg by subcutaneous injection every&#x000a0;4 weeks could be up-titrated to 150&#x02009;mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks if the investigator felt their overall therapeutic response was not fully achieved with the lower dose and that they might benefit with the higher dose.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects included in the study were aged&#x02009;&#x02265;18 years and had active AS fulfilling the Modified New York Criteria,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> with a score of 4 or higher (scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe disease activity) on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI),<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and a spinal pain score&#x02009;&#x02265;4&#x02009;cm or more on a 10&#x02009;cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (with higher numbers indicating greater disease activity), despite treatment with the maximum tolerated doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Subjects previously treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and anti-TNF agents were included with prior washout periods. Subjects were included if they had an inadequate response to an approved dose of no more than one anti-TNF agent for 3 months or more, or had experienced unacceptable adverse effects. Concomitant sulfasalazine (&#x02264;3&#x02009;g/day), methotrexate (&#x02264;25&#x02009;mg/week), prednisone or equivalent (&#x02264;10&#x02009;mg/day) and NSAIDs were permitted. Key exclusion criteria were total spinal ankylosis, evidence of infection or malignancy on chest X-ray, known HIV or hepatitis B or C infection at screening, active systemic infection within 2 weeks before baseline and previous treatment with cell-depleting therapies or biologic agents other than anti-TNF agents. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was provided by all enrolled subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>End&#x000a0;points and assessments</title><p>Subjects initially randomised to secukinumab and those who switched from placebo to secukinumab at week 16 were combined for analyses after week 52 (secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg, n=106&#x02009;and secukinumab 75&#x02009;mg, n=105). A total of 5 subjects up-titrated starting at week 140; these are included in the efficacy and safety analyses at week 156 in the treatment group they were originally randomised to. The primary end&#x000a0;point was Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society criteria (ASAS) 20 at week 16. The ASAS&#x000a0;20 response was defined as an improvement of&#x02009;&#x02265;20%&#x02009;and&#x02009;&#x02265;1&#x02009;unit (on a 10-unit scale) in at least three of the four main ASAS domains (subjects&#x02019; global assessments of disease activity, pain, physical function and inflammation) and no worsening of&#x02009;&#x02265;20%&#x02009;and&#x02009;&#x02265;1&#x02009;unit (on a 10-unit scale) in the remaining domain. The ASAS&#x000a0;20 response was measured through week 156. Other assessments included: ASAS&#x000a0;40 response; AS Disease Activity Score with C&#x000a0;reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP); ASAS&#x000a0;5/6; BASDAI;&#x02009;&#x02265;50%&#x02009;improvement in the baseline total BASDAI score (BASDAI&#x000a0;50 response); Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary (SF-36 PCS) and ASAS partial remission. The overall safety and tolerability of secukinumab was reported through week 156. Routine safety monitoring was performed; treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs are reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data on efficacy are reported as observed through week 156 by study treatment dose. Summary statistics of the categorical variable are based on observed frequencies and percentages; for continuous variables, the mean &#x000b1; SD or median (range) are used as appropriate. Analyses stratified by anti-TNF history (anti-TNF-na&#x000ef;ve vs inadequate response or intolerance to an anti-TNF agent (anti-TNF-IR)) were prespecified and reported as observed. Following week 52, subjects initially randomised to secukinumab and those who switched from placebo to secukinumab at week 16 were combined. Subjects that up-titrated were counted only in their originally randomised treatment group. For patients who discontinued during the period from week 108 to 156 (ie, current treatment period for this analysis), the end of treatment visit (ie, final assessment 4 weeks after last study treatment) was considered as week 156. Safety analyses included all subjects who received&#x02009;&#x02265;1&#x02009;dose of the study treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 219 subjects with active AS were randomised at baseline to subcutaneous secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg (n=72), 75&#x02009;mg (n=73) or placebo (n=74) (20). At week 16, 66 placebo-treated subjects were rerandomised to subcutaneous secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg or 75&#x02009;mg (eight placebo-treated subjects discontinued the study before week 16). Between week 16 and 156, subject retention rates were 86% (86/100) and 76% (76/100) for secukinumab 150 and 75&#x02009;mg, respectively. The higher discontinuation rate for 75&#x02009;mg was in part due to lack of efficacy or subject/guardian decision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar to the core trial population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>), which has been reported in detail previously.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

The safety and tolerability profile of secukinumab was consistent with previous reports; nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and diarrhoea were the most frequently reported AEs. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (per 100 patient-years) for AEs of special interest with any secukinumab dose were serious infections and infestations (1.5), Crohn&#x02019;s disease (0.6), ulcerative colitis (0.6), undifferentiated inflammatory bowel disease (0.2), <italic>Candida</italic>&#x000a0;infections (1.0) and major adverse cardiovascular events (0.6). No cases of tuberculosis reactivation, opportunistic infections or suicidality-related AEs were reported. Three deaths were reported: two in the secukinumab 75&#x02009;mg dose (one acute myocardial infarction in a man aged 60&#x02009;years before week 52; one case of respiratory arrest due to pneumonia in a man aged 77&#x02009;years between week 104 and 156), and one in the secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg dose (pneumonia, cardiac hypertrophy and dilation in a man aged 39&#x02009;years between week 104 and 156); none was suspected to be related to study treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the previously published results of the MEASURE 2 study, secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg showed significant efficacy versus placebo in the primary end&#x000a0;point, the proportion of subjects who met ASAS&#x000a0;20 response criteria at week 16 (61.1% vs 28.4%), as well as the other prespecified end&#x000a0;points (ie, ASAS&#x000a0;40 response rates, BASDAI, ASDAS-CRP inactive disease, ASAS 5/6 and SF-36 PCS), except ASAS partial remission.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Although the 75&#x02009;mg dose did show increased efficacy versus placebo at week 16 (41.1% vs 28.4% for ASAS&#x000a0;20), it did not reach statistical significance based on the hierarchical hypothesis testing that controlled for multiplicity of testing.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the present analysis, clinical improvements were sustained through week 156 across all measured end&#x000a0;points for secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg, thus supporting the long-term suitability of secukinumab for controlling the signs and symptoms of AS.</p><p>Sustained improvements were observed in subjects who switched from placebo to secukinumab, and in anti-TNF-na&#x000ef;ve and anti-TNF-IR groups through week 156. Indeed, the proportion of subjects meeting ASAS&#x000a0;40 response criteria and ASAS partial remission increased for secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg from week 52 to week 156 in both anti-TNF-na&#x000ef;ve and anti-TNF-IR groups, with higher increases for both measures in anti-TNF-IR subjects. The higher rates of increase in ASAS&#x000a0;40 and ASAS-PR in patients who were anti-TNF-IR compared with those who were anti-TNF-na&#x000ef;ve could be a result of a number of factors, including the heterogeneity of the anti-TNF-IR subpopulation; this comprised patients who previously failed anti-TNF treatment for any one of several reasons, including lack of primary or secondary efficacy, intolerance or safety concerns. These improvements in subjects in whom anti-TNF therapy had previously failed suggests that secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg could offer symptom relief for this population who are in need of an alternative therapy to anti-TNF agents.</p><p>This report confirms that secukinumab was well tolerated through 3 years of treatment, with no new safety signals or unexpected safety findings. Findings were consistent with previous studies of secukinumab for ankylosing spondylitis, including the independent MEASURE 1 trial, which reported that intravenous loading of secukinumab 150 or 75&#x02009;mg provided sustained efficacy in signs, symptoms and physical function in subjects with AS over 3 years, with no new safety concerns identified.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 19</xref> Similar sustained improvements have been seen in anti-TNF-treated patients; however, TNF-antagonists are not efficacious in some patients and have some safety concerns.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 20 21</xref> AEs through week 156 were mostly mild to moderate in severity, and primarily driven by non-serious infections.</p><p>Limitations of the current analysis include the lack of a comparator group beyond week 16 and the fact that subjects and investigators were aware that all subjects received secukinumab from week 16 onwards, which could introduce systematic bias in the reporting of results. This study was also limited in that it was not designed to identify a difference between doses or to assess differences in response according to previous anti-TNF use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Building on earlier findings, these results show sustained improvement through 3 years in signs, symptoms and physical function in subjects with AS, who remained on subcutaneous secukinumab 150&#x02009;mg. Retention rates were high and secukinumab was well tolerated with a favourable safety profile, consistent with previous reports.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing and co-ordination support was provided by Martin Wallace and John Gallagher, of Novartis, in accordance with Good Publication Practice (GPP3) guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ismpp.org/gpp3">http://www.ismpp.org/gpp3</ext-link>).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors were involved in the study design and/or collection, analysis and interpretation of the data, provided critical revision of the manuscript and approved the final version to be submitted for publication.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was funded by Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> HM-O: grant/research support from Janssen and Celgene; speaker fees from Janssen, Pfizer, AbbVie, Celgene, Novartis and UCB.
