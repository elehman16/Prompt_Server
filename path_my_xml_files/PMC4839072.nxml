Although outcomes have improved, PCNSL is still associated with inferior prognosis compared to systemic NHL. Many questions regarding the optimal therapeutic approach remain unanswered.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a randomized, open-label, international phase III trial with two parallel arms. We will recruit 250 patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL from approximately 35 centers within the networks of the German Cooperative PCNSL study group and the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group. All enrolled patients will undergo induction chemotherapy consisting of 4&#x000a0;cycles of rituximab 375&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d (days 0 &#x00026; 5), methotrexate 3.5&#x000a0;g/m<sup>2</sup> (d1), cytarabine 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;g/m<sup>2</sup>/d (d2-3), and thiotepa 30&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (d4) every 21&#x000a0;days. All patients will undergo stem-cell harvest after the second cycle. After 4&#x000a0;cycles of induction chemotherapy, patients achieving partial or complete response will be centrally randomized to 2 different consolidation treatments: (A) conventional-dose immuno chemotherapy with rituximab 375&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (d0), dexamethasone 40&#x000a0;mg/d (d1-3), etoposide 100&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d (d1-3), ifosfamide 1500&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d (d1-3) and carboplatin 300&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (d1) (R-DeVIC) or (B) high-dose chemotherapy with BCNU (or busulfan) and thiotepa followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HCT-ASCT). The objective is to demonstrate superiority of HCT-ASCT compared to R-DeVIC with respect to progression-free survival (PFS, primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), treatment response and treatment-related morbidities. Minimal follow-up after treatment completion is 24&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The rationale for consolidation treatment in PCNSL is to eliminate residual lymphoma cells and to decrease the risk for relapse. This can be achieved by agents crossing the blood brain barrier either applied at conventional doses or at high doses requiring autologous stem cell support. HCT-ASCT has been shown to be feasible and highly effective in patients with newly-diagnosed PCNSL. However, it is unclear whether HCT-ASCT is really superior compared to conventional-dose chemotherapy after an intensified antimetabolites-based immunochemotherapy in patients with newly-diagnosed PCNSL. To answer this question, we designed this investigator initiated randomized phase III trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>German clinical trials registry DRKS00005503 registered 22 April 2014 and ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02531841">NCT02531841</ext-link> registered 24 August 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12885-016-2311-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)</kwd><kwd>High-dose chemotherapy (HDT)</kwd><kwd>Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)</kwd><kwd>Conventional chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Federal Department of Education and Research (BMBF/DLR)</institution></funding-source><award-id>01KG1207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Illerhaus</surname><given-names>Gerald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) accounts for 1 to 2&#x000a0;% of all Non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphomas (NHL) and for 2 to 7&#x000a0;% of all primary CNS tumors. Its incidence has increased over the past 30&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Prognosis without treatment resembles that of systemic high-grade NHL, with a median survival of approximately 3&#x000a0;months. Although therapy has improved the outcome of patients with PCNSL, prospective clinical trials are rare compared to systemic NHL and many questions regarding the optimal therapeutic approach remain unanswered. Currently, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is considered the most efficient known cytostatic agent for PCNSL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several drugs have been combined with HD-MTX to improve outcome, but only one randomized trial demonstrated superiority of additional high-dose cytarabin (HD-AraC) compared to single agent HD-MTX treatment so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Other agents such as lomustine, procarbazine, vinca alkaloids, temozolomide and thiotepa have also been added to HD-MTX, revealing promising remission rates and acceptable toxicity profiles. A single-arm phase II trial assessing the chemotherapy combination named &#x0201c;MATILDE&#x0201d; has included thiotepa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 72&#x000a0;% and a complete remission rate (CRR) of 46&#x000a0;%, with a 5-year survival of 42&#x000a0;%. The use of thiotepa is justified by its excellent bioavailability in the CNS and its high efficacy in aggressive lymphoma and in reported trials on PCNSL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Rituximab in addition to systemic chemotherapy is the current standard for treating systemic B-cell lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. First results of the randomized phase II International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) 32 trial show a significant improvement of response, failure free survival and overall survival by the addition of rituximab to standard HD-MTX/HD-AraC. Further addition of thiotepa to HD-MTX/HD-AraC shows even further improvement, but not reaching statistical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recent trials have demonstrated that consolidating strategies with non-cross-resistant cytostatic agents in first-line therapy yield promising results in treating PCNSL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another regimen with dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide and carboplatin (DeVIC) has been applied in recurrent/refractory and in newly-diagnosed PCNSL with good results. A retrospective analysis of 21 patients with newly-diagnosed PCNSL who received DeVIC chemotherapy followed by whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) showed high efficacy with ORR to chemotherapy (DeVIC) of 95&#x000a0;% in newly-diagnosed PCNSL and 83&#x000a0;% in refractory and recurrent PCNSL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Based on experience in other hematological malignancies, such as relapsed systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and the need for effective consolidation treatment, high-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT) has also been investigated in PCNSL. The rationale for HDT-ASCT in PCNSL is to achieve therapeutic drug concentration in the CNS tissues and sanctuaries, and to overcome chemo resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In recent trials, we demonstrated a high rate of long-lasting remissions in PCNSL patients treated with HDT-ASCT, with or without WBRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a pilot and phase-II study, we treated 30 patients with PCNSL &#x02264;65&#x000a0;years with sequential induction chemotherapy including three cycles of HD-MTX, HD-AraC, and thiotepa followed by stem-cell harvest. The conditioning regimen consisted of carmustine and thiotepa followed by ASCT; WBRT was given as consolidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Twenty-three of the 30 patients proceeded to HDT-ASCT resulting in complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) in 15 and 8 patients, respectively. With a median follow-up of 63&#x000a0;months, the 5-year OS was 69&#x000a0;% for all patients and 87&#x000a0;% for those completing HDT-ASCT. In a further trial, induction chemotherapy has been intensified, thiotepa dose was doubled, and only those patients not achieving CR after induction therapy underwent WBRT (&#x0201c;Freiburg Protocol&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Seven of 11 patients were in CR following ASCT, and three in PR underwent post-ASCT radiotherapy. After a median follow-up of 25&#x000a0;months, 3-year OS was 77&#x000a0;%. None of the patients suffered from severe neurotoxicity during the follow-up period. Both trials have suggested a curative potential of HDT-ASCT in young PCNSL patients. This concept, supplemented by rituximab immunotherapy, was evaluated in a phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00647049). Preliminary results revealed an ORR of 91&#x000a0;% (77&#x000a0;% CR and 14&#x000a0;% PR) for patients treated with HDT-ASCT (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;73) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. After a median follow-up of 35&#x000a0;months, the 3-year OS was 77.6&#x000a0;% for all patients and 87.1&#x000a0;% for patients after HDT-ASCT. In light of these findings, we initiated an ongoing international randomized phase-II trial in collaboration with the IELSG. This trial has 2 randomizations: in the 1<sup>st</sup> randomization patients are allocated to primary chemotherapy with HD-MTX and HD-Ara-C with or without thiotepa, and with or without rituximab. The second randomization allocates to consolidation therapy with WBRT vs. HDT-ASCT (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01011920). In this trial, we aim to determine the best induction treatment as well as the superiority of HDT-ASCT or WBRT (the current standard for consolidation after HD-MTX-based systemic treatment) as consolidation treatment. First results of the randomized phase II IELS32 trial show that the addition of thiotepa and rituximab to MTX and Ara-C is associated with significantly improved CRR and ORR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The efficacy of HDT-ASCT has been shown in several phase II trials in PCNSL patients, both as upfront and salvage therapy, and has yielded promising results concerning response and survival rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, as there have been no randomized trials demonstrating a benefit of this concept over conventional optimized combination chemotherapy, we designed the MATRix trial to determine whether HDT-ASCT is superior to conventional-dose chemoimmunotherapy (R-DeVIC) as consolidation after intensified induction treatment in patients with newly-diagnosed PCNSL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, international phase III trial with 2 parallel arms comparing HDT-ASCT with conventional chemotherapy for consolidation in newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma.

Response assessment by brain MRI will be done after the second and fourth course and on day 60 after randomization. After the end of treatment, disease status will be assessed every 3&#x000a0;months during the first 2&#x000a0;years, every 6&#x000a0;months during the following 3&#x000a0;years, and annually thereafter. The trial flow chart indicating the assessments during the trial and the follow up period is given as appendix of the SPIRIT checklist in the Supplemental Material (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p>Tumor size, location(s) (only at screening and in case of PD) and manifestation (singular/multiple; only at screening) will be evaluated at the aforementioned time points. In case of multiple tumors, one reference tumor will be measured, the response being evaluated by comparison to the screening MRI. Response evaluation during the trial will be determined by an independent radiological review committee not involved in the study design and blinded to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>Sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint PFS. We are assuming that the PFS rate for patients treated with the conventional intervention (arm A, R-DeVIC) is approximately 50&#x000a0;% after 3&#x000a0;years. To compare the two treatment groups, a hazard ratio of 1.8 of the conventional intervention (R-DeVIC) versus the HCT-ASCT (arm B) is considered clinically relevant. This corresponds to a PFS rate after 3&#x000a0;years of 68&#x000a0;% in the HCT-ASCT group (arm B). To detect a difference between arms A and B with a power of 80&#x000a0;% at a two-sided significance level of 5&#x000a0;% under this assumption 92 PFS defining events are required. Assuming an exponential model for survival, an accrual period of 3&#x000a0;years and an additional follow-up time of 2&#x000a0;years, we will need to enroll at least 200 patients. With an expected drop-out of 10&#x000a0;%, 220 patients will be randomized. Furthermore, we anticipate that some patients (about 10&#x000a0;%) will fail to achieve complete or partial remission during the first 4 chemotherapy cycles and will not be randomized. We therefore assume we will have to include approximately 250 patients in the study (start induction treatment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle and will therefore be based on the full analysis set (FAS). The FAS includes all randomized patients in whom therapy after randomization was started, and patients are analyzed as belonging to their randomized arm, regardless of whether they refused or discontinued therapy, or whether other protocol deviations are known. Patients will be censored at the time of last follow-up provided no event of interest has occurred so that as many patients as possible can be included in the analysis.</p><p>The primary endpoint PFS will be analyzed with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, containing the randomized treatment as explanatory variable adjusted for the stratification variable response status. The test of the primary hypothesis (null hypothesis: equality of PFS rates) will be conducted within this model. The treatment effect will be described by the estimated hazard ratio from this model and will be presented with a two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the value 1 is not contained in the two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval for the hazard ratio describing the relation between treatment groups. Additionally, the PFS rates will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</p><p>The endpoint OS will be analyzed in the same way as described for PFS. The endpoint CR rate will be analyzed as the dependent variable of a logistic regression model with treatment assignment as independent variable. The endpoint response duration will be estimated with a Cox-regression model. Death without former progression will be analyzed as competing event. The regression models allow the inclusion of further potentially important prognostic factors. Details will be determined in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) to be finalized before the analysis starts. For the evaluation of CR on day 60 after randomization, patients not completing therapy will be counted as non-responders. With respect to the endpoint QOL, the treatment groups will be compared descriptively according to the EORTC manual. All p-values from analyses of secondary endpoints will be interpreted in a descriptive sense.</p><p>Further descriptive analyses will consider all patients included in the trial, i.e. data from start of induction therapy with Rituximab, HD-MTX, HD-Ara-C, and thiotepa will be analyzed. We will analyze PFS and OS starting at registration for all patients, and we will consider three groups (two treatment arms, not randomized).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>Subgroup analyses will be conducted based on response status (CR versus PR) as evaluated by contrast enhanced MRI at the time of randomization. Of note, response status is a stratification factor, thus the number of patients with either CR or PR between the two arms will very likely be balanced.</p><p>We hypothesize that particularly those patients with PR will benefit more from the more aggressive approach HDT-ASCT than patients with CR, because patients who do not respond completely after 4&#x000a0;cycles of conventional chemotherapy might be suffering from a lymphoma that is more resistant to conventional chemotherapy than the lymphomas in those patients who had already achieved a complete response. Therefore, the response status can be considered as a surrogate for a certain lymphoma biology that tends to be more aggressive, something not yet well understood.</p><p>We will estimate these subgroup effects for PFS and OS using Cox regression analyses including the following variables in the models: treatment allocation and response status at randomization. An appropriate interaction term (treatment allocation*response status) will be added to the model. We will illustrate subgroup effects using forest plots and provide the P value for the interaction test. Whether the number of events (around 7 per variable) suffices to designate OS will have to be seen. If not, we will conduct the subgroup analyses only for PFS. Based on the IELSG risk score, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] we will evaluate the prognostic impact (PFS and OS) of the following baseline variables at the time of study inclusion before starting any chemotherapy: age (as continuous variable), performance score (ECOG 0&#x02013;1 versus ECOG &#x0003e;1), liquor-protein elevation (yes versus no), involvement of deep-brain structures (yes versus no), and elevated serum LDH (yes versus no). We will use Cox regression analyses without variable selection procedures to explore these risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Quality assurance and safety</title><p>Our study data will be managed using the DAMAST Version 9.2, a proprietary data management system based on the software package SAS&#x000ae;, which has been developed, validated and is maintained by the Clinical Trials Unit Freiburg (CTU).

The underlying principles for the DMC are the patients' ethical and safety aspects.

Current treatment strategies have improved survival and shown curative potential in a considerable number of patients. Similar to other hematological diseases, the rationale for consolidation in PCNSL is to eliminate minimal residual disease. There is evidence that HDT-ASCT with carmustine or busulfan and thiotepa is feasible and highly effective both in patients with newly-diagnosed and relapsed PCNSL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The rationale behind the impact of HDT-ASCT in PCNSL is the delivery of blood brain barrier (BBB) penetrating agents into the CNS at several-fold higher concentrations than conventional therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The efficacy of HDT-ASCT has been investigated in several phase II trials for primary, relapsed, or refractory PCNSL, revealing promising response and survival rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, although urgently needed, there have been no randomized trials demonstrating this concept&#x02019;s superiority to optimized, conventional-dose polychemotherapy. The question we now aim to answer is whether HDT-ASCT is superior to conventional therapy as consolidation after intensified immunochemotherapy in patients with newly-diagnosed PCNSL. Quality assurance will be acquired by independent radiological and pathologic review committees not involved in the study&#x02019;s conception as well as by a blinded data review undertaken after the end of the recruitment period and the planned follow-up period. Therefore our study follows high-level methodological standards.</p><p>We have been chosen the DeVIC combination chemotherapy regimen for conventional consolidation, because its components cross the BBB and consist of multidrug resistant-unrelated agents. HD-MTX-based induction chemotherapy has been optimized over the past years. An international randomized phase-II-trial was recently conducted in collaboration with the IELSG to determine both the best induction treatment and the superiority of HDT-ASCT over WBRT as consolidation treatment. Apart from the expected hematological toxicity, the preliminary data have revealed good tolerability and efficacy of the combination of rituximab, HD-MTX, HD-Ara-C and thiotepa (MATRIX regimen) as induction regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In comparison to the IELSG32 trial, the induction treatment schedule was modified by administering rituximab on day 0 and +5. We assume that the application of two doses of rituximab&#x02014;one before and one after chemotherapy - results in a superior intracerebral concentration compared to bi-weekly dosing.</p><p>Results of the MATRix trial are expected to provide high-level evidence with regard to the best consolidation treatment in newly diagnosed PCNSL.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12885_2016_2311_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>List of ethics committees.
