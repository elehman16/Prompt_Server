Insulin therapy remains the most efficacious glucose-lowering treatment option for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) when lifestyle modifications and metformin fail to achieve recommended glycemic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Based on their pharmacodynamic action profiles, NPH insulin and current basal insulin analogs are injected at the same time each day to ensure optimal biological action and consistent glycemic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Strict dosing schedules required for current insulin products might be difficult to maintain, which may affect glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). On average, adherence to insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes is low (&#x0223c;70%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Although this is a clearly recognized issue for patients using prandial insulin coverage, it is also a relevant issue for those administering basal insulin. A recent study showed that &#x0223c;50% of patients with type 2 diabetes had intentionally missed a basal insulin injection, with 22% reporting that they had missed a dose in the previous 30 days (mean of three doses) and 24% reporting that they had mistimed an injection by &#x0003e;2 h (mean of 4.2 occasions) in the last month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). One reason for insulin omission/nonadherence cited frequently by patients is that injections interfere with daily activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Accordingly, an insulin preparation that allows a more flexible dosing schedule, while maintaining consistent glycemic effects, might benefit patients requiring exogenous insulin replacement.</p><p>Insulin degludec (IDeg) is an ultra-long-acting basal insulin analog that forms a soluble depot of multihexamers after subcutaneous injection, with subsequent slow release of monomers into the circulation. It has a long half-life (&#x0223c;25 h) and a consistent glucose-lowering effect of &#x0003e;42 h at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Given these attributes, we reasoned that it should be possible to vary the time of day at which once-daily injections of IDeg are given without impacting glycemic control or safety, thereby allowing for greater flexibility in the timing of injections.</p><p>The principal aim of this 26-week, phase 3 trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily IDeg given in a prespecified, &#x0201c;forced,&#x0201d; rotating morning-and-evening dosing regimen to create 8&#x02013;40-h intervals between injections, with that of insulin glargine (IGlar) dosed at the same time each day (i.e., according to label) as well as IDeg given at the same time each day. Dosing intervals of 8&#x02013;40 h were chosen for IDeg because these were considered to reflect the potential extreme ranges in once-daily basal insulin dosing that patients might encounter when routines are disrupted by everyday life.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This phase 3, 26-week, randomized, controlled, open-label, three-arm, parallel-group trial was conducted at 69 sites in 14 countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1668/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>) between November 2009 and September 2010.

Hypoglycemia rates were also comparable for IDeg OD Flex and IDeg OD, both in terms of overall confirmed hypoglycemia (IDeg OD Flex/IDeg OD RR 1.10 [0.79&#x02013;1.52], <italic>P</italic> = NS) and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia (RR 1.18 [0.66&#x02013;2.12], <italic>P</italic> = NS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of hypoglycemic episodes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="858tbl2"/></table-wrap><p>No obvious differences were observed between treatment groups in physical examination findings, vital signs, standard laboratory analysis (hematology and biochemistry), fundoscopy, or electrocardiogram.</p><p>Overall AE rates were similar across treatment groups, as were rates of AEs considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to investigational product (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1668/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 7</ext-link> for a summary of AE and serious AE [SAE] rates). The majority of AEs (&#x0003e;95%) were mild or moderate in severity, and no apparent treatment group&#x02013;specific patterns or clustering were observed (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1668/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 8</ext-link> for most frequent AEs). Two participants died during the trial: one in the IDeg OD group (anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) and one in the IGlar OD group (cause of death unknown; no autopsy was permitted by relatives). Both deaths were considered by the investigator to be unlikely related to the investigational product.</p><p>A low proportion of participants reported injection site reactions in the IDeg OD Flex (1.3%), IDeg OD (3.5%), and IGlar OD (1.7%) treatment groups.</p><p>Levels of IDeg- and IGlar-specific antibodies remained close to zero during the trial. No clinically relevant increases (from baseline to week 27) in the concentration of antibodies cross-reacting between IDeg and human insulin were observed for participants receiving insulin treatment prestudy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1668/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 9</ext-link>) or who were previously insulin na&#x000ef;ve (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1668/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 10</ext-link>). Overall, a similar number of participants in each treatment group had a change in cross-reacting antibody levels of &#x02265;10% bound/total during the trial (9, 8, and 16 participants in the IDeg OD Flex, IDeg OD, and IGlar OD groups, respectively). There was no apparent association between the development of cross-reacting antibodies and hypoglycemia, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, or insulin dose in any of the treatment groups (data not shown).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s8"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This 26-week, phase 3, treat-to-target trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes was designed to test extreme intervals for basal insulin administration with once-daily doses of IDeg, using a forced dosing schedule that created alternating short (8&#x02013;12 h) and long (36&#x02013;40 h) intervals between doses. This rotating dosing regimen (IDeg OD Flex) is clearly not intended for clinical practice; rather, it was used to explore (from an efficacy and safety perspective) the impact of variable timing of basal insulin administration that might be encountered by patients with changing schedules. The trial population encompassed a broad range of individuals who were likely to benefit from either insulin initiation or intensification.</p><p>Overall, variable dosing intervals for insulin degludec (IDeg OD Flex) resulted in similar glycemic control, hypoglycemia risk, and weight gain to fixed dosing intervals for either IGlar (IGlar OD) or itself (IDeg OD). The lower FPG level found for IDeg OD Flex compared with IGlar OD did not come at the expense of a higher incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Indeed, IDeg OD Flex was associated with a nonsignificant 23% numerically lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia than IGlar OD, consistent with findings from other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Because rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia were similar for IDeg OD Flex and IGlar OD, regardless of whether IDeg was dosed in the morning or evening, the lower overall rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia associated with IDeg Flex is thought to be due to the more consistent pharmacokinetic profile of IDeg relative to IGlar, as well as lower day-to-day and hour-to-hour pharmacodynamic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The overall safety profiles of the IDeg OD Flex, IGlar OD, and IDeg OD groups were comparable; no clinically relevant differences were found with respect to standard safety assessments, and there were no apparent group-specific patterns or clustering of AEs. Notably, no AEs of hyperglycemia, a possible consequence of insufficient insulin coverage, were reported for IDeg when administered at intervals of up to 40 h.</p><p>Given the use of different insulin delivery systems and the complexity of the IDeg OD Flex dosing regimen, a blinded, double-dummy trial design was impractical. Consequently, it cannot be ruled out that the open-label design used in this study may have influenced efforts by participants and investigators to attain the target blood glucose level and, possibly, influenced the reporting of hypoglycemia and AEs, although presumably less so between the two IDeg arms. To minimize potential reporting bias for hypoglycemia, we used confirmed hypoglycemia (plasma glucose &#x0003c;3.1 mmol/L or severe episodes requiring assistance) instead of symptoms alone to compare rates between treatment groups. As in any open-label trial, there may have been greater caution in adjusting doses of the new drug (IDeg), but this was not reflected by median times taken to first achieve the prebreakfast SMPG titration target or the proportion of patients reaching HbA<sub>1c</sub> goals at the end of the trial when compared with IGlar. It could be argued that the trial should have included a fourth treatment arm where IGlar was tested in the same rotating dosing regimen as the IDeg OD Flex arm. However, because IGlar is only approved for dosing at the same time each day, we considered such off-label use inappropriate and unlikely to be approved by local ethics committees and institutional review boards.</p><p>In conclusion, the results from this trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes demonstrate that it is possible to vary the time of day at which once-daily injections of the ultra-long-acting basal insulin IDeg are given from one day to the next without compromising glycemic control or increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. It is recommended that, when possible, IDeg should be administered at a similar time each day. However, on those occasions when consistent timing of insulin administration is not possible or is impractical, the flexibility afforded by IDeg will still allow for appropriate basal insulin coverage, without negatively impacting blood glucose control, further facilitating insulin administration and potentially improving treatment compliance.</p></sec>
