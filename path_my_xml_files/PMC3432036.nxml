Even so, adolescents are not inclined to seek professional help for emotional problems. Internet-based preventive interventions have been suggested as a feasible method of providing appropriate care to adolescents with internalizing symptoms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of preventive Internet-based (guided) self-help problem-solving therapy (PST) for adolescents reporting mild to moderate symptoms of depression and/or anxiety as compared to a waiting list control group (WL).</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>A total of 45 participants were randomized to the 2 conditions. PST consisted of 5 weekly lessons. Participants were supported by e-mail. Self-report measures of depression and anxiety were filled in at baseline and after 3 weeks, 5 weeks, and 4 months. Of the 45 participants, 28 (62.2%) completed questionnaires after 3 weeks, 28 (62.2%) after 5 weeks, and 27 (60%) after 4 months. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed overall improvement over time for both groups on depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, no significant group x time interactions were found. No differences were found between completers and non-completers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> show that depressive and anxiety symptoms declined in both groups. No support was found, however, for the assumption that Internet-based PST was efficacious in reducing depression and anxiety in comparison to the waiting list control group. This finding could represent lack of power.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Netherlands Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1322">NTR1322</ext-link>

Internet-based interventions, however, may enable treatment consideration and participation. Adolescents are particularly comfortable interacting within the computer environment <xref rid="pone.0043485-Abeles1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and Internet-based interventions may reduce stigma, maximize autonomy, save travelling time, provide low cost access, reduce waiting-lists, abolish the need to schedule appointments with a therapist, and reduce objections like lack of willingness to talk to a stranger about personal problems <xref rid="pone.0043485-Cuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043485-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Studies on adolescent Internet-based interventions for depression or anxiety are scarce (see <xref rid="pone.0043485-Abeles1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043485-Calear1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043485-Cunningham1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>) and the effectiveness of merely two programs was examined in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) <xref rid="pone.0043485-OKearney1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043485-OKearney2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043485-VanderZanden1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These concern a five session cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) based intervention program (MoodGYM) in preventing and reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety in an adolescent school-based population, and a six session guided CBT group course (Master Your Mood) for adolescents aged 16 to 25 years with depressive symptoms. Previous controlled pilot trials of the MoodGYM intervention in two private single-sex schools demonstrated benefits on self-reported depression for adolescent boys who completed more modules <xref rid="pone.0043485-OKearney1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and for girls at follow-up <xref rid="pone.0043485-OKearney2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A previous study with a more diverse sample reported decreases in anxiety symptoms for the total sample and decreases in depression for males only <xref rid="pone.0043485-Calear1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The online group course Master Your Mood was effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and in increasing mastery in young people <xref rid="pone.0043485-VanderZanden1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>As far as we know, there is no study which evaluates Internet-based problem-solving therapy (PST) for adolescents. PST is aimed at determining the major goals in life, investing energy only in those problems that are related to what matters and learning to accept those situations that cannot be changed, with problem-solving skills as the core element of this approach <xref rid="pone.0043485-Cuijpers2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043485-VanStraten1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Face-to-face problem-solving therapy has been found to be effective in a variety of problem areas <xref rid="pone.0043485-Cuijpers2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043485-Malouff1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and given high comorbidity and shared risk factors of depression and anxiety <xref rid="pone.0043485-VanLang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, the provision of an intervention that can concurrently decrease depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents would be appealing. A PST-based intervention that could be applied through the Internet was developed and studied in an adult population <xref rid="pone.0043485-VanStraten1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The intervention was successful in reducing adults' symptoms of depression, anxiety, and work related stress, and was consequently adapted for adolescents. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effects of preventive Internet-based PST for adolescents reporting mild to moderate symptoms of depression and/or anxiety as compared to a waiting list control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043485.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043485.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited through press releases, banners and advertisements on the Internet, advertisements in magazines, referral by school-doctors, through brochures and posters in schools, and through information to parents who are treated in mental health care institutions for depression and anxiety. Recruitment took place from January 2009 to May 2011. After application through a website, applicants received a brochure about this study and an informed consent form by email. If adolescents were younger than 18 years of age, parents received a brochure and an informed consent form by regular mail after application by the adolescent. Adolescents aged 17 years or younger needed parental consent for study participation. After receiving informed consent, adolescents received the baseline questionnaire by email.</p><p>To be included, applicants had to report mild to moderate depressive and/or anxiety symptoms (there was no lower limit for entering the study) and have sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language, access to the Internet, and an email address. At first, adolescents aged 12 to 18 years with depressive and/or anxiety symptoms were found eligible for this study. It was difficult to include adolescents in the study. Inasmuch as we had strong indications that parental consent requirements often withheld adolescents from participating <xref rid="pone.0043485-Hoek1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and because older adolescents showed interest in our intervention, the upper age limit was altered during the study and adolescents aged 19 to 21 years were also included from April 2010. Adolescents were excluded from the study if they were younger than 18 years of age and had no parental permission, were receiving other psychological treatment for mental health problems, had severe depressive symptoms (defined as a score above 40 on the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale; CES-D <xref rid="pone.0043485-Radloff1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>), had severe anxiety symptoms (indicated by a score above 14 on the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS-A <xref rid="pone.0043485-Zigmond1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>), and/or had prominent suicide ideation (indicated by a score above 1 on the suicide item of the Beck Depression Inventory-II; BDI-II <xref rid="pone.0043485-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>). Respondents who were excluded due to the presence of severe symptoms received a telephone call in which they were advised to consult their general practitioner. If younger than 18 years, their parents were also informed by telephone. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. For a detailed description of the study and intervention we refer to the study protocol <xref rid="pone.0043485-Hoek2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>The PST intervention was web-based and participants were provided with a username and password to access the website. Every week an automated email was sent to participants to explain the contents and exercises for the coming week. Mental health care professionals and the authors (WH, JS) offered feedback on the completed exercises. This feedback was not therapeutic but was directed at mastering the proposed problem-solving strategies. PST consisted of three steps. First, respondents described what really mattered to them. Second, they wrote down their current worries and problems, and they divided these problems into three categories: (a) unimportant problems, (b) solvable problems, (c) problems which cannot be solved. For each of these three types of problems a different strategy was proposed to solve the problems or to learn to cope with the unimportant and unsolvable ones. This step is the most important element of PST. For the solvable problems, we proposed the following six-step procedure: (1) write a clear definition of the problem, (2) generate multiple solutions to the problem, (3) select the best solution, (4) work out a systematic plan for this solution, (5) carry out the solution, and (6) evaluate as to whether the solution has resolved the problem. During the third and last step, the respondents made a plan for the future in which they described how they would try to accomplish those things that matter most to them. The course took 5 weeks and consisted of one lesson a week.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial with two groups: an Internet-based guided self-help intervention (PST) and a waiting list control group (WL).

Internet-based PST was compared to a waiting list control group and intervention effects were investigated over 4 months. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> show that depressive and anxiety symptoms declined in both groups. However, no support was found for the effects of Internet-based PST in reducing depression and anxiety in comparison to the waiting list control group, but the small sample size and high drop-out rate precluded meaningful interpretation of this finding.</p><p>Previous research into the problem-solving treatment with an adult population has found that the program obtains significant effects <xref rid="pone.0043485-VanStraten1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043485-Warmerdam1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Several explanations may be considered for not finding any additional effect of PST above usual care for our adolescent population. One reason for the lack of effects in this study is that our intervention was not implemented precisely in the way it was intended due to website problems. That is, the website content was not presented in an optimally format which could have caused difficulties for adolescents in understanding and working through the intervention. Moreover, the intervention may have lacked sufficient guidance and email support for some participants because of technical difficulties in the email support module. Six participants have encountered delayed feedback. Both suppositions are supported by satisfaction reports and may have impacted completion status. The level of completers in our study (27%) was relatively low compared to adult studies into web-based self-help <xref rid="pone.0043485-Warmerdam1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043485-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Differences in depression and anxiety outcomes between completers and non-completers were not found, however.</p><p>Another reason for the non-significant findings here may be reduced appropriateness of our intervention for this age group. The self-help and individual format of our intervention requires extensive self-discipline and motivation, and this may be too informal in nature for treatment of adolescents. Also, depression impacts on individuals' motivation and their ability to concentrate in a self-directed format <xref rid="pone.0043485-OKearney2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It is also possible that PST may not be attractive enough for adolescents, or the intervention may have been of too high difficulty or of insufficient duration for problem solving skills to become internalized to produce lasting effects.</p><p>A different possible reason for the lack of effects may be participants' severity of symptom levels at baseline. To illustrate, most adolescents reported clinically significant levels of depression or anxiety and several had encountered a mood or anxiety disorder in the past 12 months. Possibly, the PST intervention is not suitable for adolescents with more severe symptoms.</p><p>Finally, we should note that participants in the waiting list control condition may have attended other treatments during the study, possibly affecting our results. Two out of 11 waiting-list participants received other treatment. Although it is not clear to what extent this may have affected the results, our results are vulnerable to many influences considering our small sample size.</p><p>The present study has a number of significant strengths. The study is one of only a small number of randomized controlled trials to date into web-based interventions for adolescents with depression and anxiety. The intervention being examined required minimal training of therapists and was relatively cheap to administer, thereby increasing the probability that the intervention would be sustained and distributed within mental health care services. Moreover, reliable and valid measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms were used, recruitment was widespread, and diagnostic status at baseline was assessed. However, limitations should be noted. First, the sample size was very small and questions could be raised about the representativeness of the sample and the generalizability of our findings to the wider population. Specifically, immigrants were fairly underrepresented among participants, and we predominantly excluded early and middle adolescents who were reluctant to request parental consent. It is likely that participants differed in other important ways from those who did not sign up for the study. Second, in common with many other online interventions <xref rid="pone.0043485-Eysenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, we were faced with a high attrition rate, possibly due to adolescents losing interest in participating in the study. Another possible limitation is the use of a wait-list control group in that it is unclear whether the prospect of receiving an intervention within a couple of months could have influenced results. A final limitation is that demand characteristics, such as receiving a telephone call when reporting possible severe depressive or anxiety symptoms, may have affected participant responses to the questionnaires.</p><p>Overall, the results of this study do not provide support for the use and implementation of an Internet-based problem-solving therapy for adolescents with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Several explanations for this lack of effect may be provided. In general, this study may have had inadequate power to demonstrate effects and further research is needed to establish whether web-based PST will be effective in adolescents if adapted or aimed at a specific subgroup of adolescents. More research is required to ascertain what intervention content, amount, timing, and duration of delivery is most effective and for which group of adolescents <xref rid="pone.0043485-Spence1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, as well as the potential of Internet-based interventions for adolescents with internalizing symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043485.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
