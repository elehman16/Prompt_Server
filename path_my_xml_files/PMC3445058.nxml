Krupp et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941738110366840">19</xref></sup> recommended a progression from side-lying active shoulder flexion to supine active reaching to progressive upright reaching as a way to achieve upright active elevation following a biceps tenodesis or tenotomy.

It appears that these studies logically assumed that gravity-minimized elevation exercises should be less demanding than upright-assisted elevation exercises on the shoulder girdle muscles. No study has measured muscular activity with electromyography (EMG) to evaluate this effect of subdividing AAROM elevation exercises into gravity-minimized and assisted elevation. There is an assumption of increased muscular demand based on a biomechanical rationale but no empirical data to document the magnitude of change during this exercise progression.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the EMG activity of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and anterior deltoid during active-assistive forward elevation exercises to determine if subdivisions of active-assistive exercise exist. We hypothesize that upright-assisted exercises will generate more EMG activity in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and anterior deltoid than that of gravity-minimized exercises. Secondarily, compared with all the AAROM exercises, upright active forward elevation will generate more EMG activity in these same muscles.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section1-1941738110366840"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section2-1941738110366840"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifteen participants volunteered for the study: 7 women and 8 men (mean age, 23.9 years; range, 22 to 28; height, 173.4 &#x000b1; 10.6 cm; weight, 74.4 &#x000b1; 15.9 kg).

For this study, we defined gravity-minimized elevation exercise as any exercise in which (1) gravity provides assistance to the participant to complete the concentric portion of the exercise or (2) the primary movement is perpendicular to gravity with the weight of the arm supported. In this study, gravity-minimized exercises included dusting center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941738110366840">Figure 1</xref>), dusting medial and lateral, side-lying elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1941738110366840">Figure 2</xref>), and supine forward elevation with elastic resistance from 90&#x000b0; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1941738110366840">Figure 3</xref>). The second type of elevation exercise, upright assisted, is any exercise performed in the upright position that elevates the arm against gravity during the concentric phase of motion with assistance. In this study, assistance was provided (1) by the hand being supported by an object during movement or (2) by the hand moving on an object. Upright-assisted elevation exercises included the rope and pulley, wall walk, ball roll, standing T-bar active-assistive forward elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1941738110366840">Figure 4</xref>), and standing T-bar assistive elevation with active lowering.

Gravity-minimized elevation exercises provide minimal resistance to the forward elevation movement and are typically performed supine (to decrease the lever arm) or side lying (to support the weight of the arm).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941738110366840">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941738110366840">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941738110366840">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941738110366840">22</xref></sup> Inclined active exercise or upright-assisted elevation exercises increase gravity&#x02019;s resistance to the forward elevation by positioning the patient in more upright positions and are theorized to be less demanding than fully upright active elevation exercise because of the reduced gravitational resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941738110366840">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941738110366840">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941738110366840">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941738110366840">22</xref></sup> Before this study, the assumption of increased demand was based on the biomechanical rationale&#x02014;namely, that assisted movement directly against gravity would be more demanding than movement in a gravity-minimized position&#x02014;but without empirical data to document the magnitude of muscular activity change between these exercise types.</p><p>Although the average maximal EMG activity level reflects a gradual progression, beginning with gravity-minimized and progressing to upright-assisted elevation exercises for both the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus, a strong distinction between the 2 exercise types for both muscles was not found. Post hoc analysis revealed statistically significant differences between only selected exercises (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1941738110366840">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1941738110366840">3</xref>) and a large overlap in the 95% confidence interval; therefore, our hypothesis was rejected that upright-assisted elevation exercises generate more EMG activity than that of gravity-minimized exercises for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus.</p><p>For protection of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, it appears that a subdivision of AAROM elevation exercises into gravity-minimized exercises and upright-assisted elevation exercises is not necessary. Therefore, progression of exercise should be based on other factors, such as available range of motion, pain tolerance, and presence of substitution patterns. Because a clear distinction between gravity-minimized and upright-assisted elevation exercise was found for the anterior deltoid, subdivision of these AAROM exercise types is warranted in the rare situations where deltoid protection is necessary, such as an open rotator cuff repair or deltoidplasty.</p><p>The current study identified 2 exercises worthy of further comment. The wall walk, which is commonly prescribed to gain active and passive elevation, was found to generate more EMG activity than that of all gravity-minimized AAROM exercises for the anterior deltoid and supraspinatus. The EMG data suggest that it should not be considered a passive range of motion exercise and that it is most appropriately used late in the AAROM progression. The &#x0201c;supine forward elevation with elastic resistance&#x0201d; exercise generated comparable EMG activity as the other gravity-minimized exercises and the passive elevation exercises reported by Dockery et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941738110366840">11</xref></sup> The current study&#x02019;s results suggest that this resistance exercise is similar to a beginning AAROM exercise and highlights the importance of body positioning in determining muscle activity for lower level forward elevation.</p><p>This study&#x02019;s results are limited in their interpretation because no direct relationship has been established between dynamic EMG activity and tension in the respective musculotendinous structures. Only in isometric contractions has a moderate correlation been found between muscle tension and EMG activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941738110366840">4</xref></sup> All surface EMG research is subject to cross-talk from surrounding musculature, and the possibility of other muscular activity may have contributed to the electrical signal recorded. This was minimized by using small electrodes with a 2-cm interelectrode distance near the midsection of the muscles studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941738110366840">3</xref></sup> Indwelling EMG data do not depict the muscular activation of the entire muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941738110366840">17</xref></sup> Therefore, the indwelling and surface EMG data were analyzed and reported separately.</p><p>The results are also limited owing to a study population of healthy young participants instead of older participants with shoulder girdle pathology. The EMG amplitudes and activation patterns during particular motions may be altered by the effect of pain or altered movement patterns because of range of motion restrictions in a patient population. Previous EMG studies have used similar populations in making recommendations for shoulder exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941738110366840">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941738110366840">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941738110366840">27</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, a clear distinction in EMG activity level between active elevation and both types of assistive elevation exercise was found for the supraspinatus and anterior deltoid but not for the infraspinatus. In comparing EMG activity levels for gravity-minimized exercises and upright-assisted elevation exercises, a clear distinction between exercise types was found for only the anterior deltoid. No widespread differences were observed for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The results of this study do not support the biomechanical rationale of assumed increased muscle demand to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus with AAROM elevation exercises that progressively exercise the arm against gravity. It appears that subdividing AAROM elevation exercises based on muscle activity is not necessary to protect the supraspinatus or infraspinatus.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>One or more authors has declared a potential conflict of interest: This research was supported in part by a grant from the McCluskey Education and Research Foundation.
