Approval in schizophrenia was based on two acute trials in which brexpiprazole was well tolerated and showed a clinically meaningful improvement vs placebo. The present paper complements this short-term evidence by presenting results from the first long-term, controlled, clinical trial of brexpiprazole as a maintenance treatment for schizophrenia. Brexpiprazole was found to be an efficacious maintenance therapy over the course of 1 year, reducing the risk of impending relapse by 71% vs placebo, and with an incidence of adverse events that was comparable to placebo. Furthermore, the trial assessed changes in social functioning and cognitive ability with brexpiprazole treatment. Overall, this paper suggests that brexpiprazole is a beneficial maintenance treatment for patients with schizophrenia who are stabilized on brexpiprazole.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a median lifetime morbid risk of about 7 individuals per 1000 (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">McGrath et al., 2008</xref>). Following successful treatment of an acute episode of schizophrenia, treatment guidelines state that prevention of relapse is an important long-term treatment goal (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Lehman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Hasan et al., 2013</xref>). Relapse has significant psychosocial repercussions for patients, including impaired functioning, disrupted social relationships, and disrupted employment status (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Kane, 2007</xref>). Relapse is associated with increased costs for inpatient care and outpatient support (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ascher-Svanum et al., 2010</xref>), and may also be associated with a period of disease progression, although evidence for this is inconclusive (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Emsley et al., 2013</xref>). Maintenance treatment with antipsychotics substantially reduces the risk of relapse in patients with schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Sampson et al., 2013</xref>). However, despite the evidence, many patients do not receive maintenance therapy after successful treatment of an acute episode. Several explanations have been cited for this treatment gap, including that patients are not convinced of the need for continued treatment and that antipsychotics are associated with a considerable side-effect burden (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Emsley et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Brexpiprazole acts as a partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors and an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and noradrenaline &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2C</sub> receptors (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>). Brexpiprazole has subnanomolar and almost equal binding affinities for D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>, and &#x003b1;<sub>2C</sub> receptors (inhibition constants [K<sub>i</sub>] in the range of 0.12&#x02013;0.59nM), and therefore brexpiprazole is likely to show similar occupancy of these receptors <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>). In two 6-week phase III schizophrenia trials, brexpiprazole was well tolerated and showed a clinically meaningful improvement vs placebo at the 4-mg/d dose and also at the 2-mg/d dose in one trial (Kane et al., 2015; Correll et al., 2015). Brexpiprazole was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of schizophrenia, and the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, in July 2015.</p><p>Short-term evidence of efficacy and safety needs to be complemented by longer-term evidence. The objective of this trial was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of maintenance treatment with brexpiprazole compared with placebo in adults with schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design and Patients</title><p>This was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were recruited at 49 sites across 7 countries: the United States including Puerto Rico (36% of randomized patients), Ukraine (21%), Serbia (16%), Malaysia (10%), Romania (8%), Colombia (6%), and Turkey (2%). The trial was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guideline and local regulatory requirements, and the trial protocol was approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee for each investigational site. All patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>The trial included male and female inpatients and outpatients aged 18 to 65 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia for at least 3 years as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Patients must have been experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms at screening, as demonstrated by a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Kay et al., 1987</xref>) total score of &#x0003e;80. Patients must have shown response to antipsychotic treatment (other than clozapine) in the previous year, be currently treated with oral or depot antipsychotics (other than clozapine) or have a recent lapse in antipsychotic treatment, and have a history of relapse and/or symptom exacerbation in the absence of antipsychotic treatment. Exclusion criteria included a DSM-IV-TR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia, acute depressive symptoms in the previous 30 days requiring antidepressant therapy, antipsychotic-resistant or refractory schizophrenia, a significant risk of violent behavior or suicide, meeting DSM-IV-TR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> criteria for substance abuse or dependence in the previous 180 days, or requiring prohibited concomitant therapy during the trial.</p><p>The trial comprised a screening phase, a phase for conversion from other antipsychotics to oral brexpiprazole (and washout of prohibited concomitant medications), a single-blind treatment phase to stabilize patients on oral brexpiprazole, a double-blind maintenance treatment phase, and a safety follow-up phase (supplementary Figure 1). Eligible patients, as determined during screening, entered either the open-label conversion phase or the single-blind stabilization phase. Patients entered the conversion phase (weekly visits) if they were currently receiving oral or long-acting injectable antipsychotic treatment, and/or if they required washout of prohibited concomitant medications. The purpose of the conversion phase was to cross-titrate the patient&#x02019;s current antipsychotic treatment(s) to brexpiprazole monotherapy over a period of 1 to 4 weeks and to allow washout of prohibited medications. Brexpiprazole was initiated at 1mg/d, and the dose was adjusted within the range of 1 to 4mg/d over the cross-titration period according to the investigator&#x02019;s judgment. Patients completing the conversion phase and those who did not require washout of prohibited concomitant medications (supplementary Figure 1) entered a 12- to 36-week stabilization phase. In this phase (weekly visits for 4 weeks, 2 weekly thereafter), patients were titrated to a dose of brexpiprazole (1&#x02013;4mg/d) that would maintain stability of psychotic symptoms while minimizing tolerability issues. Stability was defined as meeting all of the following criteria for 12 consecutive weeks (one excursion was permitted prior to last visit): (1) outpatient status; (2) PANSS total score of &#x02264;70; (3) score of &#x02264;4 on each of the following PANSS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content; (4) Clinical Global Impressions &#x02013; Severity of illness (CGI-S; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Guy, 1976</xref>) score of &#x02264;4 (moderately ill); (5) no current suicidal behavior as assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Posner et al., 2011</xref>); and (6) no violent or aggressive behavior resulting in injury or property damage.</p><p>In addition, the dose of brexpiprazole must have been stable for at least the last 4 weeks of the stability period. Patients not achieving 12 weeks of stability after 36 weeks of treatment were discontinued. In the 52-week maintenance phase (2 weekly visits for 8 weeks, 4 weekly thereafter), patients who met the stability criteria were randomized 1:1 to double-blind, parallel-arm treatment with either their stabilization dose of brexpiprazole or placebo. An interactive voice/web response system was used to assign blocks of randomization numbers to trial centers and individual numbers to patients according to a computer-generated randomization code provided by the sponsor. Brexpiprazole and placebo were supplied as tablets, identical in appearance, in weekly blister cards. Patients were not informed of dose adjustments and should not have been aware of the transition between phases. Except in cases of emergency, patients and trial personnel remained blinded to the identity of the treatment assignments until every patient had completed trial treatment.</p><p>Safety follow-up comprised telephone contact or a clinic visit 30 (+2) days after the last dose. There were no protocol amendments.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was the time from randomization to exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse (referred to hereafter as impending relapse) in the double-blind maintenance phase, defined as meeting any of the following 4 criteria:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Clinical Global Impressions &#x02013; Improvement (CGI-I; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Guy, 1976</xref>) score of &#x02265;5 (minimally worse) and an increase on any of the following PANSS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content (a) to a score of &#x0003e;4 with an absolute increase of &#x02265;2 on that specific item since randomization, or (b) to a score of &#x0003e;4 with an absolute increase of &#x02265;4 on the combined 4 PANSS items since randomization.</p></list-item><list-item><p>hospitalization due to worsening of psychotic symptoms</p></list-item><list-item><p>suicidal behavior as assessed by the C-SSRS</p></list-item><list-item><p>violent or aggressive behavior resulting in injury or property damage.</p></list-item></list><p>These criteria for impending relapse have been used previously in clinical trials of long-acting injectable aripiprazole (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Fleischhacker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Ishigooka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2012</xref>), and comparable criteria have been used for over a decade (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Csernansky et al., 2002</xref>). The appearance of any of the signs of impending relapse at any visit resulted in withdrawal from the trial.</p><p>The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients meeting impending relapse criteria in the double-blind maintenance phase. Other secondary efficacy outcomes were the proportion of patients still meeting stability criteria at their last (post-baseline) visit in the double-blind maintenance phase, mean change in PANSS total, positive subscale, and negative subscale scores, mean change in CGI-S score, mean CGI-I score, mean change in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale score, mean change in Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale score, time to discontinuation due to any reason, mean change in PANSS excited component score, mean change in PANSS Marder factor scores, and mean change in Cogstate computerized cognitive test battery scores (individual tasks and composite score). The PSP and GAF are clinician-rated scales that assess a patient&#x02019;s functioning on a scale from 1 (worst) to 100 (best); the PSP measures socially useful activities (including work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors; the GAF measures psychological, social, and occupational/school functioning (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Morosini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). The PANSS is commonly split into positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscales; in addition, retrospective factor analysis produced 5 domains referred to as Marder factors (positive symptoms [8 items], negative symptoms [7 items], disorganized thought [7 items], uncontrolled hostility/excitement [4 items], and anxiety/depression [4 items]); (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Marder et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the PANSS excited component assesses agitation based on 5 PANSS items (excitement, hostility, tension, uncooperativeness, and poor impulse control); (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Montoya et al., 2011</xref>). The Cogstate battery comprises computerized versions of standard cognitive tasks, 4 of which were used in the present study: detection task (processing speed), identification task (attention/vigilance), 1-card learning task (visual learning), and Groton maze learning task (reasoning and problem solving) (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Pietrzak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Maruff et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Safety was assessed by spontaneous reporting of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, vital signs, body weight, and electrocardiograms. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were formally assessed using the Simpson&#x02013;Angus Scale (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Simpson and Angus, 1970</xref>), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barnes, 1989</xref>), and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Guy, 1976</xref>). Suicidality was assessed using the C-SSRS.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>With an assumption that 45% of patients who received placebo and 25% of patients who received brexpiprazole would relapse in 6 months, a hazard ratio of 0.4812 (brexpiprazole vs placebo) was derived. Thus, 90 relapse events were needed to reach 93% power to test the primary hypothesis at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. Two interim analyses were planned for assessment of efficacy (at approximately 50% and 75% of events of impending relapse [45 and 68 events, respectively]), so that the trial could be terminated once the primary objective was met in order to minimize exposure to placebo in the maintenance phase. An interim analysis review committee was formed for the independent review of unblinded efficacy data.</p><p>The enrolled population comprised all patients who signed an informed consent form and entered the conversion phase or the stabilization phase. Safety and efficacy samples were defined for both the stabilization phase and the maintenance phase. The safety samples comprised all patients who received at least one dose of trial medication in the corresponding phase. The efficacy samples comprised all patients in the corresponding safety samples who had at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation in that phase.</p><p>The primary efficacy analysis was a log-rank test at the 0.05 significance level (2-sided) comparing time to impending relapse in the brexpiprazole group vs the placebo group in the maintenance phase efficacy sample. O&#x02019;Brien&#x02013;Fleming boundaries were used to maintain an overall significance level of 0.05 (2-sided) for the planned interim analyses at 45 and 68 events and the final analysis at 90 events; the corresponding 2-sided alpha levels were 0.003051, 0.018325, and 0.044005, respectively. Rate of impending relapse was plotted on a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curve; a hazard ratio (brexpiprazole vs placebo) and 95% CI were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as term. The key secondary efficacy analysis was a chi-squared test comparing the percentage of patients in each group meeting impending relapse criteria in the maintenance phase efficacy sample. A hierarchical testing procedure was employed to preserve the overall type I error rate at 0.05: the key secondary endpoint was tested at the 0.05 level only if the primary endpoint was statistically significant at an overall nominal alpha level of 0.05. Other secondary efficacy analyses were conducted in the stabilization phase, with descriptive statistics by visit, and in the maintenance phase, with mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analyses using observed data, and last observation carried forward (LOCF) sensitivity analyses using an ANCOVA model. In the maintenance phase, CGI-I score was analyzed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel method with LOCF data. The change in Cogstate cognitive test battery composite score was calculated from the average of z-scores for each individual task. In the maintenance phase, an ANCOVA model was used, and Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> was calculated to assess the magnitude of the effect size.</p><p>All safety analyses used descriptive statistics; formal EPS rating scales were also evaluated using ANCOVA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Results</title><p>Results of the first interim analysis were positive, and the trial was terminated because the primary endpoint of a significant delay in time to impending relapse for patients randomized to brexpiprazole compared with placebo had been achieved.

In the stabilization phase, there was a mean decrease (improvement) in PANSS total score of 15.13 points from baseline to last visit. Across the 52-week maintenance phase, the PANSS total score was relatively stable in the brexpiprazole group (a least squares mean increase of 3.25 points), whereas a least squares mean increase (worsening) of 11.20 points was observed in the placebo group (LOCF, ANCOVA, <italic>P</italic>=.0007) (supplementary Figure 2). Due to the trial terminating early (at the time of the first interim analysis), the number of patients with week 52 data for the MMRM analyses was low (brexpiprazole, n=15; placebo, n=9). In the stabilization phase, there was also a mean improvement from baseline to last visit on PANSS subscales, CGI-S, CGI-I, PANSS excited component, and all Marder factor scores. In the maintenance phase, in LOCF analyses, brexpiprazole was favored over placebo at week 52 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.01) on PANSS positive subscale, CGI-S, CGI-I, PANSS excited component, and Marder factor (positive symptoms, disorganized thought, and uncontrolled hostility/excitement) scores. Similarly, on the social functioning scales, there was a mean 11.42-point improvement in GAF score from baseline to last visit in the stabilization phase (PSP was not assessed post-baseline in the stabilization phase). In the maintenance phase, brexpiprazole was favored over placebo at week 52 on PSP and GAF scores (LOCF, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.01). PSP scores improved in both treatment groups during the maintenance phase, with a least squares mean increase of 15.06 points in the brexpiprazole group and 10.31 points in the placebo group (LOCF).

In this trial, oral brexpiprazole was an efficacious maintenance treatment for schizophrenia, as demonstrated by a statistically significantly longer time to impending relapse compared with placebo in stabilized patients. The proportion of patients in the maintenance phase who experienced impending relapse with brexpiprazole was 13.5% compared with 38.5% for placebo (the hazard ratio was 0.292; thus, brexpiprazole reduced the risk of impending relapse by 71% compared with placebo). These impending relapse rates are comparable to those in placebo-controlled trials of similar design: oral lurasidone 29.9%, placebo 41.1% (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Tandon et al., 2014</xref>); oral paliperidone extended-release 25.0%, placebo 52.7% (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2007</xref>); long-acting injectable aripiprazole 10.0%, placebo 39.6% (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2012</xref>); and long-acting injectable paliperidone palmitate 17.6%, placebo 47.8% (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Hough et al., 2010</xref>); and below those in a placebo-controlled maintenance trial with no stabilization phase: oral aripiprazole 33.8%, placebo 57.0% (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Pigott et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The efficacy of brexpiprazole as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia was also supported by secondary efficacy measures. During the brexpiprazole stabilization phase, clinical symptomatology improved, as assessed by schizophrenia rating scale scores. During the double-blind maintenance phase, the benefits were generally maintained over 1 year with brexpiprazole, whereas scores worsened with placebo (LOCF analyses). The efficacious maintenance dosage of brexpiprazole in this trial was in the range of 2 to 4mg/d, as indicated by the majority of patients (99%) receiving brexpiprazole 2mg, 3mg, or 4mg at their last visit (mean 3.6mg).</p><p>Deficits in psychosocial domains are a core feature of schizophrenia, and therefore social functioning is an important outcome parameter for evaluating successful long-term treatment (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Burns and Patrick, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Nasrallah et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, social functioning was measured using the GAF and PSP rating scales. Mean GAF score improved in the stabilization phase; the benefits were maintained with brexpiprazole in the maintenance phase, whereas placebo showed worsening (LOCF analysis). PSP scores (changes measured in the maintenance phase only) showed improvements with brexpiprazole that were above the threshold for clinically meaningful response in stabilized patients with schizophrenia (an increase of 4&#x02013;7 points) (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Nasrallah et al., 2008</xref>). Benefits were also observed with placebo on the PSP in this clinical trial setting.</p><p>The Cogstate computerized cognitive test battery favored brexpiprazole over placebo, with a composite score Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> of 0.298. As defined by Cohen, this is a small, but clinically meaningful, effect size (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Cognitive deficits are a core component of schizophrenia, present at early stages and in the absence of antipsychotic medication, and strongly linked to vocational and functional impairments (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bowie and Harvey, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fatouros-Bergman et al., 2014</xref>). Brexpiprazole showed benefits over placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.05) on 2 of 4 individual cognitive tasks, consistent with previous findings that no drug has a uniform positive cognitive profile in schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000e9;sam&#x000e9;ricq et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>No unexpected safety issues were identified with brexpiprazole treatment. Though varying between agents, antipsychotic treatment has been associated with weight gain, metabolic problems, EPS and activating side effects (such as akathisia), sedation, and prolactin increases (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Kumar and Sachdev, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2013</xref>). The incidence of AEs, including sedating side effects, was low in this trial and comparable to those reported in short-term, fixed-dose trials of brexpiprazole in schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Correll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2015</xref>). Activating side effects in the stabilization phase (insomnia [12.1%], akathisia [9.1%], agitation [6.5%]) occurred with similar incidence to those observed in the short-term pivotal trials (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Correll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2015</xref>). These activating AEs had generally resolved by the maintenance phase. A mean weight increase of &#x0003c;1kg was observed in the stabilization phase, and mean weight decreased in both groups in the maintenance phase. Brexpiprazole was associated with only small changes in metabolic parameters and QT interval.</p><p>A limitation of this trial is the small number of patients who completed the study (23 of 524 enrolled patients, 4.4%), leaving the MMRM analyses underpowered at week 52. Across the 3 treatment phases, the main reason for discontinuation was early termination of the trial following the results of the interim analysis (n=192). Other common reasons for discontinuation (&#x02265;10% of enrolled population), aside from impending relapse, were withdrawal of consent by the patient (n=84) and AEs without impending relapse (n=57). The majority of these discontinuations occurred in the stabilization phase, where 60 patients (12.9%) withdrew consent, and 43 patients (9.3%) discontinued due to AEs (of which 28 were schizophrenia or psychotic disorder). Withdrawal of consent may arise because patients have underestimated the burden of participating in the study, or due to a lack of perceived efficacy and/or insight. In previous maintenance treatment trials, the incidences of discontinuation in the oral stabilization phases were highly variable: lurasidone, 14.2% withdrew consent, 12.3% withdrew due to AEs (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">ClinicalTrials.gov</xref>); paliperidone extended-release, 5.1% withdrew consent, 1.6% withdrew due to AEs (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2007</xref>); and aripiprazole, 4.1% withdrew consent, 2.0% withdrew due to AEs (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to the differences between treatments, this variation may be attributed to differences in study design, notably, variation in the length of the stabilization phase between studies (of which, up to 36 weeks in the present study was the longest), differences in blinding, and the presence or lack of a prior conversion phase. Due to the high rate of discontinuation in the present study, the trial population may not be representative of the population intended to be analyzed. Taken together, these limitations indicate that long-term treatment with brexpiprazole is appropriate for those patients who can tolerate, and respond, to brexpiprazole.</p><p>There are ongoing concerns regarding the use of placebo in clinical trials, since placebo is associated with a risk of harm by failing to prevent relapse (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Emsley and Fleischhacker, 2013</xref>). However, clinical regulatory guidelines of the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency state that the use of a placebo arm is appropriate in a randomized withdrawal trial in stabilized patients, since this trial design minimizes exposure to placebo (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">US Food and Drug Administration, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">European Medicines Agency, 2012</xref>). In the present trial, exposure to placebo was to be further minimized by 2 planned interim analyses to halt the study as soon as efficacy was demonstrated. The risk to patients receiving placebo was also minimized, since patients were carefully monitored for early indicators of worsening so that serious relapse could be prevented with appropriate active treatment (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Emsley and Fleischhacker, 2013</xref>). In general, in a relapse prevention trial, a placebo arm may be justified to establish assay sensitivity (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">European Medicines Agency, 2012</xref>). Inclusion of a placebo control is also believed to reduce the cost and duration of a clinical trial, since it is generally easier to distinguish a new medication from placebo than from a standard effective drug; as a consequence, this will reduce the number of patients exposed to the potential adverse effects of a new medication (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Carpenter et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, standard drugs are not efficacious for all patients and all aspects of schizophrenia and are associated with significant side effects; thus, there are good reasons to seek more effective and safer treatment options (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Carpenter et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In summary, in patients with acute schizophrenia who responded to brexpiprazole and met stability criteria, brexpiprazole was an efficacious option as maintenance therapy over the course of 1 year, with an incidence of AEs comparable to placebo and a safety profile similar to that observed in short-term studies. Future research should attempt to replicate this result in a naturalistic setting and to better predict which patients are good candidates to receive brexpiprazole in the long term.</p></sec><sec><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>W.
