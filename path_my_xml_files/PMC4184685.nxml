This gap in patient care has prompted efforts to improve the detection of central nervous system (CNS) tissue loss with more specific measures such as normalized white and gray matter atrophy on brain imaging and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) loss with optical coherence tomography (OCT). The relevance and reliability of these measures as markers of primary neuroprotection in clinical trials has not been established as few studies have addressed the longitudinal correlation of these measures with clinical progression independently of relapses.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Several mechanisms may contribute to tissue loss in MS, including excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, and energy deficits.

The first half of the randomized subjects was invited to remain under study for a third year while we completed the 2-year core study.

For PBVC, a sample size of 40 subjects would produce 80% power if riluzole reduced the average worsening by 90% or more. In addition, for all measures except nNAWMV, our proposed sample size would have 80% power for detecting a difference in rates of worsening by 2&#x000a0;years of 92% versus 50% and 75% versus 27% (using Fisher's exact test). As (1) the magnitude of the possible neuroprotective effect of riluzole was unknown on markers such as brain atrophy, (2) best outcome measures of neuroprotection are unclear and (3) this was a pilot study, we felt it was worth testing our hypothesis although the treatment effect we used to design this study was optimistic.</p><p>Mixed model regression analysis was used to compare the changes over time between riluzole and placebo while accounting for the longitudinal nature of the data and using the principle of intention-to-treat. The mixed model allowed subject-specific intercepts and slopes. When data were highly non-normal, transformations were used to improve normality, and bootstrapping was used to assess the impact of non-normality on the original scale. We compared the differences in trends over time (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> compared the groups using Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

It remains unclear whether this might also be generalizable to progressive forms or more advanced stages of MS. Although in the unadjusted primary analysis, there was a trend for faster brain atrophy in riluzole recipients, the preplanned analyses adjusting for baseline imbalance demonstrated this difference was likely due to these imbalances. In addition, there was no detectable impact of riluzole treatment on any other clinical or imaging outcomes, thus suggesting riluzole is unlikely to negatively impact MS. Our results emphasize the importance of taking into account key baseline measures that may reflect a more severe or active preexisting disease, such as seen with the riluzole group.</p><p>Ours is the only randomized clinical trial of neuroprotection in early RR MS. However, two randomized trials have evaluated the neuroprotective potential of lamotrigine and simvastatin in secondary progressive (SP) MS.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Another investigated neuroprotection in acute optic neuritis with erythropoietin.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Assessing neuroprotection in early MS is challenging due to the necessary combination of study drug with standard of care treatment to prevent relapses. However, given their preserved baseline neurological function, early MS patients form an important group to study, as they have more CNS tissue at risk and potentially less tissue already committed to death due to prior accumulated injuries. Furthermore, in progressive MS trials clinical fluctuations of baseline measurements can interfere with the reliability of some outcome measures.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In the setting of acute optic neuritis, prompt enrollment in trials after symptom onset is difficult and may preclude timely rescue of injured tissue.</p><p>In the lamotrigine trial,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> active treatment recipients displayed more brain atrophy progression. The processes underlying this finding remain unclear. While the failure to detect a treatment effect might be due to studying patients with advanced deficits and substantial preexisting irreversible neuroaxonal tissue loss, it might also relate to limited experience in neuroprotection trial design.</p><p>The fact that our trial did not show an effect of study drug on progression of brain atrophy could be related to randomization imbalance or lack of power. Conversely, it could relate to the use of a drug that does not target key disease processes leading to tissue loss at the early stage of the disease. Although riluzole inhibits the release of glutamate from nerve terminals and modulates glutamate kainate and NMDA receptors, its effect on the glutamate pathway is modest. It remains unclear based on animal models and pathology data what would be the best target for prevention of neurodegeneration in MS.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Some have questioned whether &#x0201c;pseudoatrophy,&#x0201d; as possibly seen in the lamotrigine trial, may confound the results of neuroprotection trials. We believe &#x0201c;pseudoatrophy&#x0201d; was not seen in this study for three reasons. First, study drug did not demonstrate an effect on new lesion formation, thus study drug unlikely had an anti-inflammatory effect, which could lead to a &#x0201c;pseudoatrophy&#x0201d; effect as previously suggested with natalizumab.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Second, weekly interferon treatment has not been reported to be associated with &#x0201c;pseudoatrophy,&#x0201d; and there was no acceleration of brain volume loss after interferon initiation at month 3 in the study compared to first 3&#x000a0;months. Finally, we do not believe there was &#x0201c;pseudoatrophy&#x0201d; related to study drug as the slope of changes with gray matter and normal-appearing white matter volumes were similar in both the riluzole and the placebo groups.</p><p>Our biostatistical analytic strategy is novel. Primary and secondary analyses took into consideration all time points collected rather than only data available at month 24 study visit. This allows for identification of trends over time with higher reliability and avoids the loss of precious information in case patients do not remain in the study until completion or the last study measure does not pass quality control. Furthermore, analyzing the trend over time allows for taking baseline differences into account and for retaining all data from subjects, regardless how long they remained in the study. For example, although differences were identified at month 24 for progression of atrophy with SIENA and RNFL changes, these differences were not confirmed in the analysis taking baseline values and all data into account. Indeed, differences in brain atrophy appeared to be related to preexisting rate of brain atrophy and lesion accumulation while differences in RNFL changes were entirely explained by baseline differences across groups for that measure. Using statistical analyses that take in account possible baseline differences is critical as these differences may otherwise confound detection of treatment effect, especially in small studies that are more prone to randomization imbalances.</p><p>Several limitations of this study are acknowledged. First, as a small trial, it may have been underpowered to detect a treatment effect and been more prone to randomization imbalance. It is also possible that by including subjects with such early MS, some may have had a more benign course, which has been associated with lower rates of brain atrophy.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Second, the add-on design may have led to lesser disease progression and decreased power. However, no consistent effect of IFNB-1a on measures of brain atrophy, RNFL, or SDMT has ever been reported. While missing data may have decreased our power or biased the results, the statistical analyses allowed making use of all available time points, thereby maximizing the contributions of all subjects to analyses. It is also possible that this study was too short to fully capture the effects of the medication on the outcomes of interest. Finally, our primary and secondary imaging outcome measures were limited to percent brain atrophy, nGMV and nNAWMV. These atrophy measures were chosen as they have been consistently used to monitor brain tissue loss in MS studies.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We cannot exclude the fact that other imaging metrics of tissue loss such as thalamic atrophy, cortical thickness, and cross-sectional area at C2 may have been more sensitive to pick up relevant changes.</p><p>As a definitive surrogate marker for disease progression has not been established, this trial combined state-of-the-art comprehensive testing of various outcomes considered relevant to the study of neuroprotection. The only measure showing trend for a difference in unadjusted analyses was percent brain atrophy, suggesting this outcome may be more sensitive than the secondary and tertiary outcome measures used in this study. We are currently analyzing longitudinal correlations between specific imaging and clinical measures to identify the most sensitive imaging outcome of disease progression in early MS. This study will no doubt help to improve the design of future neuroprotection studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are thankful to the patients who participated in this study.
