The participants were motivated on regular intervals by personal and phone contact, to use mouthwash on regular basis. The saliva samples were collected on the day 0 (baseline), followed by day 7 and 14. The assessment of salivary microbes was done by dilution and spread method, where saliva samples were diluted (1:1000) and streaked on blood agar containing gel plates.

</p><p>Several studies have been published using herbal extracts either individually or in combinations as mouthwashes and compared with CHX for their efficiency. The herbal mix used in the present study is unique and new and to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind in combination.</p><p>Baratakke <italic>et al</italic>. studied triphala combination mouthwash and compared with CHX and found no significant difference between both in reducing the plaque and gingival scores and concluded that both were equally effective and triphala mouthwashes could in future replace CHX as they have no side effects and is cost-efficient.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>A similar observation was noted by Pradeep <italic>et al</italic>., where triphala mothwash was tested against CHX, and it was noted that the plaque, gingival, and oral hygiene index-simplified values were reduced similarly with both the mouthwashes in comparison with placebo group. They concluded that triphala was compatible with CHX and can be used as a potential therapeutic agent in treatment of gingivitis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Sushma <italic>et al</italic>. subjected the dentures from patients to microbial analysis after cleaning the dentures with triphala churna and chlorhexidine gluconate and found triphala to be more efficient than conventional chlorhexidine in reducing the <italic>Candida albicans</italic> count.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Mahajan <italic>et al</italic>. in their study reported that tulsi and neem showed antimicrobial property but was less than that of chlorhexidine. Tulsi is found to be active against Candida species and hence is advantage to add one as a component in herbal mouthwash compared to chlorhexidne which acts against normal oral microflora increasing the chances of candidiasis on long-term use.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Mallikarjun <italic>et al</italic>. studied the ethanolic exctracts of tulsi (<italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>) on periodontal pathogens in comparison with doxycycline. They found tulsi to exhibit an inhibition zone on the agar gel similar to doxycycline particularly against <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, but less inhibition against <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic>. They concluded that tulsi could possibly used as an effective and affordable adjunct along with standard care in management of periodontal diseases.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Anand <italic>et al</italic>. found 3% neem to be an effective antimicrobial solution in reducing (87% reduction) the streptococcal mutans on the toothbrush bristles.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Datta <italic>et al</italic>. used neem extract as an endodontic irrigating agent and showed that 0.94% and 1.88% of the extract was found effective against <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>, respectively, when compared to 3% sodium hypochlorite and 2% chlorhexidine.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Heyman <italic>et al</italic>., in an effort to understand the antioxidant properties of neem leaf by ethanol extraction, found that neem leaf extract showed prominent dose-dependent antibacterial action against <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> but had no effect on <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Chatterjee <italic>et al</italic>. in their study used 1% turmeric mouthwash in comparison with 2% chlorhexidine and found that the turmeric mouthwash as effective as CHX in reducing the gingival and plaque index and concluded that turmeric mouthwash could be used as adjunct similar to CHX after scaling and root planning.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The components of the formulated herbal mouthwash in the present study were selected after detailed understanding of their pharmacological actions so that the combination is at its best. The antibacterial effect of the herbal blend could be attributed to the cumulative effect of each individual component. Sushrutha Samhita emphasize triphala to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, hemostatic, and wound-healing properties.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Alongside, triphala has been attributed with other additive properties such as antioxidant, antibacterial, antimutagenic, antinoeplastic, chemo and radioprotective, and antidental caries as well with broad clinical application.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The phenolic and nonhenolic components, the tannic acid, chebulic acid, and flavonoids in triphala provide the antibacterial action and therapeutic potential, especially against streptococci and <italic>C. albicans</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Neem (<italic>Azadirachta Indica</italic>) contains azadarachitin, the chief active component, which is an effective antimicrobial agent. Trimethylamine, nimbidin, nimbin, nimbolide, chlorides, lectin, and fluorides are other major components and silica, sulfur, Vitamin C, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, and sterols as minor components. These elements provide neem with its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effect.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The polyphenolic tannins present in the neem could effectively bind to the bacterial surface proteins causing bacterial aggregation and loss of glycosyltransferase activity.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The antioxidant activity of neem extract gets further amplified following adherence to bacteria. Neem leaf extracts contain polyphenols that help adhere to the oral mucosa and are effective as synergetic antioxidants in periodontal diseases.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The antimicrobial activity of <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> (Tulsi) is attributed to the essential oils contained in them, namely, eugenol, caryophyllene, germacrene-A, clemene, and caryophylline oxide. These oils render tulsi active against wide array of organism such as streptococci, staphylococci, Shigella, Salmonella and recently been tested against <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, a prominanat periodontal pathogen. The phenolic nature of the essential oils in tulsi exert membrane destabilizing effect in the microbial strains and stimulate leakage of cellular potassium which is lethal for the bacteria.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Turmeric is known for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, immunostimulant, and antiseptic properties. The anti-inflammatory action is due to its selective inhibitory action of prostaglandin E2 synthesis and thromboxane and inflammatory mediators of arachidonic acid metabolism.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] As the molecules are lipophilic in nature, cause rapid permeability of the cell membrane as in the process of apoptosis and induces change in the structure and integrity of the bacterial cells.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>As per the literature, there are a few controversies regarding the duration of the studies conducted using herbal mouthwashes. Parwani <italic>et al</italic>. in a 4 days &#x0201c;<italic>de novo</italic>&#x0201d; plaque formation study concluded that 0.2% CHX mouthwash performed better than the herbal mouthwash. However, they were of opinion that the 4 days clinical study would be very short period to evaluate the effectiveness of the herbal mouthwash.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Similar was the conclusion by Moran <italic>et al</italic>. in their study comparing triclosan and CHX mouthwash in a 4 days plaque regrowth model.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In 2011, Chatterjee <italic>et al</italic>., in their study, found that the herbal oral rinse was equally effective in reducing the periodontal index as that of chlorhexidine.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The same can be said about the results of our study on 7<sup>th</sup> day values where both mouthwashes were almost similar in activity with CHX faring marginally better, but on an extended use for 14 days, greater effect was observed in the herbal group.</p><p>CHX though has stood the test of times also come with a price tag of certain disadvantages on long-term usage, such as the teeth staining and the taste alteration.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] It is also believed that continued and increased use of chlorhexidine may cause the emergence of new strains of micobacteria with reduced susceptibility.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Combining several such herbal extracts as in the present study would certainly formulate mouthwash with a wide array of benefits in reducing the pathogenic oral microorganisms. As the benefits of the mouthwashes are better delivered on long-term usage, it is desirable to switch to herbal mix mouthwashes as they are traditionally accepted, culturally amicable, economically feasible, safe, and efficient too.</p><p>Further researches regarding new herbal combinations as mouthwashes on oral pathogenic organisms at different age groups in various clinical conditions are required to implicate the benefits of herbal extracts over chlorhexidine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>With few limitations in the study, it can be concluded that 0.12% CHX mouthwash was better at 7<sup>th</sup> day in reducing the microbial colony count, while on a prolonged usage for 14 days the herbal preparation was found to perform much better than 0.12% CHX proving the new formulated herbal mouthwash an affordable alternative in reducing the microbial count. However, further long-term clinical studies are essential to provide much-required standardization and qualification of the various combinations of herbal mouthwashes to counter the disadvantages of the gold standard chlorhexidine.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>F<sc>INANCIAL SUPPORT AND SPONSORSHIP</sc></title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>C<sc>ONFLICTS OF
