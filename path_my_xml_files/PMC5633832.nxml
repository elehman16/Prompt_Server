and a periarticular infiltration in the management of early post-operative pain
after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A pragmatic, single centre, two arm parallel group, patient blinded, randomised
controlled trial was undertaken. All patients due for TKA were eligible. Exclusion
criteria included contraindications to the medications involved in the study and
patients with a neurological abnormality of the lower limb. Patients received
either a femoral nerve block with 75 mg of 0.25% levobupivacaine hydrochloride
around the nerve, or periarticular infiltration with 150 mg of 0.25%
levobupivacaine hydrochloride, 10 mg morphine sulphate, 30 mg ketorolac trometamol
and 0.25 mg of adrenaline all diluted with 0.9% saline to make a volume of 150
ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 264 patients were recruited and data from 230 (88%) were available for
the primary analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome measure
of a visual analogue score for pain on the first post-operative day, prior to
physiotherapy, was similar in both groups. The mean difference was -0.7 (95%
confidence interval (CI) -5.9 to 4.5; p = 0.834). The periarticular group used
less morphine in the first post-operative day compared with the femoral nerve
block group (74%, 95% CI 55 to 99). The femoral nerve block group reported 39
adverse events, of which 27 were serious, in 31 patients and the periarticular
group reported 51 adverse events, of which 38 were serious, in 42 patients up to
six weeks post-operatively. None of the adverse events were directly attributed to
either of the interventions under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Periarticular infiltration is a viable and safe alternative to femoral nerve block
for the early post-operative relief of pain following TKA.</p><p>Cite this article: <italic>Bone Joint J</italic> 2017;99-B:904&#x02013;11.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Total knee arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>Periarticular infiltration</kwd><kwd>Femoral nerve block</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>odf2nlm-version</meta-name><meta-value>1.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>price</meta-name><meta-value>$2.00</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>principal-institution</meta-name><meta-value>Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, Warwick, United Kingdom</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>Knee</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>coi-statement</meta-name><meta-value>None declared</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>About 93 000 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were performed by surgeons in the NHS in the
United Kingdom in 2014; a 200% increase since 2004.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> There may be severe pain in the early post-operative period after
this operation.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A femoral nerve block, as
a single routine peri-operative infiltration of local anaesthetic, improves the control of
pain and reduces the need for systemic analgesics such as opiates.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
However, it does not provide analgesic effects to the posterior aspect of the knee joint,
which is supplied by the sciatic nerve, and so pain relief is often incomplete. A femoral
nerve block may occasionally be associated with serious complications, including damage to
the adjacent major blood vessels and to the nerve itself.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> It also temporally impairs quadriceps muscle function leading
to limited extension of the knee and falls post-operatively.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Alternative analgesic
regimes include an adductor canal block, but this also does not provide analgesic effects
to the back of the knee.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>A popular alternative approach is the intra-operative periarticular infiltration of
analgesic agents including local anaesthetics, opiates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, which may be delivered directly to the sources of pain, reducing the risk of
systemic side effects.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Periarticular
infiltration can be administered by the operating surgeon without specialist equipment,
compared with a femoral nerve block which requires ultrasound or a nerve stimulator or both
to be administered safely. Periarticular infiltration does not inhibit quadriceps function
and can provide analgesia to the whole of the knee joint.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> However, there is little evidence to support its routine use
in the management of early post-operative pain.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>We report a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the use of a femoral nerve block
and periarticular infiltration in patients undergoing TKA to establish the most effective
management of early post-operative pain.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a single centre, two arm parallel group RCT undertaken at the University
Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Hospital of St. Cross, Rugby. Patients
were recruited between December 2013 and October 2015. All those undergoing primary
unilateral TKA were eligible. Exclusion criteria were:</p><p>- concomitant medical or psychiatric problems which would interfere with treatment or
follow-up;</p><p>- a neurological abnormality in the ipsilateral leg, e.g. history of stroke, neurogenic
pain or previous nerve pain;</p><p>- a specific contraindication to the analgesic agents used;</p><p>- participation in a clinical trial involving a pharmaceutical product during the
previous 90 days;</p><p>- previous entry in the present trial;</p><p>- an inability to adhere to any procedure involved in the trial.</p><p>Patients were allocated to treatment by a remote telephone 1:1 randomisation service
using a computer-generated schedule with randomised blocks and stratified by type of
anaesthetic (general or spinal). The sizes of the blocks were randomly chosen to ensure
concealment. Randomisation was undertaken by an independent member of the operating
theatre staff on the day of surgery after a spinal anaesthetic with sedation or a
general anaesthetic had been administered.</p><p>All patients attended a routine pre-operative TKA education class. Unless
contraindicated, they were given gabapentin as premedication and received either a
spinal anaesthetic with sedation or a general anaesthetic. After randomisation, they
were allocated to receive either femoral nerve block or periarticular infiltration. The
femoral nerve block technique involved identification of the femoral nerve below the
inguinal ligament using nerve stimulation and/or ultrasound, according to the
anaesthetist&#x02019;s normal practice, and infiltration of 75 mg of 0.25% levobupivacaine
hydrochloride around the nerve. Periarticular infiltration involved 150 mg of 0.25%
levobupivacaine hydrochloride, 10 mg morphine sulphate, 30 mg ketorolac trometamol and
0.25 mg of adrenaline, all diluted with 0.9% saline to make a volume of 150 ml. This was
infiltrated into the skin and soft tissues of the knee by the surgeon. The zones of
infiltration included the medial, lateral, suprapatellar and posterior soft tissues.
Surgeons were advised to infiltrate roughly equal quantities to all four zones.</p><p>The remainder of the operation was performed according to the surgeons&#x02019; routine
practice. All patients followed the same routine post-operative pathway unless they had
specific contraindications. All received regular paracetamol, ibuprofen and gabapentin
and morphine sulphate sustained release. Oramorph was administered as required. Routine
thromboprophylaxis included intermittent positive pressure calf compression until mobile
and subcutaneous low molecular heparin for 14 days post-operatively.</p><p>The fidelity with which both interventions were delivered was reviewed by an independent
clinician (TC). The results were relayed to those delivering the interventions in order
to maintain compliance with the protocol.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was a 100 visual analogue score (VAS) of pain reported by
the patient on the first day post-operatively and before the start of physiotherapy,
with 0 being no pain and 100 being the worst pain. This has been validated for the
assessment of pain after TKA.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The
primary endpoint was chosen after feedback from the patient indicating adequate pain
relief on the first post-operative day prior to physiotherapy, and was of principal
importance to the study population; this is consistent with other smaller RCTs which
have also used this time point.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
</p><p>The secondary outcome measures are described below. Pain after physiotherapy on the
first post-operative day and pain before and after physiotherapy on the second
post-operative day, was assessed using the same VAS as the primary outcome. Functional
assessment was carried out by a physiotherapist using straight leg raise and range of
movement of the knee, and the ability to transfer from bed to chair and the time taken
to rise from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down (timed
up and go).<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Total opiate,
paracetamol, ibuprofen and gabapentin analgesia used up to 24 and 48 hours
post-operatively were recorded. All opiates were converted to a morphine equivalent dose
using a multiplication conversion factor of 0.1 for codeine and tramadol, as outlined in
the British National Formulary.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The
Oxford Knee Score (OKS),<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> EuroQol
(EQ-5D-5L),<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and Douleur Neuropathic Pain (DN2) score<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> were taken six weeks post-operatively. The OKS is a validated
self-administered outcome measure.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
The EQ-5D-5L is a validated measure of health-related quality of life, consisting of
five dimensions and a separate VAS.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The values were calculated using the 3L
crosswalk value sets.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The DN2
assesses neuropathic pain using two questions.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Adverse events (AEs) up
to six weeks post-operatively were recorded. An AE was defined as any untoward medical
occurrence in a patient, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the
treatment. They were further classified into serious adverse events (SAEs) if they
fulfilled any of the following criteria: were immediately life-threatening, required
hospitalisation or prolongation of the existing hospitalisation, resulted in persistent
or significant disability or incapacity or were&#x000a0;regarded by the study team as an
important medical condition.</p><p>Although not reported in this study, patients were followed up at up to 12 months with
OKS, EQ-5D-5L, DN2 and AEs being recorded.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> These additional data are being used to help inform the design of a
further trial examining chronic pain after TKA.</p><p>Patients were blind to the intervention to which they were allocated. Concealment was
maintained by ensuring randomisation was performed after spinal anaesthesia and sedation
or general anaesthesia and then administered within a sterile zone with drapes to
prevent the patients from seeing which intervention they received. In addition, in order
to ensure post-operative concealment, all patients had a standard dressing applied to
the area where a femoral nerve block is usually performed. It was not possible to blind
the surgeon and anaesthetist delivering the interventions to the treatment options.
Outcome data were collected by independent physiotherapists who were blinded to the
allocation of treatment.</p><p>The protocol was prepared in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items:
Recommendations for Interventional Trials guidelines<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and published <italic>a priori</italic>.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Statutory NHS research and ethical
approval was obtained on 23 September 2013, reference 13/WM/0316. The trial was
conducted in accordance with the Medicines for Human use (Clinical Trials) Regulations
2004, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice and reported
in line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Patients were consulted during their routine clinical appointments to determine if the
research question was important to them and those in a successful pilot trial were asked
to provide feedback on the processes of the trial.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> A small number of those in the pilot trial helped to develop the
full proposal including the choice of primary outcome measure. One of the patients who
was in the trial steering group was active in overseeing the running of the trial and
the ways of disseminating the results.</p><sec><title content-type="h3">Sample size and analysis plan</title><p>The available literature suggested a difference in the VAS for pain between the
groups of 12 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 9 to 15) to be the minimum clinically
important difference (MCID).<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>
Based on pilot data, the standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) for VAS for pain was 30
mm.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Therefore, to test the
null hypothesis of equality of the means of the treatment groups, assuming
approximate normality for the VAS, primary outcome data for 264 patients (132 in each
arm) were required for 90% power and 5% significance.</p><p>Initial analysis investigated differences in the primary outcome scores on an
intention-to-treat basis using an independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test. This
was augmented with linear regression analysis that adjusted for age, gender and type
of anaesthetic. Tests were two-sided and considered to provide evidence for a
significant difference at p &#x0003c; 0.05. Estimates of treatment effects were presented
with 95% CIs. For continuous approximately normally distributed secondary outcome
measures (e.g. OKS, EQ-5D-5L), data were analysed in a similar manner to the primary
outcome. In hospital medication variables were log transformed prior to testing in
order to improve the approximation of the normal distribution. Data, such as adverse
events, were compared between groups using chi-squared tests.</p><p>Some data were not available due to the voluntary withdrawal of patients, lack of
completion of individual items or loss to follow-up. Where possible, the reasons for
missing data were determined and reported. All analysis presented are based on
complete cases. The analysis was implemented using the software package R (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 264 patients were recruited between March 2014 and November 2015 and, of

received periarticular infiltration died of a myocardial infarction (Table IV). One
patient who had been allocated to and received a femoral nerve block died of sepsis.
There were 39 AEs, of which 27 were SAE, amongst 31 patients in the femoral nerve block
group, and 51 AEs, of which 38 were SAEs, amongst 42 patients in the periarticular

0.990).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial shows that pain scores on the day after TKA are the same in patients who have
had a femoral nerve block and those who have had periarticular infiltration of local
anaesthetic. It was not designed to show equivalence in outcomes; however, the 95% CIs
for the difference between the groups in the per protocol analysis were only just over
half of the pre-specified MCID. We can, therefore be confident that we have excluded a
clinically important difference in pain scores on the first post-operative day between
the two interventions.</p><p>Although the pain scores were similar in the two groups, the use of morphine up to 24
hours post-operatively was less in the periarticular group. Although morphine is an
effective supplementary analgesic for post-operative pain, dose dependent systemic side
effects, including nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, pruritus, reduced gut
mobility and urinary retention mean that lower doses are preferable.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Two other early functional secondary outcomes had borderline significant differences
between the groups (the ability to transfer independently on day 1 and the flexion of
the knee on day 2) and both were in favour of periarticular infiltration. Although
caution is needed in interpreting the relevance of the secondary observations, these and
the primary outcome findings support the suggestion that periarticular infiltration is a
good alternative to femoral nerve block. Both are designed to provide early analgesia
and by six weeks we found no difference in PROMs between the groups.</p><p>None of the AEs were directly attributed to either of the interventions and the
frequency of AEs was similar in both treatment groups, and were comparable with those
reported in the literature, suggesting that periarticular infiltration does not pose an
additional risk to the patients.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>Periarticular infiltration has previously been compared with femoral nerve block for
early pain relief following TKA in three small RCTs including, in total, 181
patients.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, meta-analyses by Marques et al<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and Albrecht et al<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and a Cochrane Review by Chan et
al<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> of these RCTs have been
unable to draw firm conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of these
interventions, largely because of a lack of statistical power and moderate quality
(GRADE)<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> evidence. Our results
now show that periarticular infiltration offers comparable early pain relief, and
safety. Patients and clinicians should therefore consider other factors including the
availability of specialist equipment such as a nerve stimulator or ultrasound for
administering the femoral nerve block, and any specific contraindications when making a
preference for either intervention. </p><p>The main strengths of this trial are the blinded assessment of outcome and its pragmatic
design. It followed a published protocol and included an intention-to-treat primary
analysis, meaning that the findings should be applicable to routine clinical practice. </p><p>The main weakness is that it involved only one NHS centre. Although, it included many
different surgeons and anaesthetists, the study should be repeated in other healthcare
settings. We tested only one regime of periarticular infiltration, but there are others
with different types and doses of local anaesthetic. However, the regime that we chose
and tested was representative of our region and many hospitals in the United Kingdom. An
error of data entry resulted in the final sample for primary analysis being two less
than anticipated. However, the evaluated treatment difference of -0.9 was less than the
MCID of 1.2, and smaller than the anticipated <sc>sd</sc>; we are therefore confident
that the study was not underpowered and that there is no clinical difference between the
two treatment arms.</p><p>In conclusion, we did not find a clinically meaningful difference in the perception of
pain on the day after TKA between patients who have a femoral nerve block and those
having a periarticular infiltration of local anaesthetic. Periarticular infiltration,
which can be administered without the need for specialist additional equipment and
reduces post-operative morphine requirements, should be considered as a viable and safe
alternative to femoral nerve block for early pain relief following TKA.</p><p><bold>Take home message:</bold></p><p>- Periarticular infiltration is a good alternative to femoral nerve block for managing
post-operative pain following TKA.</p><p>- Periarticular infiltration may reduce a patients&#x02019; requirements for additional
morphine following TKA.</p><p>- Within the limits of the trial, periarticular infiltration was a safe alternative to
femoral nerve block.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">NJR Editorial Board. National Joint Registry for England Wales and
