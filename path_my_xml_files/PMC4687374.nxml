Currently the only treatment for CD is a lifelong adherence to the gluten-free diet. CD prevalence in T1D patients approximates 5-7&#x000a0;%. Despite this increased risk, many health care professionals struggle as to the optimal approach to managing CD in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The diagnosis of patients who present with symptomatic CD, including malabsorption and obvious pathology upon biopsy, remains straightforward, with improvements noted on a gluten-free diet. Many patients identified by screening, however, tend to be asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Evidence is inconclusive as to whether the benefits of screening and potentially treating asymptomatic individuals outweigh the harms of managing a population already burdened with an established chronic illness.</p><p>The CD-DIET Study (Celiac Disease and Diabetes - Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial) is a multicenter randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of a GFD in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease and T1D over 1&#x000a0;year. Key outcomes include the impact of GFD on diabetes control (HbA1c), bone health, blood glucose variability, and patient centered measures including quality of life and self-perceived health. Dietary outcomes will include description and evaluation of food consumption patterns including glycemic index and load, dietary characteristics including gluten quantification, and highlight objective and subjective measures of GFD adherence. As a consequence, a de-novo dietary curriculum specifically addressing the educational requirements for GFD and T1D was developed to study dietary adherence and facilitate evaluation of key dietary components and their impact on study outcomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Primary and Secondary Outcomes for CD-DIET (Celiac and Diabetes-Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12876_2015_413_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>An additional challenge of this trial relates to potential difficulties with individual adherence to their assigned dietary group. As such, significant effort was invested in a patient and family centered dietary experience supported by dietitians with extensive knowledge of diabetes, and a curriculum with subjective and objective assessment for dietary quality and gluten content. A de novo study dietary handbook was also created for the study, with sections focusing on adaption to the GFD highlighting situational approaches and providing gluten-free diabetes-specific nutritional tables for carbohydrates and glycemic index. This paper describes approach and details of the dietary curriculum implemented as part of the CD-DIET study to address the needs and challenges of living with asymptomatic CD and T1D.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The challenge of T1D &#x00026; CD: dietary quality and education</title><p>CD is a unique condition since dietary modification is the only currently recommended and effective treatment. Type 1 diabetes is a challenging condition requiring daily efforts to balance meals, activity, and insulin to maintain adequate metabolic control. It is important to assess the impact of CD on dietary quality and composition as transition to a GFD may pose a risk of nutritional imbalances and/or deficiencies. Dietary inadequacies have been reported to be common with CD. This may be inherent to the diet but also as a result of habitual poorer choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although it has been shown that imbalances from the GFD are no different than the imbalances noted in the healthy population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Gluten-free foods available in Canada, analyzed for macro/micronutrient composition were found to be lower in fiber, iron, calcium, protein, folate and vitamin D and higher in total carbs, fat and sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] than products containing gluten. Similar imbalances including higher fat, lower fiber and nutrient intakes have been noted in children and adults with T1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Compared to their gluten containing equivalents, processed GF foods including breads, cereal bars and pasta have been reported to be higher in total carbohydrates, lower in protein and higher in sodium, saturated fat and cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, many starchy GF foods were noted to have variable mineral content and high glycemic index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. From a Canadian context, both the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) and the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) offer access to pertinent information including nutritional and financial support strategies for each medical condition. However there are limited all-encompassing dietary advice/resources catered to needs of individuals living with the double diagnosis of CD and T1D. A comprehensive literature review including PubMed, Medline, University of Toronto Libraries and various Internet websites investigated what resources are available on the subject. Our research found that the current available literature is limited in providing effective meaningful and tangible resources, tailored to address the short and long term needs and challenges of both conditions, particularly of asymptomatic patients with CD and T1D. At our center we have a unique experience of having the opportunity to follow this population affected by a double diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes and Celiac Disease, combined with an expertise and specialization in this field. A comprehensive curriculum has been developed to address the perceived and noted challenges as practitioners, patients and the literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Impact of CD in T1D: Quality of life (QOL)</title><p>In studies of existing chronic conditions such as diabetes, which involve mandatory daily routines to remain safe, and daily challenges which require problem solving, it is important to evaluate the impact of the double diagnosis (CD and T1D) that may further negatively impact quality of life (QOL). Areas of negative impact in maintaining a GFD have been described as follows: cost maintaining a GFD, and extend to socializing GF including dining out, impact on family, career, travel and religious practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the corresponding negative psychological symptoms and negative emotions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The benefit of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on QOL in asymptomatic screened-detected CD patients remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Asymptomatic patients with CD report better self-perceived health and less concern with their disease prior to dietary modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and over half of patients following a GFD for more than 5&#x000a0;years have reported QOL as excellent or very good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Given these challenges and our clinical experience with our population, a key element of the dietary curriculum is to address all the challenges through education. Information is provided in a supportive, encouraging and individualized manner with regular visits where patients are asked to bring in labels and practice problem solving. The Book&#x02019; Your Guide to Well Being: Managing Celiac Disease and Diabetes&#x02019; is written in a modular form so that patients and their families could refer to various sections that they find pertinent. The book addresses and provides tangible and concrete guidance on living with Type 1 and CD. It addresses in detail all aspects of social life and provides practical advice for incorporating a GFD while eating out, traveling, celebrations, management at school, university, and the workforce. A resource list including support groups, helpful websites, associations and organizations, a detailed list of GF foods with their macro and micronutrient contents including GI is available to support the practical day to day life of CD and T1D. To limit financial barriers, all patients on a GFD are provided with a monthly stipend for their groceries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dietary assignment in a clinical trial: opportunities and challenges</title><p>Symptomatic patients who follow a GFD experience an improvement in symptoms and therefore following a GFD is meaningful. However it is less clear if there are any related benefits to asymptomatic CD patients with T1D who follow a GFD. The CD-DIET Study represents an opportunity to evaluate the impact of a GFD on asymptomatic patients with CD. This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, dietary intervention study in pediatric and adult diabetes centers across Ontario, Canada, that is based on an intention to treat. The study consists of a comprehensive dietary interview with defined subjective and objective parameters. It is designed to address the educational and psychosocial needs and challenges of living and thriving with both conditions: CD and T1D.</p><p>CD-DIET is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with asymptomatic biopsy confirmed CD and T1D. Patients (ages 8&#x02013;45) will be randomly assigned to a GFD or continue with their usual diabetes gluten containing meal plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> study flow diagram). Patients will be followed-up every 3&#x000a0;months where Visit 1 is randomization, Visits 2,3,4 and 5 as 3, 6,9, and 12&#x000a0;months respectively from randomization. We anticipate that this may be a challenge as adherence to dietary advice is reported to be the lowest of all treatment types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] with a range of 36-96&#x000a0;% as strict adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Flow diagram illustrating screening and eligibility for Intervention.

These factors not only are met via the guide developed and described above but have been embedded into the dietary curriculum with opportunities to evaluate knowledge and adherence at every visit. Therefore a robust dietary curriculum which includes a detailed educational plan of what and when information will be relayed, with opportunities for assessment and evaluation of dietary quality, food consumption patterns and adherence, are key elements to the success of this study.</p><p>The dietary curriculum is planned to detect any dietary deficiencies and imbalances of macro and micronutrients as well as dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D and iron using ESHA, a Food Processor with Nutrition Analysis software. The study will also include gluten consumption patterns of the subjects enrolled using the Osborne formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>&#x0201c;Your guide to Well Being: Managing celiac and Diabetes&#x0201d; was designed specifically for the intervention arm (GFD) to address the intricate educational and social needs of both CD and diabetes. It was written in a modular form as an easy to use guide with topics ranging from explaining the diagnosis and managing a GF home to special considerations and travel with T1D.

Based on previous work, in a non-randomized comparison of HbA1c levels over time in type 1 diabetes patients with asymptomatic CD who received a GFD versus patients with type 1 diabetes alone, an increase in HbA1c of 8.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.1&#x000a0;% to 8.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.5&#x000a0;% was observed.10 As such, 91 evaluable individuals per group are required to provide 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference of at least 0.5&#x000a0;% at the 0.05 level of significance. The enrolment of 200 participants will allow for a non-evaluable rate of about 10&#x000a0;%. To reach the recruitment target of 200 individuals, approximately 5000 patients with an established diagnosis of type 1 diabetes will be screened for asymptomatic CD. Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intent-to-treat population consisting of all randomized participants.</p><p>The primary efficacy outcome, the change in HbA1c at 12&#x000a0;months, will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that includes adjustment for baseline HbA1c, age groups and investigative sites.

Significant effect will be declared at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level.</p><p>Severe hypoglycemic episodes over time will be analyzed as Poisson counts using the generalized estimating equations approach to account for correlation among repeated measures within an individual. The QOL data over time will be analyzed by means of a linear mixed effects model including factors for treatment, investigative sites, age groups, and baseline QOL scores.

The dietary curriculum will be coordinated across all centers by the main site dietitian, using standardized educational materials and a manual of operations. Both pediatric and adult patients will be randomized to a GFD or GCD. Adherence to the diets will be determined from the dietary interview, TTG-IgA blood tests and CDAT (GFD) and subjects&#x02019; self-report. CDAT is highly correlated with Standardized Dietician Evaluation (SDE) and even superior to TTG IgA serology with regards to GFD adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The Canadian context to the study is important, as the 2013 Canadian Diabetes Association&#x02019;s clinical practice guidelines suggests a targeted symptom based screening approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. While the literature supports the implementation of a GFD in symptomatic CD and T1D patients, it is less clear as to the benefits for asymptomatic patients. Our curriculum was established in concurrence with the current literature and is designed to address a number of issues: the limited educational literature the challenges associated with dietary quality and adherence and the implicated social challenges of a GF lifestyle in addition to T1D and. Participants will be supported by dietitians throughout the study and subjects on the intervention group and later the control group will have to have access to &#x02018;Your Guide to Well-being: Managing Celiac disease and Diabetes' a resource specifically designed to address the nutritional intricacies and related challenges of both conditions: CD and T1D.</p><p>The dietary quality of the GFD will be assessed through food records and interviews. The literature reports that GF equivalents tend to be lower in micronutrients and fibre, but higher in calories, fat and sodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The participant&#x02019;s diets will be evaluated for deficiencies and imbalances of macronutrients and micronutrients. We will assess the quantity and quality of carbohydrate intake using the glycemic index as well as glycemic load and calculate dietary gluten in our subject population. Dietary gluten quantification was previously demonstrated in Europe and applied to one of our smaller pilot studies with some limitations inherent to methodology and with the Canadian and American nutrient databases. We have described a method to help apply the Osborne calculation in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and plan to correlate adherence to gluten consumption and describe our population&#x02019;s consumption patterns as it relates to CD and T1D.</p><p>Participants will also have the opportunity to report their adherence to the diet that they are randomized to through a &#x02018;self-report&#x02019; questionnaire from &#x02018;strict&#x02019; to &#x02018;partial&#x02019; to &#x02018;non&#x02019; adherent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although some studies show that patients overestimate adherence to GFD and that reliability of self-reports decreases with time on a GFD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], our previous findings show a close correlation between self-reports and dietitians&#x02019; assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>One of the greater challenges with asymptomatic patients if that they report better QOL and health prior to diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
