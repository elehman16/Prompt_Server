Patients experiencing initial seizure duration of 15 seconds (very short) or 120 seconds (very long) achieve a less favorable response to ECT.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Many anesthetic drugs used for ECT have anti-convulsant properties and may decrease the duration of ECT-induced seizure activity in a dose-dependent manner. Use of larger than necessary dosages results in shorting of the duration of ECT-induced seizure activity and could adversely affect the efficacy of the ECT treatments. A delicate balance needs to be maintained to achieve an adequate anesthetic state along with an optimal duration of EEG seizure activity. The essential elements of anesthesia for ECT include rapid loss of consciousness, effective attenuation of the hemodynamic response to the electrical stimulus, avoidance of gross movements, minimal interference with seizure activity, and prompt recovery of spontaneous ventilation, and consciousness. Use of general anesthetic techniques with a rapid onset and recovery is essential to facilitate fast tracking.</p><p>Propofol is associated with less nausea and vomiting,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] faster emergence, better early psychomotor recovery, and better early cognitive recovery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Initial concerns that shorter seizures produced with propofol administration may compromise efficacy have not been empirically supported in the period immediately after ECT and have been offset by its demonstrated advantages.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>This study aimed to compare thiopentone and propofol for use during ECT, the primary outcome measure being the clinical response as assessed by BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) and MMSE (Mini Mental state Examination) scores after the scheduled ECTs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A double-blind, randomized trial was performed following clearance from Institutional Ethical Committee and an informed written consent from all subjects. Adult patients, aged 18 years or older with a major depressive episode as part of a diagnosis of either major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder (International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> edition Code 296), were included in the study. Patients were excluded from the study if they fulfilled criteria for DSM-IV 8 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) substance abuse disorder in the last 12 months; had received ECT within the previous 6 months, or were in ASA III/ IV.</p><p>Over a period of 18 months, a total of 28 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups, based on the choice of anesthetic agent (thiopentone or propofol). 5 of the patients were referred for ECT again during the study period, but were only not included the second time.</p><p>All patients received glycopyrrolate 0.1 mg/kg IV. In group P (<italic>n</italic> = 14), sedation induction was achieved with propofol 1.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV), whereas in group T (<italic>n</italic> = 14), sedation was achieved with thiopentone 3 mg/kg IV. Succinylcholine 0.4 mg/kg IV was given for neuromuscular blockade to reduce the muscle contractions associated with ECT-induced seizure activity. Ventilation is assisted with help of a face mask using a standard Mapleson D breathing system.</p><p>ECT was administered twice a week using a brief-pulse, square-wave, constant-current ECT device [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] (120 mC, 70 Hz/ 0.1 sec). Bilateral ECT was given using the standard bifrontotemporal placement. During the course of ECT, each patient was given maintenance anti-depressant medication by the psychiatrist to reduce the risk of relapse.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Patients are required to fast overnight for solid food, but clear liquids were allowed for taking an oral medication up to 1 h before the procedure.

In successful cases, an initial clinical improvement is usually evident after 3 to 5 treatments.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Maintenance therapy can be performed at progressively-increasing intervals from once-a-week to once-a-month to prevent relapses.</p><p>Mot or seizure may not be visualized in many patients, and yet ECT produces effective seizure as evident by EEG. We did not record the motor seizure, but quantified the seizure by EEG monitoring. Propofol has been found to have more potent anti-convulsant effects during ECT than other IV anesthetics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] However, the use of a minimally hypnotic dose of propofol (0.75 mg/kg) has been associated with a seizure duration that is comparable to standard hypnotic doses of methohexital.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Use of propofol can significantly shorten the duration of seizure activity, and its effect on the anti-depressant action of ECT has been a concern. However, the ECT seizure duration in our study after larger dose of propofol (1.5 mg/kg) was significantly longer than after thiopentone, possibly because higher shock energy was delivered to patients in the propofol group.</p><p>2 reports have compared the anti-depressant efficacy of ECT by using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, HRSD (a 17-item scale that evaluates mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and comorbid anxiety symptoms) and the Beck Depression Inventory (a 21-item self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression) when propofol or methohexital was administered as the primary anesthetic. The HRSD scores symptoms of depression were improved to a similar degree in both anesthetic groups after they completed a standard series of ECT treatments.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In our study, the mean BDI score was significantly less in propofol group, showing it to have a better anti-depressant effect. Significantly, more patients received an increased charge when propofol was used for ECT, probably due to an elevation in seizure threshold caused by propofol. BDI score at completion was significantly lower in the propofol group. This is in accordance with the findings of Cronholm and Ottosson who found more rapid effect of increase in stimulus intensity (but no change in the final degree of improvement).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The increase in cognitive side effect is also a well-known price to be paid for an increased stimulus dose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Acute hemodynamic response during the ECT procedure is reduced with propofol as compared with thiopental. Emergence from propofol anesthesia was only marginally faster than with thiopentone,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] and recovery of cognitive function is similar to thiopentone during the recovery period as seen with MMSE scores.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Anesthetic agents may have different profiles with regard to cognitive impairment. Crossover studies have explored differences in acute cognitive impairment after propofol and barbiturate anesthesia. A recent crossover study compared thiopental and propofol with regard to cognitive deficits in the acute postictal period after ECT using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and concluded that propofol reduces acute cognitive impairment as compared with thiopental.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] We did not find any difference in MMSE score between the propofol group and the thiopental group. The duration of hospitalization was comparable showing no difference in end point of duration of hospitalization.</p><p>Age, sex, and concurrent medical treatment could influence the duration of seizure, degree of cognitive impairment; for example, lithium is known to have the potential to cause postictal delirium.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>The patients are evaluated and managed by the psychiatrist. As far as anesthesiologists are concerned is whether we can help in performing a modified ECT in the sense that seizures are not violent and that hemodynamic stability is maintained, the final aim being complete and faster recovery of patients. We found propofol to be a better drug for ECT as it curbs hemodynamic response, has better recovery and better BDI score.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Although the incidence of myoclonus after propofol was 80% and number of ECT required was more in propofol group, it did not have any effect on the duration of hospitalization or on recovery after the procedure. More studies are required to evaluate regarding the current treatment strategies for ECT and the need for exploring the mechanism of action and for finding reliable indicators of efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
