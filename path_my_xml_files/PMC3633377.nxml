The Framingham study estimates that obesity may be responsible for 26% of cases of hypertension in men and 28% in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Persistent obesity directly raises blood pressure and makes its control more difficult by interfering with the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In contrast to this, loss of body weight leads to lower blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), which is important in the prevention and treatment of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). For every kilogram lost, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreases by about 0.5 to 2 mmHg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p>Obesity is a major health problem in developed countries, and because of its high frequency we are talking about the epidemic of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Obesity is no longer just a problem of developed countries, but it has become an increasing problem in developing countries. It is estimated that worldwide there are 1.1 billion adults and 10% of children who are overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Recent epidemiological studies suggest that according to the number of lost days of healthy life, obesity is among the top ten risks among mass non-communicable diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Research conducted in the Republic of Serbia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) showed a significant association between systolic and diastolic blood pressure values and the body mass index, especially in patients over 60 years of age, increasing value of systolic decreases diastolic blood pressure and increases the value of glucose and lipids in the blood.</p><p>Studies in Africa suggest that the prevalence of hypertension in urban population is 21.3% and it is associated with body mass index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Research conducted in France in 2003 indicates that the prevalence of obesity is 29%; prevalence of hypertension was 24.7% in men, and 22.1% in women, while obesity is cited as a key factor for hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p>Arterial hypertension, by definition, means the measured value of pressure above normal, at least three times in two different time periods. Normal values are considered to be up to 140/90 mmHg, while optimal values are up to 120/80 mmHg. Timely and proper treatment of hypertension undoubtedly can extend life expectancy and significantly contribute to the success of primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, and contribute to a better quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Arterial hypertension is more than high blood pressure. It is not just a cardiovascular risk factor and highly prevalent chronic disease. Arterial hypertension is, as said by Hymann and Pavlik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) barometer of efficient education of the population as general indicator of successful health care in the country. Arterial hypertension is a major independent factor of morbidity and mortality, and this was confirmed by the results of Murray and Lopez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), where it is in the former socialist economies listed as the third risk factor for the lost years of life, just after smoking and alcohol.</p></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>RESEARCH GOALS</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To determine the value of body mass index of

Around 690 million people worldwide suffer from hypertension. At least three million people a year die directly from the consequences of hypertension, while hypertension contributes to many other fatal cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). These and similar studies in this area are few, and this research will contribute to clarify the need for prevention activities in terms of lifestyle changes in the field of nutrition and obesity prevention.</p><p>The study was conducted in family medicine Clinic of the Primary Health Care Center Zenica. Out of 600 patients of both sexes aged 18 years and older we randomly formed group of 188 patients with hypertension and 189 patients without hypertension of the same gender and age. The study included patients with primary or essential hypertension, and excluded patients with secondary hypertension, hypertension due to renal disease, pheochromocytoma, and coarctation of the aorta, as a result of taking oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, and cocaine. Conducted are anthropometric measurements and general physical examination with measurement of blood pressure. Body mass index is computed based on the relationship between body weight and body height: body weight kg / body height m<sup>2</sup>. Performed are three consecutive measurements of blood pressure and mean value is calculated. The measured values were categorized according to the WHO instructions, whereby the hypertension is marked as blood pressure equal to or greater than 140/90 mmHg. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p>The increased value of BMI in the sample with hypertension are present in much higher percentage (87.23%), compared to the tested sample without hypertension (60.10). This is much more than in research conducted in Croatia by Heim and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Their study showed that in the adult population are a little bit more than a fifth of obese ones.</p><p>In patients with hypertension, the highest percentage (51.06%) of patients has the BMI in range between 25 and 30, then BMI in the range between 30 and 35 (25%). BMI of 35-40 have 6.38% of patients, and 3.72 patients over 40.</p><p>In the group of patients without hypertension there was a significantly smaller percentage of respondents compared to the previous group (39.15%) with a BMI in the range of 25-30, then BMI in the range between 30 and 35 (18.51%). BMI of 35-40 had 3.17% of patients, and 1.05 patients has a BMI over 40.</p><p>Contribution of obesity that we obtained in our study is considerably higher than the values that were recorded in the European Union (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.iotf.org">www.iotf.org</uri>). Between 36% and 53% of men is overweight in the European Union. The highest percentage was recorded in Germany (52.9; 2002), Greece (51.1%; 1994-1998), Slovakia (49.7%; 1992-1999) Czech Republic (48.5%; 1997/98), etc. The lowest percentage was in Estonia (35.5; 1994-1998) and France (37.4, 2003). The percentage of women who are overweight is lower, ranging from 24% (France, 2003) up to 37% (Greece, 1994-1998) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p>According to WHO data in Europe is obese one third of adults (130 millions). The average BMI was 26.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, while the index in Croatia in 2003 amounted to 29.93 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and in our study the mean BMI in patients with hypertension was 28.98 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, while in patients without hypertension was 26.45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Mean values of body mass index in both groups of patients were increased, while the group of patients with hypertension significantly higher than the group without hypertension. Tests of significance show that there is a statistically significant difference observed between groups.</p><p>There was a negative correlation between groups of patients with hypertension and without hypertension in relation to the BMI value (Rho = 0.22). Correlation between groups of patients with hypertension and without hypertension according to the value of BMI is determined the presence of strong positive correlation (Rho = 0.737). Noting that the study of BMI in elementary school Jusupovic (2001) found obesity in 15.2% of children without implementation of any preventive action this large percentage of obesity in this population group could be expected. All this is consistent with the results of ATTICA study conducted in Greece, which confirmed the results of previous studies that obesity is associated with various cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, as is the case in our research. Panagiotakos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) noted that obese people were less educated, often with sedentary lifestyle, higher consumption of alcoholic beverages, they were prone to unhealthy diet and had the classic cardiovascular risks. Our studies agree with recently published results of the TROPHI (Trial of Preventing Hypertension) study, which showed that 84% of patients with hypertension have excess body weight. According to data of Framingham Heart Study 78% of hypertension in men and 65% of women can be attributed to obesity. There is a linear correlation with BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</p><p>The fact that the 3% of patients with hypertension and 5% without hypertension stated that obesity has no effect on the health speaks among other things, about the need for preventive work in order to increase level of health culture. Total cholesterol values in patients with hypertension for 57.97% of the cases were increased, which is much higher than in patients without hypertension, 2.32%. Correlation between groups of patients with hypertension and without hypertension compared to HDL indicate the presence of strong negative correlation (Rho = 0.152), while compared to LDL was not statistically significant (Rho = 0.018). Correlation between groups of patients with hypertension and without hypertension compared to triglycerides was statistically significant (pc = 0.123).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><label>6.</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The increased value of BMI in the tested sample with hypertension are present in much higher percentage (87.23%), compared to the tested sample without hypertension (60.10%) with the existence of strong positive correlation (Rho = 0.737).</p><p>The mean value of the BMI in patients with hypertension was 28.98 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, while in those without hypertension 26.45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Must</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Spadano</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Coakley</surname><given-names>EH</given-names></name><name><surname>Field</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>Coldit</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Dietz</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The disease burden associated with over weight and obesity</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>1999</year><volume>282</volume><fpage>1523</fpage><lpage>1529</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10546691</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name><name><surname>D&#x0201c;Agostino</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Parise</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Kannel</surname><given-names>WB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Overweight and obesity as determinants of cardiovascular risc: the Framingham experience</article-title><source>Arch Intern Med</source><year>2002</year><volume>162</volume><fpage>1867</fpage><lpage>1872</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12196085</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Modan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Almos</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Chetrit</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lusky</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Halkin</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Obesity, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and response to antihypertensive drugs</article-title><source>Hypertension</source><year>1991</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>565</fpage><lpage>573</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2013483</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Neter</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Stam</surname><given-names>BE</given-names></name><name><surname>Kok</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Grobbee</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name><name><surname>Gelijanse</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Influence of weight reduction on blood pressure: a meta &#x02013;analysis of randomized controlled trials</article-title><source>Hypertension</source><year>2003</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>878</fpage><lpage>884</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12975389</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>A.G</given-names></name><name><surname>Chobanian</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Predicting obesity in adults from childhood and adolescent weight</article-title><source>Am J Clin Nutr</source><year>2002</year><volume>76</volume><fpage>497</fpage><lpage>498</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12197989</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haslam</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>WP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Obesity</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2005</year><volume>366</volume><fpage>1197</fpage><lpage>1209</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16198769</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Anonymous.
