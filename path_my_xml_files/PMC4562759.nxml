Of 560 eligible patients identified, 279 (50%) declined to participate. The remaining patients were equally randomized to either TM (n=141) or usual care (n=140) for the 6-month study period. TM comprised recording of symptoms, saturation, spirometry, and weekly video consultations. Algorithms generated alerts if readings breached thresholds. Both groups received standard care. The primary outcome was number of hospital admissions for exacerbation of COPD during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Most of the enrolled patients had severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second &#x0003c;50%pred in 86% and &#x02265;hospital admission for COPD in the year prior to enrollment in 45%, respectively, of the patients). No difference in drop-out rate and mortality was found between the groups. With regard to the primary outcome, no significant difference was found in hospital admissions for COPD between the groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.74), and likewise, no difference was found in time to first admission or all-cause hospital admissions. Compared with the control group, TM group patients had more moderate exacerbations (ie, treated with antibiotics/corticosteroid, but not requiring hospital admission; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), whereas the control group had more visits to outpatient clinics (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study of patients with severe COPD showed that TM including video consultations as add-on to standard care did not reduce hospital admissions for exacerbated COPD, but TM may be an alternative to visits at respiratory outpatient clinics.

However, the preferred communication for the patients in our study was either phone or email and not video consultations. As stated previously by Pinnock et al,<xref rid="b8-copd-10-1801" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the positive effect of TM seen in previous trials could thus be due to enhancement of the underpinning clinical service rather than the TM.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of our study include that we have included a large number of patients with a sufficient number of admissions to see a clinically relevant effect of an intervention, and that no patients were lost to follow-up.</p><p>The limitations of our study are the fact that our call centers were only operating Monday to Friday in the daytime, and that we do not have data on the enrolled patients&#x02019; number of visits to their GP during the study period.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that TM in addition to usual care in outpatient clinics did not reduce hospital admissions, but TM may be an alternative to visits at the respiratory outpatient clinic. More studies are needed to establish the optimal follow-up strategy of patients with COPD including the role of TM.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank the NETKOL group (Pia Andersen, Lisbeth &#x000d8;stergaard, Christine Lilliedahl, Torben Lage Frandsen, Jo-Ann Ramsrud Jensen, Lene Nissen, Marie-Louise Pagh S&#x000f8;ndberg, Tanja S.
