Four EDs in England and Wales will collect data for all blunt chest wall trauma patients over a 5-month period; in the initial period acting as the controls (normal care), and in the second period acting as the interventions (in which the new model will be used). Baseline measurements including completion of the SF-12v2 will be obtained on initial assessment in the ED. Patient outcome data will then be collected for any subsequent hospitalisations. Data collection will conclude with a 6-week follow-up completion of two surveys (SF-12v2 and Client Services Receipt Inventory). Analysis of outcomes will focus on feasibility, acceptability and trial processes and will include recruitment and retention rates, attendance at clinician training rates and use of model in the ED. Qualitative feedback will be obtained through clinician interviews and a research nurse focus group. An evaluation of the feasibility of health economics outcomes data will be completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Wales Research Ethics Committee 6 granted approval for the trial in September 2016.

An improvement in the ability to identify the high-risk blunt chest wall trauma patient on initial assessment in the ED would potentially lead to a reduction in these poor outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref>
</p><p>A new prognostic model to assist in the management of blunt chest wall trauma patients in the ED has been developed and externally validated in a large multicentre study.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5&#x02013;7</xref> The model comprises five risk factors: age, number of rib fractures, pre-existing chronic lung disease, use of preinjury anticoagulants and oxygen saturation on initial assessment in the ED.

The trial objectives are to (1) evaluate the infrastructure necessary to perform a future definitive trial, including the Trial Management Group, Trial Steering/Data Management Committee; (2) test the feasibility of the proposed stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised design; (3) evaluate and qualitatively explore the compliance of the clinicians in using the prognostic model (and reasons for non-compliance); (4) assess the appropriateness of the training manual and consistency of training provided by each principal investigator (PI); (5) quantify the number of patients required for a full definitive trial through the estimation of the magnitude of effect and necessary parameters, including the margin of error acceptable to achieve the proposed outcomes; (6) assess the processes of patient recruitment, consent and reasons for non-participation; (7) assess the quantity and potential patterns of missing data; (8) test the feasibility of collecting the proposed outcome measures for a full trial, including optimal time points, using the electronic case report form on the REDCap data collection system; and&#x000a0;(9) decide whether a fully powered, multicentre randomised trial is indicated by formal assessment of feasibility trial findings against pre-set progression criteria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design and randomisation</title><p>This feasibility trial is designed to test the methods of a multicentre, prospective, cluster-randomised (stepped-wedge) trial,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> with a substantial qualitative component. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> outlines the trial procedure. There will be four hospitals participating in the trial, which will be run using a stepped-wedge design. In accordance with Medical Research Council guidance,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> the unit randomisation will be the EDs, rather than patients, since the intervention will be used by ED clinicians, with the aim of studying effects on patient outcomes. All participating EDs will begin as control sites, at the same time, testing conventional management without the model, for a period of 1&#x02009;month (control arm). Every month, following the initial month&#x02019;s data collection period as controls, one hospital will be randomly assigned to become an intervention arm (in which all clinicians in the ED will be using the risk model) sequentially, until all hospitals are acting as interventions.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the trial&#x02019;s timelines.&#x000a0;PI, principal investigator.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-015972f01"/></fig><p>The randomisation process applies to the hospitals (known as clusters) participating in the trial, rather than at a patient level. The order in which hospitals EDs convert to intervention status is based on a purely random process (involving only computer-generated random numbers, but no information on the individual hospitals or EDs) and can be regarded as equivalent to the drawing of names at random. As there are four hospitals participating in the trial, all patient recruitment will be completed over a 5-month period. This trial design will test the feasibility of the classic stepped-wedge design to be used in the future definitive trial.</p><p>During the control period, the doctors in each ED will receive training on the model from the PI in each ED. Each PI will be instructed at the start of the trial on how to train the clinicians and a training manual will be designed and provided.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Population</title><p>Patients will be included in the trial if they present to the ED with isolated blunt chest wall trauma, are aged &#x02265;18 and are capable of giving consent to participation. Potential patients will be excluded if they are under the age of 18, lack capacity to give informed consent, present with any immediately life-threatening injuries or any concurrent injury that will determine the patient&#x02019;s management (rather than the chest trauma). Patients will be withdrawn from the trial if they lose capacity (including death) to complete the surveys and if they request to be withdrawn. These data will be recorded as part of the assessment of the trial&#x02019;s success criteria in order to inform the design of the future definitive trial. A list of all patients who decline to participate will also be completed in order that the trial team can assess the recruitment rates at the end of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and recruitment</title><p>This multicentre feasibility trial will be run in the EDs of the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, Salford Royal Hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary (all large teaching hospitals located in the UK). The clinicians or research nurses in the ED will screen, recruit and consent eligible patients to the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size</title><p>A 5-month recruitment period has been proposed. In 2015, &#x0003e;1200 blunt chest wall trauma patients presented to the ED of the hospital of the trial research team, with &#x0003e;100 of these admitted. If the four participating hospitals recruit for 5&#x02009;months each, between 30&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;80 patients per site should be recruited, allowing for loss to follow-up, low response rates with follow-up surveys and difficulties with recruiting at weekends if research nurses only work Monday to Friday. This sample size is the minimum number of participants considered necessary to test the processes of data collection, based on existing recommendations with respect to the number of patients required to yield meaningful estimates of parameters of interest.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p><p>The analysis will lead to an estimation of the sample size for the definitive trial needed to yield 80% power when using a significance level of 5%, by establishing non-inferiority between use of the prognostic tool and standard care, as revealed by the feasibility study.</p><p>The analysis will include descriptive data (means and SD) on all outcomes collected, including levels of missing data, leading to the calculation of clinically important differences. The conventional sample size calculations for the future definitive trial will be developed using this analysis and the consensus among the Trial Management Group and Trial Steering Committee of the minimal clinically important difference in these measures. If the recruitment and retention plan is shown to be optimistic in this feasibility trial, then this is an important finding which will inform the sample size calculation for the future main definitive trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention being investigated in this study is the use of the prognostic model to guide the clinicians' clinical decision-making. The model will be used by the clinician during the initial patient assessment and will provide a suggestion of the appropriate management in terms of whether the patient can be safely discharged home or whether they need admission to either a ward or critical care. There will be no other differences in patient care. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> describes the patients&#x02019; journey through the trial. All patients will be required to complete one survey (SF-12v2),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> on initial presentation to the ED and two more surveys at 6&#x02009;weeks post&#x000a0;injury (SF-12v2 and a Client Services Receipt Inventory). A sample of the clinicians using the model will be asked to attend a short interview in which they will be asked to discuss the model in relation to clinical practice.

As this is a feasibility trial, the focus will be on establishing the most appropriate framework for a future health economic analysis in the full definitive trial. The feasibility of collecting data on outcome and resource use will be assessed. A provisional assessment of the cost categories associated with the intervention (eg, staff time associated with training and use of the model) will be completed through discussion with the qualitative researcher completing the telephone interviews. To capture resource usage by patients as a result of the intervention, from a National Health Service/Personal Social Service perspective, an adapted resource usage questionnaire will be used.

Stopping criteria will include (1) a 5% increase in each of the hospitals, in the number of patients with an unplanned representation to the ED due to development of complications, leading to I admission and unexpected death (following direct discharge from the ED on initial presentation), in the intervention period compared with the control period; and&#x000a0;(2) a 5% increase in each of the hospitals, in the number of patients identified as having a delayed admission to ICU leading to unexpected death, in the intervention period compared with the control period. The committee will also be responsible for the overall supervision of the trial to ensure the trial is completed according to rigorous sta</p><p>There will be no direct change to patient care; however, once the model has been introduced to each ED, the clinicians will be required to use the prognostic model to guide their management decisions for the patient. The model will <strike>only</strike> be used as a guide to management; however, if the clinician believes the suggestion of the risk score places the patient at risk, they can over-ride the prognostic model. This would be documented and reviewed by the trial team. Although there are a number of expected adverse events for blunt chest wall trauma&#x000a0;patients, the PI may take appropriate urgent safety measures in order to protect research participants against any immediate hazard to their health or safety, without prior authorisation from a regulatory body. Any serious adverse event and urgent safety measures will be reported to the CI immediately with details of the measure and a plan for further action. The chief investigator (CI) or sponsor will notify the main Research Ethics Committee and Trial Steering Committee. Serious adverse events will include (1) death or ICU admission in patients who have been discharged home as suggested by the risk score and (2) any trial patient complaint.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethical issues</title><p>This trial has received ethics approval by the Wales Research Ethics Committee 6 (ref: 16/WA/0290). Any arising important protocol modifications (such as changes to eligibility criteria, outcomes, analyses) will be communicated to the relevant parties (investigators, Research Ethics Committee / International Review Board, trial participants, trial registries, journals, regulators) in a timely manner. Compliance with this will be monitored by the trial sponsor (ABMU Health Board R&#x00026;D Department). Informed consent will be obtained by the clinicians or research nurses who will all have received &#x02018;protocol and informed consent specific training&#x02019; in alignment with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and who have signed the trial delegation log. Consent will be sought, following a full introduction to the study and once the patient has had time to discuss the Patient Information Sheet with a family member/carer (as appropriate). A study withdrawal letter will also be attached to the Patient Information Sheet in case the patient wishes to withdraw consent in the first week following recruitment.</p><p>The trial&#x02019;s CI will take responsibility to ensure that patient anonymity is protected and maintained. Information with regards to study patients will be kept confidential and managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, NHS Caldicott Guardian, The Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care and Research Ethics Committee Approval. All patients will be allocated a study number once informed consent is obtained. Personal data will only be identifiable by this study number during data collection. All patient identifiable data will be removed and data anonymised once data collection using the survey is complete. The CI will act as the custodian of the data and the records will be kept securely for a further 5 years in the Health Board archive facility. The Caldicott Guidelines will be adhered to throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p>Dissemination of the outputs from this trial is proposed through publication in an appropriate <italic>Emergency Medicine Journal</italic> and by presentation at relevant international conferences. The aim of this feasibility trial is not to report definitive results regarding clinical and cost effectiveness; however, any important outputs produced in the trial related to the prognostic model will be published in appropriate medical journals as follow-on articles from our previous published work in this area. We will disseminate our findings to stakeholders via professional meetings. The Trauma and Audit Research Network (TARN) newsletter will be used to disseminate the results to the Trauma leads in each ED participating in TARN in the UK.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e298" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-015972.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e300" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-015972.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors of the paper have contributed to the design of the trial.
