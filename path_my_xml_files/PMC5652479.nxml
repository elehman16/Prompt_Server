POC tests for urine culture, and urine&#x000a0;culture susceptibility testing are commercially available. They can provide a result within 24&#x02009;hours, a delay to treatment which the majority of patients would accept.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The Flexicult SSI-Urinary Kit is commonly used in general practice due to its ease of use and the fact that both culture and susceptibility testing can be performed on the same plate.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Similar chromogenic agars for culture-only exist, but are less commonly used and have not been validated in general practice. The most commonly used antibiotics in Denmark for treatment of acute UTI are pivmecillinam and sulfamethizole. Resistance rates in <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates in urine from primary care in Denmark are approximately 30% for sulfamethizole and 5%&#x02013;10% for pivmecillinam.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Since other uropathogens can be inherently resistant to pivmecillinam, overall resistance would be expected to be 15%&#x02013;20% for this drug. We hypothesised that performing a susceptibility test prior to initiation of treatment could target treatment to the individual patient, potentially reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and leading to faster clinical recovery. This study aimed to investigate the effect of POC culture and susceptibility testing against POC culture&#x000a0;only on the appropriate use of antibiotics and clinical and microbiological cure for patients with suspected uncomplicated UTI in general practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>This study was an open, randomised controlled trial (RCT).

The recruited GPs participated in a prestudy instruction course on handling and reading both POC tests and had to pass an online test measuring ability to diagnose UTI based on photographs of urine cultures prior to the inclusion of patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment of patients</title><p>The inclusion criteria were: women, 18 years or older, presenting to their GP with dysuria, frequency or urgency, for 7&#x02009;days or less and for which the GP suspected uncomplicated UTI, including elderly patients above 65, patients with recurrent UTI and patients with orally treated diabetes without complications. The broader definition of uncomplicated UTI was chosen to ensure applicability to a larger group of patients in general practice. The exclusion criteria were: negative dipstick analysis on both leucocytes and nitrites, serious comorbidities, former participation in the study and patients presenting on a Friday (since POC culture is read the following day). All patients had to consent to wait until the next day to receive the result of the POC test before commencing possible treatment. After informed consent, patients were randomised to either POC culture, or POC culture and susceptibility testing. A urine sample from the same portion of urine was sent to the local microbiological laboratory for culture and susceptibility testing. The GP filled out a case&#x000a0;report form and the patient was asked to fill out a 7-day symptom diary and return to the GP after 14 days for a control urine sample. Validation of the symptom diary has previously been published.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Patients were reminded by text messages and telephone calls to return the diary and bring the control urine sample. Each practice kept an anonymous screening log of patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria but who were not included in the study. GPs received no treatment protocol concerning choice of antibiotics but could decide freely on treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Patient involvement</title><p>One of the secondary outcome measures was clinical cure. This was measured using a content validated symptom diary, where items were generated through cognitive interviews with patients.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Patients could state on their consent form whether they wished to be informed about the results of the study. This will be done using a text message with a short summary and a link after publication. Patients were not involved in the design of the study. All recruiting practices received a poster displaying information about the trial to hang in the waiting room, so patients could enquire about participation in case they were not approached regarding this.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Point-of-care tests</title><p>Culture-only group: The ID Flexicult (SSI DIagnostica, Denmark) is a chromogenic agar allowing identification and quantification of (1) <italic>E. coli</italic>, (2) other Enterobacteriaceae (Gram-negative rods), (3) enterococci, (4) Proteus spp, (5) <italic>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</italic> and (6) <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic> The plate is inoculated with freshly voided urine using a 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;L loop&#x000a0;needle and incubated at 35&#x000b0;C overnight.

Investigated variables were: age, number of days with symptoms, key symptoms (dysuria, frequency and urge), complicating factors and reference culture and susceptibility test. Primary and secondary outcomes were analysed in logistic regression models; clustering within practices was adjusted for by generalised estimating equations. Patient factors (age, number of days with symptoms, key symptoms, and complicating factors) and practice factors (number of GPs and organisation of practice) were investigated for effect modification on the primary outcome.

There was no difference in clinical recovery, despite the difference in appropriate prescribing. This may be partly due to the fact that pivmecillinam has been shown to have a clinical and microbiological effect despite the infecting pathogen being resistant in vitro.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>We aimed at investigating the effect of adding susceptibility testing to POC culture on the appropriate use of antibiotics so the RCT&#x000a0;was the most appropriate design.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> We succeeded in enrolling a sample of GPs with experience in POC culture. These GPs recruited a sample of patients with symptoms of uncomplicated UTI, which was sufficient to detect a small but significant difference between appropriate prescribing based on two different POC culture tests. The inclusion criteria broadened the usual strict definition of uncomplicated UTI, which ensures applicability of our findings to a much broader group of patients in general practice. It may be controversial to include patients with diabetes and recurrent UTI in a sample of patients with uncomplicated UTI, but since these conditions are very common among patients with suspected UTI in general practice and they could be safely included, we decided to include these conditions and investigate whether they modified the effect of the intervention on the outcome. Both the subgroup analysis and the investigation of effect modification indicated that these patients&#x02019; disease was not more complicated than that of young women with no comorbidity. We did not recruit our initially planned sample, but the difference between groups turned out to be larger than originally expected when sample size was calculated. A type I error in determining the superiority of the ID Flexicult is possible since the significance level was not overwhelming, but a type II error in failing to detect the expected superiority of the Flexicult SSI-Urinary Kit is unlikely. Subgroup analysis could easily be subjected to both type I and type II errors and should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Bias in the interpretation of the test was low as described previously.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> GPs were blinded to the result of the reference at the time of deciding on treatment; POC test and reference were performed on the same portion of urine; the reference was adequate for ruling disease in or out and all data were included in the analysis. Allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. It is very unlikely that GPs introduced any selection bias due to strong beliefs of the effect of one of the tests. Applicability of the results was also high, since patients, GPs and tests were very similar to those which would be relevant in daily practice. Patients with negative dipstick results were excluded. Spectrum bias should therefore be considered if the tests are applied to all patients regardless of their dipstick result.</p><p>The study was subjected to clinical review bias in the interpretation process, since the interpreter of the POC tests was not blinded to clinical history. The two groups did not differ in terms of number of symptoms or number of days with symptoms, and patient factors did not seem to have different effects on the two groups, so the difference in this bias between groups was probably minimal. Confirmation bias in the interpretation process could also be present, since treatment had to be initiated based on the result of the test and only patients with suspected UTI were included. GPs were slightly more compliant with regard to the familiar test (culture and susceptibility testing) than with the new test. However, since overtreatment was similar in the two groups, it does not seem to have had a major effect (see&#x000a0;online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix 1</xref>). The number of patients recruited in the two groups was not the same, but if allocation concealment was insufficient leading GPs to avoid recruiting patients when the patient was intended to receive culture without susceptibility testing, we would have expected more patients with any complicating factor in the culture and susceptibility groups, but the opposite was the case. The unequal distribution of patients between the groups was more likely random due to the GPs not recruiting to number. Our trial was open&#x000a0;label and it is possible that ascertainment bias was present if GPs had a stronger belief in one of the tests. Six patients had the wrong test performed, but per-protocol analysis reproduced the ITT findings, suggesting that this was unintentional. The reference, sending urine in boric acid for culture at the microbiological laboratory, has its flaws as previously described.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, these flaws should have a similar effect on the two groups, since the distribution of growth and the resistance pattern did not differ significantly between groups.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018028.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018028supp001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>There are no previous diagnostic RCTs comparing the use of POC culture versus POC culture and susceptibility testing in general practice. A study from 2010 investigated five different management strategies and found differences in antibiotic use (more antibiotics were used when treatment was based only on symptoms) but no difference in patient recovery.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> They found the lowest antibiotic use in the group in which antibiotics were delayed (77%). In comparison, total antibiotic use was 76% for culture&#x000a0;only and 73% for culture and susceptibility testing in this study.</p><p>The significant overall difference in appropriate prescribing between the groups was driven by three factors (none of them individually significant): first, undertreatment; second, treatment with an antibiotic to which the infecting pathogen was resistant and third, inappropriate choice of a second-line antibiotic. The first factor, undertreatment, could be partly due to a slightly lower sensitivity of the Flexicult SSI-Urinary Kit<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and partly to GPs being generally more compliant with a negative result in this group (see&#x000a0;online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix 1</xref>). The second factor, treatment with an antibiotic to which the infecting pathogen was resistant, was surprising and could be partly due to the fact that susceptibility testing in general practice is not always accurate<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and partly due to ID Flexicult possibly being a better test to identify pathogens, thereby identifying the inherent susceptibility pattern. Correct identification of pathogens is essential for determining the inherent susceptibility pattern, since the inherent susceptibility pattern does not necessarily show on the culture plate.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The GPs in our study may have relied too much on their susceptibility test and only looked up the inherent susceptibility when they were forced to do so. The study on the accuracy of the two tests investigated in this study showed that the GPs identified pathogens correctly in about 60% of the positive cultures.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A post&#x000a0;hoc analysis showed that the ID Flexicult was actually significantly better at identifying uropathogens than the Flexicult SSI Urinary kit. However, the most common uropathogen, <italic>E. coli</italic>, does not have inherent resistance to first-line antibiotics, so this second factor may just be a random finding. The third factor, inappropriate choice of a second-line antibiotic, happened in a few cases and none of them had an obvious reason, such as identification of resistance on the practice susceptibility test or patient allergies. The factor expected to drive the difference between the groups: choice of an antibiotic to which the infecting pathogen was resistant, happened in few cases with no difference between the groups. Resistance levels in Denmark are low, and in countries with high resistance rates, the results would probably be different. It remains to be investigated if adding POC susceptibility testing in a high-resistance setting improves prescribing.</p><p>The findings of this study support current recommendations that uncomplicated UTI should not have susceptibility testing performed prior to initiation of treatment. Women generally accepted delaying treatment for 1&#x02009;day to await the POC culture result and inappropriate treatment was low in both groups. If all patients had been treated with first-line antibiotics based on clinical history and positive dipstick finding, then about 45% of patients would have been inappropriately treated compared with 29% in this study (data not shown). Also, total antibiotic use was lower than previously described in a similar setting.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Based on these results, performing POC culture prior to treatment for patients with uncomplicated UTI seems rational, but adding POC susceptibility testing should be reserved for those patients at high risk of a resistant infection or complications or for geographical areas with high levels of resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e198" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018028.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e199" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018028.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the GPs and patients who took part in this study, as well as the UC-Care Research Centre at the University of Copenhagen.
