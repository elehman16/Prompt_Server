Using an Affymetrix microarray, microRNA expression was determined in paired muscle biopsies taken before and after the exercise intervention from 3 patients in each group. Ingenuity pathway analysis with a microRNA target filter was used to identify microRNA transcript targets. These targets were investigated at the mRNA (microarray) and protein (mass spectrometry) levels in patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Endurance exercise altered 39 microRNAs. The microRNAs with increased expression were predicted to target transcripts involved in inflammatory processes, metabolism, and muscle atrophy. Further, these target transcripts had an associated decrease in mRNA expression in exercised patients. In particular, a decrease in the NF-&#x003ba;B regulator <italic>IKBKB</italic> was associated with an increase in its target microRNA (miR-196b). At the protein level, there was an increase in mitochondrial proteins (AK3, HIBADH), which were associated with a decrease in microRNAs that were predicted to regulate their expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Improvement in disease phenotype after exercise is associated with increasing microRNAs that target and downregulate immune processes at the transcript level, as well as decreasing microRNAs that target and upregulate mitochondrial content at the protein level. Therefore, microRNAs may improve disease by decreasing immune responses and increasing mitochondrial biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov

The pathology is characterized by extensive inflammation but also includes signs of skeletal muscle damage such as central nucleation, variation in fiber size, fibrosis, and fiber atrophy. Although its underlying cause is currently unknown, myositis is thought to be autoimmune in origin, given the presence of autoantibodies in more than 50% of patients [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since these disorders involve both muscle and immune responses, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs are currently used for treatment. In particular, glucocorticoids are an effective treatment because they target both the muscles and the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, they have substantial side effects, such as muscle fiber atrophy, that can lead to further muscle damage when taken in large doses or for extended periods of time [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>During the past decade, exercise has been recognized as an effective anti-inflammatory intervention in many chronic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is well known that both skeletal muscle and immune pathways are altered by exercise [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; therefore, exercise as a therapy is particularly relevant to myositis. Recent studies have shown that both resistance and aerobic exercise are well tolerated by polymyositis (PM) as well as dermatomyositis (DM) patients and may be used as a therapeutic intervention to improve disease outcomes. Resistance exercise training for 7 weeks has been shown to increase muscle strength, decrease levels of serum creatine kinase, and improve myositis intention-to-treat activity index (MITAX) scores when compared to baseline measurements [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At the molecular level, global gene expression microarrays show reductions in pro-inflammatory and profibrotic gene networks [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; however, these changes are not observed at the histological level, in part because the inflammation does not occur evenly throughout myositis muscle and because there is a poor correlation between the degree of inflammation and the severity of symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In addition to resistance exercise, endurance exercise training for 12 weeks has also been shown to provide functional benefit. Exercised patients have reduced disease activity, according to the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) score, as well as increases in aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub> max) and muscle fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Analysis of the transcript and protein profiles in these patients indicated improvements in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and angiogenesis, with concomitant reductions in inflammatory and atrophy-related signaling [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the upstream mechanisms, such as microRNAs, that regulate changes in gene expression in the muscle are unknown.</p><p>MicroRNAs, which are small non-coding RNA molecules, are important regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and function by either inhibiting translation or degrading transcripts once they are bound to a specific seed sequence located in target mRNA. MicroRNAs can target numerous transcripts and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In skeletal muscle, microRNAs have been shown to be important during myogenic differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and their dysregulated expression has been found in inflammatory myopathies [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to suppress the expression of microRNAs that are important for muscle differentiation and maintenance, connecting chronic inflammation with muscle degeneration in myositis [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in myositis is partially attributed to activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is expressed by both muscle and immune cells and is targeted by glucocorticoids. Therefore, we hypothesized that exercise improves the disease phenotype by altering the expression of microRNAs that target both muscles and immune processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>The data collected here are part of a larger randomized, controlled parallel trial evaluating the effect of endurance exercise in myositis skeletal muscle at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden titled &#x02018;Physical Exercise as a Targeted Therapy in Patients with Chronic Rheumatic Muscle Disease&#x02019; (For full trial protocol, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183292.s005">S1 File</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01184625).

First, NF-&#x003ba;B activation, which is a known regulator of skeletal muscle inflammation in myositis, occurs downstream of <italic>IKBKB</italic>, which transcribes the beta subunit (IKK-&#x003b2;) for the IKK enzyme complex. Second, <italic>IKBKB</italic> is essential for classical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, which induces proinflammatory cytokine production.

To determine if increased miR-196b expression was associated with decreases in classical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, we immunoblotted for total I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; protein. I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; functions as an inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B by keeping NF-&#x003ba;B in its inactive state through sequestration within the cytoplasm and blocking its ability to bind to DNA. Further, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; protein levels are regulated through degradation induced by IKK-&#x003b2; (<italic>IKBKB</italic>).

Since exercise directly targets the muscle, myositis patients were traditionally advised not to exercise out of fear for exacerbating existing muscle damage and inflammation. However, substantial evidence has shown that a consistent exercise regimen exerts anti-inflammatory effects and may be beneficial to individuals with multiple chronic inflammatory conditions [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In myositis, exercise provides clinical benefit and is an attractive therapy because it non-invasively targets skeletal muscle with relatively few to no side effects [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Previous studies have tried to link clinical improvements with underlying molecular mechanisms; however, these studies have only examined global gene and protein changes [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Currently, there are no studies that examine how exercise affects potential genetic regulators, such as microRNAs. This is the first study that has tried to integrate exercise-induced microRNA alterations with subsequent target gene and protein expression.</p><p>One of the major issues in studying rare neuromuscular diseases is the heterogeneity of the patient population. A main strength of this study is the experimental setup in which skeletal muscle was taken from paired muscle biopsies of myositis patients before and after an aerobic exercise intervention. This controlled for the wide variability seen in the disease phenotype since each patient was normalized to its baseline level. Additionally, there are two previously published studies using larger, separate cohorts of endurance exercised patients so we were able to use an evidence-based approach by cross-referencing both array and functional data [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Since our cohorts were different, we repeated both transcriptomics using a different platform (Illumina instead of Affymetrix) and proteomics using a different approach (SuperSILAC instead of isobaric mass tagging). We hypothesized that microRNAs regulate processes involved in the both the muscles and the immune system. Specifically, we found that exercise induced the expression of microRNAs that targeted mRNA transcripts as well as proteins involved in suppressing inflammation, promoting muscle growth, and improving aerobic respiration in skeletal muscle after a 12-week endurance-exercise intervention in myositis patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183292.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Our findings suggest that exercise-induced microRNAs help to regulate the genetic, proteomic, and functional benefits previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0183292.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183292.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Exercise induces microRNAs that target transcripts and proteins important for muscle and immune response.</title><p>Exercise-induced microRNAs help improve disease outcomes in myositis by modulating transcripts and proteins important for aerobic metabolism, immune response, and muscle atrophy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0183292.g004"/></fig><p>Pathway analysis of exercise-induced changes in microRNA revealed that exercise-induced microRNAs primarily down-regulate transcripts involved in immune response, glycolytic metabolism, and muscle atrophy.

To further explore this, we used targeted gene expression analysis and found that <italic>IKBKB</italic> mRNA was reduced following exercise training, in accordance with increased mir-196b expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183292.t003">Table 3</xref>). <italic>IKBKB</italic> is an upstream modulator of NF-&#x003ba;B and assists in its translocation to the nucleus by marking NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitors (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;) for degradation by proteosomes.

Further, there was a variable response between patients when examining total amounts of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; protein after exercise. To further explore the effect of exercise on this pathway, a larger cohort of myositis patients is needed.</p><p>We further explored how microRNAs influence the regulation of protein expression, since microRNAs are known to influence gene expression through either transcriptional degradation or translational repression. We established that most the proteins regulated by microRNAs (AK3, HIBADH) are localized within mitochondria and are suggestive of increased mitochondrial biogenesis. This is in agreement with previous studies that have shown increases in the aerobic respiration of exercised patients [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the microRNAs that were predicted to target these proteins were downregulated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183292.t003">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that microRNAs regulate aerobic metabolism and could contribute to patients&#x02019; functional improvements in aerobic respiration after endurance exercise [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The number of proteins altered by exercise involved in inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183292.t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183292.g004">Fig 4</xref>) was much lower than at the transcript level. This is most likely due to limitations within our method for protein detection. Many of the inflammatory proteins were not present as we used healthy myotubes as an internal standard. Despite this, we were able to detect a possible microRNA-mediated increase in APEX1, which has been previously shown to relieve oxidative stress during an acute bout of exercise in skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In summary, exercise induces changes at the microRNA level that target genes at both the transcriptional and protein levels that are implicated in immune responses, aerobic metabolism, and muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183292.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Interestingly, similar effects have been reported in healthy individuals after exercise [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183292.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], suggesting that myositis muscle may adapt to training in a manner that is comparable to healthy muscle. This could suggest that inflammation is a driving factor in disease pathogenesis; however, several studies have shown that inflammation is poorly correlated with myositis muscle pathology [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which indicates a role for non-immune mechanisms in disease pathogenesis. Therefore, it is possible that exercise targets not only inflammatory pathways, but also additional non-immune pathogenic pathways implicated in the muscle. This is supported by studies showing that myositis patients on immunosuppressive therapies have impairments in aerobic capacity when compared to healthy age and physical activity matched controls [<xref rid="pone.0183292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this case, although exercise has similar effects in both healthy and myositis muscle, exercise becomes therapeutic because it targets both immune and non-immune mechanisms implicated in disease. However, further studies comparing exercise in healthy control and myositis muscle are needed to answer this question.</p><p>Because of the side effects of glucocorticoids, patients can only take small dosages that aim to balance the treatment of symptoms with negative off-target effects associated with prolonged use. Because of these dosage restrictions, the dosage may be sufficient to clear systemic inflammation that causes the infiltration of immune cells into the muscle, but it may not be high enough to target NF-&#x003ba;B activation in the muscle effectively without producing severe side effects such as muscle atrophy and wasting. Therefore, exercise may be able to target NF-&#x003ba;B in the muscle better than the current doses of glucocorticoids can, and this improved targeting could help to explain the overall improvement in patients after endurance exercise. Endurance exercise may act as a glucocorticoid-sparing intervention, or it may supplement and work in combination with glucocorticoid usage to permit patients to receive lower doses, reduce unwanted side effects, and give maximal benefit for disease treatment. Further studies validating these microRNAs in a separate larger cohort of exercise patients are needed to determine significance and to further understand the molecular mechanisms that result in disease improvement after exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183292.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Altered microRNAs after endurance exercise in myositis patients.</title><p>This table shows the full data set of microRNAs that were found to be altered after 12 weeks.</p><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183292.s001.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183292.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>IPA&#x02019;s MicroRNA target filter results.</title><p>This table shows the full list of transcripts that the mapped microRNAs are predicted to target.</p><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183292.s002.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183292.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Expression pairing of microRNA with mRNA in exercised patients.</title><p>This table associates the changes in transcript expression to changes in microRNA expression.</p><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183292.s003.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183292.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Altered proteins after endurance exercise.</title><p>This table shows the full data set of protein changes that were identified by mass spectrometry.</p><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183292.s004.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183292.s005"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Trial study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183292.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183292.s006"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183292.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Vincent Mouly for the human life-extended myotubes that were labeled and used as the internal standard for the mass spectrometry experiments and Dr. Deborah McClellan for editorial assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0183292.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hengstman</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>van den Hoogen</surname><given-names>FH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>van Engelen</surname><given-names>BG</given-names></name>. <article-title>Treatment of the inflammatory myopathies: update and practical recommendations</article-title>. <source>Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy</source>. <year>2009</year>;<volume>10</volume>(<issue>7</issue>):<fpage>1183</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>90</lpage>.
