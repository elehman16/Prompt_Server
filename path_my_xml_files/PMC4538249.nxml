Despite impressive early gains in the intervention study, this highlights the need for an ongoing close follow-up of patients with diabetes.</p><p>The increase in HbA1c and the risk of cardiovascular events in the next 10&#x02005;years can be explained by the lack of systematic follow-up by the pharmacist. We were informed by the participating pharmacists that patients returned to receiving usual care after the study was completed. Until recently, there was no remuneration system for pharmacists in Alberta, Canada, which was considered as a barrier to follow-up. Disease progression and the lack of optimal insulin dose titration/stopping insulin may have also contributed to this increase. Indeed, it has been reported that patients with type 2 diabetes experience an average loss of 5% of insulin production capacity, per year, after diagnosis.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The findings of this study highlight the impact of structured pharmacist intervention on glycaemic control in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Patients&#x02019; HbA1c improved by 1.8% (95% CI 1.4 to 2, p&#x0003c;0.001) over 6&#x02005;months while receiving the pharmacist&#x02019;s intervention; however, their HbA1c increased by 0.8% (95% CI &#x02212;1.1 to &#x02212;0.5, p&#x0003c;0.001) 12&#x02005;months after completing the study. It is also important to note that the gains from the intervention were not completely lost 12&#x02005;months after completing the study as the baseline HbA1c was 9.1% and 88% of the patients were still taking insulin. If maintained, this change from baseline has the potential to have a significant impact on future diabetes-related complications.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>This study is not without limitations. We did not have any data on the patients&#x02019; cholesterol/HDL ratio and this could affect their risk of cardiovascular events in the next 10&#x02005;years, which is a surrogate marker, therefore, we used a ratio &#x02018;4.9&#x02019; which makes no contribution to the overall risk<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and assumed that there were no changes to this ratio over time to avoid any effect those changes may have on the risk of cardiovascular events in the next 10&#x02005;years. Also, no formal methods were constructed to track whether pharmacist follow-up visits had occurred beyond study completion. Pharmacists in Alberta, Canada have access to the Provincial Electronic Health Records (Alberta Netcare), where they can access important health information that was ordered by them or by other healthcare professionals. This system was created to improve the healthcare that is provided to the public. Key health information collected at different interactions with different healthcare professionals at a variety of locations gets recorded in the health records and then will be made available to all the healthcare professionals involved in the patient&#x02019;s care.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This can affect the generalisability of the study results.</p><p>The findings of the RxING study took the evidence for the benefits of pharmacist care in diabetes one step further, as it proved that pharmacists can systematically identify patients with poor glycaemic control, educate and support them to achieve better outcomes on top of the known fact that insulin prescribing will improve glycaemic control.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The 12-month postcompletion data suggest that systematic patient follow-up should be continued in order to maintain glycaemic control improvement. This supports the important role that pharmacists can play in improving glycaemic control in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the participation of the following pharmacists and pharmacies in making this study possible: Rick Siemens (London Drugs, Lethbridge), Darsey Milford (Turtle Mountain Pharmacy, Bellevue), Rita Bowron, Rami Chowaniec, Nader Hammoud, Carol Wei, Sheilah Kostecki (Safeway Pharmacy, Edmonton and Calgary), Anita Brown (Shoppers Drug Mart, Okotoks), Janelle Fox, Tony Nickonchuck (Walmart Pharmacy Cold Lake and Peace River), Rita Lyster (Rita's Apothecary and Home Healthcare, Barrhead) and Anita and Warren Dobson (Medicine Shoppe, Calgary).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> RTT and YNA H took part in study concept and design.
