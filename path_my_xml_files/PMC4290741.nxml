expensive.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To assess the impact of a low-cost intervention designed to improve medication
adherence and clinical outcomes in post-discharge patients with CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>A pilot RCT was conducted at a teaching hospital. Intervention was based on the
four-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4). The primary outcome measure
was medication adherence assessed using the eight-item MMAS at baseline, at 1
month post hospital discharge and re-assessed 1 year after hospital discharge.
Other outcomes included readmission and mortality rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>61 patients were randomized to intervention (n = 30) and control (n = 31) groups.
The mean age of the patients was 61 years (SD 12.73), 52.5% were males, and 57.4%
were married or living with a partner. Mean number of prescribed medications per
patient was 4.5 (SD 3.3). Medication adherence was correlated to intervention (p =
0.04) and after 1 month, 48.4% of patients in the control group and 83.3% in the
intervention group were considered adherent. However, this difference decreased
after 1 year, when adherence was 34.8% and 60.9%, respectively. Readmission and
mortality rates were related to low adherence in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The intervention based on a validated patient self-report instrument for assessing
adherence is a potentially effective method to improve adherent behavior and can
be successfully used as a tool to guide adherence counseling in the clinical
visit. However, a larger study is required to assess the real impact of
intervention on these outcomes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiovascular Diseases</kwd><kwd>Medication Adherence</kwd><kwd>Patient Discharge</kwd><kwd>Patient Discharge Summaries</kwd><kwd>Randomized Controlled Trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Research Foundation for the State of Alagoas</funding-source><award-id>EFP00000889</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Trial registration: Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Cl&#x000ed;nicos RBR-26ydc3.</p><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Medication adherence can be defined as the extent to which patients follow the
instructions they are given for prescribed treatments<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Adherence is a determinant of high-quality outcomes, yet
studies indicate that 20% to 50% of patients - across gender, age, and ethnic cohorts
and with various medical disorders - do not take their medications as
prescribed<sup><xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. This is a growing concern to clinicians and healthcare
systems because of mounting evidence that non-adherence is prevalent and associated with
adverse outcomes and higher costs of care<sup><xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In the setting of
chronic medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, medication non-adherence
leads to worse medical treatment outcomes, higher hospitalization rates and increased
health care costs<sup><xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Even after hospitalization, adherence problems may
persist due to inadequate knowledge about the treatment, lack of understanding or
excessive complexity<sup><xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p>A variety of interventions have been tested with the goal of improving patient
adherence. However, despite several types of interventions demonstrating effectiveness
in improving medication adherence in chronic medical conditions, few significantly
affected clinical outcomes<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. A
Cochrane Database review concluded that almost all of the interventions that were
effective for long-term care were complex, including combinations of more convenient
care, information, reminders, self-monitoring, reinforcement, counseling, family
therapy, psychological therapy, crisis intervention, manual telephone follow-up and
supportive care. Even the most effective interventions did not lead to large
improvements in adherence and treatment outcomes<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>We have developed our intervention based on patient responses to the questions of a
self-reporting instrument for assessing adherence to medications<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Based on a previous study<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that this low-cost intervention would improve
measured adherence and reduce exacerbations requiring emergency department visits or
hospitalization. The present study assessed an intervention in post-discharge patients
with CVD taking prescribed drugs with the aim of improving medication adherence and
clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>We performed a randomized controlled, single-center trial with patients allocated to
intervention <italic>versus</italic> usual care between October 2010 and April 2011.
A computer program randomized patients using minimization with a random element to
ensure that the 2 trial arms are not significantly different on 5 key variables: age,
gender, number of drugs per patient, surgical procedure during hospitalization and
diagnosis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of patients
throughout the study.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abc-103-06-0502-g01"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>A 300-bed cardiovascular clinic of a private urban teaching hospital, in the city of
Macei&#x000f3;, state of Alagoas, Northeast Brazil. The state of Alagoas has one of the worst
human development indices (HDI) in Brazil.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>We recruited and obtained consent from consecutive patients who were discharged from
cardiovascular clinics and who were prescribed antihypertensive medication.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated to brief intervention or usual care and we used an
intent-to-treat approach and thus ignored subsequent changes to regimens, treatment
interruptions, and treatment termination.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection</title><p>We had to strike a careful balance between early intervention and enough time for
participants to demonstrate variance in medication adherence, thus our decision was
to assess adherence at baseline and 1 month post-hospital discharge. Later, we
re-assessed adherence 1 year after hospital discharge, as well as readmission and
mortality rates; both clinical outcome measures were included to correlate adherence
and effectiveness of intervention. Therefore, consenting participants were contacted
by phone call by a trained lay interviewer at 2 moments: a) 1 month after their
event, when they were asked to answer the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale
(MMAS-8)<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>; b) 1 year after
their event, when they were once again asked to complete MMAS-8 and to report the
number of hospitalizations related to CVD during the study year. Patients that were
randomized to the intervention group were contacted again by phone on the same day (+
5 days) of the first application of MMAS-8, during this telephone contact. Questions
about the medications were discussed with these patients by the research pharmacists.
Deaths were confirmed via death certificate. The study was closed 12 months after the
last patient had been discharged. Patients who had been readmitted to the study site
hospital during the 12-month follow-up period did not receive the intervention
again.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Aiming maximum inclusiveness, we recruited all patients who had a discharge diagnosis
of CVD and who were on antihypertensive medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients were excluded if they reported they were already using any tool to improve
adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>The Federal University of Alagoas institutional review board approved the study
protocol and consent form.</p></sec><sec><title>Measuring Adherence</title><p>Medication adherence - the primary outcome measure in the evaluation of this trial
was assessed by phone call through the MMAS-8, an 8-item self-report scale for
measuring medication-taking behavior developed from a previously validated 4-item
scale<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and supplemented with
additional items to better assess barriers to adherence behavior (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Chart 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">2</xref>). Each of the 8 items measures a specific medication-taking behavior and
not a determinant of adherence behavior. The new scale has been determined to have
higher reliability compared with the 4-item scale (a = .83 vs a = .61)<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The MMAS scores can range from 0 to
8 and have been previously trichotomized into the following 3 levels of adherence to
facilitate use in clinical practice: high adherence (score = 8), medium adherence
(score, 6 to &#x0003c; 8), and low adherence (score, &#x0003c; 6)<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Prior research revealed that the new scale is
significantly associated with blood pressure control in patients with
hypertension<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In our study, we used a validated
version in Portuguese of the MMAS-8<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Patients were considered adherent if they had a score equal to 8
(high adherence)<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Chart 1</label><caption><p>The 4-Item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4)</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.

non-adherence - unintentional non-adherence (which occurs when patients wish to
adhere to medications, but are prevented from taking medications due to some reason;
it is based on forgetfulness and clarification regarding the medical regimen) and
intentional non-adherence (which occurs when patients deliberately do not take their
medications; it is based on withdrawing medications when feeling better or
worse)<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, we have developed our intervention based on MMAS-4
questions, which has been shown to be predictive of adherence to cardiovascular
medications and blood pressure control, aiming to prevent both intentional and
unintentional non-adherence behavior, INAB and UNAB, respectively.</p><p>This protocol consisted of 2 distinct parts: patient-centered verbal instructions (to
prevent INAB and UNAB) and written material about prescribed medications (to prevent
UNAB). Interventions to enhance medication adherence in chronic medical conditions
may be grouped by type<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, as follows: (I) <italic>informational</italic> interventions
describe cognitive strategies designed primarily to educate and motivate patients by
instructional means, based on the concept that patients who understand their
condition and its treatment will be more informed, empowered, and likely to comply
(e.g.: face-to-face oral, telephone, written, or audiovisual education; didactic
group class; and mailed instructional material - not including reminders or prompts
to comply); (II) <italic>behavioral</italic> interventions are strategies designed to
influence behavior through shaping, reminding (cues), or rewarding desired behavior
(reinforcement), examples include skill building by a health care professional,
pillboxes, calendars, a change in packaging, or other steps intended to remind the
patient; changes in dosage schedule to simplify the regimen or tailor the regimen to
the patient's daily routine (i.e., reduce its behavioral demands); and rewards and
reinforcement (e.g., assessment of adherence with feedback to the patient); (III)
<italic>family and social</italic> interventions involve social support
strategies, whether provided by family or another group (e.g. support groups and
family counseling)<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Our combined
intervention included features of I and II of the preceding categories.</p><p>The main elements of the discharge counseling were as follows: a) information about
disease process/prognosis; b) information about discharge medications (e.g.,
therapeutic goals; how to monitor drug treatment, especially the consequences of
abrupt cessation of antihypertensive treatments and adverse drug reactions that may
be causes of withdrawal; and how to handle inaccurate dosing systems or unusual
dosage forms). Subjects considered critical to success of treatment were discussed
with the patient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t03">Chart 3</xref> - please see
additional File 2). Additional information (e.g., dosage schedule) was written on a
drug treatment card adapted as a refrigerator magnet.</p><table-wrap id="t03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Chart 3</label><caption><p>Points to discuss with patients and suggested recommendations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="rows"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMAS-4 question</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Do you ever forget to take your medicine?</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Do you ever have problems remembering to take your

same questions (from the MMAS-8 and about readmission events) by phone at the same
moments as the intervention group. Moreover, they were visited before discharge by a
research-team member in order to disguise the lack of testing intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>We estimated that a sample size of at least 19 patients in each group would provide
80% power to detect a 40% difference, based on baseline adherence and results from a
previously performed pilot investigation in medication adherence by using a t-test
with a 2-sided &#x003b1; level of 0.05<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.
Unlike this, difference in adherence between groups is generally small in randomized
clinical trials<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. However,
we did not find any study that included concurrent post-discharge patients with CVD
and MMAS as the adherence measure, or even studies with an intervention based on its
own assessment tool. We believe that this shared mechanism leads to higher adherence
scores in intervention group and consequently increases effect size.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Bivariate comparisons between groups were performed using chi-square test for equal
proportions (or Fisher's exact tests where numbers are small) and reported as numbers
and percentages. Continuous normally distributed variables (determined by
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) were compared using ANOVA and reported as means (standard
error). Backward stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine
independent correlates of medication adherence. These statistical analyses were
performed using the statistical program package SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, Illinois). The researcher (S.F.N.) responsible for analyzing readmission and
adherence data was blinded regarding the group to which the patients had been
randomized.</p><p>The magnitude of the intervention effect (Cohen's <italic>d</italic>) was calculated
by subtracting the MMAS-8 mean score of the control group from the MMAS-8 mean score
of the intervention group and dividing the result by the pooled standard
deviation<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. A Cohen's d of
0.5 thus indicates that the mean of the intervention group is half a standard
deviation larger than the mean of the control group. Values of d from 0.56 to 1.2 can
be assumed to be large, 0.33 to 0.55 are moderate, and 0 to 0.32 are small<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. This measure is independent from the
method of adherence measurement used, thus permitting comparison of different
interventions across studies. In this way, it provides more information than a simple
test of significance comparing outcomes in intervention and control groups<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 73 patients invited to participate in the study, 11 declined. Of 62 randomized

interventions were generally poorly described, and failed to adhere to theoretical
models<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Subsequent reviews
have found few consistent associations between the characteristics and effectiveness of
interventions to improve adherence<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Kripalani et al<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> observed that behavioral interventions that reduced dosing
demands of individual therapies consistently improved adherence<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>; other successful interventions usually
contained multiple elements delivered over time. However, none of these reviews focused
on medication adherence after hospital discharge. In a Cochrane Database
review<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, no evidence of
difference in adherence to medication was observed after two pharmacy discharge
plans.</p><p>In contrast to these findings, our intervention based on MMAS-4 improved medication
adherence score after 1 month. In addition, control of potential confounding factors
(e.g. age, gender, marital status, number of prescribed medications, undergoing surgery
during hospitalization and main diagnosis) did not influence the results. This effect
may be due to several causes. First, we used a measure of medication-taking behavior
based on the same pattern of intervention; although the eight-item scale has shown
better psychometric properties than the original 4-item scale<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, some questions are identical.</p><p>Second, although 12 different classes of drugs were used by the patients' physicians, a
narrow variety of drugs inside theses classes were prescribed (mostly aspirin,
enalapril, losartan, clopidogrel and rosuvastatin). Such rigid adherence to medical
guidelines, although leading to excessive costs, permitted us to focus our efforts on a
restricted number of therapies.</p><p>Third, our intervention was centered on subjects considered critical to treatment
success and it may be related to a MMAS-8 question commonly answered incorrectly among
non-adherent patients: "Have you ever cut back or stopped taking your medication without
telling your doctor because you felt worse when you took it?" Burnier<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> states that it appears that an
effective, convenient drug regimen that is relatively free of side effects, combined
with a positive and supportive approach to treatment, will therefore yield the best
results in terms of facilitating adherence and persistence with antihypertensive
therapy<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In our study,
physicians reported that some patients came back or contacted them by phone after an
adverse drug event for which they were warned during a counseling session, instead of
stop taking their medication.</p><p>Fourth, the presence of a Hawthorne effect was considered and must not be ignored;
however, patients in the control group were visited by a research-team member in order
to disguise the lack of testing intervention. A systematic review performed by Schlenk
et al<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> observed that, because of the
nature of the interventions, the investigators were not able to blind the participants
and interventionists to group assignment, which could produce Hawthorne, novelty, and
experimenter effects in the intervention group subjects. For all practical purposes, our
patients were blinded about the treatment that was used.</p><p>Fifth, in the pilot study we observed that longer counseling sessions (e.g. 20 to 40
minutes) led to a few patients' refusal of continuation of intervention. Thus, we
believe that a shorter intervention tends to be more comprehensive and effective. It is
also noted that acceptability of intervention among patients was high.</p><p>However, the positive effect of the intervention decreased significantly (p = 0.203)
after 1 year, which may be due to the fact that this study did not have sufficient power
to detect a 26% reduction in adherence (Cohen's <italic>d</italic> = 0.643) as a
meaningful difference. Kripalani et al<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> state that many similar studies were relatively small and not
sufficiently powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes. On the other side, a
high effect size - as foreseen in this pilot study - does not require a large sample and
both probability of detecting a difference and the power are both high as well. A sample
size of at least 30 patients in each group would provide 80% power to detect a 33.5%
increase in medication adherence; and we observed a 35% difference after 1 month.
However, as a pilot study, our study was in fact underpowered for more nuanced
differences in long-term adherence and other outcomes.</p><p>Our study had other limitations. For example, the intervention was delivered by 2
pharmacists, which limits the generalizability of our findings. Because of multiple
components of intervention (e.g. verbal counseling based on INAB and UNAB and written
materials) we could not attribute intervention effects to any single component. Although
patients, prescribers and the researcher responsible for analyzing study data were
blinded to the group, the pharmacists who performed data collection were not. We also
had limited information about other medications used during the follow-up year.
Intervention itself was limited by lack of ongoing contact. Carter et al<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> suggest that continued interventions may
be necessary to maintain high rates of BP control, especially in those patients who lose
BP control. And this may be why the intervention did not led to better clinical outcomes
after 1 year. At this time point, adherent patients in both groups had significantly
lower rates of readmission and mortality, and once the effect of intervention on
adherence dissipated, we believe that the same intervention involving ongoing contact
may positively influence these clinical outcomes. Murray et al<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, for instance, provided a 9-month multilevel
intervention to support medication management in outpatients with heart failure who had
low health literacy and limited resources, with a 3-month post-study phase, improving
adherence to cardiovascular medications and decreasing health care use and
costs<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Finally, 8 (11%)
patients declined to participate. While one patient refused to participate because of
the possibility of being assigned to the placebo condition, five patients claimed not
having time to participate and two declared themselves anxious to go home. Although this
occurred at pre-randomization and does not affect internal validity, it may affect the
generalizability of our study.</p><p>While non-adherence to medications is common for patients with CVD, who might be less
likely to take their medication as prescribed because hypertension is asymptomatic, many
studies have described the association between medication adherence and clinical
outcomes<sup><xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. A meta-analysis
revealed that the odds of good blood pressure control among patients adherent to
anti-hypertensive medications, compared to those who were non-adherent was 3.44 [95%
confidence interval 1.6-7.37]<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> .
Although we did not measure blood pressure as part of the study and cannot determine the
association between self-reported medication adherence and blood pressure control,
previous studies demonstrated a significant association between the MMAS-8 score and
blood pressure control<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>Nair et al<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> state that medication
adherence appears to be a patterned behavior established through the creation of a
routine and a reminder system for taking the medication. In addition, control of
hypertension - as one of the most important interventions to prevent coronary heart
disease, stroke, heart failure and end stage renal disease - may be achieved by
continued efforts on development of simple and feasible interventions to improve
medication adherence. Gehi et al<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>
findings suggest that self-reported adherence may be a simple and straightforward method
to identify patients at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with
Coronary Heart Disease. Similarly, it seems plausible that interventions designed to
improve self-reported adherence can positively affect clinical outcomes. Our findings
suggest that self-report methods of measuring medication-taking behavior, such as
MMAS-4, may be integrated into the clinical visit in which the health care provider
interacts with the patients in assessing adherence behavior and provides immediate
feedback and counseling as to how barriers - such as forgetting, misunderstandings - can
be addressed, as well as provide reinforcement for good adherence behavior<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p><p>Despite the encouraging results, we need to examine other behavioral determinants that
may influence medication adherence and clinical outcomes. These results need to be
replicated using a multicenter, randomized strategy, and such a study is already being
carried out in patients with chronic CVD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on these findings, we conclude that a brief intervention based on a patient
self-report instrument for assessing medication adherence is a potentially effective
method to improve adherent behavior - which was correlated, in our investigation, to
readmissions and mortality rate - in post-discharge patients with CVD taking prescribed
drugs. However, a larger study is required to assess the real impact of intervention on
these outcomes. Although updated by MMAS-8 as a research method for assessing adherence
to medications, MMAS-4 can still be used as a guide for an educational intervention in
the clinical setting, whereby the health care provider asks the intentional and
unintentional adherence questions to the patient and provides guidance and counseling to
the patient based on the response.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>
