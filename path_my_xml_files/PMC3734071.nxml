As a result, the development of cost effective stress prevention or stress management approaches has become an important endeavor of current research efforts. Music has been shown to beneficially affect stress-related physiological [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as well as cognitive [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and emotional processes [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, the use of listening to music as an economic, non-invasive, and highly accepted intervention tool has received special interest in the management of stress and stress-related health issues.</p><p>The experience of stress arises when an individual perceives the demands from the environment &#x02018;&#x02026;as taxing or exceeding his or her resources and endangering his or her well-being' [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Accordingly, physiologic stress effects are regulated by top-down central nervous system processes (=<italic>cognitive</italic> stress component, e.g. &#x02018;I can&#x02019;t cope with the situation&#x02019;), as well as by sub-cortical processes within the limbic system (=<italic>emotional</italic> stress component, e.g. &#x02018;anxiety&#x02019;). Both areas forward their messages (e.g. &#x02018;I am in danger!&#x02019;) via neuronal pathways to a central control system, the hypothalamus [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The hypothalamus is closely intertwined with two major stress systems, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (=<italic>physiologic</italic> stress component, i.e. endocrine and autonomous responses). Together, the HPA axis and the SNS orchestrate various psychological (e.g. emotional processing) and physiological (e.g. endocrine and cardiovascular activation) processes to ensure the maintenance of the homeostasis of the organism that is challenged by the experience of stress [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The main effector of the HPA axis is the so-called &#x02018;stress&#x02019; hormone cortisol; its concentration is measured and evaluated in order to have an index for HPA axis activation [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) is a novel biochemical index for sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Both parameters obtained particular interest in stress research as unlike more traditional blood-derived stress markers (e.g. epinephrine and norepinephrine), they can conveniently be assessed in saliva. Taken together, the experience of stress is a multi-faceted phenomenon that comprises cognitive and emotional components that are closely intertwined with physiological systems, whose messengers / effectors found in saliva can be applied to objectively measure stress responses.</p><p>Research on potentially beneficial effects of music listening on HPA axis functioning, i.e. on stress-induced cortisol release, has only recently been established. Significant positive changes in cortisol were reported when listening to music before and / or during medical interventions considered stressful (decreases and lower increases in cortisol) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and after such interventions (greater reductions in cortisol) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The few laboratory-based studies show inconsistent findings, though: some report that music was effective in suppressing a stress-related increase in cortisol [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or in decreasing cortisol levels following a stressor when compared to a non-music control condition [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, some other investigations did not find a meaningful impact of music on cortisol [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As a consequence, no final conclusions can be drawn about whether or how music listening influences stress-induced cortisol levels.</p><p>The research on beneficial effects on SNS parameters has a longer tradition: A series of clinical and laboratory-based studies revealed that listening to music can decrease sympathetic activity [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, positive SNS effects of listening to music are not consistently reported [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is conceivable that knowledge achieved from the effects of music on an additional SNS parameter, such as the newly established sAA, would help to increase understanding of inconsistent previous reports. However, to date no laboratory study exists that has investigated the effects of music on stress-induced sAA levels.</p><p>As listening to music has the capacity to initiate a multitude of cognitive processes in the brain [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], it might be assumed that music also influences stress-related cognitive processes and, as a consequence, physiological responses. Previous investigations found reductions in perceived levels of psychological stress, increased coping abilities, or altered levels in perceived relaxation after listening to music in the context of a stressful situation [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Another line of research has focused on the effects of music on anxiety, which may be considered an adaptive response to the experience of stress. Given that music listening can trigger activity in brain regions linked to the experience of (intense) emotions [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], listening to music might also modulate anxiety levels induced by the experience of stress. Indeed, a decrease in anxiety after listening to music is the most consistent findings reported in field studies with patients [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and laboratory-based studies [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, not all investigations found anxiety reductions through music listening [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Also here, no final conclusions can be drawn whether or how music is able to influence cognitive and emotional components of the stress response.</p><p>Besides the insufficient quantity or pure lack of studies investigating the effects of music on stress-induced cortisol or sAA levels, there are a number of methodological limitations that may account for the wide discrepancies in the already existing literature. The main reason for this divergence in the literature might be that many studies have been conducted in a clinical context, introducing heterogeneity by studying various different medical settings and patient samples. Besides the valuable attempt of a small number of studies to investigate the effect of music listening in a controlled laboratory environment, these investigations suffered from methodological shortcomings, such as small sample size [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and/or the lack of a valid (i.e. HPA axis activating) stressor. From the perspective of biopsychological stress research, a major shortcoming is the vast neglect of the control of confounding variables [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although acute stress responses occur rather uniformly across individuals (which makes it a good paradigm for the investigation of acute stress), they may be modified by previous individual experiences, such as chronic (affective) stress [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. What is more, given that stress [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], as well as music behavior [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] differs as a matter of how emotions are regulated in general, traits of emotion regulation should always be controlled, particularly in investigations examining the effect of music on stress. Finally, the broad majority of previous work has used only one (if any) control group (rest with no acoustic stimulation), and has not examined whether positive effects of music are due the nature of music itself or due to a calming (non-music) acoustic stimulation. Consequently, the particular effectiveness of music listening on stress cannot yet be determined.</p><p>In sum, it appears that listening to music has the inherent ability to decrease the psychobiological stress response. However, due to the fact that the existing literature is not complete and often appears as inconsistent, definitive conclusions about the beneficial stress-reducing effect of music may be too premature. In light of these considerations, we set out to examine the effect of listening to music prior to a standardized stressor across neuroendocrine, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional domains of the human stress response in healthy participants in a laboratory setting. We put a special emphasis on the control of known influencing factors of the stress response and music effects, i.e. depression, anxiety, chronic stress, and emotion regulation traits. To the best of our knowledge, such an endeavor has not been attempted thus far. We hypothesized that those participants who listened to relaxing music prior to the stress task would show a different stress responses in terms of cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase, heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, subjective perception of stress, and anxiety when compared to non-music control groups, i.e. an acoustic control condition (sound of rippling water) and a control condition resting without acoustic stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited by advertisement at the University of Zurich and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070156-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Female sex was chosen to control for gender differences, as sexual dimorphism in both the HPA axis response to psychosocial stress [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and in physiological and emotional responses to&#x02028;9 music listening [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] have been observed in the past.

Additionally, self-reported hearing deficits or tinnitus were exclusion criteria. Individuals with musical training were not included in the study.

Participants were instructed not to drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages 48 hours prior to the study. Additionally, they were told to refrain from any exercise activities 24 hours prior to the experiment. Further, participants were asked to refrain from brushing their teeth or eating at least 60 minutes before the study.

There were three conditions prior to a stress test (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST, see description below): a music condition (relaxing music listening prior to stress test, RM), a water sound condition (an acoustic control condition including listening to sound of rippling water, SW) and a control condition (non-acoustic control condition including resting without acoustic stimulation, R). Seventy-eight participants fulfilled all study requirements and were randomly assigned to one of the groups. Eighteen participants were not able to keep their appointment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070156-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Randomization was accomplished through the use of a computer generated randomization list.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3.2"><title>Psychobiological stress induction</title><p>All participants underwent a standardized psychosocial laboratory stress protocol. The TSST consists of an introduction (Intro) that lasts 2 minutes in which participants are introduced to the procedure of the TSST. Specifically, they are told that the TSST consists of a public speaking task followed by a mental arithmetic task in front of an audience. In the public speaking task (lasting 5 minutes), participants are asked to apply for a job. In this simulated job interview, they are asked to talk about their personal qualifications for the chosen job, e.g. why they are a better fit for the job than other applicants. Right after the job interview, participants are explained the nature of the mental arithmetic task, which lasts for another 5 minutes. The participants have to calculate backwards in steps of 17 from the number 2043. After each calculation error the participants are asked to re-start calculating from 2043. The TSST has repeatedly been found to be a reliable tool to activate both the HPA axis and the autonomous nervous system (ANS) [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In the current study, the standard TSST procedure as reported in the literature was slightly modified: in the Intro, the subjects were not told about the exact nature of the upcoming speaking task (i.e. giving a speech as part of a simulated job interview) in order to prevent subjects from mentally preparing for the task.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3.3"><title>Study procedure</title><p>For the current study, all examinations were conducted between 1200 and 1700h to minimize the confounding effect of the hormonal diurnal rhythm. Circadian fluctuations of hormone levels are particularly pronounced in the morning hours and flatten throughout the day [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Participants arrived at the laboratory 60 min prior to the onset of the stress induction by the TSST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070156-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Participants were then escorted to a non-intervention room, where they spent their waiting time between the actual experimental interventions. Immediately after arrival, participants were informed by the main experimenter about the course of the experiment. Oral and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Right afterwards, the LifeShirt, an electrophysiological measurement device (see below), was attached. After an adaptation period of 30 min, a basal saliva sample (T1, -30 min) was taken. Twenty minutes prior to the TSST, the participants were brought to the TSST room, where they were introduced by the main experimenter to the procedure of the TSST (= introduction: Intro, 2 min). The subjects were then brought to the intervention room, seated in a comfortable chair, and provided with headphones. All participants had to adjust a test signal (sinus tone, sound pressure = -70dB) to the individual hearing threshold level for the calibration of the volume. After this, the participants were to undergo their assigned condition, i.e. RM, SW, or R for ten minutes. No instruction was given for any of the conditions. Immediately after this part a second saliva sample was taken (T2, -5 min). Following this, subjects were taken back into the TSST room where they were undergoing the TSST. After the completion of the TSST, the subjects were then returned back the non-intervention room and a third saliva sample was taken (T3, + 10 min). Further samples were taken 15 min (T4, + 25 min), 30 min (T5, + 40 min), 45 min (T6, + 55 min), and 60 min (T7, + 70 min) after the TSST.

Still, it is an acoustic stimulus with a certain perceptual quality for the listener.

On a 5-point Likert scale participants indicated how much they liked the particular music style (1 &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; to 5 &#x02018;very much&#x02019;).</p><p>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] was used to control for a possible impact of depression on the HPA axis response [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

Higher values on each scale denote greater expressiveness of the respective variable.</p><p>Visual analog scales (VAS) were employed to repeatedly measure subjective perception of stress during the experiment. To control for the experience of chronic stress in our sample, we used the screening scale of the <italic>Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress</italic> (TICS) [<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], which assesses the global perceived chronic stress load of an individual with 12 items (Screening Scale of Chronic Stress, SSCS).

High values are indicative that the individual is often worried, overburdened, overstrained, and unacknowledged.</p><p>The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] was used to assess anxiety. The STAI consists of two 20-items questionnaires which assess state respectively trait levels of anxiety in clinical and non-clinical populations. Scores for both scales range between 20 (low anxiety) and 80 (high anxiety). The STAI-state was used as a continuous measurement for possible changes in anxiety during the experiment.

For comparison of the scale means of the questionnaires with normative samples, Student&#x02019;s t-tests were computed. Cortisol (-30 min to + 70 min), alpha-amylase levels as well as heart rate measures (-30 min to + 40 min) were evaluated according to the area under the curve with respect to increase (AUC<sub>I</sub>). The AUC<sub>I</sub> is related to the sensitivity of the biological system; it is pronouncing changes over time, and is characterized by accumulation of the error of the baseline, as the formula is based on the difference between the baseline and the subsequent measures [<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

We hypothesized that those participants who listened to relaxing music prior to a stress task would show different stress responses in comparison to non-music control groups, i.e. an acoustic control condition (sound of rippling water) and a control condition, resting without acoustic stimulation. With regard to endocrine responses, we found significant differences between the music and the acoustic control condition in cortisol: highest cortisol concentrations were observed in individuals who were listening to music prior the stress task, lowest concentrations were found in those who were listening to the sound of rippling water. Although there was no significant effect of music regarding autonomic responses, we observed a trend towards a faster recovery in sAA activity and in RSA in the music group. As for psychological measures, we did not find significant differences between the three groups.</p><p>The lack of a decreased cortisol response in the music group corroborates findings of a previous study by Knight and Rickard [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, that investigation is the only laboratory-based study in which the influence of music listening prior to a stressor was investigated. However, the explanatory power of the findings was somewhat limited as the authors did not apply a stressor that was strong enough to elicit a significant cortisol stress response and that participants were examined in small groups (6&#x02013;12 participants per condition). As for the latter, recent research has suggested that music interventions might be more effective on an individual compared to the group level [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Nevertheless, even though we applied a significant stressor and tested our participants one-by-one, we did not find an attenuation of stress-induced cortisol levels after music listening.</p><p>We did not expect the observed relative increase of cortisol concentrations in the music group in comparison to the control groups. Our findings seem to be the opposite from what the majority of previous studies have reported when investigating the effect of music on <italic>baseline</italic> HPA axis functioning, i.e. a significant decrease in cortisol concentrations [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Our findings also seem to differ from the effects of music, when music is presented <italic>during</italic> (suppressed cortisol response) [<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] or <italic>after</italic> a stressor (decreased cortisol response) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Interpreting our findings in the light of these studies, we may deduce that the beneficial effect of music on HPA axis functioning depends on situational context (rest vs. stress) and chronology of events (prior vs. during vs. after stress). A possible explanation for the context-dependent influence may be the involvement of certain brain areas and their subdivisions, such as for instance the hypothalamus, the amygdala, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, in both listening to music and stress processing [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. It appears that music listening prior to the experience of stress may add to, facilitate, or increase subsequent HPA axis activation by a staggered activation of a partly shared neuronal network. Brain-imaging studies are needed to investigate whether there is indeed a specific &#x02018;combinational&#x02019; effect of music and stress.</p><p>It is of great interest that the lowest concentrations of cortisol were observed in the acoustic control condition (i.e. listening to the sound of rippling water). Given that, to the best of our knowledge, no study so far has investigated the effects of natural sounds on stress-related HPA axis responses, we did not anticipate this outcome. The sound of rippling water was equally preferred and perceived as relaxing as music by our participants. This may be a hint to differential effects on the HPA axis of music and non-music acoustic stimulation. Due to the lack of studies on neuronal activation patterns of natural sounds it is difficult to determine the exact mechanisms for this effect, though. Although unexpected, the finding of decreased cortisol concentrations in the acoustic control condition is of potentially great relevance and may increase our understanding of mechanisms of beneficial interventions in natural environments, based on the concept of biophilia for instance [<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. According to this view, humans, who have lived in natural environments throughout evolution, are equipped with brains / mental functioning that &#x0201c;&#x02026;subconsciously seek connection with all that is alive and vital&#x0201d; (p. 4660) [<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. As a consequence, humans indeed feel more comforted in natural than in urban environments. Lingering in natural environments, such as for instance in a forest, has been found to have significant beneficial physiological effects [<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Accordingly, a detachment from natural environments might lead to decreased physical and psychological well-being [<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. It might therefore be reasoned that the sound of rippling water in our study had a relaxation effect stronger than that of music, due to its inherent characteristics as a sound of nature. Of course, this notion is highly speculative. More studies are needed to examine the differential endocrine effects of natural and non-natural acoustic sound stimulation.</p><p>We observed a differential influence of music listening on autonomic activity: music resulted in a faster autonomic recovery after stress compared to the control groups. This partly corresponds with findings from an investigation by Arai et al. [<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] who found significantly decreased sAA levels at wound closure in patients who listened to intra-operative music when compared to a non-music control condition. Music might thus facilitate autonomic recovery from a stressor in comparison to listening to non-musical sounds or no acoustic stimulation. The fact that our finding only showed a statistical trend narrows its relevance, however. Other investigations assessing the effects of music on the ANS (e.g. via epinephrine and norepinephrine) have found no beneficial effects [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. As for cardiac measures, we found a decrease in HR and an increase in RSA in response to RM, SW, and R. After stress exposure, we found an increase in HR and a decrease in RSA. On the one hand, these findings correspond to investigations that found an increase of parasympathetic activity in response to sedative music listening [<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. On the other hand, our results corroborate findings from studies reporting decreased parasympathetic activity in response to stress [<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. As with sAA, we found a trend for a faster recovery of the RSA in the music group when compared to the resting control group. It appears that music listening might be effective in accelerating the recovery process of the parasympathetic branch of the ANS. It is interesting, however, that the sound of rippling water was even more effective than music in returning RSA levels back to baseline. Clearly, further studies are warranted for further eliciting the differential physiological effects of music and non-music acoustic stimulation.</p><p>Music listening had no differential effect on psychological measures (stress perception or anxiety) in comparison to the two control conditions. This is not in line with investigations that report listening to music to be effective in reducing psychological stress [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or anxiety [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. One explanation might be that music listening may only reduce psychological stress / anxiety in the presence of a relatively mild stressor. It might be the case that the stressor in our study (i.e. the TSST) was too strong. Knight and Rickard [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], who were using a (mild) cognitive stressor in the laboratory, found anxiety-reducing effects of music listening prior to stress. MacDonald and colleagues found similar effects only in those patients who had a minor surgery (mild stressor) and not in those who had a major surgery [<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Evans [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], finally, systematically reviewed studies of the effectiveness of music interventions for hospital patients. He found that music listening was effective for the reduction of anxiety during normal care delivery (which may be considered as mild stressors), but not for patients undergoing invasive or unpleasant procedures (strong stressors). In contrast to those findings, however, patients in the study by Allen et al. were experiencing &#x0201c;&#x02026;a high level of stress and anxiety...&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] related to surgery, so that one may assume that this was a strong stressor. Still, music was effective in decreasing perceived stress levels in that study. However, patients were allowed to listen to their own choice of music. It might be argued that not the music itself, but the positive memories associated with it caused this effect. What is more, control patients did not wear headphones and were therefore exposed to the sounds of surgery, thus further inducing stress in the control group. Future studies are needed to test for the assumption that music listening might only reduce stress related psychological processes and anxiety in the context of mild stressors.</p><p>Taken together, our results seem to indicate that pre-stress music listening might not be effective in reducing the biopsychological stress response, but might, in contrast, add to or facilitate a stress response. However, our results may also be interpreted in the light of another explanation: it may be that the participants in the music group were actually so relaxed that the subsequent stress induction was incompatible with this state of relaxation, and that they produced an increased stress response as a consequence. We might have therefore measured the effect of the contrast between a relaxing and a stressful state rather than the preparatory effects of relaxing music on the subsequent stress response. This notion is supported by the greatest increase in stress perception in the relaxing music group. Future studies should follow-up on this explanation and further dissect the effects of preparatory music listening on stress responses.</p><p>Although this is the first study in which the effect of pre-stress music listening on a multitude of stress response domains was examined in the context of a rigorously controlled laboratory setting, our findings need to be considered in the light of the following limitations.</p><sec id="s4.1"><title>Selection of music stimulus</title><p>Standardized music stimuli, selected by the researchers, might have different effects than those chosen by the participants themselves. In our study, however, we used a music stimulus which had already been evaluated as relaxing in previous research [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], so we were confident that this stimulus had stress-attenuating capacity independent of individual preferences. Also, using researcher-selected music stimuli has been shown to have greater effects on stress reduction than music stimuli selected by the subjects themselves [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4.2"><title>Sample</title><p>The focus on healthy young female participants, which were non-smoking, not taking any oral contraceptives, and being in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, restricts the generalization of the results beyond this particular sample. While the exclusion of potential confounding variables certainly improves internal validity, further research should investigate men also, as well as a mixed sample of men and women with more liberal inclusion criteria in order to reach more general conclusions.</p><p>In summary, the findings of the present study demonstrate that listening to relaxing music prior to a stress task differentially affects biological stress response domains. Listening to relaxing music prior to a stressor did not decrease the endocrine stress response, but tended to increase it. Moreover, music listening helped the ANS to recover from a stressor more efficiently. Cognitive and emotional processes did not seem to be differently influenced by listening to relaxing music compared to listening to the sound of rippling water or resting with no acoustic stimulation prior to a stressor. As a consequence, our findings do not fully support the notion of using music listening as a successful stress management tool, at least not in the context of anticipating an upcoming stressor. Certainly, the potential health implications of the observed increase in HPA axis activation and the faster recovery of the ANS through listening to relaxing music are worth mentioning and should be further studied in order to better understand the potentially positive effects of music on the human body.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the study subjects and acknowledge the assistance of Eliane Horat in co-conducting the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
