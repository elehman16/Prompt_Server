Creativity is essential to the development and advancement of human civilization and plays a crucial role in our cultural life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Hence, researchers among various disciplines have burgeoning interest in the potential for fostering creativity through education and training.</p><p>Traditionally, creativity is viewed as a relatively stable individual difference, with some people being regarded as consistently more creative than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. More recently, creativity has been studied as a less stable phenomenon that varies as a function of brief states of the person and situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is possible to measure creativity in a fast way that allows assessment of states induced by training. As one of the most widely used test of creativity, Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) is easy to administrate in short time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has fewer limitations and cautions to apply, and is more researched and analyzed than any other creativity instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Many studies examined the predictive validity of the TTCT including elementary education majors, seventh-grade students, and economically disadvantaged elementary school Black children, which increased the TTCT&#x02019;s credibility as a predictor of creative productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A series of follow-up studies at the range from 7- to 22-year interval found that three of the TTCT subscales (fluency, flexibility and originality) correlated significantly (at the .01 level) with creative achievements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, many reanalysis studies of Torrance&#x02019;s data concluded that the Creative Indexes (fluency, flexibility, and originality) are the best predictors for adult creative achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The popularity of meditation in the West has led research into its influence on creativity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previous studies showed that long-term (over years) meditation training enhances creativity as assessed by TTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For example, open-monitoring meditation, in which an individual is open to perceive and observe any sensation, promotes divergent thinking, a style of thinking that allows many new ideas to be generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Some recent research showed that short-term meditation has fostering effects on creative thinking. For example, maintaining a mindful and alert state during meditation results in more insight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, Zen practitioners who meditated in the laboratory performed better on the creative test than Zen practitioners who did not meditate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our pilot work also suggested that around 3&#x000a0;hours IBMT (30&#x000a0;min/session for 7 sessions) can enhance the creative ability as assessed by TTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although studies have shown the positive effect of meditation on creativity, the cognitive mechanisms are largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Mood represents a transient state that has attracted a great deal of attention as a potential facilitator of creativity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Positive affect (PA) produces more fluent and original responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], while negative affect (NA) has the opposite effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For example, PA leads to greater cognitive flexibility and facilitates creative problem solving across a broad range of settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. PA increases creative performance and implementation efficiency, while NA has no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, a study with 256 undergraduates shows that PA tends to be induced to create and use categories more inclusively than NA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Results are interpreted in terms of an influence of affect on cognitive organization. PA biases cognitive control mechanisms in ways that facilitate creativity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and borderline effects of NA on categorization might result from normal people&#x02019;s attempts to cope with NA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Hence, previous studies lead some researchers to conclude that PA promotes fluent and original thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], while NA has the opposite effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Meditation is associated with greater emotion regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. For example, 5&#x000a0;days of IBMT has been shown to improve mood and cognitive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Four days of mindfulness meditation is effective at reducing anxiety scores and other cognitive manipulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A similar training regimen improves mood when compared to a sham meditation and control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Further, four meditation sessions resulted in greater improvements in mood than participants in a sham condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Other studies showed improvements in mood after brief and single instruction in mindfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>In summary, meditation is associated with enhancing the ability to self-regulate emotions, which has been found to be a key component in cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], including creativity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the integrative reviews of creativity studies, it is proposed that PA fosters creativity fluency and originality because of enhanced cognitive flexibility, which may make more diverse connections among ideas, as well as perceive more differences among the items or content, with NA having the opposite effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that short-term meditation increases capacity to self-regulate emotions and thus improves creative performance.</p><p>The present study focuses on the cognitive mechanism of meditation on creativity. Short-term IBMT, adopted from traditional Chinese medicine and incorporating the key components of meditation training, was used as a meditation intervention. Instead of using effort to control thoughts, IBMT is designed to facilitate the achievement of a meditative state with a balance and optimization between mind and body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and further maintain this state to regulate emotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. On the other hand, relaxation training (RT) involves relaxing different muscle groups from the head to abdomen and forces one to concentrate on the feelings of warmth and heaviness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This progressive muscle training helps a participant achieve physical (body) and mental (mind) relaxation and calmness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Since both RT and IBMT emphasize achieving their desired states through regulating the body and the mind, RT matches IBMT in the training, and thus we chose RT as an active control condition. We used the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] to measures PA and NA, and the TTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] to assess performance of creativity. PANAS and TTCT were measured before and after training to compare the training effects between IBMT and RT. In addition, the reciprocal cross-lagged effects of PANAS (PA and NA) and TTCT were examined before and after IBMT. Cross-lagged analysis is widely recommended for addressing the issue of temporal precedence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It helps to test whether the IBMT-regulated emotion has a causal effect on creativity and to rule out alternative causal hypotheses.</p><p>Taken together, we hypothesize that compared to RT (i) IBMT will produce greater creativity (indexed by TTCT) (ii) IBMT will improve emotion (indexed by PANAS scales) and (iii) this improved emotion may mediate the change in creativity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Forty healthy undergraduates at Dalian University of Technology (DUT) without any meditation or relaxation experiences were recruited. They were evenly and randomly assigned to IBMT group or RT group (20:20). Nineteen participants in the IBMT group (11 males, aged 21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6&#x000a0;years old) completed the whole training of 30&#x000a0;min/day for 7&#x000a0;days (3.5&#x000a0;hours in total). The 20 participants in the RT group (10 males, aged 21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3&#x000a0;years old) were given the same amount and length of RT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The study was approved by DUT Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from each participant. The consent form explained that participants would complete the PANAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] to measure mood state, and the TTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] to assess performance of creativity.</p></sec><sec><title>PANAS</title><p>PANAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] is a 20-item measure of PA (10 items) and NA (10 items). All items are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). Although PANAS can be administered in terms of varying time frames, subjects responded to PANAS items on basis of to what extent they feel a certain way over the past week. The PA scales reflect the extent to which a person feels enthusiastic, active, or alert. The measure has been validated in Chinese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]; these authors reported that Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas for the PA and NA subscales were .85 and .83, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Creativity assessment</title><p>The creativity performance was assessed through TTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which has been translated into Chinese language and standardized for the usage in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. TTCT has two versions: TTCT-Verbal and TTCT-Figural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The creative scalogram in this study consists of two activities (Product Improvement, and Unusual Uses) from TTCT-Verbal and two activities (Picture Completion, and Repeated Figures of Lines) from TTCT-Figural. All participants answered the same questions. Ten minutes were required to complete each activity to generate as many answers as possible.</p><p>The four subscales, with descriptions about scoring and the content measured, are listed as following: (a) Fluency, which is the number of relevant responses to the questions, shows the ability to produce and consider many alternatives; (b) Flexibility, which is the (total) number of categories that answers are assigned based on a criteria table or an almost equivalent judgment, shows the ability to produce responses from a wide perspective; (c) Originality, which is the number of statistically infrequent ideas, shows the ability to produce ideas that differ from others&#x02019;. The scoring procedure counts the most common responses as 0 and all other legitimate responses as 1. The originality lists are prepared for each item on basis of normative data, which are readily memorized by scorers. (d) Elaboration shows the ability to produce ideas in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. For the purpose of this article, Elaboration will not be discussed.</p><p>The raw score (fluency, flexibility, originality) in each activity is converted to T-scores according to a formula in TTCT manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Each total scale score is the sum of its T-scores in the corresponding scale of the four activities. A TTCT score is the sum of three subscales including fluency, flexibility and originality. Each subscale was rated by a single proficient scorer who was blind to the conditions of the participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>The experimental sessions included pre-training session, training session, and post-training session.</p><p>(i) Pre-training session. Before training, the PANAS and TTCT were administered in a group format. First, all the participants completed the PANAS. Second, To avoid the two tasks interference, after PANAS, the participants were given around 30-min break including 15-min rest and then 15-min explanation of the following TTCT tasks. Third, the TTCT was administered. During this session, the administration was performed blind by one psychology Ph.D. who mastered the TTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]<monospace>-</monospace>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and PANAS. Each participant completed the tests in a partition type desk.</p><p>(ii) Training session. The training sessions were intended to help each participant to increase the meditation or relaxation experience. Both IBMT and RT group completed the 7 consecutive days of training with 30&#x000a0;min/per day respectively, total is 3.5&#x000a0;hours. The first training day occurred on a different day after finishing the pre-training session. Firstly, a qualified coach provided participants a free question-and-answer meeting about techniques (IBMT or RT). Secondly, after ensuring the clear grasp of techniques for the novices, the coach guided participants to practice instructions on a compact disc in a harmonious and relaxed atmosphere. The practice was 30&#x000a0;minutes. The IBMT group concentrated on achieving a balanced state of body and mind. The RT group concentrated on the relaxing of different muscle groups and the corresponding feelings of warmth and heaviness. During the practice, the coach observed facial and body cues and gave proper feedback immediately to those who were struggling with the method. Thirdly, thirty minutes later, each participant filled out a questionnaire and evaluated the practice. The coach gave short responses to subjects as required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>(iii) Post-training session. This session occurred on the next day after the final training day. The procedures of this session were consistent with the pre-session. Participants were given the PANAS firstly, and the TTCT 30&#x000a0;min later.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>ANOVA, t tests, linear regression and a cross-lagged panel design were applied for analysis. All analyses were performed using SPSS software.</p><p>To examine the homogeneity in TTCT or PANAS between IBMT group and RT group before training, an independent t-test was used to compare the differences between two groups in mean values (TTCT or PANAS). And then, we conducted preliminary analyses using a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) method between groups on each dependent variable (TTCT or PANAS) with time as a factor. When statistically significant effects were found, the independent t-test was used to compare differences in mean values of percent changes from pre to post between two groups.</p><p>Causal relationships could be inferred by utilizing a cross-lagged panel design, in which variables are collected at least twice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The basic results of cross-lagged analyses include a complete correlation matrix: stationarity of correlations (Csta, autocorrelations), synchronous correlations (Csyn), and cross-lagged correlations (Ccl) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). First, to assume that a causal model based on crossed-lagged panel correlations is valid, the Csyn and Csta coefficients must be high in magnitude and statistically significant in the non-cross direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Second, for a pair of variables, A and B, the causal influence from A to B is represented by the standardized regression coefficients of the path from A at time 1 to B at time 2 (Ccl 1&#x02013;2). In a similar manner, the causal influence from B to A is represented by the standardized regression coefficients of the path from B at time 1 to A at time 2 (Ccl 2&#x02013;1). Thus, under the usual assumptions governing regression analysis, a nonzero value of a relevant parameter is indicative of a significant causal effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The cross-lagged panel design used to evaluate causal relationships between A and B.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1744-9081-10-9-1"/></fig><p>All data are expressed and plotted as mean &#x000b1; SE.

TTCT is used to evaluate creativity through divergent thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], which is a key aspect of creativity and predictor of creative ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. We concluded that creative performance on the divergent thinking task was better following IBMT than RT. Thus, the results are consistent with our hypotheses. The improvement of creativity may be caused by a variety of factors. Previous studies have shown that there may be a wealth of psychological factors, such as intelligence, self-confidence, attention, cognitive flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and mood states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] with regard to the influence on creative fluency and originality.</p><p>In the PANAS, the PA score (assessed by PA subscale) increased significantly and the NA score (by NA subscale) decreased significantly after 3.5&#x000a0;hours of IBMT compared to RT. We concluded that short-term IBMT yielded a better emotion state than RT. Thus, the results are consistent with our hypotheses that the IBMT group improved emotional regulation, whereas RT group did not.</p><p>Moreover, we hypothesized that emotional improvement may be one way that TTCT scores are changed in short-term meditation. Our results revealed that the cross-lagged analysis documented PA and NA as an antecedent of creativity in the IBMT group. The standardized regression coefficients of the path from before-training PA (or NA) to after-training TTCT was significant, while the standardized regression coefficients of the path from after-training PA (or NA) to before-training TTCT was marginally significant. However, similar effects of emotion on creativity were not found in the RT group. Our results indicated that emotion-based creativity-promoting mechanism is attributed to IBMT.</p><p>Creativity includes a wide range of cognitive processes, such as flow (when a person is fully immersed in what s/he is doing, characterized by a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and success in the process of the activity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], breadth of attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], and remote association of ideas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, emotion is associated with these cognitive processes that contribute to the complex of creativity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. One mood theory is that PA promotes a more global scope of attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], enhancing access to distant or unusual associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], which facilitates creative solutions to classic creative problems such as improving performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] on the Remote Associates Test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Another mood theory is that PA enhances switching between global and local attention modes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] or between strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], or in other words that it enhances selection of different perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In contrast, NA states such as anxiety and depression are associated with deficits in attentional and cognitive control mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>], often inducing a narrow scope of attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Therefore, NA states should impede cognitive flexibility and creative problem solving.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that creative performance on the divergent thinking task and emotion were better following IBMT than RT, and meditation with mood regulation effects have potential benefit to levels of creativity.
