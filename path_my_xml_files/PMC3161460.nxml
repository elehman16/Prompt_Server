In the operating room, the standard five-lead electrocardiography (ECG), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse oximetry were attached and the baseline hemodynamic parameters were noted. A baseline intravenous normal saline infusion was started. All fluids used were warmed to 37&#x000b0;C before infusion. Temperature of the operating room (OR) and Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) were kept constant between 21 and 22&#x000b0;C, with constant humidity, by centrally air conditioning and laminar flow. An anesthesiologist, blinded to the drug and group allocation, administered the study drug. Anesthesia was induced with a sleep dose of i.v. thiopentone and tracheal intubation was facilitated with i.v. vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Fentanyl 1.5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg i.v. was given as intraoperative analgesia. Ventilation was controlled and anesthesia maintained with isoflurane in a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (30 : 70). All patients were covered with one layer of surgical drapes over the chest, arms, thighs, and calves during the operation and one cotton blanket over the entire body, postoperatively. No other warming device was used. Intraoperative monitoring included heart rate (HR), NIBP, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (EtCO<sub>2</sub>). After completion of the procedure, the residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with i.v. atropine 20 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg and neostigmine 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ kg. The postoperative shivering was graded (0 &#x02013; 4 scale) at arrival of the patients to the PACU and every five minutes thereafter, up to 30 minutes. Scores were assessed by an unbiased observer in the PACU, who was blinded to the test group.

Prevention of postoperative shivering should be considered mandatory.</p><p>A number of physical methods have been used to alleviate shivering, which includes; forced-air patient warming systems, radiant heaters, complex humidifiers, intraoperative double-draping, maintaining OR and PACU temperature at more than 25&#x000b0;C, and providing an extra blanket and heated humidified oxygen delivery in the PACU.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The mainstay of treatment of postoperative shivering is, however, pharmacological. A wide range of drugs like pethidine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] other opioids (fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] doxapram,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] clonidine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] ketanserin,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] and dexmedetomidine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] are reported to be effective in preventing and suppressing established shivering. Pethidine has been used both intraoperatively and postoperatively for prevention and treatment of shivering. In a majority of adults 25 mg pethidine i.v. is effective in treating postoperative shivering.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Half life of i.v. pethidine is four to six hours and it can be used prophylactically in short or medium duration surgeries. It may, however, potentiate the sedative, PONV, respiratory, and hemodynamic effects of the opioids given perioperatively, and can lead to delayed discharge from the PACU.</p><p>In the present study, all the groups have been comparable in respect to age and body weight. Controversy exists regarding the relationship between post-anesthetic shivering and age. Some reports suggest that relatively younger patients are more prone to develop post-anesthetic shivering[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] but Vaughan <italic>et al</italic>. observed that geriatric patients were prone to hypothermia and shivering.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The mean duration of surgery in all the three groups was 50 &#x02013; 60 minutes. Goold[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] observed shivering to be more frequent when the duration exceeded 30 minutes, while Moir <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] found this critical duration to be more than one hour. On the other hand, Holderaft <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] could not find any relation between the two. Harrison <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] in their study observed that mean core body temperature fell by 2.1&#x000b0;F when volatile anesthetic agents were used and 1&#x000b0;F when intravenous anesthetic agents were used.</p><p>In the present study, shivering was correlated with the all in tympanic membrane temperature. The patients who shivered had a significantly lower temperature in the PACU than those who did not shiver. John <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] found a greater fall in intraoperative temperature in patients who subsequently shivered. However, there are many reports, which found no correlation between the fall in temperature and shivering. Liem <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] found no correlation between a fall in body temperature and the incidence of shivering. Similarly, Baxendale <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] did not find any significant difference in the core temperature between patients who shivered and those who did not.</p><p>Neither the incidence nor the grades of postoperative shivering differed significantly among the three groups. Stephen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] reported an incidence of 5%, whereas, Pauca <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] found the incidence to be 62.67%. The incidence of shivering in our study was in the middle of the overall range mentioned in contemporary literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Our study agreed with the work of Moir,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] who reported the incidence of postoperative shivering after GA to be 29.6%.</p><p>Rescue drug (i.v. pethidine 20 mg) was administered to a total of 18 study patients who had shivering grade &#x0003e;2. The shivering stopped in five to ten minutes after giving 20 mg i.v. pethidine. In all these cases there was no recurrence of shivering within the study period of 30 minutes. Wrench <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] found that 26 patients, out of 30 patients, stopped shivering within 10 minutes of administration of i.v. pethidine 20 mg.</p><p>The HR either remains unchanged or increases slightly in laparoscopic procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] With pethidine the HR may increase slightly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In the present study, the HR remained stable and showed a similar trend in all the groups. In laparoscopic surgeries, blood pressure is elevated because of the increase of systemic vascular resistance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Blood pressure is normally unaffected, but sometimes it may fall after administration of pethidine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In the present study, in all the groups, the blood pressure remained within normal range at all monitored levels. During gynecological laparoscopic procedures in patients under controlled ventilation, EtCO<sub>2</sub> progressively increases to reach a plateau 15 to 30 minutes after starting CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Oxygen saturation remained within 98 and 100% in all three groups of patients.</p><p>There was no significant difference among all the three groups in terms of incidence of PONV. No other detrimental effects of pethidine like sedation and respiratory depression were noted in any patient during routine postoperative monitoring.</p><p>The limitations of our study were that we measured tympanic membrane temperature once at pre-induction and thereafter at completion of surgery, for a mean duration of 50 minutes of the surgical procedure. Shivering was also measured for a 30-minute period only. The postoperative pain score was not measured, which may have influenced non-thermoregulatory pain and affected the shivering threshold. Pethidine had a half life of four to six hours, and the mean surgical time in our study was 50 minutes. Inefficacy of pethidine in preventing post-anesthetic shivering was possibly due to early administration of the drug. Dosing of pethidine just before completion of surgery might have a role in the prevention of post anesthetic shivering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found a 30% incidence of postoperative shivering, but found no statistically significant difference in the incidence and grade of shivering among patients administered pre-induction pethidine and those who were not. After induction, body temperature fell in all patients and the lowest temperature was seen at arrival in the PACU. There was no difference in the degree of fall of temperature among the three groups. The patients who shivered had significantly lower temperatures in the PACU than those who did not shiver. We could not demonstrate the potential role of prophylactic low-dose pethidine in preventing postoperative shivering.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
