In addition, simvastatin treatment leads to a reduction in fluxes in mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and II and might thereby reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that simvastatin may reduce oxidative stress in humans in vivo.</p><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in which subjects were treated with either 40&#x000a0;mg of simvastatin or placebo for 14 days. The endpoints were six biomarkers for oxidative stress, which represent intracellular oxidative stress to nucleic acids, lipid peroxidation and plasma antioxidants, that were measured in urine and plasma samples.</p><p>A total of 40 participants were included, of which 39 completed the trial. The observed differences between simvastatin and placebo groups in the primary outcomes, DNA and RNA oxidation, were small and nonsignificant (p=0.68), specifically, 3% in the simvastatin group compared to 7.1% in the placebo group for DNA oxidation and 7.3% in the simvastatin group compared to 3.4% in the placebo group. The differences in biomarkers related to plasma were not statistically significant between the treatments groups, with the exception of total vitamin E levels, which, as expected, were reduced in parallel with the reduction in plasma cholesterol.</p><p>In healthy young male volunteers, short-term simvastatin treatment, which considerably reduces cholesterol, does not lead to a clinically relevant reduction in a panel of measures of oxidative stress. Whether simvastatin has effects on oxidative stress in diseased populations, such as diabetes or hemochromatosis, where oxidative stress is prominent, is unknown but seems unlikely.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="ab0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="f0025" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Simvastatin reduces plasma cholesterol but not oxidative stress.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Oxidative stress was measured in both intracellular and extracellular compartments.</p></list-item><list-item id="u4510"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Simvastatin does not influence nuclelic acid oxidation.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Simvastatin</kwd><kwd>Randomized clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>8-oxodg</kwd><kwd>8-oxoguo</kwd><kwd>DNA oxidation</kwd><kwd>RNA oxidation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The statin group of drugs is widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in risk groups <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One common side effect of statins is muscle pain, and the mechanism by which this pain occurs is not fully understood but could include oxidative stress. Statins have different effects in skeletal and cardiac muscle, which may be why muscle problems are only observed in skeletal muscle <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and not in other types of muscles. The primary site of ROS production is in mitochondria <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, there are many sources of ROS, both intracellular <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and environmental <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Recently, a reduction in mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle was reported in patients treated with simvastatin. This reduction was mainly related to reduced respiration in mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and II mediated <italic>via</italic> a reduction in the content of the electron carrier Q10 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, atorvastatin and simvastatin reduced the oxidative stress induced by calcium <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Oxidative stress to RNA can be measured non-invasively based on the excretion of the ribonucleoside 8-oxoGuo (8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine) in urine, and its clinical relevance has been demonstrated in type 2 diabetes, where high oxidative stress is predictive of death <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We have hypothesized that RNA oxidation is related to the production of hydrogen peroxide by mitochondria, which could contribute to mitochondrial respiration/dysfunction and excess ROS production in diabetes <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A reduction in oxidative stress by statins would therefore represent a novel and interesting therapeutic mechanism.</p><p>We conducted a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial of simvastatin versus placebo in healthy male volunteers with DNA and RNA oxidation as the primary endpoints. The secondary endpoints were the plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde, vitamin C, vitamin E, and biopterin, which are markers of extracellular stress.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention study.

Larsen et al. also found a reduced concentration of Q10, just as we found a reduction in vitamin E, which corresponded to the reduction in cholesterol. In long-term treatment with simvastatin, the changes induced in lipid metabolism and lipid soluble antioxidants may take time to manifest. Additionally, these changes might not be specific for simvastatin and may be indirect effects rather than a direct effect of simvastatin on mitochondria.</p><p>The previously observed difference between smokers and non-smokers in DNA oxidation was approximately 50% <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In patients with hemochromatosis <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, RNA oxidation is increased 2&#x02013;3-fold. Furthermore, in patients with type 2 diabetes, the highest quartile versus the lowest quartile differ approximately 2-fold in RNA oxidation levels <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and high values of RNA oxidation are associated with a considerable risk of premature death in the high quartile <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the present study, the small, nonsignificant 7% difference with an upper 19% confidence limit ensures that the possibility of overlooking a true difference due to type 2 error is low and without clinical relevance.</p><p>For patients with coronary heart disease, statin therapy resulted in a decrease in MDA <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> as measured by the thiobarbituric acid reaction (TBA). However, this method is much less specific for oxidative stress in vivo than the MDA measurement we used. In patients with hypercholesterolemia <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, changes in total antioxidant capacity were found. However, we regard this assay as being easy to perform but unspecific and difficult to interpret as oxidative stress. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies on hypertensive hypercholesterolemia mice and humans <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> have also used the unspecific TBA reaction for testing the effects of fluvastatin treatment. Similarly, the TBA reaction has also been used to study effects of fluvastatin, alone and in combination with the antihypertensive agent, Losartan, in humans and rats <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In summary, as these studies have used unspecific methodology <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, their results are very difficult to interpret. Our study is the first to study the anti-oxidative effects of simvastatin in healthy young males using specific and validated methodologies, and based on our findings, we can reject the hypothesis that simvastatin has antioxidant effects. It is possible that simvastatin or other statins could have different effects in various patient populations, such as those mentioned above. Although it is unknown, there are no indications that the effect on the markers we have measured for oxidative stress should differ between such diseased populations and the normal controls investigated in the present study.</p><p>Estimating DNA and RNA oxidation from urine as a biomarker has limitations, particularly as it reflects an average of the intracellular oxidative stress in all cells in the body. Consequently, if simvastatin has differential effects in other organs, for example, such as opposite effects in heart and skeletal muscle (5), potentially positive and negative effects could cancel each other out, thereby obscuring the detection of positive effects in major organs. Likewise, if the positive effect is confined to a minor organ, such as the endothelium cells, such an effect, positive or negative, could be undetectable due to the large background noise from the remainder of the body.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that in healthy young male volunteers, simvastatin treatment per se does not reduce specific biomarkers for intracellular and extracellular oxidative stress.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grundy</surname><given-names>S.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for treatment of hypercholesterolemia</article-title><source>N.
