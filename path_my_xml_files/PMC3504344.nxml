However, when treatment is intensified, fasting plasma glucose values improve immediately, whereas HbA<sub>1c</sub> values lag behind, not reaching a stable new value for 4 months or more. Therefore, fasting plasma glucose measured at early follow-up visits might predict future success in reaching HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets. To test this concept, we performed a pooled analysis of patient-level data obtained in studies in which treatment with glargine was started using similar treat-to-target methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Study selection</title><p>Sixty-three studies in adults with Type 2 diabetes completed between 1997 and 2007 were evaluated. For inclusion in the pooled analysis, a study had to have a prospective, randomized, controlled design conducted according to Good Clinical Practice standards; using basal insulin therapy with glargine (but without prandial insulin) added to lifestyle alone or stable oral anti-diabetic drug therapy, and a treat-to-target strategy with a predefined insulin titration algorithm targeting fasting plasma glucose &#x02264; 5.6 mmol/l; and including fasting plasma glucose measurements at baseline, week 6 or 8 (6/8) and week 12 as well as systematic collection of reports of hypoglycaemia. Seven studies met these criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>] (data on file; Sanofi US, Bridgewater, NJ, USA). For studies with longer duration, only data from the first 24 weeks were used. Participants were eligible for analysis if fasting plasma glucose values at baseline, week 6/8 and week 12 and HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements at week 24 were all available. Patient level data for 1036 participants were included.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Laboratory measurements of fasting plasma glucose from samples collected at study sites were divided into three categories: &#x0003c; 8.9, &#x02265; 8.9 to &#x0003c; 10 or &#x02265; 10 mmol/l. Correlations between study site fasting plasma glucose values and those obtained at home by patient self-measurement were determined. Treatment was considered successful if HbA<sub>1c</sub> at week 24 was &#x02264; 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). Symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as all events reported with symptoms. Glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia included events with concurrent glucose &#x0003c; 2.8 mmol/l. Severe hypoglycaemia comprised all symptomatic events for which the patient required assistance and had either a blood glucose level &#x0003c; 2 mmol/l or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Summary statistics were calculated for HbA<sub>1c</sub> at baseline and week 24. Independent analyses of fasting plasma glucose values were performed for the correlation between week 6/8 fasting plasma glucose and week 24 HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and the correlation between week 12 fasting plasma glucose and week 24 HbA<sub>1c</sub>. For each, week 24 HbA<sub>1c</sub> and change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to week 24 were analysed continuously using an analysis of covariance model, with study as a factor and post-baseline visit fasting plasma glucose as a covariate. Week 24 HbA<sub>1c</sub> was dichotomized with &#x02264; 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) as a target threshold. Additional analyses were explored by adding baseline fasting plasma glucose as a covariate, or using categorized fasting plasma glucose instead of the measurement as a continuous variable, as well as using dichotomized week 24 HbA<sub>1c</sub> value as the response variable. The general association between success of reaching target HbA<sub>1c</sub> and each fasting plasma glucose category was assessed using a Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel statistic. To verify the relevance of central laboratory fasting plasma glucose values obtained at visits to home self measurements, a subset of samples (<italic>n</italic> = 490) obtained at visits were compared by Pearson correlation coefficients with plasma referenced, self-measured, fasting capillary blood samples obtained the same week at home.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics and glycaemic responses</title><p>The 1036 participants were 56% male and 81% white with mean &#x000b1; <sc>sd</sc> age 56.3 &#x000b1; 9.9 years and duration of diabetes 8.4 &#x000b1; 5.9 years.

Although the baseline fasting plasma glucose value provided little indication of whether a patient would attain &#x02264; 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 24 weeks of treatment, a single clinic-measured fasting plasma glucose value &#x0003e; 10 mmol/l between 6 and 12 weeks after starting glargine was associated with &#x0223c;25% chance of attaining that target. Also, a fasting plasma glucose value of &#x02265; 10 mmol/l after 12 weeks of treatment suggested approximately 15% likelihood of ending with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e; 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) and 7% likelihood of a final HbA<sub>1c</sub> higher than 86 mmol/mol (10.0%). Not surprisingly, lower levels of fasting plasma glucose after 12 weeks of treatment with glargine were associated with more hypoglycaemia. However, the occurrence of severe hypoglycaemia was rare, even with intensive insulin therapy targeting fasting plasma glucose &#x0003c; 5.6 mmol/l. Thus, the occurrence of hypoglycaemia, when carefully managed, did not preclude intensification of insulin therapy.</p><p>These findings are potentially helpful despite the limitation inherent in their being based on only a single measurement of fasting plasma glucose for each patient at each time point. Collection of multiple self-measured values by the patient at home should provide a more substantial basis for evaluating the patient&#x02019;s early response to insulin therapy. When, despite a systematic titration plan, glargine fails to reduce fasting plasma glucose below10 mmol/l within the first 12 weeks, potentially important problems may be suspected. These might include development of a new medical problem that interferes with insulin&#x02019;s effectiveness, frequent omission of insulin injections, inability to make systematic decisions on dose&#x02013;titration, mishandling of insulin or faulty injection technique, or eating prior to measurement of fasting plasma glucose either at home or in the provider&#x02019;s office. If such medical or behavioural factors are not identified, the possibility of markedly elevated postprandial glucose values leading to wide daily variations of glucose should be considered, and addition of rapid-acting insulin or other prandial treatment may be indicated.</p><p>In conclusion, these analyses verify that attention to fasting plasma glucose changes in the first 12 weeks after starting treatment with glargine may allow earlier identification of patients unlikely to attain HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, leading to individualized attention and more timely and effective changes in management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Study funding was provided by Sanofi US.
