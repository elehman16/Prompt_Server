In this immunological substudy of the phase III Assessment of Oral Laquinimod in Preventing Progression of MS (ALLEGRO) trial, we performed an ex vivo and in vitro analysis of effects exerted by laquinimod on peripheral blood immune cell populations from RRMS patients with a special focus on monocyte phenotype and function. Approximately 100 patients were enrolled following a standardized protocol. Half of the patients received laquinimod and the other half received placebo. Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to commencement of therapy and after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of continuous therapy. Main lymphocytic and antigen presenting cell fractions were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ex vivo by flow cytometry. The proliferative response of PBMCs to mitogen or recall antigen was assessed in culture experiments. Untouched monocytes were sorted magnetically and cultured under pro-inflammatory conditions. PBMC analysis showed no significant differences of investigated lymphocytic and antigen presenting cell populations over time within each group, or between the two groups. However, the detailed in vitro analysis of monocytes demonstrated a lower level of CD86 expression on monocytes stimulated with LPS in laquinimod patients beginning from the 1st month of treatment. Upon pro-inflammatory stimulation, monocytes obtained from laquinimod treated patients tended to secrete lower levels of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL2 or CCL5. Taken together, in this prospective study, we demonstrate immune modulation but no immunosuppressive biological activity of laquinimod in a large group of MS patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>immunomodulation</kwd><kwd>laquinimod</kwd><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>neuroimmunology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Laquinimod (quinolin-3-carboxamide) is a novel, orally administered immunomodulatory drug which was developed for the treatment of relapsing&#x02013;remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It was selected based on an extensive structure-activity relationship program, which showed a high oral bioavailability, increased potency and a superior safety profile versus other candidates <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. In preclinical studies, laquinimod effectively inhibited disease incidence and relapses of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The mechanism of action may involve complex immune modulatory processes directed on specific elements of the autoimmune reaction. In a murine model of acute EAE, laquinimod did not reduce the number of B- or T-cells <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Rather it suppressed Th1 and Th17 cells and induced a Th2/3 shift of the immune response <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. There was an associated down-regulation of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12 and an up-regulation of TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-4, and IL-10. In parallel, laquinimod reduced the amount of leukocyte infiltration in the central nervous system (CNS) <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Importantly, the prophylactic and therapeutic administration of laquinimod in EAE resulted not only in a lower extent of CNS demyelination, but also in reduced acute axonal damage as well as in functional improvement of callosal axon excitability <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Most remarkably, laquinimod prevented atrophy of ventral horn motor neurons in EAE even when administered after the peak of the disease <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Additionally, a neuroprotective capacity of laquinimod was suggested by a recent report of our group showing that laquinimod induced a significant and persistent increase in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serum levels of MS patients <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. The role of BDNF for its mechanism of action was further confirmed by experiments showing a blunted effect of laquinimod in EAE in mice lacking BDNF expression in myeloid cells and T cells <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Transfer experiments in the same study also proved a role for monocytes as targets for laquinimod. Another possible mechanism of laquinimod associated neuroprotective activity was demonstrated in the cuprizone model of toxic demyelination. Here, laquinimod treatment prevented demyelination and acute axonal injury independently from the immune response in a mechanism involving direct, CNS intrinsic modulation of NF-kB signaling in astrocytes <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. The local CNS-specific laquinimod mode of action is well in concordance with the results of autoradiography studies showing rapid absorption and distribution of orally administrated <sup>14</sup>C-laquinimod in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord of laboratory animals suffering from EAE but also with an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>In inflammatory and autoimmune models other than EAE, laquinimod reduced or prevented clinical manifestations in an experimental model of systemic lupus erythematosus <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Laquinimod also diminished T-cell responses in experimental models of autoimmune neuritis <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. However, laquinimod did not exert any effect on graft survival in a rat heterotopic heart allograft model <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, suggesting a lack of influence on the heterotypic response of an animal to mount a cellular or humoral transplant reaction. Taken together, these data indicate that laquinimod is not an immunosuppressant, but rather acts as an immunomodulator with strong and complex neuroprotective activities.</p><p>In MS patients, laquinimod was effective in suppressing MRI-measured disease activity in both phase IIa and IIb clinical trials, and was well tolerated without any opportunistic infection <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Patients treated with laquinimod exhibited a 44% reduction in the mean cumulative number of active brain lesions as compared with placebo, and a significant decrease in the cumulative number of both Gd-enhancing and new T1 brain lesions <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. In turn, two large phase III clinical trials evaluated the effects of a daily dosage of 0.6&#x02009;mg laquinimod on clinical measures, and MRI measures of permanent axonal damage, as compared to either placebo or interferon-&#x003b2;1a in RRMS patients. The placebo-controlled phase III trial Assessment of Oral Laquinimod in Preventing Progression of MS (ALLEGRO) demonstrated clear effects of laquinimod 0.6&#x02009;mg in delaying disease progression and on reducing the accumulation of brain-tissue loss, as measured by MRI, together with a favorable safety and tolerability profile <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. The phase III comparison of laquinimod with interferon-beta-1a (BRAVO) trial demonstrated an insignificant effect of laquinimod on disability progression, but significant reductions in brain atrophy versus placebo, again with a very good safety profile <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p><p>In this immunological substudy of the phase III ALLEGRO trial, we sought to evaluate the immunological effects of laquinimod on PBMC populations and monocyte phenotype/function in RRMS patients.

The main finding of the analyses performed is a modulatory effect of laquinimod on the immune properties of monocytes stimulated in vitro with various pro-inflammatory factors including LPS and IFN&#x003b3;, reflecting the immune potential of these cells in vivo.</p><p>Already the earliest laquinimod studies in MS showed both protective and disease suppressive effects of this compound in different forms of EAE which is widely regarded as the best animal model of autoimmune CNS demyelination <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. The therapeutic effects of laquinimod in EAE were attributed to the anti-inflammatory shift of cytokine secretion (including inhibition of IL-17 production) <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and the regulation of CNS migratory properties of both lymphocytic and monocyte/macrophage cells <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p>Recently, it was shown by our group that adoptive transfer of laquinimod treated monocytes in mice suffering from EAE ameliorated the clinical course of the disease in a mechanism most probably dependent on a monocyte shift towards a regulatory and neuroprotective immune profile associated with BDNF secretion <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Taking in consideration the immune cell independent, astrocyte specific beneficial effects of laquinimod in the cuprizone demyelination model, our findings suggest monocytes alternatively or complementary to astrocytes as cellular carriers of the laquinimod-associated neuroprotective capacity <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Moreover, the results of a human leukocyte gene expression study indicated monocytes as one of the main targets of the immunoregulatory action of laquinimod <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Accordingly, in our in vitro analysis we decided to prospectively investigate the influence of laquinimod treatment on monocyte responses to different proinflammatory stimuli. The in vitro assessment of costimulatory profiles repeatedly showed lower levels of LPS stimulated CD86 expression in monocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of laquinimod treated patients, beginning already from the 1st month of the treatment. Interestingly, this difference was not present in monocytes cultured with IFN-&#x003b3;. Additionally, under pro-inflammatory conditions applied in our experiments (LPS or IFN-&#x003b3;), we did not observe any differences in the expression of CD80 between monocytes obtained from laquinimod and placebo treated patients. In our opinion, these results suggest the existence of a subtle immuno-regulatory action of laquinimod directed on monocytes which is specific for particular costimulatory mechanisms and dependent on the mode of pro-inflammatory stimulation. Of great importance seems to be the differential influence of laquinimod on the expression of particular members of the B7 family of costimulatory molecules. Due to their functional properties and their kinetics of expression, CD80 and CD86 are considered to play different roles in various phases of the immune reaction: CD86 delivering the main costimulatory signal in the most early stage and CD80 being expressed later after a previous pro-inflammatory stimulation <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Thus, the selective down-regulation of LPS but not IFN-&#x003b3; stimulated CD86 expression by monocytes may represent a central regulatory mechanism underlying the influence of laquinimod on APCs and in consequence on the putative auto-immune reaction in MS as a whole. This may be further supported by the influence of laquinimod treatment on chemokine secretion by monocytes under inflammatory conditions in vitro. In laquinimod treated patients, the down-regulation of CD86 expression on monocytes upon LPS stimulation was accompanied by a lower production of CCL5, whereas monocytes stimulated in vitro with IFN-&#x003b3; were characterized by a lower ability to secrete CCL2 with no differences in CCL5 secretion as compared to the placebo group. CCL2 is secreted by monocytes upon proinflammatory stimulation to recruit additional monocytes, memory T cells, and DCs to the site of inflammation. Similarly, CCL5, a member of the IL-8 super-family of cytokines, is a selective attractant for memory T lymphocytes and monocytes <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Both chemokines may play a crucial role in the recruitment and activation of inflammatory monocytes and other pathogenic immune cells to the central nervous system in MS and EAE <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. In active MS lesions, CCL2 was shown to be expressed by monocyte/macrophage cells and astroglia whereas CCL5 production was observed predominantly in non-immune cells, that is, astrocytes and endothelial components <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Importantly, both CCL2 and CCL5 were implicated as important factors regulating monocyte and lymphocyte BBB transmigration in MS <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. In agreement with our results showing the influence of laquinimod on chemokine secretion in humans, laquinimod treatment abrogated the CNS entry of pro-inflammatory monocytes in EAE in a mechanism involving the inhibition of local CCL2 production <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Most interestingly, an analysis of the secretion profile of glial cells in culture showed that laquinimod effects are depended on the glial cell type and the stimulus applied. In primary microglial cultures, laquinimod increased the TNF&#x003b1;-induced CCL5 secretion, whereas such effects were not observed after LPS stimulation. In primary astrocyte cultures stimulated with IL1&#x003b2; alone or in combination with IFN&#x003b3;, laquinimod strongly reduced the secretory reaction except for CCL5 production, which was increased by laquinimod as in the case of microglial cells <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. The opposite effects on CCL5 secretion after pro-inflammatory stimulation in glial cells and peripheral blood monocytes may suggest that laquinimod acts on immune cell trafficking at multiple levels including the peripheral immune system, the BBB and finally particularly CNS structures.</p><p>Recently Jolivel et al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> published an elegant experimental study analyzing the influence of laquinimod on DCs. In their experiments, the authors presented a profound effect of laquinimod on the functional properties of DC including cytokine and chemokine secretion and an immuno-regulatory action both in EAE and in MS patients. Importantly, one of the crucial findings of this study was a modulatory influence of laquinimod on CD86 expression on DCs. Both in splenic DCs of EAE mice and in conventional DC from the peripheral blood of MS patients, laquinimod treatment was associated with an increased CD86 expression. Yet, the in vitro experiments with human monocyte derived DCs showed that laquinimod inhibited LPS stimulated CD86 expression, which stays perfectly in line with our prospective 2-year long ex vivo observation. Additionally, similarly to our data Jolivel et al. did not observe any changes in HLA-DR expression in parallel to the CD86 modulatory effects of laquinimod. These results on DC together with our monocyte data imply that the immune-regulatory effects of laquinimod are cell-type specific and may involve a vast spectrum of antigen presenting cells. Such assumptions are confirmed by the results of a study in EAE demonstrating that the decrease of T cell encephalitogenicity in laquinimod treated mice was dependent on changes in APC subsets including the induction of regulatory monocyte and DC subpopulations <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to the in vitro findings, the ex vivo measurements encompassing all the main peripheral blood lymphocytic populations (B cells, T cells, NK cells, NKT cells, Tregs) as well as monocytes and mature CD83<sup>+</sup> DCs revealed no differences between the laquinimod and placebo treated groups over the 2 years of observation. Additionally, during the study we did not observe any effects of laquinimod treatment on the proliferative response of PBMCs either to mitogen or antigen-specific stimulation in vitro. These findings clearly show that longitudinal treatment with laquinimod does not exert any major, unspecific immunosuppressive influence on the crucial elements of patient's cellular immunity at any time point of the therapy, beginning from the 1st till the 24th month. Hence, we here provide a unique set of immune-safety data for the long-term treatment of MS patients with laquinimod. During the preparation of this manuscript, the results of a complementary study were published which solely focused on ex vivo analyses of immune cells from ALLEGRO study participants in the US <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. In full agreement with the ex vivo part of our study, there was also no effect of laquinimod on the main peripheral blood immune cell populations in the American MS patient population. These results further support the fine immune modulatory but not immunosuppressive biological activity of laquinimod in humans. Importantly, the laquinimod associated regulatory mechanisms may be directed on particular immune cell populations (especially antigen presenting cells) and may, with great probability, be organ- and disease-specific.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MS and RL planned and performed all the experimental procedures, LH designed the study and wrote the paper, OB analyzed the experimental data and performed the statistical analysis, RG designed the study and wrote the paper.
