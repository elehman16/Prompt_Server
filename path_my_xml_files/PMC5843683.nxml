id="Par1">Reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is important for patients with a high risk for atherosclerotic events, such as patients with diabetes and other risk factors. Anagliptin was reported to reduce LDL-C for 12&#x000a0;weeks in phase III trials regardless of the use of statins, but it is uncertain whether this effect is common to other dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial was conducted to confirm the superiority of anagliptin to sitagliptin in terms of the primary endpoint of reduction of LDL-C for 52&#x000a0;weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular lesions, as well as the non-inferiority of anagliptin to sitagliptin in terms of change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Patients are randomly assigned to receive anagliptin or sitagliptin at a ratio of 1:1, with those in the anagliptin group receiving anagliptin 100&#x000a0;mg orally twice per day and those in the sitagliptin group receiving sitagliptin 50&#x000a0;mg orally once per day. During the trial period, hypoglycemic agents and anti-dyslipidemia drugs should not be added and neither should their dosages be changed. A total sample size of 300 was estimated to provide a power of 0.8 with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 for LDL-C, considering a 30% dropout rate. Pre-specified factors for subgroup analyses are HbA1c, use of DPP-4 inhibitors, sex, body mass index, LDL-C, age, and the presence of treatment for existing ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">If anagliptin were to be shown to reduce LDL-C in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular lesions despite pre-existing statin treatment, more intensive cholesterol management would be appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p id="Par4"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NCT02330406</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s10557-018-6776-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>DPP-4 inhibitors</kwd><kwd>Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</kwd><kwd>Type 2 diabetic patients</kwd><kwd>Dyslipidemia</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular risk</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">Diabetes mellitus is one of the strongest risk factors for atherosclerotic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Europe and the USA, myocardial infarction is the direct cause of death in 40&#x02013;50% of patients with diabetes, and the number of patients with diabetes that die as a direct result of ischemic heart disease is reportedly increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In a Finnish study, the rate of incipient myocardial infarction among patients with diabetes was roughly equal to the rate of recurrent myocardial infarction among non-diabetic patients; furthermore, patients with diabetes and prior myocardial infarction demonstrated a greatly increased incidence of myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although the application of such results to the Japanese population is not straightforward, existing atherosclerotic vascular lesions and diabetes mellitus are undoubtedly major risk factors for further fatal vascular diseases. Therefore, multifactorial intervention, including control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, is crucial for the prevention of vascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors enhance the action of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), the most physiologically important incretin, and they consequently show various actions, such as the stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, inhibition of gastric emptying, and appetite regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. DPP-4 inhibitors have become standard drugs to improve hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in patients with diabetes, though improvement of cardiovascular outcomes by adding DPP-4 inhibitors to usual care in diabetic patients with established cardiovascular diseases has not yet been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Anagliptin is unique among the DPP-4 inhibitors because it was reported to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 9.5&#x000a0;mg/dL over 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in phase III trials regardless of the use of statins. This effect of anagliptin may not be a &#x0201c;class effect&#x0201d; of DPP-4 inhibitors, because there has been experimental evidence to suggest that anagliptin inhibits the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine and cholesterol synthesis in the liver, which presumably are involved in the LDL-C-mediated reduction by anagliptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">This LDL-C-lowering effect of anagliptin is particularly relevant to diabetic patients with high cardiovascular risk, but such patients are likely to be excluded from clinical trials for regulatory approval. The aim of the present study is, therefore, to investigate the comparative effects of anagliptin and sitagliptin, which was most frequently prescribed in Japan, on LDL-C in patients with type 2 diabetes with dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic vascular lesions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial Design</title><p id="Par8">This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial to determine the effectiveness of anagliptin versus sitagliptin on reduction in LDL-C in patients with type 2 diabetes and existing atherosclerotic vascular lesions.

The null hypothesis is that the 97.5% upper one-sided confidence limit for [change in HbA1c in sitagliptin group&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;change in HbA1c in anagliptin group] &#x02265;&#x02009;0.3, and the alternative hypothesis is that the 97.5% upper one-sided confidence limit for [change in HbA1c in sitagliptin group&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;change in HbA1c in anagliptin group] &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.3.</p><p id="Par24">A total sample size of 300 provides a power of 0.8 for HbA1c on the assumption that the SD for HbA1c in the anagliptin group based on a previous clinical trial is 0.91, and the non-inferiority margin is 0.3 with a one-sided alpha of 0.025.</p><p id="Par25">The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be specified before data analysis. The full analysis set (FAS) includes patients who received allocated treatment and provided assessable outcome data. The safety analysis set (SAS) includes patients who received allocated treatment at least once. The per protocol set (PPS) includes patients who received allocated treatment and for whom planned outcome data as per the protocol are available. The FAS is used for the primary endpoint, and the FAS and PPS are used for the important secondary and other secondary endpoints. The SAS is used for safety outcomes. Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies with percentages, and continuous variables are expressed as means with SDs or medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs). All analyses are conducted under the intention-to-treat principle.</p><p id="Par26">Repeated ANOVA with mixed effect models for repeated measures (MMRM) will be developed to compare the anagliptin and sitagliptin groups in terms of change in LDL-C. In this model, treatment allocation and time are treated as fixed effects and include five variables used in balancing factors at randomization as covariates. The same model without covariates of stratification variables will also be developed for sensitivity analyses. The non-inferiority of the anagliptin group to the sitagliptin group in terms of HbA1c levels will be examined with a non-inferiority margin of 0.3%.</p><p id="Par27">For the changes in other endpoints, a one-sample <italic>t</italic> test is used for comparisons of the baseline and follow-up values within the group, and two-sample <italic>t</italic> tests are used for comparisons between groups. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method is used for missing values.</p><p id="Par28">The number and frequency of categorical safety outcomes will be presented and compared between groups by the chi-squared test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The means are presented with SDs or medians with IQRs for laboratory parameters, and a one-sample <italic>t</italic> test is used for comparisons of the baseline and follow-up values within the group, with two-sample <italic>t</italic> tests used for comparisons between groups. The LOCF method is used for missing values.</p><p id="Par29">Subgroup analyses for the primary and important secondary endpoints will be determined before fixing the SAP. The following pre-specified factors are used for subgroup analyses for the primary and important secondary endpoints: HbA1c (&#x02265;&#x02009;8.0%, &#x0003c;&#x02009;8.0%), use of DPP-4 inhibitors prior to trial registration, sex, BMI (&#x02265;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, &#x0003c;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), LDL-C (&#x02265;&#x02009;130&#x000a0;mg/dL, &#x0003c;&#x02009;130&#x000a0;mg/dL), age (&#x02265;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;years, &#x0003c;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;years), and the presence of treatment for existing ischemic heart disease before enrollment (PCI or CABG). The statistical significance of possible treatment effect heterogeneity between subgroups is assessed with interaction terms in repeated ANOVA. Other exploratory analyses are conducted based on the consensus of the Steering Committee. Because of the exploratory nature of these analyses for other than the primary endpoint, no correction for multiplicity is made.</p><p id="Par30">All statistical analyses are performed by a study statistician (Morimoto T) and members of the data center (Institute for Clinical Effectiveness) with the use of JMP 13.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) based on the SAP. All <italic>P</italic> values are two-sided, and <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 is considered significant other than for the non-inferiority test for HbA1c, where a one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.025 is considered significant. For baseline data, missing data are not imputed, and data with missing data are analyzed as they are. Because of the short enrollment and follow-up periods and the estimated low risk of adverse events, no interim analyses are planned.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">This pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial was designed to investigate the comparative effects of two DPP-4 inhibitors, anagliptin and sitagliptin, on plasma levels of LDL-C in type 2 diabetic patients with a high risk for cardiovascular diseases. The lipid-lowering effect of anagliptin was first demonstrated in a phase III trial comparing anagliptin to placebo as a single agent or with concurrent anti-diabetic treatment, such as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanide, sulfonylurea, or thiazolidine in type 2 diabetic patients for 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Anagliptin significantly lowered LDL-C by 5.4&#x000a0;mg/dL and, though it was a before and after comparison, further reduction of LDL-C levels by 9.7&#x000a0;mg/dL compared to those at baseline was observed during the additional observation period extended to 52&#x000a0;weeks. In terms of effects of sitagliptin on lipid metabolism, a similar extended phase III trial showed no significant reduction of LDL-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis including 11 randomized controlled trials showed that sitagliptin alone or in combination with other drugs significantly improved levels of serum TG and HDL-C but had no effects on LDL-C levels with substantial heterogeneities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although these data suggest that LDL-C-lowering effects of anagliptin seem specific among DPP-4 inhibitors, we should, however, interpret them with great caution because measurement of lipid was not the primary end point in most studies and therefore not well standardized among studies. In addition, there has been no direct comparison between anagliptin and other DPP-4 inhibitors. Possible beneficial effects of anagliptin on lipid metabolism, therefore, should also be demonstrated in a pragmatic trial with a longer observation period that compares it to other DPP-4 inhibitor regarding LDL-C as the primary end point and enrolls more relevant patients, i.e., patients with a high cardiovascular risk with insufficient lipid-lowering despite use of statins. From these points of view, this trial was designed to enroll type 2 diabetic patients with at least one atherosclerotic vascular lesion and LDL-C levels above 100&#x000a0;mg/dL on statin treatment, with an observation period of 52&#x000a0;weeks after randomization. Given that DPP-4 inhibitors are the most frequently prescribed anti-diabetic drugs in Japan, comparing anagliptin to sitagliptin as an active control rather than placebo is more realistic and relevant to clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">From the points of view discussed above, a pragmatic, unblended, randomized, controlled trial comparing the effects of anagliptin and sitagliptin on plasma LDL-C levels in type 2 diabetic patients with at least one atherosclerotic vascular lesion and insufficient LDL-C lowering despite the use of statins was designed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
