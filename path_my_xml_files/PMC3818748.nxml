compare the efficacy of ultrasound treatments of various durations for patients with
subacromial impingement syndrome. [Subjects and Methods] One hundred patients who had been
diagnosed with subacromial impingement syndrome by clinical examination and magnetic
resonance imaging were included in this study. Patients were randomly divided into two
groups of fifty patients per group. The first group received 15 sessions of therapeutic
ultrasound (4 minutes), superficial heat and transcutaneous electrical stimulation therapy
combined with exercise. The second group received the same treatment except that each of
the 15 ultrasound sessions were eight minutes in length. The patients were evaluated
before and after the treatment. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain, the
University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and Constant Scale were used to assess
shoulder function and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to quantify depressive
symptoms. [Results] There were no statistically significant differences between the groups
in age, time since the onset of pain, sex, education and depression levels prior to the
treatment. The post-treatment evaluation of patients VAS, UCLA, Constant, and BDI scores
showed statistically significant within group improvements. When the two groups were
compared, we found no statistically significant differences in the Constant activities of
daily living, Constant external rotation, Constant force and BDI scores. However, the
second group scored better than the first group in all the remaining parameters.
[Conclusion] Ultrasound therapy was found to have beneficial effects on pain and
functional status in the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome. Eight minutes of
ultrasound treatment was shown to be more effective than 4 minutes of ultrasound
treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Shoulder</kwd><kwd>Subacromial impingement syndrome</kwd><kwd>Ultrasound</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is characterized by severe pain spreading from the
shoulder throughout the biceps and deltoid. The pain increases at night and with abduction
and internal rotation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. SIS is one of the
most frequent causes of shoulder pain and occurs when the muscles comprising the rotator
cuff are compressed in the subacromial space and the coracoacromial arch<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Multiple predisposing factors play a role
in the development of SIS. The most common risk factors are weak rotator cuff muscles,
abnormal scapular muscle structure, abnormal structure of the acromion, repetitive trauma,
articular capsule abnormalities and overhead arm activity for long periods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The primary goals of treatment are to improve function and reduce pain. The first steps in
treatment are rest, ice packs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If healing is not
achieved, physical therapy and rehabilitation are administered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapy programs
include mobilization and manipulation techniques, magnetic field therapy, ultrasound,
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and infrared therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ultrasound is a
frequently used method in physical therapy. Ultrasound increases tissue temperature, blood
flow and tissue collagen elasticity and is also effective at relieving muscle spasms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While there are many studies in the literature on the use of various physical therapy
methods alone, in combination, compared to each other or to a placebo for the conservative
treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome, there are no studies comparing various
durations of ultrasound therapy.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate various durations of ultrasound therapy in the
conservative treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>One hundred patients admitted to the outpatient clinic of the Istanbul Physical Therapy and
Rehabilitation Education and Research Hospital with shoulder pain between January 2012 and
December 2012 who were clinically and radiologically diagnosed with subacromial impingement
syndrome were included in this study. A detailed history was obtained from all patients and
a thorough physical examination was performed in order to develop a differential diagnosis
and final diagnosis. Clinical diagnostic tests, including the Neer, Hawkins, painful arc,
drop arm, Yergeson, Jobe and supraspinatus tests, were conducted. MRI images of the patients
were examined and the findings were recorded. Patients above forty years of age who had
symptoms for six months or longer and had findings compatible with nerve compression on
physical examination and whose passive range of motion was less than 30% compared to the
unaffected side were included in this study. Patients with systemic inflammatory rheumatic
diseases, decompensated heart failure, neurologic deficits who had undergone shoulder and
neck surgery, who had received physical therapy and steroid injections for their shoulder
pain, who had findings consistent with calcific tendinitis and bursitis on conventional XR
images, who had complete lacerations on their MRI images this or who had adhesive capsulitis
and shoulder instability were excluded from the study.</p><p>The 100 patients included in this study were divided into 2 groups each consisting of 50
patients using consecutive sequential randomization. The first group received fifteen
ultrasound treatment sessions for the affected shoulder (1.5&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 4 minutes),
as well as TENS (30 minutes), infrared therapy (20 minutes) and physical therapy exercises.
The second group received the same treatment, except that each of the 15 ultrasound sessions
were eight minutes in length instead of 4 minutes.</p><p>Continuous ultrasound was applied using circular motions for 15 sessions (with a frequency
of 5 times per week). A Chattanooga brand ultrasound machine with a transducer head size of
5&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> was used. The initial exercise program consisted of Codman's pendulum
exercises, passive range of motion exercises and stretching exercises. Posterior capsular
stretching exercises and wall walking exercises were also performed. The exercises were
taught to the patients at the beginning of the physical therapy program. After the patients
achieved full or nearly full range of motion, shoulder-strengthening exercises were
performed. Patients were instructed to not to use their affected arm for daily activities,
in particular overhead activities, in order to properly rehabilitate their shoulders. After
the patients' shoulders were properly strengthened, they were allowed to abduct their
shoulder greater than 90 degrees and use their arm for daily activities. The exercises were
performed under observation in the outpatient clinic, twice a week, and the patients were
instructed to carry out the exercise program at home twice a day with 20 repetitions per
exercise.</p><p>The patients were evaluated before treatment and 15 days after the end of treatment. Pain
was evaluated using a VAS (visual analog scale), functional activity was evaluated using the
UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) shoulder rating scale and the Constant
shoulder score, and depression was evaluated using the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory).</p><p><bold>Pain score:</bold> Pain was categorized as occurring while resting, moving or
sleeping. Pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). A 10&#x02005;cm line was drawn,
divided into ten equal segments, and numbered from 0 to 10 (0=no pain, 5=moderate pain,
10=worst pain). The patients were asked to mark the most appropriate value describing their
pain on the scale.</p><p><bold>UCLA score:</bold> Pain, function, patient satisfaction, strength of forward flexion
and active forward flexion were evaluated and the following point system was utilized: 34&#x02013;35
points were classed as excellent, 29&#x02013;33 points as good and less than 29 points as poor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p><bold>Constant shoulder score:</bold> Pain, activity level, active ROM and strength
parameters were evaluated and the total possible score was 100 points: 90&#x02013;100 points were
classed as excellent, 80&#x02013;89 points as good, 70&#x02013;79 points as moderate and &#x0003c;70 points as
poor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was conducted for each patient to screen for depression
and evaluate the severity of the depressive symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to definitive statistics, the independent t-test was
used to compare inter-group values and the paired t-test was used to compare values within a
group. A p-value of &#x02264; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>This study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, approval for the
conduct of the experiment was received from the local ethics committee, and all patients
included in this study signed an informed consent form. The writers have no conflict of
interest to declare.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Demographic features</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GROUP 1 (n=50)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GROUP 2 (n=50)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex</td><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Avarage age (year)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.4&#x000b1;7.63</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.7&#x000b1;8.67</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time since the onset of pain (month)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.34&#x000b1;4.86</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.66&#x000b1;4.91</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Occupation</td><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Housewives</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Government employees</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Private sector</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Retirees</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>(N=100) Values are mean &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The average age of the 100 patients included in this study was 54.99&#x000b1;8.10&#x02005;years (42&#x02013;68).

than the first group in all the remaining parameters after treatment (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Subacromial impingement syndrome is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain and a
general consensus on the method of treatment within the realm of physical therapy has not
yet been reached<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rest, cold compress,
exercise, NSAIDs and ultrasound are among the most common treatment protocols for SIS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The efficacy of different durations of ultrasound therapy for the treatment of patients
diagnosed with SIS was compared in this study. There was a significant decrease in the VAS,
Constant and UCLA scores of the group that received ultrasound treatment for 8 minutes
compared to the group that received ultrasound for 4 minutes. The effectiveness of
ultrasound in the treatment of SIS has been shown in various studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, but there are
also studies indicating that it is not effective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Different durations of ultrasound have been used in various studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup> but, to our
knowledge, there is no study in the literature that has directly compared treatment
different durations.The result of this study indicate that ultrasound therapy is beneficial
in the treatment of SIS.</p><p>In a study by Robertson et al. conventional ultrasound and placebo ultrasound were
compared, and it was shown that conventional ultrasound was more effective than placebo with
regards to range of motion and pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
study by Levendo&#x0011f;lu et al. compared the effectiveness of physical therapy versus steroid
injections in patients with SIS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
their study, 8 minutes of ultrasound was administered and a meaningful increase in range of
motion and VAS was recorded after treatment.</p><p>In the studies on ultrasound therapy for SIS, there are differences in parameters like the
duration and intensity of ultrasound therapy. Ebenbichler et al. administered
2.5&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.89 mh 1:4 intermittent ultrasound) ultrasound 5 times a day for 3
weeks and then 3 times a week for 3 weeks to patients with calcific tendonitis in the
supraspinatus tendon. They reported and the calcium deposits disappeared or disintegrated in
19% of patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Santamato et al.
compared laser therapy and ultrasound therapy in their study. The ultrasound group received
1 mHz 2&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> ultrasound for 10 minutes and there was a significant improvement
in their VAS scores<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Johanson et al.
compared the effectiveness of acupuncture and ultrasound therapy in patients with SIS. The
ultrasound group received 1 mHz 2&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> ultrasound for 10 minutes in 10 sessions,
and this amount of therapeutic ultrasound was reported to be effective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The incidences of chronic pain and depression is increased in patients with SIS. &#x000c7;elik et
al. compared the effect of two different exercise programs on pain. TENS for 20 minutes,
1&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> intermittent ultrasound for 4 minutes and an exercise program were
administered to both groups and the Constant pain score and VAS score were significantly
decreased in both groups at the end of the second and the 16th weeks. Similarly, the Beck
Depression Inventory was used in their study and a meaningful improvement was observed in
both groups at the end of the 16th week<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The limitations of our study include a lack of control and placebo groups and that the
long-term effects of the treatment were not evaluated.</p><p>In conclusion, ultrasound therapy was effective at decreasing pain and improving
functionality. We showed that 8 minutes of ultrasound administration was more effective than
4 minutes at relieving pain and improving functionality. However, studies with a larger
number of patients and ultrasound treatments of various durations and intensities are needed
to determine the appropriate intensity and duration of ultrasound therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Santamato</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Solfrizzi</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Panza</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal> et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Randomized clinical trial people with subacromial
