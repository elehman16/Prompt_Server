Contraceptive vaginal rings (CVRs) are available in a number of countries and are most of the time used intermittently i.e. three weeks out of a 4-week cycle. Efficacy trials with a dapivirine-containing vaginal ring for HIV prevention are ongoing and plans to develop multi-purpose vaginal rings for prevention of both HIV and pregnancy have been elaborated. In contrast with the CVRs, multi-purpose vaginal rings will have to be used continuously. Women who continuously use a CVR will no longer have menses. Furthermore, some safety aspects of CVR use have never been studied in-depth in the past, such as the impact of the vaginal ring on the vaginal microbiota, biofilm formation and induction of inflammation. We studied acceptability and these novel aspects of safety in Rwandan women. Although significant progress has been made over the past decade, Rwanda still has a high unmet need for contraception (with 47% unplanned births) and a generalized HIV epidemic, and CVRs are not yet available.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We will conduct an open label, single centre, randomized controlled trial. A total of 120 HIV-negative women will be randomized to intermittent CVR use (to allow menstruation) or continuous CVR use. Women will be followed for a maximum of 14&#x000a0;weeks. In parallel, we will conduct a qualitative study using in-depth interview and focus group discussion methodology.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In addition to evaluating the safety and acceptability of intermittent and continuous CVR use in Rwandan women, we hope that our findings will inform the development of future multipurpose vaginal rings, will prepare Rwandan study populations for future clinical trials of multipurpose vaginal rings, and will pave the way for introduction of CVRs on African markets.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01796613?term=NCT01796613&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01796613</ext-link>.

Compared to systemic dosing, this maximizes efficacy at lower doses, thereby reducing side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the ring can stay in place for 1&#x02013;3 months, which improves adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In recent years, vaginal rings have become popular for contraception and estrogen replacement therapy in Latin America, the United States and Europe where studies on the acceptability of the contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) have shown overall good adherence and acceptability. On average, 85% of the users were satisfied or very satisfied and 85% to 90% would recommend the method to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>However, CVRs are not yet on the market in any African country. Limited vaginal ring acceptability data are available in the context of HIV prevention research. A study by the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) in Tanzania and South Africa evaluated the acceptability of a vaginal ring without any active drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The study found that the vast majority of women felt comfortable inserting and removing the ring, acceptability increased with prolonged use, and only one male sexual partner felt the ring during sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This placebo ring and a similar ring containing the antiretroviral drug dapivirine are currently used in two HIV prevention efficacy trials in African women (the IPM027 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and MTN020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] trials). CONRAD is currently developing a contraceptive/microbicide CVR (similar to NuvaRing&#x000ae;) and reformulating tenofovir gel with contraceptive properties for use with the SILCS diaphragm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Given these developments, we believe that single-purpose and/or multi-purpose vaginal rings will eventually be introduced in African settings.</p><p>A multi-purpose vaginal ring will have to be used continuously, which is different from the way CVRs currently are mostly used. Current use is intermittent, i.e. the ring is taken out for one week after having been in place for three weeks. Women who continuously use a CVR will no longer have menses. We need in-depth data on the acceptability of the vaginal ring and of continuous use. Gaining a better understanding of acceptability requires the assessment of an intertwined set of variables and constructs such as users&#x02019; personal characteristics and factors influencing the user experience (product efficacy, attributes, and price; relationship context and factors impacting on sexuality). These factors in turn are embedded in a specific sociocultural context. The conceptual framework developed by Woodsong et al. for assessing the vaginal ring for microbicide delivery will guide our acceptability research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an imbalance of the vaginal microbiome. Epidemiological studies have shown that women with BV are twice more likely to acquire HIV than women without BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The vaginal microbiome can now be characterized in much more detail using molecular methods than was previously possible using microscopy. Very recent research has shown that the vaginal microbiome in African women can be categorized into at least 6 different bacterial communities, each with distinct characteristics in terms of the types and quantities of bacteria present, whether or not inflammation is induced and whether there is an increased risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The presence of inflammation is particularly important because inflammation often causes symptoms (itching, burning) and is associated with an influx of HIV target cells e.g. CD4+ T cells and macrophages into the genital area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is therefore very important that any product used inside the vagina (such as a CVR) does not cause irritation and/or inflammation.</p><p>BV has also been associated with biofilm formation of microorganisms on the vaginal epithelia and this may be why BV recurrence rates are very high after initial successful treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. BV is more common in African and African-American women, which could be due to the high prevalence of vaginal anaerobic bacteria that are prone to form biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is also well known that biofilms easily form on the surface of catheters and prostheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Knowledge is lacking on whether vaginal bacteria can adhere to the ring and form a biofilm. A small study among four non-human primates suggested that the vaginal ring could lead to biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We therefore need to explore the formation of biofilms on vaginal rings in the vagina for different periods of time. Furthermore, biofilms may hamper delivery of the active compounds of the rings and could lead to clinical BV (which increases risk of HIV acquisition). Better knowledge on biofilm formation in the cervicovaginal context will aid further development of multi-purpose vaginal rings.</p><p>In Africa, especially in Rwanda there is an unmet need for contraception with 47% unplanned births and a generalized HIV epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Several large epidemiological studies have suggested an increased risk of HIV acquisition in women using high dose long-acting progestogens (the so-called &#x02018;injectables&#x02019;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], which means that these may have to be replaced with other long-acting hormonal methods such as CVRs, provided that they do not pose an HIV acquisition risk by causing inflammation.</p><p>The CVR that will be used in this trial is commercialized under the trade name of NuvaRing&#x000ae;, approved since 2001 by most countries within the European Union, and in the United Stated by the FDA. To date NuvaRing&#x000ae; is available in 32 countries and used by approximately 1.5 million women. NuvaRing&#x000ae; contains etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and is manufactured by N.V. Organon (a subsidiary of Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc.,), Oss, the Netherlands.</p><p>We describe here the study protocol as it was initially designed. At time of submission of this paper, the study has started and data collection and analyses are ongoing.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The study will be a multidisciplinary research project with two aims. The first aim will be to determine the safety of a CVR in women, with an emphasis on its effect on the vaginal microenvironment after different durations of use: the vaginal microbiome, biofilm formation on epithelial cells and rings, inflammation and immune activation in the vagina; and the second aim to investigate the feasibility, acceptability and adherence to vaginal ring use in Rwandan women, including attitudes towards a future multi-purpose vaginal ring for prevention of both pregnancy and STIs.</p><p>The study objectives are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

All women randomized and who insert the CVR at the enrollment visit will be included in the analysis under the group they are randomized to, even if they discontinue before visit 2 (week 4). For the analyses requiring vaginal or urine samples, all women with available data will be used, i.e. women without a sample prior to or during CVR use will be excluded.</p><p>Participants in each treatment group will be described with respect to baseline characteristics. The primary analysis is based on the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) vaginal flora data. This data will comprise different species and will be recorded at baseline (week 0), and at 3 (group A) or 4 (group B) time points during CVR use.</p><p>The presence/absence of each species during CVR use will be analyzed using repeated measures logistic regression models, with random intercepts and random slopes over time for each woman and fixed effects for randomization group (intercept and slope).</p><p>The incidence of signs and symptoms, study/ring use withdrawals, adverse experiences and STIs will be compared among randomization groups over the full study period using Fisher's exact test. Changes in Nugent scores and Ison &#x00026; Hay grading of the vaginal flora will be graphically depicted and analysed using repeated measures (logistic) regression models.</p><p>The statistical analysis of secondary objectives 2 and 3 are research and data driven, no prior statistical analysis plan will be made but the statistical analysis methods will be fully described in the resulting reports and/or publications. Presence/absence of dispersed/adherent form of BV-related bacteria and of biofilms will be analyzed using repeated measures logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p>All IDIs and FGDs will be audio-recorded and will be followed by a debriefing session. After transcription and translation, data will be uploaded into Nvivo 9.</p><p>For the primary objective, the IDI and FGD data will be analysed through a deductive, content-analytical approach to assess if the components of the theoretical framework developed by Woodsong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] are valid in the given setting. New elements that emerge from the data will be integrated into the framework. Selected statistical analysis will be conducted on the data of the individual asked questionnaires, the ballot box questionnaires and the self-rating adherence scales. This quantitative analysis will be largely descriptive.</p><p>To analyse the IDIs and FGDs for the secondary objectives, open coding methodology based on a data driven framework will be developed by the research team.</p><p>A descriptive analysis of the data from the individual asked questionnaires will be conducted to address the exploratory objectives, in parallel with coding of the IDIs and FGDs based on a risk perception attitude framework supplemented by the research team as themes emerge.</p><p>All coding and analysis will be performed by at least two qualitative researchers to compare their coding and reach consensus on convergent issues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Ethics</title><p>The protocol and all study documents were reviewed and approved by the IRB of the ITM, the EC of UZA and the RNEC, the National Health Research Committee and to the Rwandan Ministry of Health (MoH). Approval for importing vaginal rings was obtained from the Rwandan MoH. No study activities will be performed before approval from all these bodies is obtained.</p><p>Yearly re-approval from the RNEC will be sought after submission of the annual report.</p><p>The study will be carried out according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki, all applicable national and international regulations and International Conference on Harmonization and World Health Organization GCP guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Steering committee and trial management group</title><p>A Trial Management Group (TMG) will be in charge of the day-to-day management of the clinical trial.</p><p>A Steering Committee (SC) will be set up to manage and supervise the entire project. The SC will consist of the TMG and at least one study member of each partner institution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Archiving</title><p>The PI and the sponsor must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study and the verification of the data.</p><p>After completion of the study, the site investigator file and the sponsor trial master file will remain available for internal audits and/or inspections of regulatory authorities for a period of twenty years in accordance with the Belgian legislation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Before implementing an intervention, it is beneficial to investigate whether this intervention, if proven effective, will be accepted and used by the local population. Therefore a mixed method approach was chosen for our study. However including a sociological component to a clinical study can be challenging as sexual behavior questioning in research trials is not straight forward due to several factors, for example the public opinion or the risk of being excluded from the study, and participants may give inaccurate reports. For this reason different sources such as the questionnaires, diary cards and data obtained from the IDIs and FGDs will be used to triangulate and assess the validity of the data.</p><p>Another challenge is to follow the protocol as designed at the start of a clinical trial. As it is an intricate task to predict every need that will arise during the course of the study, it could be that, after a cautious assessment of the pros and cons, changes are required during the study. For our study, two main changes occurred: an additional cervical swab taken at baseline for the rapid detection of CT using the BioChekSwab (a rapid self-contained, two step enzyme detection system) and the range of male partners that were invited for an IDI was broaden from partners from women who participated in the end trial IDI or FGD to all partners. These amendments to the protocol were submitted and approved by all involved review bodies.</p><p>Multi-purpose rings require continuous use. However as the CVR used in our study, the NuvaRing&#x000ae;, releases the contraceptive hormones etonogestrel and ethinylestradiol over a period of 3&#x000a0;weeks (with a maximum of 4&#x000a0;weeks after which the contraceptive effect cannot be guaranteed anymore), it was not possible to implement continuous use. Our continuous use study regimen, i.e. replacing the ring every 3&#x000a0;weeks, approaches the continuous use as close as possible.</p><p>Due to the expected short recruitment period and the use of commercially available and approved CVRs, no formal data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be set up and an independent data safety monitor will be appointed. In case of major safety concerns, this person will request the sponsor to halt recruitment of the trial and/or to organize a formal DSMB with a complete overview of all available safety data.</p><p>The proposed study will prepare the study community in Rwanda for vaginal ring use. It will improve the study instruments (particularly related to adherence and acceptability) of the RU research centre and will strengthen their research capacity even further. In a wider context, the project results will be shared within our extensive network of microbicide researchers and in particular within the network of the single- and multipurpose vaginal ring researchers. Our findings will thus inform the development of future multipurpose vaginal rings for Africa and future vaginal ring trial design. Finally this study may lead to the introduction of contraceptive vaginal rings on African markets.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Study status</title><p>The study is ongoing.
