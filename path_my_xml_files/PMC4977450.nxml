In this phase 3, observer-blind study, 274 children aged 12&#x02212;24 months were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose of JE-CV (Group JE-CV) or the SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2 vaccine currently used to vaccinate against JE in the Republic of Korea (Group SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2). JE neutralizing antibody titers were assessed using PRNT<sub>50</sub> before and 28&#x000a0;days after vaccination. The primary endpoint of non-inferiority of seroconversion rates on D28 was demonstrated in the Per Protocol analysis set as the difference between Group JE-CV and Group SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2 was 0.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI]: &#x02212;2.35; 4.68), which was above the required &#x02212;10%. Seroconversion and seroprotection rates 28&#x000a0;days after administration of a single vaccine dose were 100% in Group JE-CV and 99.1% in Group SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2; all children except one (Group SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2) were seroprotected. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) increased in both groups from D0 to D28; GM of titer ratios were slightly higher in Group JE-CV (182 [95% CI: 131; 251]) than Group SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2 (116 [95% CI: 85.5, 157]). A single dose of JE-CV was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. In conclusion, a single dose of JE-CV or SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2 vaccine elicited a comparable immune response with a good safety profile. Results obtained in healthy Korean children aged 12&#x02212;24 months vaccinated with JE-CV are consistent with those obtained in previous studies conducted with JE-CV in toddlers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine</kwd><kwd>Phase 3 trial</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="21"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>

However, these figures are thought to considerably underestimate the true burden of JE, given inadequate JE surveillance and reporting in most countries of the Southeast Asia and western Pacific region.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,5</sup></xref></p><p>In the Republic of Korea, a live attenuated JE vaccine SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2 (CD.JEVAX&#x000ae;, Chengdu Institute of Biological Products, People's Republic of China) is one of the currently available products used to vaccinate against JE. Inactivated JE vaccines are also available in the country. The recommended schedule of SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2 vaccine in Korea is a single dose for primary immunization at 12 mo of age and a booster dose one year later. A comprehensive vaccination program has contributed to an estimated JE vaccination coverage (&#x02265; 2 doses) of 75.8% among children aged 7&#x02212;83 mo.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>A new live attenuated JE chimeric virus vaccine (JE-CV) has been developed as an alternative to give protection against JE with an improved overall safety profile compared with the older generation of mouse brain derived inactivated anti-JE vaccines (MBDV). JE-CV was developed using ChimeriVax technology by replacing the genes for yellow fever vaccine (YFV 17D 204) premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins with those of JE attenuated virus strain SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,8,9</sup></xref> This vaccine has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in clinical trials in adults in Australia and the USA<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and in toddlers and children in Thailand, the Philippines and Taiwan.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11-14</sup></xref> A phase 3 study conducted in 300 children aged 9&#x02212;18 mo in Thailand showed that a single dose of JE-CV or SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2 vaccine elicited a comparable immune response with a satisfactory safety profile.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The current recommended schedule in the pediatric population is a primary injection from 12 mo of age and over followed by a booster dose between 12 and 24 mo later.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> JE-CV was first licensed in Thailand and Australia in 2010.</p><p>This was a phase 3 study in children aged 12 to 24 mo in the Republic of Korea.

Secondary objectives were to further describe the immunogenicity results in both vaccine groups (before and 28 d after the vaccination), safety in all children up to 28 d after vaccination and serious adverse events (SAEs) within 6 mo after vaccination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0002-0001"><title>Participants and demography</title><p>The study was conducted between July 2011 and March 2013. As the JE vaccine is generally preferred to be given in Spring and Summer, children were recruited in two cohorts (July to December 2011 and May to September 2012). Fewer children than planned (274 rather than 300) participated in the study owing to slow recruitment at the end of the study (outside the usual JE vaccination period), the expiry date of the comparator and the start of the seasonal influenza vaccination campaign at the end of September (administration of a concomitant vaccine was an exclusion criteria). Though the influenza vaccination rate of toddlers 12&#x02212;24 mo of age is not available, according to the nationwide vaccine coverage level: Conceptual Methodology and Survey (2008.05.16&#x02212;2009.03.15), influenza vaccine presented about 50% coverage rate in children 24 mo&#x02212;6 y of age. Children 6&#x02013;59 mo of age are the priority target group for influenza vaccination and are recommended to be vaccinated annually in Korea. Children aged 6 mo through 8 y receiving influenza vaccine for the first time should receive two doses administered at least 1 mo apart. Therefore, any children who presented themselves to their healthcare provider during the influenza season would have been recommended to receive an influenza vaccine, and once vaccinated these children could no longer be considered for this study.</p><p>Demographic characteristics at baseline were similar between the two vaccine groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0001"><bold>Table&#x000a0;1</bold></xref>). The mean age was 14.2 mo (range 11.8&#x02212;22.4 mo). There were slightly more male than female children in both groups.

AEs of special interest (AESIs) were reported within 28 d after the vaccination by four children in Group JE-CV and seven children in Group SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2. The most commonly experienced AESI was mild or moderate urticaria affecting one child in Group JE-CV and four children in Group SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2; only two of these AESIs (one child in each group) were considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination.

Therefore, JE-CV is at least as immunogenic as SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2 vaccine after a single dose of either vaccine administered to healthy Korean children aged 12 to 24 mo.

No fatal SAEs were reported, no child was withdrawn due to an AE and no unexpected reactions were observed. Only two SAEs (pyrexia in two children in Group SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2 that occurred within 2 d after vaccination) were assessed as related to vaccination; the origin of the fever was not determined. One child (in Group SA14&#x02013;14&#x02013;2) experienced a febrile convulsion 26 d after vaccination; this SAE was not related to vaccination as reported by the investigator and the child recovered fully.

After incubation, cells were fixed and stained using crystal violet-formaldehyde solution. The presence of JE-CV virus infected cells is indicated by the formation of viral plaques, visualized as clear spots on a violet background and counted. The neutralization titer (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) of the test serum sample is defined as the reciprocal of the highest test serum dilution for which the virus infectivity is reduced by 50% when compared with the average plaque count of the challenge virus control.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The theoretical lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay is a PRNT<sub>50</sub> titer of 10 (reciprocal dilution). This assay was validated demonstrating inter-assay precision at &#x02264; 30% coefficient of variation (CV), and intra-assay precision at &#x02264; 20% CV for medium and high titer samples and &#x02264; 30% CV for low titer samples.
