Among these, meperidine is the weakest agonist and less potent opioid.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Paracetamol is a well-known analgesic drug used for pain control in mothers.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It affects both central and peripheral pathways through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and the cyclooxygenase 2 pathway inhibition[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Meperidine is the first synthetic opioid presented in 1932.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Some studies indicated that in patients with obstetric analgesia, meperidine is a more effective agent than tramadol without significant side effects.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Pain control is the most important key to improving mothers&#x02019; satisfaction and baby care after cesarean section; therefore, different investigators have used several agents to decrease pain, however, many patients, continue to experience inadequate pain relief. On the other hand, although meperidine and paracetamol are commonly using in postoperative pain control, but studies comparing these two agents are rare, therefore, to address these concerns, we conducted this study to evaluate the effect of paracetamol versus meperidine on postoperative pain of elective cesarean section in patients under general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>In this randomized double-blinded prospective study, seventy primigravid women candidate for elective cesarean section referring to Shariati Hospital in Bandar Abbas were recruited during 2013&#x02013;2014. The criteria for enrollment were primigravida, American Society of Anaesthesiologists I, II and lack of preeclampsia, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, and other serious diseases. Exclusion criteria were sensitivity to drugs using in this trial, complicated pregnancy, death, and absence of written consent. The study procedure was explained to all patients, and a written informed consent was obtained. The study protocol was approved by the Ethic Committee of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences. The standard operating room monitoring, including noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry were performed for all patients. Before induction of anesthesia ringer lactate, 500 ml was infused to all patients, and the general anesthesia was induced by sodium thiopental 4 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg intravenously (IV). Then the patients were intubated, and the cesarean section was initiated after anesthesiologist permission. The patients were randomized into two groups based on random allocation, after delivery, and umbilical cord clamping, the patients in the 1<sup>st</sup> group received 1 g paracetamol (Apotel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Exir Pharmaceutical Co., Fac: Boroujerd City, Tehran, Iran) in 100 ml normal saline solution (paracetamol group, <italic>n</italic> = 35), and the patients in the 2<sup>nd</sup> group received 25 mg meperidine (Pethidine 50<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Caspian Tamin Pharmaceutical Co., Rasht, Iran) in 100 ml normal saline solution (meperidine group, <italic>n</italic> = 35). The solutions of administration were infused in 20 min in both groups, and both groups were monitored for 24 h after operation (0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24 h). Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating center staff) were blinded to treatment allocation. During the 24 h of operation, the level of pain based on visual analog scale (VAS), blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, heart rate (HR), and analgesic consumption were checked immediately after section and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after the operation in the ward. If the score of pain was more than 3 then meperidine 25 mg IV was administered until the VAS decreased to under 3. If the vomiting was severe ondansetron 4 mg was injected. The first request for the analgesic agent was recorded; the patients with severe bleeding and hysterectomy were excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical data were presented as (<italic>n</italic>%), and continuous data as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.

The value of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>The comparison of patients regarding characteristics at baselines such as age, gestational age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), HR and duration of surgery did not show a significant difference [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Severe postoperative pain increases the postoperative incidence of nausea and vomiting moreover increases the hospital stay, atelectasis, hypoxemia, pulmonary secretions, etc.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] To decrease the severity of postcesarean pain and improving patients satisfaction several agents such as acetaminophen, opioids, and NSAIDs are frequently used and some advantages and disadvantages related to these drugs are reported.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Analgesics that are used perioperatively for cesarean section, in addition to being effective, must not either depress the neonate's respiratory function or decrease the Apgar score. In this study, we compared meperidine with paracetamol in seventy women who underwent cesarean section operation with general anesthesia and showed that the pain VAS score after 6 h in meperidine group was significantly lower than paracetamol group; moreover, the analgesic consumption in meperidine group during 24 h after surgery was significantly lower than paracetamol group. Moreover, the VAS score of vomiting during 24 h of surgery ward stay in the meperidine group was more than paracetamol group. In contrast to our findings in a study by Ayatollahi <italic>et al</italic>. in 2014 indicated that IV paracetamol is an effective agent to provide better postoperative pain management without considerable neonatal complications in women undergoing cesarean section and general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In addition, another study by Varrassi <italic>et al</italic>. detected that proparacetamol is effective in the management of postoperative gynecologic surgery pain when combined with an opioid agent.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In line with these results Moon <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that preoperative paracetamol in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy decreased the consumption of opioid and related side effects.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In contrast to our trial, some other studies revealed the effect of paracetamol in postoperative pain control is comparable with opioids, as in a study by Hassan in 2014 indicated that the administration of paracetamol and meperidine in patients undergoing cesarean section with general anesthesia is an effective agent for hemodynamic stability and reduction of postoperative pain scores.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Moreover, Landwehr <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that paracetamol and metamizole had similar analgesic effects.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Another study by Van Aken <italic>et al</italic>. did not show a significant difference between morphine and paracetamol in post dental surgery pain.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, in another study by Gin <italic>et al</italic>. indicated no significant difference between intramuscular ketorolac and meperidine in post cesarean section pain control.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The severity of vomiting in our trial in paracetamol group was lower than meperidine group. In agreement with our findings related to drug side effects a study by Shen <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that paracetamol is an effective and safe agent without clinically significant drug interactions and without the adverse effects related to other analgesics.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Our study was one of few studies comparing the effects of paracetamol and meperidine on pain after elective cesarean section. Probably the different sites of action of paracetamol and meperidine in the nervous system are the cause of different results we reported here.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this study such as small sample size and short duration of study that warrant mention. These limitations restrict the ability to generalize the result of our survey. Further investigations are recommended with longer follow-up and larger series to validate the findings reported here.
