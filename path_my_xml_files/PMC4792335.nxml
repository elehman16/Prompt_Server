After the incident of the TGN1412 study, there has been an increasing concern regarding the validity of informed consent in healthy volunteers in phase I studies. All healthy volunteers who received an intervention in the TGN1412 study ended up in the intensive care unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Investigations of how much the volunteers understood the risks involved in the study show that the informed consent form (ICF) was extensively long (13 pages), lacked many essential elements, and made liberal use of complex language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The volunteers did not have a real understanding of the risks that would be involved in the study or recognize the risks when participating in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This study highlights concerns about the safety of healthy volunteers in clinical trials. Comprehension of research subjects, particularly concerning their rights and the risks involved in clinical research, has become a matter of paramount importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Literature reviews demonstrate limited understanding of fundamental trial aspects among healthy research volunteers, even experienced ones who were enrolled in the long-duration clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some of them could not even name the drug they were taking or recall any side effects of that drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These cases call into question the quality and validity of informed consent currently being practiced in clinical research.</p><p>An ICF is a required document in clinical studies, which provides information of a particular study to potential research subjects and documents an individual subject&#x02019;s voluntary consent to participate in research. To date, the quality of ICFs used in clinical studies is still problematic due mainly to extensive length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], chaotic structure, and overly technical language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These potentially reduce the subject&#x02019;s ability to thoroughly read and understand the information provided therein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], thus compromising the ethical principle of respect for persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Additionally, information essential for a subject&#x02019;s decision-making is sometimes missing in many ICFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Improvement of the quality of ICFs in clinical trials is thus necessary for ethical research conduct. For decades, ICFs have been extensively refined and two systematic reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of an enhanced or simplified ICF in improving subjects&#x02019; understanding in clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the Strategic Initiative for Developing Capacity in Ethical Review (SIDCER), an organization launched by the Special Programme for Tropical Disease Research, World Health Organization in 2001, has proposed the SIDCER ICF principles and template for ICF development. The concept and structure of the SIDCER ICF have been refined and finalized in collaboration with researchers and Ethics Committee members mainly from the Forum of Ethical Review Committees in the Asian and Western Pacific region (FERCAP). In short, the SIDCER ICF consists of three principles: (1) completeness of the mandatory ICF content required by international ethics guidelines and regulations, (2) concise information provision which is relevant to a subject&#x02019;s decision-making and local context, and (3) use of simplified means to effectively convey relevant information to the target population. The SIDCER ICF template for clinical trials has been designed to guide the development of an ICF based on the SIDCER ICF principles (presented in the 14th FERCAP Conference, Tagaytay, Philippines, 2014). Validation of the SIDCER ICF&#x02019;s applicability and effectiveness in a variety of clinical studies with different designs is needed. Although the concept is universal, the application and validation must be done in a local language as it plays a major role in the comprehension of research subjects in a reference setting and context.</p><p>The present study is an empirical study to test the SIDCER ICF&#x02019;s applicability and effectiveness in Thai and to evaluate the understanding of Thai volunteers. The SIDCER ICF methodology was applied to a clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction (DDI) study involving healthy subjects, and the local volunteers&#x02019; understanding between the enhanced (SIDCER) ICF and the conventional ICF was compared using a randomized-controlled design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was an open-label, randomized-controlled study of the two different ICF interventions (1:1), i.e., the enhanced ICF and the conventional ICF, using a post-test questionnaire as an assessment tool. The clinical study protocol of the PK DDI study entitled &#x0201c;Effect of curcuminoids on the blood level of digoxin in healthy male volunteers&#x0201d; (Trial Registration Number: ChiCTR-TTRCC-14004645) was used to be the core information for ICF development.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The enhanced informed consent form</title><p>Following the SIDCER ICF principles and template, the enhanced ICF was developed (in Thai) based on the abovementioned clinical study protocol. In close observation of the first SIDCER ICF principle, the study protocol was reviewed and the essential information in regard to compliance with internationally recognized regulatory ICF requirements are selected and present in the enhanced ICF. To limit the contents and length of the enhanced form in accordance with the second SIDCER ICF principle, the information in the study protocol was carefully analyzed and summarized, and only relevant information to a subject&#x02019;s decision-making on research matters was used for ICF development. The refined information was then transformed into a narrative and illustrative format and appropriately inserted into the SIDCER ICF template (where the third SIDCER ICF principle is applied) using local lay language with reference to local context.</p><p>A four-page enhanced ICF containing 21 required elements was successfully developed (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It was then reviewed by the principal investigator of the PK DDI study (NH) to ensure the accuracy of information and by two independent local laypersons to ensure the use of the simplest terms with reference to local context.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The enhanced ICF and the conventional ICF</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Enhanced ICF</th><th>Conventional ICF</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of pages</td><td>4</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Number of required elements provided</td><td>21</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">General items</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Recognition that this is research</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Subject&#x02019;s responsibility</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Confidentiality of records</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Who can access the data</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>Not stated</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Research contact person(s)</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Rights of the subject</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Right to refuse</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Right to withdraw</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Consequences of withdrawal</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>Not stated</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Right to receive new relevant information</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>Not stated</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Scientific aspects</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Subject eligibility</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Number of subjects required</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Purpose of the study</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Trial treatment</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Trial procedures</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Duration of the subject&#x02019;s participation</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>Not stated</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Ethical aspects</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Foreseeable risks</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Expected direct and/or indirect benefits</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>Not clear<sup>a</sup>

Higher proportions of the participants who read the enhanced ICF obtained the satisfactory level of understanding at 80&#x000a0;% and perfect score in the post-test questionnaire than those who read the conventional ICF (82.2&#x000a0;% vs. 60.4&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, and 30.2&#x000a0;% vs. 9.5&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, respectively).

The results indicate that shortening the length of an ICF is possible while retaining all essential elements in a concise manner and that the SIDCER ICF template is applicable to a clinical PK study and its application is effective in this group of population. Since literature reviews demonstrate the mixed results of other ICF studies using other enhanced forms in improving research subjects&#x02019; understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], further studies on the application of the SIDCER ICF and evaluation of subjects&#x02019; understanding in a variety of study designs, settings, languages, and groups of population are required.</p><p>A closer examination of our results reveals the reasons why the participants in the enhanced ICF group did better than those in the conventional group in the post-test questionnaire. The first reason is that the enhanced ICF presents a complete set of the information required according to the first SIDCER ICF principle. Of the 13 questions in which the enhanced ICF group scored higher (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), four items (including who can access the data, duration of the subject&#x02019;s participation, expected direct/indirect benefits, and participant termination criteria) were not described in the conventional ICF (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The second reason is that the enhanced ICF uses an innovative presentation means in accordance with the third SIDCER ICF principle to convey relevant information to the target population. Nine of the 13 items (including research contact person, right to refuse, right to withdraw, subject eligibility, number of subjects required, trial procedures, foreseeable risks, anticipated expenses, and compensation for injury) were sufficiently presented in both ICFs but the enhanced ICF group was able to achieve a higher score. Interestingly, there were two items, including consequences of withdrawal and right to receive new information, which were not stated in the conventional ICF; but the proportions of the participants who correctly answered between the two groups did not show a statistically significant difference. This could be due to a practicable drawback of the evaluation tool: a close-ended question with multiple answer choices gave an individual a chance to inadvertently give the correct answer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Although most of our data favored the enhanced ICF, there were two data subgroups that did not fully support our conclusion: the participants in the baby boomers generation and the participants in the educational level 3. Literature points out that each generation has a difference in perspective and perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is possible that the presentation manners, such as figures or diagrams, used in the SIDCER ICF template might not be suitable for some generations. The increased proportion of the participants with optimal understanding by the enhanced ICF was observed in generation Y and generation X. Although there was a trend for baby boomers in the enhanced ICF group to do better, it was not statistically significantly enough to conclude that the enhanced ICF was more effective in this generation than the conventional ICF (83.3&#x000a0;% vs. 63.6&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.105). A possible reason for this result is the small number of subjects in the baby boomers generation in comparison to the other generations (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), as we did not control this factor when conducting the study. With regards to the educational level, although the result indicates that the enhanced ICF increased the proportion of the participants with optimal understanding in the participants with educational levels 1 and 2, there was little effect in the participants with educational level 3 whose understanding level was high in both groups. This is consistent with the lines of evidence demonstrating that the educational level is a major determinant to research subjects&#x02019; comprehension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In research practice, research subjects generally come from various backgrounds with different educational levels; thus, the SIDCER ICF could be of value.</p><p>It should be noted that this study was performed in a mock population so that the level of understanding might be either overestimated, due to the inclusion of only respondents who were willing to read a given ICF, or underestimated, owing to their limited concern for the information regarding study participation. Studies involving real research subjects of clinical studies could provide stronger evidence to support the effectiveness of the SIDCER ICF in enhancing subjects&#x02019; understanding of ICFs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Understanding of the participants in this study was improved by the enhanced ICF developed based on the SIDCER ICF principles and template. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the application of the SIDCER ICF principles and its template in improving the quality of ICFs and subjects&#x02019; understanding in clinical research. Further studies to evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of the SIDCER ICF in a variety of clinical studies in different languages and settings are necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ms. Kedsada Ruangsuttinaruparp, Ms. Chotimanee Kaewserm, Ms. Chompunoot Koonrungsesomboon, Dr. Sumitra Pongsiri, Mr. Suraphon Wongsathit, Dr. Noppamas Pipatpiboon, Ms. Rapheephorn Khatsri, Dr. Jirapas Sripetchwandee, Mr. Tayakorn Puengkrim, Ms. Sujitra Techatoei, and Dr. Kanchana Koonrungsesomboon for their assistance on the data collection process.
