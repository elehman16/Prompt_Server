As the United Kingdom (UK) Government include well-being as a marker of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], HRQOL measures can be used to assess the health status of the population. Hence, valid and reliable instruments are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is considered a robust analytic method to explain and establish construct validity among observed and unobserved (latent) variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] within such instruments. Kidscreen-27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] is a HRQOL measure that is applied in behavioural science research with children.</p><p>According to Schreiber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], when observed and latent variables are strongly correlated, the more likely it is that the instrument is reliable. As sample characteristics can be diverse and include various ages, cultures, genders and social groups, Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] suggested that researchers should account for group differences in measurement selection in order to prevent potential confounders that may lead to flawed conclusions. Therefore, it is desirable to conduct CFA in cases where data from specific populations have not undergone instrument reliability and validity testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The Kidscreen HRQOL model was developed as part of the first cross-cultural, European-based attempt to standardise the measurement of children&#x02019;s HRQOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the instrument development phase, the Kidscreen group conducted focus groups with children, a Delphi procedure with experts, and item reduction and CFA techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As traditionally children&#x02019;s HRQOL measures have been developed through expert opinion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], this method ensured that the content and language of the Kidscreen questionnaires was consistent with how children interpret HRQOL as a concept. Subsequently, CFA of a 52-item questionnaire was tested in a study of 22,827 children across 13 European countries and resulted in an initial 10-dimensional factor structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Further analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] resulted in a reduced 27-item measure that is embedded within Kidscreen-52. The Kidscreen instruments are now widely used to monitor the health status of both healthy and unhealthy children aged 8&#x02013;18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>In Kidscreen-27, HRQOL is hypothesised to consist of a 5-dimensional structure: <italic>physical well</italic>-<italic>being, psychological well</italic>-<italic>being, social support and peers, parent relations and autonomy, and school environment</italic> (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Yet, the 5-factor structure of Kidscreen-27 has received mixed support with some studies finding a good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and unacceptable fit with modifications for a 7-factor structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Although one of these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] included children from the Republic of Ireland, the socio-economic status (SES) of these participants was not reported. Moreover, in Northern Ireland, Kidscreen-27 has only been tested online using exploratory factor analysis methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] propose that psychometric models should be tested in multiple populations to determine whether the hypothesised structure is generalisable. Hence, it is necessary to conduct CFA on Kidscreen-27 to determine whether: (a) researchers should opt for the hypothesised 5-factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or modified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] 7-factor structure; and (b) whether Kidscreen-27 is a psychometrically consistent measure of HRQOL for children of low SES across both Irish jurisdictions (Northern and Republic).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Scale description detailing the conceptual themes for Kidscreen-27 5- and 7-factor models</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">Kidscreen-27 5-factor dimension</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Physical health (5 items)</td><td align="left">This dimension explores the children&#x02019;s perceptions of their physical activity, health and vitality.

</p><p>The objective of this study is to present the psychometric properties of Kidscreen-27 with Irish children of low SES. The purpose of testing the instrument is to determine whether the measure is conceptually valid and internally consistent for assessing HRQOL with children. This evidence presented below recommends how future research can monitor the health status of the population using Kidscreen-27.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The data for this study were collected as part of a clustered randomised control intervention study, Sport for LIFE: All Island (SFL:AI). A sample of 705 children (364 boys) aged 8&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years (<italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8.74, SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.50) took part during September 2014 and January 2015, corresponding to the delivery of the intervention across Ireland. Due to missing data analysis (outlined below), 94&#x000a0;% (663 children, 347 male, 315 female) of the total SFL:AI sample was included in the final analyses. Geographically, the sample consisted of 186 children from Northern Ireland and 477 from the Republic of Ireland.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment and procedure</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from Ulster University&#x02019;s Research Ethics Committee. In both jurisdictions (Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland), participants were recruited from urban schools in areas of social and economic disadvantage based on deprivation indexes. The Multiple Deprivation Measure in Northern Ireland consists of seven domains of deprivation: income, employment, health, education, proximity to services, living environment and crime. This database gives a living area, as indicated by postcode, a Super Output Area (SOA) rank, with one being the lowest. Schools situated in the most deprived areas were identified. In the Republic of Ireland, only schools identified by Department of Education&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) programme were included. The DEIS database includes socio-economic variables such as local authority accommodation, lone parenthood, travellers, large families (five or more children) and pupils eligible for free books. Studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] show that pupils attending schools listed on the NISRA and DEIS databases are likely to be from lower social class backgrounds and have parents with fewer educational qualifications. A sample of the schools (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;27) was chosen via a manual random number generator and invited to participate in SFL:AI.</p><p>School principals were contacted, and all agreed to participate and distributed information sheets about the study to the classroom teachers and to children&#x02019;s parents. Only participants who provided written assent and consent from their parents participated in the study. To ensure anonymity, participants were given a unique code for the questionnaire. The questionnaires were administered to the participants under quiet classroom conditions. Instructions and information regarding the completion of the questionnaire were explained by a lead researcher, and minor details such as word pronunciation were described to the children in groups of 5&#x02013;10 with a trained researcher accompanying each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Health-related quality of life</title><p>HRQOL was measured using the 27-item questionnaire, Kidscreen-27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Kidscreen-27 has five dimensions (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for description and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> for wording of individual items). The measure was developed through exploratory factor analysis, regression and item reduction techniques, and confirmatory factor analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;never, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;seldom, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;quite often, 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very often and 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;always&#x02014;reflecting the frequency of behaviours or feelings; or 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;not at all, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;slightly, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderately, 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very, 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;extremely&#x02014;reflecting the intensity of a belief or attitude in the previous week.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data management</title><p>Raw scores from the questionnaire were entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Three items (no. 9, 10 and 11) required reverse scoring for negatively worded responses. To screen for missing data, Little&#x02019;s Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] test was run on each subscale. According to Little&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] MCAR test, if the Chi-square statistic is not statistically significant, the data are missing in random order. The data were missing at random for each scale (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.05). As such, 6&#x000a0;% of the sample had complete missing data on a given scale. Chi-square tests confirmed that there were no significant demographic differences between those participants with missing data and those with non-missing data. To this end, the first author analysed the patterns of missing data and conducted a listwise deletion of these participations (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;42).</p><p>The expectation&#x02013;maximisation (EM) algorithm was used for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the remaining missing data. The EM method estimates a score for missing data based on three steps: first, the means, variances and covariances for complete data sets are estimated; second, regression formulas are created based on these estimations; and third, these formulas are used to estimate missing scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. EM was conducted on each individual scale to use data, in a theoretical sense, from inter-correlated items as predictors of the missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. On average, 3.5&#x000a0;% of the data were estimated for each scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were calculated. The items from each scale were added together to represent a total mean score and standard deviation for each factor. Further, in accordance with the Kidscreen scoring methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], we also transformed the 5-factor scale scores into standardised <italic>T</italic> values and standard deviations so that other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] can directly compare their results with the present study. Ceiling and floor effects were also calculated and determined present if more than 15&#x000a0;% of the sample scored the highest or lowest score, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was calculated as a measure of internal consistency. However, as there are fewer than 5 items on each scale, we approached this value with caution and considered an alpha coefficient value of .60 or above as acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>For the demographic variable gender (females or males), we conducted a series of one-way between-group analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to test for significant differences between the groups on each of the original and modified factors. Alpha significance was set to <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.05, and partial eta squared (<italic>&#x003b7;</italic>
<sub arrange="stack"><italic>p</italic></sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup>) was calculated as a measure of effect size.</p><p>Mardia&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] coefficient of multivariate kurtosis and its critical ratio of 1.96 were performed to test the data for multivariate normality. The principle of multivariate kurtosis is to either: (a) ensure normality before conducting conventional statistical hypothesis testing or (b) reject normality and conduct tests with bootstrapping procedures for non-normal data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As the data departed from normality in all of the models, the alpha significance value was corrected for bias at the 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, and Bollen&#x02013;Stine bootstrapping was conducted with 1000 samples in order to have improved accuracy when assessing parameter estimates and fit indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The factor structure of Kidscreen-27 was tested through CFA. Models were specified using AMOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] using the maximum likelihood estimation. A CFA was conducted on the original hypothesised 5-factor model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and modified 7-factor model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] of the Kidscreen-27 measure, based upon mixed success for the original 5-factor model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Specifically, this involved splitting the psychological well-being and autonomy, and parent relations factors into two further factors (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for dimensionality map and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for information on the adjusted scale description). The psychological well-being factor was split as focus group research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] shows that children&#x02019;s psychological well-being encompasses both positive and negative dimensions. Four items (6, 7, 8 and 12) represent positive perceptions and emotions, while three items (9, 10 and 11) represent depressive moods and emotions. The autonomy and parent relations factor was split as previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found that the two items specifically related to financial resources were tapping into an independent financial resources factor, as specified in the 52-item model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, this produced an autonomy and parent relations factor [5 items] and financial resources factor [2 items]. Consistent with the structure of the Kidscreen instruments, all the factors were allowed to correlate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and a correlation matrix was calculated for the 5- and 7-factor models, considering positive values of .0 to .3 as weak, .31 to .70 as moderate and .71 or above as strong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Dimensionality map for 5- and 7-factor Kidscreen-27 models. <italic>Note asterisk</italic> (*) item numbers in brackets</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11136_2016_1432_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>The adequacy of the models was assessed using multiple goodness-of-fit indices. The Chi-square (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) goodness-of-fit index was reported with a small non-significant <italic>&#x003c7;</italic>
<sup>2</sup> statistic indicating good model fit. We approached this value with caution given that large sample sizes tend to result in statistically significant Chi-square values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and the goodness-of-fit index (GFI) were reported with values of &#x0003e;.90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or &#x0003e;.95 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], considered as acceptable or good model fit, respectively. The root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) was reported as a badness of fit index, with values of close to .06 or below considered acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As the models are nested, a Chi-square test of independence was conducted to compare the fit of the 5- and 7-factor models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><p>Descriptive statistics are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p>Kidscreen-27 is a child-centred, cross-cultural instrument that can monitor the HRQOL of children and provide clarity on which aspects of children&#x02019;s environments may be salient for promoting health and well-being. The purpose of this study was to determine the factor structure and internal consistency of Kidscreen-27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] with children of low SES across the island of Ireland. By including children of low SES from both Irish jurisdictions (Northern and Republic), this study extends previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] testing the factor structure of Kidscreen-27. CFA conducted on the two specified Kidscreen-27 models found that the modified 7-factor model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] was a better explanation of the data than the original 5-factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] model. This was confirmed with a nested Chi-square difference test. Overall, these findings provide methodological recommendations for future HRQOL research with children.</p><p>The fit indices for the 5-factor model revealed unacceptable <italic>&#x003c7;</italic>
<sup>2</sup>, CFI and TLI values. This finding contradicts a CFA conducted on Kidscreen-27 in 13 European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and with Chilean adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] that found an acceptable model fit. However, the sample characteristics were different. For example, Robital et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] study used an aggregated score from both children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; (aged 8&#x02013;18) data, while the present study consisted exclusively of preadolescent children (aged 8&#x02013;9). Confirmatory evidence for the modified 7-factor Kidscreen-27 model in this study supports recent research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and may offer methodological reasons for the unsuitability of the 5-factor model for younger children.</p><p>Specifically, this model split the psychological well-being subscale into two independent scales. Previous focus group research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] has found that children&#x02019;s psychological well-being has positive and negative dimensions. Although these dimensions are moderately correlated (as evidenced in the correlation matrix, see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), meaning that children with positive emotions are less likely to experience negative emotions, findings from the CFA in this study suggest that two independent factors are required for conceptualising the psychological well-being construct in children. However, it is worth noting that the Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha value was below the recommended limit for the modified moods and emotions scale that is constructed with negatively worded items. Previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] has argued against the use of negatively worded items as they are likely to reduce scale reliability and consistency. Indeed, research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] with pre-adolescent children (aged 6&#x02013;12) has found that negatively worded items can be problematic as younger children are just beginning to develop their reading skills and thus may find it difficult to interpret negatively worded items. Considering the mean age of this sample was 8.5&#x000a0;years, this may explain why the negatively worded items were found to have low internal consistency.</p><p>Akin with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the autonomy and parent relations factor loaded onto two independent factors, with one relating to the children&#x02019;s sense of autonomy and relationships with parents, and one relating to satisfaction with financial resources. However, the largest CFA of Kidscreen-27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] did not report this issue, despite the inter-factor correlations for the financial resources items being the lowest across the whole model. Statistical testing found that gender had no significant relationship with the modified financial resources factor. However, gender had a significant relationship with the original and modified parental relations and autonomy factor, with females scoring higher than males. Notably though, a stronger effect size and significance value was found between gender and the modified parental relations and autonomy factor, in comparison with the original. Moreover, the correlation matrix found just a moderate (.51) relationship between children&#x02019;s parental relations and autonomy with their satisfaction with financial resources. Therefore, as children&#x02019;s autonomy is only starting to form during pre-adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], their satisfaction with financial resources is linked with their parental relations, but our study suggests that they are independent of each other.</p><p>Ceiling effects were present in all but one of the subscales (autonomy and parent relations in 5-factor Kidscreen-27). Ceiling effects have been previously reported in the social support and peers and school environment scales with 10-year-old children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but not with 12-year-old children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As the present study was the first to psychometrically test for floor and ceiling effects in Kidscreen-27 with younger children (aged 8&#x02013;9), it is unclear whether younger children score higher on these indices of HRQOL. Future use of Kidscreen-27 with younger children should test for floor and ceiling effects and, if necessary, apply bootstrapping and nonparametric models that have been shown to correct for bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The strength of this study was a rigorous psychometric testing of Kidscreen-27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] with a large sample of Irish children from areas of low SES. Overall, the 7-factor model of Kidscreen-27 is suitable for assessing the HRQOL of pre-adolescent children (aged 8&#x02013;10) of low SES. Future research should consider the linkages, but independence, between positive and negative psychological well-being dimensions; and between children&#x02019;s parental relations and autonomy, and their satisfaction with financial resources. However, as the Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha value was low for the moods and emotions factor, future research may consider constructing positively worded items to determine whether the internal consistency can be improved. Limitations of this study are that the test/retest reliability and convergent/divergent validity of Kidscreen-27 remain unassessed in this population. Longitudinal study designs examining HRQOL with multiple instruments may provide a more comprehensive psychometric assessment of Kidscreen-27 than the cross-sectional design conducted in the current study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the Coca Cola Foundation (Grant Award Number&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;874661) as part of the Sport for Life: All Island project.
