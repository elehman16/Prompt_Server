Subjects with ulcers characteristic of cutaneous leishmaniasis will be medically evaluated and laboratory tests and parasitological confirmation performed. After checking the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. During 20 days Group 1 will receive simultaneously meglumine antimoniate and placebo of nitric oxide patches while Group 2 will receive placebo of meglumine antimoniate and active nitric oxide patches. During the treatment visits, the medications will be daily administered and the presence of adverse events assessed. During the follow-up, the research group will visit the patients at days 21, 45, 90 and 180. The healing process of the ulcer, the health of the participants, recidivisms and/or reinfection will also be assessed. The evolution of the ulcers will be photographically registered. In case that the effectiveness of the patches is demonstrated, a novel and safe therapeutic alternative for one of the most important public health problems in many countries will be available to patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a worldwide disease that is endemic in 88 countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is estimated that 1.5 million people suffer from CL annually and that more than 350 million are at risk of contracting the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In America, 60,000 new cases of CL are reported annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], being endemic in 20 of its 22 countries and in 2 islands of the Caribbean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Currently, CL has affected more than 500 U.S. Army soldiers serving in Iraq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the Andean region, the incidence of Leishmaniasis has been increasing dramatically over the last two decades; reaching more than 14,000 cases per year from 1996&#x02013;98 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In Colombia 6,500 cases have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The increase in the reported cases of CL in Colombia has been related to factors such as migration, deforestation, the multiplication of illicit plantations, the armed political conflict and the behavioral changes of the vector. The main strains of <italic>Leishmania </italic>in Colombia are <italic>L. panamensis</italic>, <italic>L. brazilensis</italic>, <italic>L. infantum </italic>and <italic>L. guyanensis</italic>, which are distributed throughout the entire national territory, predominantly in the rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. CL is caused by intracellular protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Leishmania </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and is transmitted to humans through the bite of a small percentage of the species of phlebotomus and lutzomyia sandflies classified to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the digestive system of the sandflies, this dimorphic parasite presents an extracellular flagellated form called a promastigote, which upon its release in the host blood, is phagocyted by the macrophage, losing its flagella and turning into an amastigote [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Dogs, rodents and didelphidae are the natural hosts of the parasite while man is an incidental host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This zoonosis has suffered an interesting urbanization phenomenon, changing from an eminent rural entity affecting mainly men of an active age, to a disease that is affecting all people, especially children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The characteristic lesions of this disease are ulcers that heal spontaneously over a period of three months to a year, depending on the isolate, and that leave a flat, atrophic and depigmented scar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The CL, especially the one produced by <italic>L. brazilensis </italic>can evolve into mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis (MCL), which has a worse prognosis owing to the deforming character of its lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The spontaneous cure of these lesions allows for the acquisition of partial resistance to reinfection, which could explain the higher pathogenicity observed in the children and young adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Previous studies have shown a higher incidence of CL and a poor response to treatment in the children population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The program of epidemiological vigilance in Colombia requires that the probable cases of CL (identified by ulcer features and by the patient's origin) be confirmed by microscopic direct examination of a secession sample obtained from the ulcer, if these are negative, by biopsy of the wound. Once confirmed, the cases must be notified to the Local Health Secretary using clinical-epidemiological records. This institution, in charge of the epidemiological vigilance, studies the sources of transmission and distributes the medication to the people affected. Currently, various aspects are considered when treating CL, among which, the risk of developing MCL, the grade, localization, number, size, evolution and persistence of the lesions, are the most important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For more than 60 years, the pentavalent antimony compounds: sodium stibogluconate, (Pentostan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, produced by Glaxo-Wellcome) and meglumine antimoniate, (Glucantime<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, produced by Sanofi-Aventis) have been considered the treatments of choice for this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Studies made in Colombia reported a percentage of cure of 85%, using meglumine antimoniate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Despite the efficacy of these drugs is high, they present many disadvantages such as parenteral administration, and, reversible secondary effects such as nausea, vomiting, muscular and abdominal pain, cardiac problems, a rise in the concentration of hepatic aminotransferases, and chemical pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Additionally, the adherence to the treatment is affected by its duration (several weeks) and its availability by the restriction in its distribution. Therapeutic alternatives of second line have been proposed; amphotericin B and pentamidine have been used with excellent results, nevertheless their high cost, little availability, the necessity to hospitalize the patients for their administration and the severity of their secondary effects have limited their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the last decade new treatments for CL have been developed, using oral agents such as mefloquine, itraconazole, miltefosine, paromomycin, ketoconazole, allopurinol and dapsone, however, they have not shown enough evidence of their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In an effort to develop a topical treatment for CL, paromomycin has been used in different preparations. However, healing rates achieved with this medication have not been higher than conventional treatments, even when compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In several studies, <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, it has been demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) is effective to eliminate various strains of <italic>Leishmania </italic>in its amastigote form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The production of NO from the oxidation of L-arginine caused by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) constitutes one of the most important defense mechanisms of the macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], in which two oxidative forms of defense against <italic>Leishmania </italic>have been identified. During the first phase of infection, in response to the phagocytosis process, some promastigotes are eliminated due to the release of the superoxide ion, a process which is catalyzed by the NADPH oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Those promastigotes that survive this defense mechanism evolve into amastigotes, activating the production of IL-12 in the macrophages and promoting the presentation of the antigens of <italic>Leishmania </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] to the T helpers 1 lymphocytes that enhance the cytotoxic activities of the macrophages toward the intracellular parasites via the interferon gamma (INF&#x003b3;) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) by promoting the production of NO catalyzed by iNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A recent study shows a higher activity of iNOS in the macrophages of subjects infected with CL, suggesting a vital role of NO in the immunological activity against <italic>Leishmania </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In Studies with rodents resistant to <italic>Leishmania </italic>infection (C57BL/6), where <italic>L. major, L. chagasi </italic>or <italic>L. donovani </italic>were inoculated, the application of iNOS inhibitors like N<sup>G</sup>-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) caused a higher rate of survival and virulence of the parasites in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. After inoculating <italic>L. major </italic>in mice with the genetic susceptibility to develop infections with <italic>Leishmania </italic>(BALB/C), no activity of iNOS was observed. However, the application of IL-12, was able to control the infection by activating iNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In humans, several clinical trials have been realized with topical treatments containing NO donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In Ecuador, our group developed and tested a NO generating topical cream with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), evidencing a beneficial effect in the management of this type of ulcers with no reports of any serious adverse event.</p><p>Nevertheless, due to the unstable nitric oxide release, the cream had to be applied frequently (4 times a day) making the adherence to the treatment difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In Syria, another group used potassium nitrate acidified with salicylic acid and ascorbic acid for the topical treatment of <italic>L. tropica </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, this NO generating mixture destroyed the amastigotes and promastigotes of <italic>Leishmania</italic>; however, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the study of 40 patients presented inconsistent results, reducing the size of the ulcer in 28% of the subjects and healing only 12%. The discrepancy in these results is believed to be due to the technique used to obtain the NO. The acidification of nitrite produces an instant blast of NO, but its release is not maintained over a long period of time[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The difficulty of controlling the liberation of NO has created the necessity of looking for new techniques to regulate its release. The nanofiber polymers produced by the electrospinning technique have been studied in order to guarantee the constant release of pharmaceuticals on the lesion. In the electrospinning process, a high voltage is used to create an electrically charged jet of polymer solution, which dries and solidifies to leave behind a dry polymer fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. As this jet travels through the air, the solvent evaporates leaving behind a charged fiber that can be electrically deflected and collected on a metal screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Fibers with a variety of cross sectional shapes and sizes are produced from different polymers. With this technique, the encapsulation or entrapment of several pharmaceuticals, enzymes and proteins has been successful. In a previous study, nanofiber patches were successfully used as releasing vehicles of tetracycline hydrochloride. The release of tetracycline was constant for a period of 5 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Using the same model, a multilayer transdermal patch has been produced, in which nitrite is bound to an ion exchange resin (DOWEX) and electrospun into a polyurethane nanofibers layer. A solution containing Waterlock<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>superabsorbent and polyurethane is electrospun on top of the nitrite-DOWEX layer. The ascorbic acid entrapped in the polyurethane solution is electrospun onto a third layer, with another layer of Waterlock<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>superabsorbent and polyurethane as the fourth and final one. Upon hydration, this Nitric Oxide Releasing Patch (NOP) produces a stable release of 3.5 &#x003bc;mol of NO during 12 hrs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In a pilot study, developed in Landazuri, Santander, Colombia, a placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 35 patients who presented 68 ulcers produced by <italic>L. panamensis</italic>. Using the NOP, a 65% improvement was observed in the treated ulcers, with only a 25% improvement in the placebo group (p = 0.001). In this pilot study the unique adverse event described was pruritus in the area where the patch was applied (unpublished data). Taking into account the wide distribution of CL, the changes in its form of transmission and the difficulty related with the availability of medication, this study proposes to investigate whether the NO donor transdermal patch, produced by electrospinning is, at least, as effective as the meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of CL, with less adverse events and a lower cost, constituting therefore an effective therapeutic alternative. In case that the effectiveness of the NOP is demonstrated in this study, a novel and safe therapeutic alternative of easy access and higher adherence for one of the most important public health problems in our country will be made available.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><sec><title>General objective</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of NOP in the treatment of CL compared with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Specific objectives</title><p>1.

Subsequently, the subjects that present active ulcers with more than 2 weeks of evolution, with or without parasitological confirmation of CL, will be invited by the health promoters to attend the screening visit (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Schedule of activities</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>PROTOCOL ACTIVITIES</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Screening Visit</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Initial Visit</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Treatment visits</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="4"><bold>Follow-up visits</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>Visit 1</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Visit 2</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Visit 3</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Visit 4</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>SCHEDULE OF VISITS</bold></td><td></td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">1&#x02013;20</td><td align="center">21+3</td><td align="center">45 &#x000b1; 7</td><td align="center">90 &#x000b1; 14</td><td align="center">180 &#x000b1; 14</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Clinical History</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Physical Examination</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Inclusion/Exclusion criteria</td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Informed Consent</td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Direct test</td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Sampling of cultures</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Laboratory tests</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Randomization</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Treatment administration</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Clinical assessment of the lesion</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Measurement of ulcers</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Photographic registration</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Education of patients</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Handing over of diary</td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Evaluation of effectiveness</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Documentation of adverse events</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Recording of concomitant medications</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><title>Screening visit</title><p>During this visit a complete clinical history will be elaborated and data about antecedents of leishmaniasis obtained (administered treatment, localization, number of lesions, etc). A full medical evaluation will be realized based on universally accepted techniques. The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be applied and the selected candidates informed about the study after which they will sign an informed consent. For those subjects with ulcers of more than two weeks of evolution without parasitological diagnosis a direct test will be performed by the parasitologist. If the first direct test is negative, it will be repeated up to three times; after which, in case of negative results, a biopsy will be performed. In case leishmaniasis is not confirmed the patient will be remitted to the original health center.</p></sec><sec><title>Initial visit</title><p>The included patients will be randomly assigned in one of two groups. A culture in Novy-Nicolle-McNeal (NNN) medium will be taken for strain identification and a blood sample withdrawn from the antecubital vein for hepatic enzymes, creatinine, and pancreatic amylase determination. During this visit, a complete medical evaluation will be performed, the ulcer will be measured and a picture will be taken. Before taking the picture, a graduated rule will be placed next to the ulcer along with a sticker marked with the identification code of the participant, and the date of the visit. The first NOP (active or placebo) will be applied covering the lesion and the first shot of meglumine antimoniate (active or placebo) administered. The patients will receive information on how not to damage the patches and how to identify and report adverse events. To help the patients to do so, they will receive a diary to register them. The two groups randomly composed will be divided as follows:</p><p>Group 1: During 20 days this group will receive simultaneously intramuscular (IM) meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>20 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose of 3 ampoules per day); and an NOP placebo.</p><p>Group 2: During 20 days this group will receive simultaneously placebo of IM meglumine antimoniate (5&#x02013;15 cc/day) and an active NOP.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment visits</title><p>The patients will visit the health center daily during 20 days to receive both the NOP (placebo or active) and meglumine antimoniate (placebo or active). Daily, the subjects and their adherence to the treatment will be assessed and the data collected. If any adverse event is detected, the patient will be referred immediately to the medical staff that will make an evaluation and report it to the adverse event committee that will take the final decision in each case.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up visits</title><p>This phase will last 10 months. During the follow-up, the patients will be seen by the research group in 4 opportunities. The first visit will take place the day after the end of the treatment (day 21) in which new blood samples will be taken for biochemical determinations. The second, third and fourth visits will be realized on day 45, 90 and 180 respectively. During these visits the healing process of the ulcer, the presence of recidivisms and/or reinfection and the health of the participants will be assessed. The evolution of the ulcers will be photographically registered.</p><p>The maximum and minimum diameters of the ulcer will be measured using a graduated ruler, and the induration using the ballpoint pen technique. The ulcer and induration areas will be calculated separately, and then registered in the CRF. The evaluation of the clinical response will be based on the ulcer showing the least improvement.</p><p>1. Complete clinical response: Complete reepithelization of the ulcer and disappearance of the induration.</p><p>2. Clinical Improvement: Reduction of more than 50% of the ulcer and the induration areas in relation to the last clinical evaluation.</p><p>3. Absence of clinical response: Increase or reduction of less than 50% of the ulcer and the induration areas in relation to the last clinical evaluation.</p><p>4. Therapeutic failure:</p><p>a. Increase in the size of the ulcer by more than 50% in relation to the last clinical evaluation</p><p>b. Presence of the ulcer three months after the beginning of the treatment.</p><p>c. Reactivation: Appearance of a lesion on the edge or in the center of the scar, with positive parasitological diagnosis, after a period of complete reepithelization.</p><p>d. Affection of the mucous membranes: Presence of affections of the mucous membranes during the treatment, at the end of it or in the follow-up visits.</p><p>5. Reinfection: Activation of an ulcer in an area different from the original lesion.</p><p>For subjects whose treatment will have been considered a failure the code will be broken and they will be remitted to their original health center to look for other therapeutic approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><sec><title>Physical examination</title><p>A complete physical examination will be realized and vital signs will be measured.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Blood samples withdrawn</title><p>Blood samples will be withdrawn from the antecubital vein to perform the following biochemical analyses:</p><p>1. Creatinine by spectrophotometry</p><p>2. Alanine transaminase (ALT) by spectrophotometry</p><p>3. Aspartate transaminase (AST) by spectrophotometry</p><p>4. Pancreatic amylase by spectrophotometry</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling technique for the direct test of CL</title><p>A direct test is performed to confirm the presence of cells with amastigotes in a dermis scrape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]; the sample must be, in so far as it is possible, free of blood, cellular detritus or pus. If the patients present several lesions, the sample must be taken from the one with the shortest time of evolution, the biggest induration area and/or the least purulent discharge. If the lesion has a scab it must be removed to improve the quality of the sample. The sample can be taken from the active edge or from the bottom of the ulcer. When the sample is taken from the active edge asepsis must be realized with alcohol at 70% and hemostasis then performed using the first and second fingers to make sure that there is no blood in the sample. A small incision of about 3 mm in length and depth is made with a scalpel in the active edge parallel to the edge of the ulcer. With the sharp side of the scalpel, a scrape is done in the dermic wall of the incision to obtain tissue. The extracted material is extended on two microscope slides. The sample is dried at room temperature, and then fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa, Wright or Field. Using immersion oil the sample is observed under a microscope with a 100&#x000d7; lens, the presence of amastigotes of <italic>Leishmania </italic>assessed and their structure verified (nucleus, kinetoplast and cell membrane). If the sample is taken from the center of the lesion the same hemostatic technique must be used, the scab removed, and the bottom of the ulcer well cleaned using the sharp side of the scalpel to prevent the presence of cellular detritus and/or purulent material. This procedure must be continued until the granulomas are seen at the bottom. With the same technique used to process the samples from the active edge the presence of amastigotes of <italic>Leishmania </italic>is verified.</p></sec><sec><title>Technique for the sampling of cultures</title><p>The sample for the culture may be obtained by suctioning the ulcer active edge or by extracting a fragment of tissue which is then macerated in a phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) with antibiotics (1000 UI of crystalline penicillin per cc), before it is put in the culture medium. A tuberculin syringe with a thin needle (26G), containing 0.3 cc of PBS solution with antibiotics is used in the suction technique. Previous asepsis of the ulcer with alcohol at 70%, a needle is introduced into the dermis and through rotating movements a small amount of tissue is macerated by the needle bevel during about a minute, after which it is suctioned into the syringe. The sample is deposited in aseptic conditions into a NNN culture medium and incubated at 26&#x000b0;C during 4 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Every week a drop is extracted from the culture medium and placed between two slides to be observed under a microscope. In case that promastigotes are not found, the cultures are rejected as negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The strains are identified by species using the monoclonal antibodies developed by Dr. Diane Mc Mahon Pratt [50, 51]</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation and management of adverse events</title><p>During the treatment and the follow-up visits, the patients will be asked about adverse events.
