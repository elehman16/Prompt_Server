A variety of autoantibodies and immune complexes appear in the serum of SLE patients, along with severe glomerulonephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Effective treatments for SLE are presently lacking. The establishment of an appropriate animal model is an essential research tool to investigate drug treatment efficacy during the pathogenesis of the disease. Tree shrews are climbing animals between insectivores and primates. Evolutionarily closer to primates than rodents, tree shrews are being considered as an alternative to primates for study. Because tree shrews are small in size and cheap in price compared with primates, we chose this model over primates. Tree shrews were found to have genetic characteristics close to those of primates, which laid the foundation for research into clinical disease mechanisms and the development of new drugs.</p><p>The kidney is the most affected organ in mouse and human SLE. Lupus nephritis results in immune complex deposition in different parts of the glomeruli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. When lupus nephritis cannot be well controlled, glomerulonephritis will eventually develop and advance to renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Generally, SLE therapy &#x02013; particularly cyclophosphamide therapy &#x02013; can control most lupus nephritis well, but not all cases can be controlled. Better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is thus very important to improve the therapeutic effect of SLE. SLE has a complex etiology, and the exact mechanism of this autoimmune disease has not been elucidated. However, SLE is generally agreed to be due to a genetic predisposition and appears in response to environmental factors and infections. Specifically, a susceptibility gene regulates the pathogenesis of SLE, and lymphocytes and cytokines participate in abnormal immune responses, which significantly increase autoantibodies and damage to the body.</p><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a class of cells found in the bone marrow, fat, muscle, and other tissues. These cells are multipotent and have the immunomodulatory effects of nonhematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) mainly form the hematopoietic microenvironment and regulate the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, MSCs can differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, cardiac tissue, neuronal tissue, and other mesodermal cells. MSCs have low or no immunogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which decreases the probability of allogeneic transplant rejection and thus constitutes safer treatment. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) have the advantage of easier access than the BM-MSCs used in the past, which has made them a clinical research focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>SLE occurs mainly in young women and is an autoimmune disease that involves multiple organs and is characterized by T-cell and B-cell activation. The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of SLE remains unclear, but studies have confirmed that abnormal T-cell immunity plays an important role. This abnormal immunity strongly relates to the development and prognosis of the disease. T-helper 17 (Th17) cells are novel CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells identified in recent years that may secrete interleukin (IL)-17, which is involved in the innate immune and adaptive immune responses and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, IL-17 is involved in the innate immune response and induces expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-16, among others; amplifies tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) during inflammation; and is involved in adaptive immune responses. Studies have shown that Th17 cells are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), autoimmune enteropathy, psoriasis, and other diseases. The transplantation of UC-MSCs reduces the levels of Th17 cells in SLE patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and a decrease in Th17 lymphocytes is likely one of the effective mechanisms of UC-MSC transplantation in the treatment of SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, the incidence of autoimmune disease has increased and SLE remains a problem. When studying this topic, an animal model of SLE is one of the best research tools, especially for the study of the genetic aspects of susceptibility and pathogenesis. The use of the tree shrew model can control the impact of environmental factors on experimental animals, help to clarify the pathogenesis of the disease, and help to identify the pathogenic gene locus. The tree shrew model developed in this study aims to elucidate the exact mechanism of lupus nephritis and the mechanisms and efficacy of UC-MSCs in the treatment of SLE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tree shrew UC-MSCs isolated, cultured, and identified</title><p>Full-term pregnant tree shrews were anesthetized using intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium (50&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight) before caesarean section. The uterus was first surgically opened to fully expose the placenta and the fetal tree shrews, and approximately 5&#x000a0;cm of umbilical cord was isolated from the fetus and placenta via sterile laparotomy; approximately three or four umbilical cords were isolated based on the number of fetuses. The umbilical cord was cleaned on a sterile bench and soaked with double antibiotics. The umbilical cord was then cut and placed in adherent culture flasks, in which adherent cells were visible after 2&#x02013;3 days. The medium was 20&#x000a0;% fetal bovine serum in DMEM-F12 (Hyclone). The cells were subcultured when confluent. The third passages of tree shrew UC-MSCs were labeled with antibodies for flow cytometry. The antibodies included CD29-FITC, CD44-FITC, CD34-FITC, and FITC isotype controls.

Similar to other autoimmune diseases, the body continues to produce IgG class autoantibodies to self-antigens, forming a large number of circulating immune complexes deposited in the glomeruli capillaries and other tissues to cause glomerulonephritis and whole body multiple systemic disease. The mechanism is similar to type III hypersensitivity. Currently, nonspecific immunosuppression is used in clinical treatment, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is used to treat a small number of refractory cases. However, SLE prognosis remains to be improved to prevent infection, recurrence, kidney failure, and heart and brain damage, and for other reasons. We hope that the establishment of the tree shrew SLE model and infusion of UC-MSCs in this new therapeutic animal study will help to improve treatment efficacy and explore a therapeutic mechanism.</p><p>Under certain conditions, MSCs can differentiate into a variety of tissue cells, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, tendon cells, and adipocytes. However, they can also differentiate across the mesoderm to the endoderm and neural ectoderm (such as the liver, bile duct epithelium, lung, intestine, skin epithelium, and neuronal and glial cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Pan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have reported using BM-MSC transplantation to treat diabetic nephropathy in tree shrews. However, UC-MSCs are readily available and not rejected after replantation; these cells show a strong ability to self-replicate, are easily separated and amplified in vitro, and should be widely used in tissue engineering, cell transplantation, and gene therapy. UC-MSCs are therefore an ideal seed cell. UC-MSCs have immunosuppressive effects. Application of UC-MSC treatment for SLE involves allogeneic cell transplantation. By restoring the balance of autoreactive T cells in SLE patients, UC-MSCs exert immunosuppressive effects by reaching immune homeostasis again and achieve a therapeutic effect.</p><p>The role of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells is not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The possible mechanisms are secretion of TGF-&#x003b2; and/or IL-10 or induction of other cells to secrete other inhibitory cytokines. With high cell surface expression of TGF-&#x003b2;, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells bind the TGF-&#x003b2; receptor and inhibit the autoreactive T cells and B cells. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in the body account for 10&#x000a0;% of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The number and activity of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells meet the need to inhibit autoreactive T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte activation, as well as the proliferation and maintenance of autoimmune balance. In individuals susceptible to SLE, environmental factors, genetic abnormalities, and other factors affect the production of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in the thymus, which can lead to SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Previous studies showed that the level of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly lower in SLE patients than in healthy controls, irrespective of the status (active or inactive) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Because the numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells were reduced, which results in immune suppression, the activation of T-helper cells was enhanced, the expression of B-cell activating factor increased, and B-lymphocyte hyperthyroidism was induced to produce a variety of autoantibodies, which led to a series of immune system interaction disorders that resulted in multiple organ damage. We used quantitative PCR to detect the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene because its change indirectly represents the change in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood. Our results showed in that in the model tree shrew, the expression of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene decreased. The relative expression of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene was less than 0.5 of that in the normal control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). The decrease in <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene expression is enough to have biological impact on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells. This result indirectly shows that in the SLE model CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells are significantly lower than in healthy controls. According to the literature, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells are a subset of regulatory T cells that mainly originate from the thymus. Their main function is related to the inhibition of the immune response of autoreactive T cells, the inhibition of conventional T-cell activation, and the promotion of the secretion of some suppression cytokines. The cells play an important role in the maintenance of a stable internal environment and tumor immune surveillance, and induce transplantation tolerance and autoimmune diseases. SLE patients with increased Th17 cells in the peripheral blood show a decreased population of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells, which increases peripheral <italic>IL-17</italic> gene expression and decreases <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene expression.</p><p>The literature indicates the use of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and pristane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] by intraperitoneal injection to induce SLE in mouse studies, but the tree shrew SLE model has not been studied. We therefore used 80 tree shrews, divided into four groups of 20. Studies have shown that pristane and LPS injection in tree shrews induces SLE-related changes, including an increase in the peripheral <italic>IL-17</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], reduction in the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene, elevated serum IgG and C3, multiorgan lesions, and immune complex deposition in kidney sections. We divided 10 model tree shrews into five model control groups and five treatment groups, and the model success criterion was defined as an ELISA OD value of standard model tree shrews &#x0003e;2.8, more than twice the mean OD value (1.4) of the normal control group. Quantitative PCR showed that the relative expression of the <italic>IL-17</italic> gene was more than twice that of the normal control group, while that of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene was less than 0.5 that of the normal control group. DiR-labeled cells (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells) were transplanted into each tree shrew in the treatment and the normal control groups; 2&#x000a0;weeks later, three groups of tree shrews were used to detect serum antiphospholipid and antinuclear antibodies simultaneously with an inflammatory cytokine antibody microarray. From three groups of tree shrews, morning urine was analyzed for urine protein concentration, and the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys were imaged. The imaging results showed that labeled cells were distributed in the lung, liver, and spleen of tree shrews in the treatment group, and fluorescence intensity values of the normal and model control groups of all organs were lower than in the treatment group. Labeled UC-MSCs from tree shrews mainly were located in the damaged organs. Because organ damage was absent in the normal control group, the detected fluorescence intensity values were lower than those in the treatment group, and most values were lower by an order of magnitude. Labeled cells did not transplant in the model control group; thus, the detected fluorescence intensity values were lower than in the treatment group, and most values were lower by an order of magnitude. Serum antiphospholipid and antinuclear antibodies results showed that in the model group antiphospholipid and antinuclear antibodies increased significantly. In the treatment group, antiphospholipid and antinuclear antibodies decreased significantly. This result indicates that UC-MSC therapy is effective in the SLE model. Urine protein quantitation results also showed that UC-MSC therapy can effectively decrease urine protein concentrations in the SLE model.</p><p>In summary, we reviewed a large body of domestic and foreign literature and established a tree shrew SLE model. The pathological and serological results and genomics showed that the SLE tree shrew model was established successfully. After initial UC-MSC therapy, we found labeled cells in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of tree shrews in the treatment group. The region of interest (ROI) fluorescence values were higher than in the control tree shrews, and most of these ROI values were larger by one order of magnitude. These findings provide a theoretical and experimental basis for using UC-MSCs to treat SLE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ten modeled tree shrews from the pristine and LPS injection groups were grouped into the treatment group and the model control group, with five animals per group. Five normal tree shrews were selected as the normal control group. DiR-labeled UC-MSCs (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells) were transplanted into animals of the treatment and normal control groups. Two weeks after transplantation, the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of the three groups were stained with HE and kidney Masson and PAS stain, and were imaged. The results revealed obvious pathological changes in the model group, while the treatment group returned to normal levels. The imaging results showed that labeled cells were mainly localized in the lungs, liver, and spleen in the treatment group, and the ROI value of organs of the treatment group was significantly higher than in the normal control group and in the model control group. This difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). This finding proved that UC-MSCs have a therapeutic effect in the tree shrew SLE model.
