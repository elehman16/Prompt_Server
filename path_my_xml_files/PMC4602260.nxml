The optimum antibiotic choice remains unknown. We conducted an exploratory trial in stable patients with COPD comparing three antibiotic regimens against placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a single-centre, single-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial. Patients aged &#x02265;45&#x02005;years with COPD, FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x0003c;80% predicted and chronic productive cough were randomised to receive either moxifloxacin 400&#x02005;mg daily for 5&#x02005;days every 4&#x02005;weeks, doxycycline 100&#x02005;mg/day, azithromycin 250&#x02005;mg 3 times a week or one placebo tablet daily for 13&#x02005;weeks. The primary outcome was the change in total cultured bacterial load in sputum from baseline; secondary outcomes included bacterial load by 16S quantitative PCR (qPCR), sputum inflammation and antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>99 patients were randomised; 86 completed follow-up, were able to expectorate sputum and were analysed. After adjustment, there was a non-significant reduction in bacterial load of 0.42 log<sub>10</sub>&#x02005;cfu/mL (95% CI &#x02212;0.08&#x000a0;to 0.91, p=0.10) with moxifloxacin, 0.11 (&#x02212;0.33 to 0.55, p=0.62) with doxycycline and 0.08 (&#x02212;0.38 to 0.54, p=0.73) with azithromycin from placebo, respectively. There were also no significant changes in bacterial load measured by 16S qPCR or in airway inflammation. More treatment-related adverse events occurred with moxifloxacin. Of note, mean inhibitory concentrations of cultured isolates increased by at least three times over placebo in all treatment arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Total airway bacterial load did not decrease significantly after 3&#x02005;months of antibiotic therapy. Large increases in antibiotic resistance were seen in all treatment groups and this has important implications for future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01398072).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COPD Exacerbations</kwd><kwd>COPD Pathology</kwd><kwd>Respiratory Infection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>editors-choice</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><sec><title>What is the key question?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>How do three different antibiotics (moxifloxacin, doxycycline and azithromycin) compare in their effects on total airway bacterial load in stable COPD?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What is the bottom line?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Airway bacterial load was similar to placebo after treatment with all three antibiotics, although increases in antimicrobial resistance were noted in all treatment arms.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Why read on?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first trial to directly compare the effects of different antibiotic classes on airway bacterial load in stable COPD.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>COPD exacerbations are important events associated with poorer health status,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> lung function decline<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and mortality.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Their prevention is an important goal of COPD treatment<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

The best evidence for this comes from the macrolide antibiotics, with both erythromycin<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and azithromycin<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> shown to significantly reduce exacerbation frequency although at the expense of auditory decrements and a possible increase in cardiovascular risk.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> There is less evidence for other antibiotic classes in stable COPD, although the fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin has shown some efficacy when used in a pulsed dosing regimen,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and with no comparative studies there are few data to inform the optimum antibiotic choice. There are also growing concerns regarding the development of antibiotic resistance in airway bacteria.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Although the presumptive mode of action of antibiotics is via reducing airway bacterial load, no trials to date have examined this in stable COPD. Furthermore, molecular techniques are now important tools in accurately quantifying the airway microbiome<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and may be able to detect more subtle changes with therapy than traditional culture-based methods.</p><p>For the first time, we aimed to directly compare the effects of different antibiotics on airway bacterial load in patients with stable COPD, measured both by culture and 16S quantitative PCR (qPCR). We also examined important secondary clinical endpoints, bacterial resistance and changes in airway inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was an exploratory 13-week, single-centre, single-blind, placebo controlled, randomised controlled trial conducted at the Royal Free Hospital (London, UK).

Sputum processing and culture, sensitivity testing and inflammatory marker analysis were conducted in the laboratories of the Centre for Respiratory Medicine and the Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Royal Free Campus, University College London. DNA extraction and 16S qPCR were conducted in the laboratories of the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Stable patients aged &#x02265;45&#x02005;years with chronic bronchitis (self-reported sputum expectoration on most days when clinically stable) and spirometrically confirmed COPD (defined by FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x0003c;80% predicted, FEV<sub>1</sub> to FVC ratio &#x0003c;0.7 and a history of smoking) were included. Patients who reported either treatment for an exacerbation or an episode of symptom worsening in the 4&#x02005;weeks prior to screening, or were unable to enrol for safety reasons, were excluded. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the online supplementary data.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Screening and run-in period</title><p>After clinical assessment, spirometry was performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidance<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> using a Vitalograph Gold Standard spirometer (Vitalograph, Maids Morton, UK). Spontaneously expectorated sputum was collected for analysis prior to randomisation. Patients also completed the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to assess health status. Patients received diary cards and recorded any worsening of their respiratory symptoms each day for a 1-week run-in period; these have previously been shown to be a reliable index of exacerbation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Patients returned to the clinic 1&#x02005;week after screening. The diary cards and screening results were checked and details sought regarding any adverse events. If the subject remained eligible and clinically stable after reassessment, and had been able to provide a sputum sample for analysis by the second visit, then internet randomisation into groups of 1:1:1:1 was performed using a computer-generated permuted block system of variable sizes (Sealed Envelope, UK). Patients remained blinded to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Follow-up of patients</title><p>Patients were telephoned by the study doctor during weeks 5 and 9 of treatment and any adverse events or exacerbations recorded. Patients who suffered a COPD exacerbation during the trial were treated either by their treating physician or using self-administered treatment as appropriate; exacerbation treatment during the study was not standardised. To avoid drug interactions, the study medication was temporarily stopped if the patient took other antibiotics for any reason. Details of exacerbations were recorded on the daily diary cards and the study team notified.</p><p>Patients attended the clinic at the end of 13&#x02005;weeks of treatment. A further spontaneously expectorated sputum sample was collected and the SGRQ administered, diary cards collected and any exacerbations or adverse events recorded. Unused medication was collected and pill counts performed for adherence analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the change in sputum bacterial load, as assessed by quantitative culture. Prespecified secondary outcomes were changes in resistance to the three tested antibiotics, changes in FEV<sub>1</sub>, adherence to therapy, health status as measured by total SGRQ scores and adverse events. Further exploratory outcomes assessed changes in sputum bacterial load as assessed by 16S rRNA gene targeted qPCR and changes in sputum inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Laboratory analysis of sputum</title><p>A minimum of 0.25&#x02005;g spontaneously expectorated sputum was analysed using a modification of the method described by Pye <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Mean inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were established for each isolate against each of the three antibiotics by Etest (bioM&#x000e9;rieux UK, Basingstoke, UK) and isolates were defined as sensitive, intermediate or resistant where breakpoints were available.</p><p>DNA was isolated from sputum and qPCR for 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA gene carried out using a ViiA 7 real-time PCR system (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK).</p><p>Sputum supernatant was batch analysed for the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-1&#x003b2; using commercial high-sensitivity sandwich ELISA kits (RD Systems, Abingdon, UK). The lower limits of detection were 0.70, 3.5 and &#x0003c;1.0&#x02005;pg/mL, respectively.</p><p>Further detail on these methods is included in the online supplementary data.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Pre-existing comparative data showing the effect of antibiotics on sputum bacterial numbers using quantitative culture methods were unavailable. Using PCR analysis, data from within our group showed that, in patients demonstrating bacterial colonisation on &#x02265;2 occasions, mean (SD) sputum bacterial load when stable was 6.89 (1.23) log<sub>10</sub>&#x02005;cfu/mL, falling to 5.01 (3.71) after antibiotic treatment at exacerbation. Assuming a correlation of 0.5 between the baseline and 3-month follow-up measurements, we calculated that 44 patients in each of the four groups would be sufficient to have a 90% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, a difference between untreated (placebo) and post-treatment bacterial load of 1.88 log<sub>10</sub>&#x02005;cfu/mL.</p><p>Analysis was by intention to treat. The primary endpoint of total bacterial numbers in sputum (the sum of the bacterial load for each isolate cultured from a sample) was analysed using multiple regression after log<sub>10</sub> transformation to assess the treatment effect for each antibiotic compared with placebo. Where growth was below the limit of detection (6&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>&#x02005;cfu/mL), patients were treated as having a left-censored outcome and a parametric survival regression model was used. Spirometry, health status (SGRQ) and adherence to therapy were modelled using linear, Poisson or logistic regression as appropriate. Antibiotic resistance was modelled using a linear mixed effects model for log(MIC) to account for multiple detected isolates within each individual; a generalised mixed effects model was used to analyse resistance as a binary outcome. All analyses were adjusted for baseline values, with multivariable analyses further adjusted for age, sex, current smoking status, FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted and previous exacerbation history. Exacerbations during the study period were defined using diary card criteria as previously reported<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> as well as patient reporting to clinical health professionals or the study team, with the final decision made by consensus. A further methodological analysis compared the measurement techniques of quantitative culture and 16S qPCR using the Bland&#x02013;Altman method<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> for all samples where both results were available.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient characteristics at recruitment</title><p>Two hundred and forty-eight patients were screened between February 2012 and May 2013; 99 were randomised, and sputum was analysed for the primary endpoint from 86. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2015207194F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the screening, randomisation and follow-up of patients.

Most notably, there were no significant reductions in sputum bacterial load, by culture or qPCR, with any of these three antibiotics compared with placebo. Although pulsed moxifloxacin demonstrated the largest fall in bacterial numbers on culture, it also had the highest incidence of associated adverse events. There was evidence of an increase in antibiotic resistance of the cultured isolates across all treatment groups.</p><p>The primary endpoint of this study was total bacterial load, as the sum of the load of all isolates from each sample. Most of the bacteria isolated here were species classically considered to be non-pathogenic in airway disease, and this is in keeping with molecular studies of the airway microbiome which demonstrate a diverse flora dominated by firmicutes, including the <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Rothia</italic> spp predominant here.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> While previous exacerbation studies have focused on loads of the three typical respiratory tract bacteria (<italic>S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>),<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>

As in the gut, the lung microbiome is commensal and plays a role in immune function;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> these non-pathogenic microorganisms are therefore also important, and changes in their numbers are likely to influence exacerbation susceptibility. We did not find any support for our hypothesis that antibiotic therapy reduces total bacterial load in stable COPD, as well as potentially improving clinical outcome measures. Airway inflammation also did not change during treatment with any of these antibiotics and this is in keeping with previous reports<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and despite known anti-inflammatory effects of macrolide antibiotics. As discussed below, patients in the doxycycline and moxifloxacin arms suffered more exacerbations during the study period, and given that bacterial load,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> airway inflammation<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and quality of life<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> all worsen significantly at exacerbation this may have attenuated any measured reductions. In addition, reductions in total bacterial load may only persist for a short time after quinolone therapy<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which might reduce the effectiveness of intermittent, &#x02018;pulsed&#x02019; dosing regimens.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Overall, however, antibiotic therapy did not appear to reduce total bacterial load after 3&#x02005;months of therapy when measured either by culture or by 16S qPCR. The reduction in exacerbation frequency observed elsewhere is therefore likely to be mediated by other mechanisms. These may include either altering the background composition of the airway microbiome such that exacerbation susceptibility is reduced, by making the airway a less hospitable environment for the acquisition of new bacterial strains that may potentially cause exacerbation<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> or alternatively by attenuating the rise in bacterial load when an exacerbation occurs rather than reducing it in the stable state. Further research is required to investigate these possibilities.</p><p>For the first time, we have also directly analysed the measurement techniques of 16S qPCR and quantitative culture in the quantification of the airway microbiome. qPCR detected approximately 10 times as many bacteria as culture and, although significantly correlated, the wide variation between the measured values limits their direct comparability. Culture-based techniques are less sensitive than qPCR, and a normally cultivable species may not grow on culture media even when it is proved on sequencing to be the dominant organism in a sample.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These findings therefore support the move away from culture-based to molecular techniques.</p><p>Administration of each antibiotic was associated with an MIC increase of at least three times pretreatment values compared with placebo, with a corresponding increase in clinical resistance in those organisms for which this has been defined; this supports findings from other short-term studies of antibiotic therapy.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> However, in contrast to previous studies of antibiotics in COPD focusing on resistance in specific pathogens,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> we examined all isolates cultured from sputum, and we have examined resistance in greater detail. The information here therefore provides a much better indication of resistance in the wider airway microbiome. Macrolide resistance is rapidly inducible, highly transferrable, and increasing in prevalence commensurate with increasing macrolide prescriptions;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> resistance to quinolones and tetracyclines is also increasing globally.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> There is evidence that commensal airway streptococci act as a reservoir for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> resistance<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and the increased resistance demonstrated here may therefore drive future antibiotic-resistant disease. The approach of only examining resistance in those species classically thought to be pathogenic may be too narrow.</p><p>There was an indication of a higher rate of treatment-related adverse events and treatment discontinuation with moxifloxacin therapy than previously reported,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> although the types of events reported were similar. This may be related to the higher frequency of administration here (4-weekly rather than 8-weekly) than in the previous study. By contrast, azithromycin and doxycycline were well tolerated. However, there is growing evidence of increased cardiovascular risk with macrolides,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> as well as high-frequency hearing loss,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> although the size and duration of this trial were not sufficient to examine these. Until these risks are further evaluated, advice to exercise caution in patients with cardiac risk factors<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> still seems prudent.</p><p>There were no significant changes seen in the other measures of quality of life, lung function or adherence to therapy. There was an apparent increase in exacerbations with doxycycline therapy, although this was influenced by a small number of patients, and the study period was relatively short for exacerbation detection. Although the placebo group had a lower self-reported exacerbation frequency than the active treatment arms, this was adjusted for in the analysis. Furthermore our composite detection of exacerbations (using diary cards and/or treatment) may have contributed to the relatively higher recorded exacerbation frequency during the study. This study was not powered to detect changes in exacerbation frequency and this result should therefore be treated with caution.</p><p>There were a few limitations to this study. First, due to difficulty in double-blinding each of the three treatment regimens in a single trial, only one placebo was used and the trial was single blind. The final sample size was 50% lower than that initially specified (99 compared with 200), and some patients were unable to spontaneously expectorate sputum at their final study visit. This study was intentionally designed as a pilot exploratory study to assess airway bacterial changes with different antibiotics prior to a definitive study. Hence, the precision of the estimates shown here cannot fully discount a reduction in airway bacterial numbers of up to 0.9 log<sub>10</sub>&#x02005;cfu/mL for moxifloxacin and 0.5 log<sub>10</sub>&#x02005;cfu/mL for doxycycline and azithromycin. Nevertheless, we have shown that larger reductions in airway bacterial numbers (&#x0003e;1.0 log<sub>10</sub>, or 10-fold, cfu/mL) are unlikely. While the study was terminated early due to constraints with time lines, further recruitment would therefore have been unlikely to alter these conclusions. Third, as an exploratory study, this trial was not powered to detect changes in clinical endpoints and therefore further trials will be needed regarding the relative effectiveness of these antibiotics in practice.</p><p>In summary, we found no significant changes in total bacterial load with antibiotic therapy in this, the first randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled study to directly compare the use of different antibiotics in stable COPD. We have also demonstrated an increase in the degree and rate of resistance of cultured airway bacteria following administration of these antibiotics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2015-207194-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1456" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Claire Eckold (UCL Centre for Clinical Microbiology) for help with bacterial quantitative culture and resistance testing and interpretation, and Dan Jackson (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge) for advice regarding the statistical analysis of antimicrobial resistance.
