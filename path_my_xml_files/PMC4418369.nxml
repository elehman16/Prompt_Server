corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation. The objective of this randomized,
double-blind trial was to determine the effects of high- <italic>vs</italic>
conventional-dose bolus rocuronium on QTc duration and the incidence of dysrhythmias
following anesthesia induction and intubation. Fifty patients about to undergo
coronary artery surgery were randomly allocated to receive conventional-dose (0.6
mg/kg, group C, n=25) or high-dose (1.2 mg/kg, group H, n=25) rocuronium after
induction with etomidate and fentanyl. QTc, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure
were recorded before induction (T0), after induction (T1), after rocuronium (just
before laryngoscopy; T2), 2 min after intubation (T3), and 5 min after intubation
(T4). The occurrence of dysrhythmias was recorded. In both groups, QTc was
significantly longer at T3 than at baseline [475 <italic>vs</italic> 429 ms in group
C (P=0.001), and 459 <italic>vs</italic> 434 ms in group H (P=0.005)]. The incidence
of dysrhythmias in group C (28%) and in group H (24%) was similar. The QTc after
high-dose rocuronium was not significantly longer than after conventional-dose
rocuronium in patients about to undergo coronary artery surgery who were induced with
etomidate and fentanyl. In both groups, compared with baseline, QTc was most
prolonged at 2 min after intubation, suggesting that QTc prolongation may be due to
the nociceptive stimulus of intubation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>QTc</kwd><kwd>Rocuronium</kwd><kwd>Induction</kwd><kwd>Intubation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="20"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Effects of coronary vascular disease (e.g., ischemia, scar tissue, and reduced ejection
fraction) may lower the cardiac depolarization threshold and cause corrected QT interval
(QTc) prolongation. A delay in cardiac repolarization may create an electrophysiological
environment that favors the development of cardiac arrhythmias, most notably torsade de
pointes (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Therefore, knowledge of the effects
of drugs on the QTc is important, especially for patients with coronary ischemic disease
(<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>An initial large bolus of an intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocker (e.g.,
rocuronium) is often given to obtain neuromuscular blockade (NMB) for rapid sequence
intubation (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This method is advantageous in cardiac surgery patients because an
initial large single bolus of NMB has been shown to minimize postoperative residual
muscle paralysis (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). At a dose of 1.2 mg/kg, rocuronium, the NMB agent with the
fastest onset of action, increases heart rate and might help reduce thoracic rigidity,
which might otherwise result if opioids are given during induction (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The
mild vagolytic effect of rocuronium is also an advantage in cardiac surgery (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this randomized, double-blind, parallel trial was to compare the
effects of high single- and conventional-dose rocuronium NMB on QTc and hemodynamics in
patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting under fentanyl and
etomidate anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Ethical approval for this randomized, double-blind, parallel trial was granted by our
university hospital's Ethics Committee (No. 00572010). Patients with a EuroSCORE
(European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation score) of less than 6 (i.e.,
predicted medium risk) and about to undergo elective coronary artery
revascularization surgery were invited to participate in the study. Those granting
written informed consent were randomly allocated to one of two groups using sealed
envelopes. Group H patients (high-dose) received 1.2 mg/kg and group C (conventional
dose) patients received 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium for neuromuscular blockade during
induction of anesthesia. The patients, intubating physician, and electrocardiogram
(ECG) reader were blinded to group allocation. Patients with morbid obesity,
anticipated difficult airway (Mallampati score &#x02265;3), an abnormal ECG (atrial
fibrillation or bundle branch block), neuromuscular disease, congestive heart
failure, autonomic dysfunction, electrolyte disturbances, congenital long QT syndrome
(in the patient or in a family member), or on medications known to prolong the QTc
(tricyclic antidepressants, antidysrhythmics, &#x003b2;-adrenergic antagonists, calcium
channel blockers), or with ventricular tachycardia, ventricular extrasystole, or a
history of known allergy to drugs were excluded from participation. Patients having
hemodynamic instability requiring resuscitation during anesthesia and those whose
intubation was difficult were excluded from data analysis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Monitoring</title><p>Patients received 5 mg diazepam orally 1 day before surgery. Routine operating room
monitoring included arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry), cardiac rhythm
(leads II and V<sub>5</sub>), end-tidal carbon dioxide, and index of consciousness
(IoC-view, Morpheus Medical, Spain). An IV was placed in each forearm for crystalloid
(Isolyte S<sup>&#x000af;</sup>, a balanced electrolyte solution, Eczaciba&#x0015f;i-Baxter, Turkey)
infusion. A radial artery catheter was placed and serum electrolytes (K<sup>+</sup>,
Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) were measured. In the operating room, patients
were monitored before induction and continually until 5 min after intubation with a
7-lead Holter electrocardiogram (DM Software, Stateline, USA). The IoC-view monitor
recorded the EEG from 3 surface electrodes [middle forehead (+), left forehead (ref),
and over the left zygomatic bone (&#x02212;)]. The IoC is a unitless scale ranging from 99
(awake) to 0 (isoelectric EEG, coma) with a target range of 60-40 recommended by the
manufacturer for surgical anesthesia. The IoC was measured and recorded at 4 study
periods described below. Neuromuscular function was evaluated using a
Tofguard<sup>&#x000af;</sup> SX acceleromyograph (Organon Teknika NV, Belgium), which is
fully compliant with Good Clinical Practice guidelines (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Electrodes for ulnar nerve stimulation were placed at the
wrist on the radial side of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and 2-3 cm proximal to
the distal electrode. The acceleration transducer used to monitor neuromuscular
function was placed on the volar side of the distal phalanx of the thumb with no
preload to the thumb. The arm was not used for administration of anesthetic agents.
After loss of consciousness, supramaximal train-of-four (TOF) electrical stimulation
was applied every 15 s, with a square wave stimulus set at a current of 50 mA and a
duration of 0.2 ms, and the evoked response of the adductor pollicis muscle was
monitored. When the TOF ratio (T4/T1) was zero (i.e., when the depth of neuromuscular
block was completely disrupted), direct laryngoscopy was initiated followed by
tracheal intubation in 1 min. Intubation quality was evaluated as good, medium, or
poor (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Neuromuscular monitoring was
continued until 5 min after intubation. Body temperature at baseline was measured via
the tympanic membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Anesthesia and study periods</title><p>General anesthesia was induced as follows: intravenous fentanyl (6 &#x000b5;g/kg) was
administered over 4 min. Then, 0.15 mg/kg etomidate was injected and followed by
subsequent doses of 0.05 mg/kg (if needed) until loss of responsiveness (LOR).</p><p>LOR was defined as the moment of loss of eyelash reflex combined with the absence of
response to verbal or mild tactile stimulation. At that moment, patients were
considered to be unconscious and received either 0.6 mg/kg (group C) or 1.2 mg/kg
rocuronium (group H). Ventilation was controlled to maintain end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>
at 35-40 mmHg with a fresh gas flow of 6 L/min (100% oxygen) via face mask, either
breathing spontaneously or by receiving manually assisted ventilation. Following
rocuronium administration, patients were completely ventilated.</p><p>ECG data were transferred to a computer and analyzed by a senior cardiologist blinded
to allocation group. The QT interval was measured manually in each lead from the
beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. The QT, QRS, and RR intervals
were measured and then QTc values were calculated according to Bazzet's formula
[QT/(RR<sup>1/2</sup>)]. At least three consecutive cycles were measured for each
lead. A QTc longer than 450 was regarded as long (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Dysrhythmias were also recorded.</p><p>The study periods were: T0 = baseline, 1 min before administration of induction
drugs; T1 = immediately after completion of initial etomidate/fentanyl doses
(approximately 4 min after the start of induction); T2 = 2 min after rocuronium
administration, just before laryngoscopy; T3 = 2 min after intubation, and T4 = 5 min
after intubation. In order to minimize the cardiac rhythm artifacts, the patients
remained untouched during the study periods except as needed to perform face-mask
ventilation and intubation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using Statistics for Windows<sup>&#x000af;</sup> v6.0 (StatSoft
Inc., USA). Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used for intergroup comparisons of
parameters with normal distributions (means&#x000b1;SD). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for
intergroup comparisons of parameters without a normal distribution (median, lower and
upper quartile values). Repeated measurements were analyzed with the Friedman
analysis of variance (ANOVA) between variables at baseline and those at different
postoperative times within each group. Intragroup comparisons of the dependent
variables measured at specific times were compared with Wilcoxon's matched pairs test
and then corrected with the Bonferroni method. Fisher's exact chi-square test was
used to compare categorical variables between the two groups. A P value &#x0003c;0.05 was
considered statistically significant. The initial sample size analysis revealed that
17 patients would be required in each group in order to show a 20 ms difference (with
an estimated standard deviation of 20 ms) in QTc, with a power of 0.80 at an alpha
level of 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Fifty-four patients granted informed consent and were enrolled in the study. Fifty
patients completed the study according to the protocol. Four patients were excluded from
data analysis: 2 because of a problem with the Holter device, 1 because of the technical
problems with the TOF monitor, and 1 with poor intubation due to a vocal cord nodule.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>. The patients had normal (&#x0003c;55%) and mild
(&#x0003c;45-54%) ejection fractions, as measured by transthoracic echocardiography using the
Simpson method. The proportions in each group were similar, with 10 (40%) in group C and
12 (48%) in group H having a normal ejection fraction. The other patients in each group
(15 in group C and 13 in group H) had mildly impaired ejection fractions. The mean
rocuronium dose was 46&#x000b1;7 mg in group C patients and 102&#x000b1;8 mg in group H patients. The
mean time to a TOF ratio of 0 in group H (88&#x000b1;9 s) was significantly shorter than that in
group C (116&#x000b1;5 s; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>). No patients had
unexpected difficult intubations.</p><p>

group H had long QTc intervals (range 461 to 583 ms). Within both groups, the mean QTc
changed significantly during the study period (P=0.0001 for group C and P=0.009 for
group H). In group C, the mean QTc was significantly longer at T3 (2 min after
intubation) than that at baseline (T0), after the induction agent was given (T1), and
after rocuronium administration (T2), (P=0.001, P=0.001, and P=0.0003, respectively;

were also significantly longer at 2 min after intubation (T3) than at baseline (T0), and
after the induction agent was given (T1), (P=0.005, P=0.0001, respectively), but not
after rocuronium administration (T2, P=0.2). Sixteen patients in group C and twelve
patients in group H had an increase in QTc of &#x0003e;10% at T3 compared with baseline (T0,
P=0.2). Mean QTc intervals were not significantly different between group H and group C
at any time point (P&#x0003e;0.05, Mann-Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>

varied significantly with time (P=0.00001 and P=0.00003, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>). In both groups, the mean heart rate was
significantly lower after rocuronium (T2) compared with baseline (T0; P=0.0004, P=0.03,
respectively) and higher 2 min after intubation (T3) compared to T2 (P=0.0007 and
P=0.01, respectively). The overall mean heart rates (i.e., the mean of the rates
measured at all time points) in groups C and H were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Mean arterial pressures are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>.

P=0.0001 and P=0.02 for group H). In both groups, mean arterial pressure was
significantly higher 2 min after intubation (T3) than after rocuronium administration
(T2; P=0.04 for group C and P=0.01 for group H). The overall mean arterial pressures
(i.e., the mean of the pressures measured at all time points) in groups C and H were not
significantly different (P&#x0003e;0.05, Mann-Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The incidence of dysrhythmias was similar in group C (28%) and group H (24%) (P=0.5,

groups, dysrhythmias appeared 2 min after intubation (T3) and continued during the
following minutes. At T3, one patient in group C had nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia and two patients had ST depression. In group H, three patients had premature
atrial contractions and two patients had premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) at
the beginning of the case that continued until 5 min after intubation. Two patients with

actual power of 0.93 with 25 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, the effects of NMB with high (1.2 mg/kg) and conventional (0.6 mg/kg)
single-dose rocuronium on QTc were similar in patients undergoing coronary artery
revascularization surgery while under fentanyl and etomidate anesthesia. In both groups,
the greatest prolongation of QTc compared with baseline occurred 2 min after intubation,
but the QTc returned to baseline 5 min after intubation. Our findings suggest that the
stimulation of intubation itself (rather than the dose of rocuronium used) may have
caused the QTc prolongation. In both groups, mean heart rate was significantly
increased, and mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased, before and after
rocuronium compared with baseline, but these changes did not have negative clinical
effects. Dysrhythmias were observed 2 and 5 min after intubation. Patients receiving the
higher dose of rocuronium had fewer dysrhythmias than those receiving the conventional
dose, but the difference in occurrence was not statistically significant.</p><p>A dose of 1.2 mg/kg is typically the highest rocuronium dose used in clinical practice,
and was found to be the best dose to prevent electromyographic responses to intubation
when compared with lower doses (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 mg/kg) during general anesthesia with
propofol (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Therefore, we expected that
high-dose rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg) would produce a weaker sympathetic response to
intubation and have less of an effect on QTc intervals compared with the conventional
lower dose (0.6 mg/kg). The only study of the effects of high-dose rocuronium on QTc
during induction was conducted by Puhringer et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status I-III patients
during non-cardiac surgery. As in this study, they observed no effect of rocuronium
alone on QTc prolongation.</p><p>Intubation conditions are related more closely to the degree and time of onset of NMB in
the laryngeal adductors, diaphragm, and masseter muscles than in the adductor pollicis
muscle (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Monitoring NMB at different muscles
may provide additional information that can be used to effectively prevent hemodynamic
responses to intubation despite good or excellent intubation conditions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Neuromuscular blocking agents decrease stretch receptor activity in the muscles and thus
suppress stimulation input to the arousal centers in the brain (afferentation theory).
According to this theory, NMB agents suppress the bispectral index (BIS) and
cardiovascular responses to nociceptive stimulation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In the present study, we
intubated patients when they lost responsiveness after having received fentanyl and
etomidate, which corresponded to a mean IoC of 55 in our study. The IoC correlated well
with BIS, and we encountered no unexpected difficult intubations at this level of
anesthesia. Studies state that a BIS value higher than 40 may not provide ideal
conditions for intubation, and intraoperative airway complications may occur more
frequently due to more pronounced laryngeal reflexes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The need to maintain
hemodynamic stability during induction in patients with coronary artery disease leads us
to not seek a low BIS value before intubation. Although high-dose rocuronium provided
deeper anesthesia than conventional-dose rocuronium, adequate sympathetic blockade (as
measured by hemodynamic values and length of QTc) was not obtained in the high-dose
group. Others have reported that rocuronium administration did not affect BIS during
steady-state propofol anesthesia in the absence of nociceptive stimulation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, with nociceptive stimulation
(laryngoscopy), the increase in BIS in patients who received rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) was
significantly lower than in patients who did not (saline) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We performed intubation when the TOF ratio reached zero to
prevent the sympathetic response to stimulus before intubation and the large
interindividual variation in neuromuscular depression that can occur after
administration of NMB agents (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>In our study, QTc intervals were longer than baseline at 2 min after intubation and were
independent of rocuronium dose, i.e., both doses of rocuronium failed to block the
hemodynamic response to intubation. Preexisting myocardial injury in patients about to
undergo cardiac surgery may also result in long QT intervals (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). QTc prolongation with
rocuronium may be related to the extent of coronary artery disease, the extent of
myocardial ischemia, and/or the extent of collateral circulation. Approximately 45% of
our patients had altered depolarization thresholds at baseline. In our study population,
the proportion of patients having long QTc was similar in both groups. We observed ST
depression, ventricular extrasystoles, and sustained ventricular tachycardia 2 min after
intubation. Dysrhythmias occurred with similar frequency in both groups, but a study
with a larger number of patients should be done to determine these frequencies more
precisely. Although the proportions of patients with long QTc were similar in the two
study groups, future studies of rocuronium effects conducted in larger numbers of
coronary artery disease patients will be useful to determine its adverse effects.</p><p>Limitations of our study are the small study group sizes and the lack of a placebo group
that was not given rocuronium. We believe that the use of larger doses of non-NMB agents
in adult patients with a history of cardiac ischemia would be likely to result in
clinically unsafe side effects.</p><p>In conclusion, intubation provoked increases in QTc, heart rate, and MAP following
conventional- and high-dose rocuronium given during induction and intubation of patients
about to undergo coronary artery surgery. Anesthesia was induced with etomidate and
fentanyl. Dysrhythmias occurred at similar rates in both dosage groups. In both groups,
QTc was most prolonged, compared to baseline, 2 min after intubation, suggesting that
the QTc prolongation may have been a response to the nociceptive stimulus of intubation.
Further controlled studies are needed to assess depolarization thresholds and QTc after
