As a result, few cost effectiveness analyses have been reported. The aim of this paper is to report the cost and cost effectiveness of the Physical Activity 4 Everyone (PA4E1) intervention which was a multi-component intervention implemented in secondary schools located in low-income communities. Cost effectiveness was assessed using both the physical activity and weight status trial outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Intervention and Study Design:</italic> The PA4E1 cluster randomised controlled trial was implemented in 10 Australian secondary schools (5 intervention: 5 control) and consisted of intervention schools receiving seven physical activity promotion strategies and six additional strategies that supported school implementation of the intervention components. Costs associated with physical activity strategies, and intervention implementation strategies within the five intervention schools were estimated and compared to the costs of usual physical activity practices of schools in the control group. The total cost of implementing the intervention was estimated from a societal perspective, based on the number of enrolled students in the target grade at the start of the intervention (Grade 7, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;837).</p><p><italic>Economic Outcomes:</italic> The economic analysis outcomes were cost and incremental cost effectiveness ratios for the following: minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day gained, MET hours gained per person/day; Body Mass Index (BMI) unit avoided; and 10&#x000a0;% reduction in BMI z-score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The intervention cost AUD $329,952 over 24&#x000a0;months, or AUD$394 per student in the intervention group. This resulted in a cost effectiveness ratio of AUD$56 ($35&#x02013;$147) per additional minute of MVPA, AUD$1 ($0.6&#x02013;$2.7) per MET hour gained per person per day, AUD$1408 ($788&#x02013;$6,570) per BMI unit avoided, and AUD$563 ($282&#x02013;$3,942) per 10&#x000a0;% reduction in BMI z-score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PA4E1 is a cost effective intervention for increasing the physical activity levels and reducing unhealthy weight gain in adolescence, a period in which physical activity typically declines. Additional modelling could explore the potential economic impact of the intervention on morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=362315">ACTRN12612000382875</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>School</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial, Low income, Disadvantaged, Cost effectiveness, Economic</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001207</institution-id><institution>Department of Health, New South Wales Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Regular physical activity has well established positive benefits for both physical and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], yet physical activity levels are known to decline throughout adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] with only 20&#x000a0;% of youth currently undertake sufficient daily physical activity to obtain these health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Physical inactivity is considered to directly contribute to 1.5&#x000a0;%&#x02013;3.0&#x000a0;% of global health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], including direct and indirect health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The large proportion of low-active adolescents, coupled with the global concern regarding overweight and obesity, make population-based interventions focused on physical activity promotion and obesity prevention in this population sub-group a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As both physical inactivity and overweight and obesity are more prevalent in adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds, strategies targeting this population are particularly warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>School-based physical activity and lifestyle interventions show promise in addressing both physical inactivity and overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Schools provide almost universal access to children and adolescents, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, schools have the policies, resources, and teaching staff to adopt programs into usual school practice that are likely to impact on both physical activity and weight status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite this, successful interventions targeting adolescents are limited in number, particularly interventions that target adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A recent systematic review reported only 14 of the 44 included school-based physical activity intervention trials targeted adolescents, of which only four resulted in significant physical activity intervention effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Only two of the adolescent trials focused on disadvantaged adolescents, with one reporting significant intervention effects on physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, a recent review of childhood and adolescent obesity prevention reported multi-component school physical activity interventions have resulted in only modest reductions in BMI (&#x02212;0.13&#x000a0;kg/m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], 95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;0.22 to &#x02212;0.04) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the review reported results for both children and adolescents combined, with the impact specifically on adolescents unknown. Systematic reviews of interventions that aim to prevent obesity have demonstrated smaller effects in adolescent populations in comparison to younger children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In order for policy makers to allocate scarce health resources, economic evaluations of effective programs, ideally based on outcomes of randomised controlled trials, are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) aims to evaluate questions around the benefits of interventions relative to their cost in order to inform funding decisions and health care policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] CEA is used to determine technical efficiency. That is, the production of health benefit for the least cost. No single threshold exists for determining the acceptability of a CE ratio. Rather, a variety of considerations, including the prosperity of a nation or health system, as well as the incremental value delivered by an intervention, influence funding decisions. Despite the valuable contribution of CEA, very few studies have evaluated school-based physical activity interventions from a cost effectiveness perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Even fewer studies have targeted adolescents and none have focussed on disadvantaged adolescents. Two recent systematic reviews of physical activity interventions reporting cost-effectiveness included school-based interventions, but neither separated the effects for elementary and secondary school-focussed interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The reported cost effectiveness of interventions included in the review by Wu and colleagues (16 school-based trials, four in adolescents) was based on costs obtained either directly from published cost analyses or imputed by the review authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The second review by Laine and colleagues included school-based interventions from the Wu review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], as well as modelled cost-effectiveness studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (total of six school based trials, three in adolescents). While these reviews have limitations such as few of the studies assessing physical activity using objective measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], use of imputed cost estimates rather than actual costs and variability in study design (with rigorous well designed RCT&#x02019;s tending to show smaller physical activity effectiveness and higher cost-effectiveness ratios) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], both reviews conclude that school-based physical activity interventions are cost effective compared to other population based interventions in terms of physical activity outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>From an obesity prevention perspective, the Australian ACE Obesity prevention study conducted in 2003 used modelling techniques to review a portfolio of interventions targeting the prevention of childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Five of the thirteen population level interventions were school-based. The review concluded that multi-strategic school-based interventions were cost effective (modelled to cost less than $50,000 AUD per DALY) and estimated at $211&#x02013;$473 per student [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However the strength of the evidence was often limited, weak or inconclusive with only seven of the 13 interventions included in the study being based on evidence of effect gained from randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A further systematic review of eight childhood obesity primary prevention trials (including three school-based trials all targeting elementary aged children) reported school-based interventions were cost effective using a variety of cost effectiveness measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The authors concluded that limited comparison between studies could be made due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures across the studies, low quality of included studies and the use of model-based studies to obtain an outcome rather than trial outcome measures. Given the limitations of existing data there is an increasing demand for additional data on cost and cost effectiveness of school based intervention for both physical activity and adiposity outcomes.</p><p>The Physical Activity 4 Everyone (PA4E1) trial involved a 24-month multicomponent school-based intervention implemented in secondary schools located in disadvantaged communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The trial aimed to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the decline in physical activity among adolescents. The trial was one of a very limited number of school-based physical activity interventions that has demonstrated an increase in objectively measured physical activity coupled with a reduction in weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and the first study in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. At both 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and 24-months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], the study reported improvements in daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) together with a positive effect for weight and body mass index (BMI) in favour of the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, a significant intervention effect was also observed for BMI Z-score at 24&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Due to the limited literature outlining the cost effectiveness of school-based interventions that can impact on both physical activity and weight status in adolescents, the aim of this study was to assess the costs of the PA4E1 intervention, and the cost effectiveness of the intervention considering both physical activity and weight status trial outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intervention trial design, setting and sample</title><p>A cluster randomized trial was conducted involving randomly selected secondary schools (five intervention and five control schools) in socio-economically disadvantaged communities in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.

The analysis was conducted on an intention to treat basis, with the total program cost being calculated for all enrolled students in the target Grade across the five intervention schools at baseline given these students would have been exposed to the intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;837). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated for each outcome measure and represent the additional expenditure required to deliver each additional unit of benefit.</p><p>For the physical activity outcome measures, the ICERs calculated were the cost per student per mean minute of MVPA gained and cost per student per MET minute gained. To present the intervention cost per minute of MVPA gain, the total cost per student was divided by the mean difference in change in MVPA minutes between intervention and control groups over 24&#x000a0;months, to provide a cost per student per minute of additional MVPA. The cost per person/day is then divided by the MET hours gained per day, resulting in a cost effectiveness ratio per MET hour gained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>For the weight status outcomes, the ICERs were calculated to represent the expenditure per student per BMI unit avoided and cost per student per 0.1 unit (10&#x000a0;%) BMI z-score reduction. The total intervention cost per student was divided by mean difference in change in BMI and BMI z-score between groups over 24&#x000a0;months to provide a cost per BMI unit avoided and cost per 0.1 (10&#x000a0;%) reduction in BMI z-score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p>The multicomponent intervention was delivered in its entirety to a cohort of students in Grade7 at the beginning of the intervention, followed through to Grade 9. Whilst the evaluation of the intervention occurred within the cohort of students and the cost effectiveness analysis has been conservatively calculated on the basis of the intervention benefiting only the cohort of students measured in the evaluation. Due to the nature of the intervention strategies (teacher training, school environment and broader school community links), it was likely the intervention had an impact on all students attending the school more broadly, not just on those students within the evaluation cohort. Univariate sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test plausible variation in the evaluation components as well as the impact of changing key design features of the intervention, including broader exposure and an associated estimate of benefit. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> details the sensitivity tests that were modelled and provides justification for the assumptions made based on evaluations and empirical data from the PA4E1 trial: (i and ii) variation in the costs of specific intervention components (iii) variation in the magnitude of effect size using the upper and lower confidence interval limits; (iv) test assuming physical activity strategy 4 (recess and lunchtime activities) is extended to 10&#x000a0;% of students beyond the target grade, with a reduced effect on daily minutes of MVPA compared to students in the target grade; and (v) test assuming the benefits of physical activity strategy 1 (active PE), strategy 5 (physical activity policy) and implementation strategy 1 (change agent), 2 (executive support) and 3 (resources) are extended to all students (100&#x000a0;%) outside the target year (in Grades 7&#x02013;10), with a reduced effect on daily minutes of MVPA compared to students in the target grade. Aggregated costs across schools meant it was not possible to capture the cost profiles of individual student participants, prohibiting uncertainty analysis.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sensitivity and scenario description: strategies and benefit</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Test to be modelled</th><th>Detailed assumptions</th><th>Justification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sensitivity analyses</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(i) Variation in the intervention cost</td><td>Higher estimate of the assumed opportunity cost of school staff participation in PA strategy (PAS) 4 &#x00026; 5 and implementation support strategy (ISS) 1</td><td>Plausible variation in the cost</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(ii) Variation in the intervention cost</td><td>Lower estimate of the assumed opportunity cost of school staff participation in PAS 4 &#x00026; 5 and ISS 1</td><td>Plausible variation in the cost</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(iii) Varying the magnitude of the effect size</td><td>Assumes benefit of the overall intervention varies between the calculated confidence interval of the effect size in daily minutes of MVPA</td><td>Plausible variation in the effect size</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">&#x02003;(iv) Extending the benefit of physical activity recess and lunchtime activities to students beyond the target year.</td><td>Assumes benefit of PAIS 4 is extended to 10&#x000a0;% of students beyond the target year, with a reduced effect on daily minutes of MVPA compared to students in the target year.

There are 487 secondary schools catering for students in Grades 7 to 10 in NSW, with 254,923 students enrolled in these Grades. The first scenario used the current intervention implementation model within the target year across all applicable secondary schools in NSW. That is, those schools with Grades 7&#x02013;10. Due to the logistical challenges of implementing interventions across large groups of schools and based on questions posed to principals of participating schools, the second scenario analysis used a real world solution whereby the implementation of school based physical activity practices is supported by an existing in-school teacher as an alternative to the school physical activity consultant employed in the efficacy trial. The potential model utilising an existing in-school teacher for providing guidance for schools was assumed for the intervention across Government and Catholic schools catering for students in Grades 7 to 10 across NSW (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;487 secondary schools, catering for 254,923 students). The dissemination model included the costs of each school receiving relief funding for three periods per week for two years to support the implementation of the intervention within the school. This relief funding would allow an existing teacher within each secondary school to be released from classroom teaching to support the implementation within their school. This existing school teacher would be provided with teacher professional learning to enable them to embed the seven PA4E1 strategies within the school, using the same intervention implementation strategies used in PA4E1. Such a model was supported by principals of participating schools, who expressed a willingness to commit school resources for an in-school consultant for a period of 24&#x000a0;months. It was assumed that expansion of the intervention and changes to the support model would result in a reduced effectiveness compared to the primary trial outcome reported in the efficacy trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and a reduced impact as outlined in the sensitivity analysis for students outside the target year.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Schools</title><p>Five intervention schools (including 4 government and 1 catholic school of which 3 schools were located within the inner city and 2 were rural schools, with a mean of 129 Year 7 students) and five control schools ((including 4 government and 1 catholic school of which 3 schools were inner city schools and 2 were rural schools with a mean of 101&#x000a0;year 7students).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Trial participants</title><p>The study included 1150 students in Grade 7 (645 intervention, 505 control) at baseline.

Since the current analysis did not extend to including any potential cost-offsets associated with increased physical activity, the cost-effectiveness of the intervention should still be considered favourable.</p><p>From a weight perspective, the intervention costs per child calculated in PA4E1 are similar to a school- and community-based childhood obesity intervention (implementing both nutrition and physical activity strategies) known as <italic>Be Active Eat Well</italic>, which was also implemented in Australia targeting children aged 5&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This study reported a cost per child of $344AUD, and resulted in a similar effect on BMI (0.28 BMI Units), but a greater impact on BMI Z-score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], potentially due to the younger age of the students targeted by the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, the APPLES childhood obesity prevention study conducted in New Zealand targeted children aged 5&#x02013;12 years and reported higher intervention cost per child of NZD $1,281 (equivalent to $1202.7AUD), and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NZD $664&#x02013;$1708 per kg of weight-gain prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>The cost per student in the PA4E1 study were comparable to other school-based physical activity interventions and multi-component school-based obesity prevention interventions with a physical education component that have reported to be cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. This is in spite of PA4E1 targeting adolescents, in which systematic reviews show smaller effects in adolescents compared to elementary aged children. As a result, the PA4E1 study seems a cost effective option for improving the physical activity and weight status of adolescents within a higher risk population group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In most cases, the cost effectiveness ratios are conservative in nature due to the intervention effect being limited to the target group only. Sensitivity analyses revealed lower costs per students when the benefits were extended beyond the target group to others students in the school, or if equipment provided was reduced.</p><p>Based on conservative estimates of benefit (applied to the target year only), this study demonstrates that PA4E1 is a cost effective intervention for maintaining adolescent physical activity levels and impacting favourably on weight status. The sensitivity analyses provide insight into impact of the intervention if the health benefits were applied to students across the school more broadly, with the majority of these analyse demonstrating a greater cost effectiveness and a reduced intervention cost per student. When the assumptions of the intervention are manipulated as demonstrated in the scenario analyses, by reducing the cost of equipment and extending the benefit of the MVPA outcome (at a reduced level) beyond the target year, the intervention remains cost effective. The provision of an in-school physical activity consultant for one day per week was the largest cost relating to the efficacy trial (66&#x000a0;% of the total intervention cost). Whilst the provision of an in-school physical activity consultant was necessary under efficacy trial conditions in order to evaluate the effect of the combination of intervention strategies, the feasibility of providing a part-time consultant within schools across large geographic regions and the cost of such a model of support presents challenges in upscaling the intervention. The dissemination of an effective intervention across the community requires the use of implementation strategies which better mirror real world practice. A dissemination model that utilises an existing in-school teacher to embed desired practices has been shown to successfully impact on student physical activity levels, and our results indicate such a model is more cost effective at scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, the cost effectiveness of these studies has not been reported. Whilst PA4E1 appears to be a cost effective intervention, dissemination is needed if its health benefits are to be realised. Based on a model to a disseminate an effective intervention under real world conditions, a scenario analysis indicated the potential of a state-wide roll-out of the PA4E1 program, resulting in a cost per student which was substantially reduced compared to the costs of the randomised controlled trial. As the intervention is effective, prioritising higher risk schools such as those located in socio-economically disadvantaged areas may provide a rationale for prioritisation.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study has a number of strengths and limitations that should be considered within the broader context of the economic evaluations and disease prevention. The strengths include: firstly the data informing the analysis is based on results from a randomized controlled trial using [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] objectively measured physical activity using accelerometry. Secondly, the costs associated with the intervention were collected prospectively thus improving accuracy by eliminating recall bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Thirdly, this study reported the ICER from a number of perspectives, both physical activity and weight status. This enables comparison across studies, particularly physical activity studies in which a broad range of outcomes have been used in the past and therefore limit the usefulness of such studies. In our case, the conversion of the physical activity outcome to METS, and cost per MET minute gained enable useful comparison with the limited number of published physical activity cost effectiveness studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The study also has limitations that should be noted. The translation of the intermediate outcomes captured by the study into final outcomes, such as DALYs, expedient for economic evaluations was beyond the scope of this analysis. This type of modelling has previously been conducted on interventions that aimed to prevent overweight and obesity in children and adolescents, and as a result may provide policy makers with additional useful data to make informed policy decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These studies model the broad societal level cost effectiveness, and should potentially be considered for this intervention in the future.</p><p>The sensitivity and scenario analysis are both hypothetical. Whilst based on empirical data from the evaluation of the intervention they may overestimate (or underestimate) the impact of changing the intervention component on the intervention costs. The scenario analysis tests only one set of possible assumptions, and whilst based on empirical data collected via a sensitivity analysis conducted within the efficacy trial and formative research of schools participating in the intervention, the scenario is hypothetical. Additionally, this analysis is constrained by the time horizon of the intervention. Whilst the intervention appears to be cost effective and able to obtain health benefits for both physical activity and weight status for a relatively low cost, the sustainability of these behaviours remains unknown. Lai and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] have indicated the physical activity of similar school-based intervention can be sustained, however, the likelihood that the positive change achieved through the PA4E1 intervention can be maintained is currently unknown. Future research on the sustainability of PA4E1 is warranted in addition to research evaluating the impact of using an alternative model to support large scale implementation. This would in turn inform the extrapolation of these cost effectiveness results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The PA4E1 intervention had a statistically significant intervention effect on physical activity and weight gain which can be achieved for a relatively low monetary cost of $394AUD per student over a 24-month period. This investment is promising for public health policy, particularly as the intervention was delivered in school communities located in disadvantaged communities where both physical inactivity and overweight and obesity are likely to be more prevalent, therefore likely to result in a greater future burden of disease. Further research is required to determine the impact of the intervention if implemented on a routine basis throughout the period of secondary schooling.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental cost effectiveness ratios</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISS</term><def><p>Implementation support strategy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVPA</term><def><p>Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSW</term><def><p>New South Wales</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA4E1</term><def><p>Physical activity 4 everyone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAS</term><def><p>Physical activity strategy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PE</term><def><p>Physical education</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Physical Activity 4 Everyone intervention trial was funded by the NSW Ministry of Health through the NSW Health Promotion Demonstration Research Grants Scheme and conducted by Hunter New England Population Health (a unit of the Hunter New England Local Health District), in collaboration with the University of Newcastle and University of Wollongong.
