Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss during cardiac and orthopedic surgery, but no study has yet evaluated tranexamic acid use during cystectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A randomized, double-blind (surgeon-, anesthesiologist-, patient-, data-monitor-blinded), placebo-controlled trial of tranexamic acid during cystectomy was initiated in June 2013. Prior to incision, the intervention arm participants receive a 10&#x000a0;mg/kg loading dose of intravenously administered tranexamic acid, followed by a 5&#x000a0;mg/kg/h maintenance infusion. In the control arm, the patient receives an identical volume of normal saline that is indistinguishable from the intervention. The primary outcome is any blood transfusion from the start of surgery up to 30&#x000a0;days post operative. There are no strict criteria to mandate the transfusion of blood products. The decision to transfuse is entirely at the discretion of the treating physicians who are blinded to patient allocation. Physicians are allowed to utilize all resources to make transfusion decisions, including serum hemoglobin concentration and vital signs. To date, 147 patients of a planned 354 have been randomized to the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This protocol reviews pertinent data relating to blood transfusion during radical cystectomy, highlighting the need to identify methods for reducing blood loss and preventing transfusion in patients receiving radical cystectomy.

Among incident cancers it is estimated that 8% (6400 per year) will undergo radical cystectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Radical cystectomy is an advanced surgical procedure that involves removal of the urinary bladder, adjacent organs, and pelvic lymph nodes. Removal of the urinary bladder also necessitates urinary reconstruction using an isolated segment of small or large intestine for urinary diversion. The extensive extirpative and reconstructive components of this surgery result in prolonged operative times and are associated with significant risk of complications including high risk of perioperative bleeding and subsequent need for blood transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Among individual surgeons at institutions that perform many procedures, median intraoperative blood loss is between 600 and 1700&#x000a0;mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The incidence of at least one intraoperative blood transfusion is 9 to 67% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the postoperative transfusion risk is at least 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Among cystectomy patients who receive transfusion, a median of 2&#x000a0;units of blood cells are given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Lysine analog drugs are synthetic derivatives of the amino acid lysine that reversibly block lysine-binding sites on plasminogen molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This action prevents the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, the active enzyme that degrades fibrin clots. Therefore, lysine analogs decrease the breakdown of clots and are considered anti-fibrinolytics. There are two commonly studied lysine analogs, tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Both of these drugs have been shown to decrease blood transfusion need during some surgeries without a significant increase in adverse events.</p><p id="Par23">In 2011, urologists who specialize in cancer treatment (members of the Society of Urologic Oncology) were surveyed about the methods they used to prevent blood loss during radical cystectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Respondents were asked about their use of systematic techniques, systemic drugs, and topical agents to reduce blood loss and prevent blood transfusion. Topical agents were commonly used among expert urologists (73% used oxidized cellulose polymer; 53% used gelatin and thrombin matrix) and 28% used at least one systematic technique such as autologous blood recovery. Systemic drugs, such as lysine analogs, were used by only 5% of surgeons.</p><p id="Par24">The infrequent use of lysine analogs during radical cystectomy may be due to lack of high-quality evidence supporting their effectiveness in this setting. While numerous cardiac and orthopedic surgery studies have evaluated the effect of intraoperative lysine analogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], a recent systematic review of major pelvic surgery failed to identify a single cystectomy trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In summary, radical cystectomy is associated with a high risk of clinically significant blood loss and blood transfusion, while lysine analogs have been shown to decrease these risks during other types of surgery. Therefore, our objective is to determine the effect of lysine analogs during radical cystectomy using a placebo-controlled randomized trial. We chose to use tranexamic acid as the study drug because of its ease of administration, demonstrated benefit in other procedures, safety profile, and familiarity of use in other surgical procedures.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives and research questions</title><p id="Par26">The primary objective is whether the use of systemic tranexamic acid compared to placebo reduces the proportion of radical cystectomy patients requiring red blood cell transfusion up to 30&#x000a0;days post operative (anticipated 50% transfusion rate with placebo to 35% with tranexamic acid). Secondary objectives are to determine the effect of tranexamic acid on intraoperative blood loss, number of transfused blood products, and post-operative complications. Specifically, thrombotic events will be evaluated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting and design</title><p id="Par27">This study was initiated at The Ottawa Hospital, a regional cancer referral center in Ottawa, Canada.

Patients are randomized to receive either tranexamic acid (intervention) or placebo (control).</p><p id="Par28">In keeping with a pragmatic approach to this study, we have adopted permissive eligibility criteria, an easily administered protocol, outcomes that are of relevance to physicians, patients, and health administrators, and limited data collection.

Patients who have undergone previous surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy may be included. Extent of lymph node dissection is not prescribed. All forms of urinary diversion (conduit, orthotopic continent, or continent cutaneous) are allowed. Use of perioperative thromboprophylaxis (e.g., anti-coagulants, thromboembolism-deterrent stockings, sequential compression devices) are permitted and are at the discretion of the care providers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par31">Patients are excluded from enrollment if they (1) are unable or unwilling to receive red blood cell products due to medical or personal reasons; (2) are pregnant (confirmed by &#x003b2;HCG test); (3) have a known allergy to tranexamic acid; (4) have acquired disturbances of color vision; (5) have a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage; or (6) have thromboembolic disease (active or diagnosed within 1&#x000a0;year), such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or cerebral thrombosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study interventions</title><p id="Par32">The study intervention is Canadian-sourced tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron&#x000ae; made by Pfizer). Tranexamic acid is administered intravenously at a dose of 10&#x000a0;mg/kg within 10&#x000a0;min (loading dose) prior to the surgical incision, followed by 5&#x000a0;mg/kg/h continuous maintenance infusion for the length of surgery (stopped &#x000b1;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;min from skin closure). For example, an 80-kg patient would receive 800&#x000a0;mg prior to incision and a 400&#x000a0;mg/h infusion for the duration of surgery.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Description and justification of dose</title><p id="Par33">There is no defined dosing schedule for tranexamic acid administration. A wide range of doses and schedules have been used in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In 34 cardiac surgery trials investigating the efficacy of tranexamic acid, the loading dose ranged from 2.5 to 100&#x000a0;mg/kg while the maintenance infusions ranged from 0.25&#x02013;16&#x000a0;mg/kg/h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In 31 non-cardiac surgery trials investigating the efficacy of tranexamic acid, the majority (27) in orthopedic surgery, loading doses ranged from 10 to 40&#x000a0;mg/kg and maintenance infusions ranged from 1 to 40&#x000a0;mg/kg/h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The most common loading dose from all trials was 10&#x000a0;mg/kg and the most common infusion dose was 10&#x000a0;mg/kg/h in non-cardiac surgery and 1&#x000a0;mg/kg/h in cardiac surgery (not including doses of drug used to prime the bypass machine). Dosing strategies were highly variable as some studies did not use a loading dose while others gave only single or intermittent doses.</p><p id="Par34">The serum half-life of tranexamic acid is 120&#x000a0;min when administered intravenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Without a loading dose it would take as long as 10&#x000a0;h to reach a steady-state serum concentration when the maximum treatment effect would be observed. Therefore, we decided that a loading dose is essential to ensure adequate drug concentration at the time of the initial incision so that the maximum effect of the drug coincides with the greatest risk for bleeding. Furthermore, given the relatively short half-life of tranexamic acid and the long duration of cystectomy surgery, a maintenance infusion is more likely to maintain therapeutic serum concentrations compared to intermittent bolus dosing.</p><p id="Par35">Given the safety profile of tranexamic acid and the potential dose-related response (in vitro) we believed that it was important to choose a dose large enough to be confident that we are achieving therapeutic drug concentrations. A 10&#x000a0;mg/kg loading dose has been frequently studied and should achieve a therapeutic serum concentration. In addition, the maintenance infusion dose suggested for bypass surgery (5&#x000a0;mg/kg/h) is within the range of studied doses and should be sufficient to maintain drug levels throughout surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Pharmacy preparation and administration of tranexamic acid or placebo</title><p id="Par36">Ampoules of tranexamic acid (10 mL) of concentration 100&#x000a0;mg/mL are secured by the pharmacy. Mixtures of tranexamic acid remain stable for up to 24&#x000a0;h when refrigerated; therefore, the local research pharmacist or pharmacy technician accesses the online patient allocation and prepares the study drug or placebo within a 24&#x000a0;h period prior to the anticipated completion of the scheduled cystectomy. All mixtures are kept refrigerated from the time of mixing until time of use unless used immediately. The weight-based dose to administer for each patient is confirmed by the administering anesthesiologist using a weight-based dosing nomogram provided by the coordinating center&#x02019;s pharmacy research technician. The research site&#x02019;s pharmacy staff also has access to the patient&#x02019;s weight and dosing nomogram in order to prepare the study products. Study drugs are stored in a secure, locked location at each site&#x02019;s pharmacy department. Health Canada regulations mandate monitoring and documenting temperature daily as the medication must be stored at room temperature prior to mixing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Placebo control</title><p id="Par37">As there is no standard of care concerning administration of anti-fibrinolytic agents in cystectomy procedures, controls follow the same dosing and schedule described above, but receive 0.9% sodium chloride only.</p><p id="Par38">Other techniques, agents, or equipment may be used at the discretion of the anesthesiologist/surgeon to prevent blood loss, and are recorded. These may include acute normovolemic hemodilution, autologous blood banking, systemic hemostatics (e.g., factor VIIa), topical agents (e.g., oxidized cellulose), and instruments such as thermal devices (e.g., Ligasure&#x000ae;).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study outcomes</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Primary outcome</title><p id="Par39">The primary outcome of the trial is whether or not the patient was transfused at least 1 unit of packed red blood cells up to 30&#x000a0;days post operative. We will compare the proportion transfused at least 1 unit of packed red blood cells between tranexamic acid and placebo study arms. In keeping with our pragmatic approach and difficulty in defining a transfusion protocol, there are no strict criteria to mandate the transfusion of blood products. The decision to transfuse is entirely at the discretion of the treating physicians who are blinded to patient allocation. Physicians are allowed to utilize all resources to make transfusion decisions, including serum hemoglobin concentration and vital signs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p id="Par40">Secondary outcomes will assess other transfusion metrics and perioperative safety, cumulative to 30 days post operative. Documentation includes total units of red blood cells transfused, occurrence of postoperative bleeding requiring intervention (e.g., reoperation or angioinfarction), occurrence of platelet transfusion, total units of platelets transfused, occurrence of plasma transfusion, total units of plasma transfused, estimated intraoperative blood loss, and change in hemoglobin. Safety outcomes include occurrence of severe adverse events, such as DVT, PE, myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebral infarction. We also capture treatment &#x0201c;failures&#x0201d; noted as the need for anti-hemorrhagic rescue interventions such as topical agents (e.g., oxidized cellulose) and recombinant factor VIIa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sequence and frequency of follow-up</title><p id="Par41">Data is collected prior to surgery, during surgery, at the time of hospital discharge, and at 30&#x000a0;days post operative (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). At each data collection time point, a detailed review of the health record is conducted by the site research coordinator. Laboratory tests are drawn as per standard clinical care at each institution. A 30-day post-surgery follow-up for adverse events is conducted through both health records and a 30-day phone interview. If the patient reports re-admission to hospital or outpatient intervention for a complication within 30 days of surgery, the medical record from the outpatient visits is reviewed and abstracted. Case Report Forms (CRFs) are completed at each study time point and are supported fully by source documents (charts, reports, laboratory result sheets).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par42">A patient record review from The Ottawa Hospital indicated that red blood cell transfusions were performed in approximately 60% of patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy. However, we anticipate that transfusion rates are likely to decrease slightly while under the study protocol. From the results of our survey, systemic anti-fibrinolytics are rarely used during radical cystectomies; to influence practice we suggest that tranexamic acid will have to produce a substantial reduction in the proportion of patients requiring transfusion. To assist in determining the minimally important effect of tranexamic acid deemed necessary to change clinical practice, Canadian experts in the surgical treatment of bladder cancer were surveyed in February 2012. Minimally important effect sizes ranged from an absolute difference of 15% (relative risk (RR) 30%) to 30% (RR 60%) and are consistent with effects observed in many clinical trials of tranexamic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. From our systematic review of lysine analogs to prevent bleeding during pelvic surgery, the pooled estimate favored lysine analogs (RR 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.00) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">If 50% of placebo patients will require at least one transfusion within 30&#x000a0;days of surgery, and if the use of tranexamic acid reduces the need for transfusion within 30&#x000a0;days to 35% of patients (15% absolute reduction), and assuming 80% power to detect this absolute difference, with a two-sided alpha level of 5%, the required sample size is 340 people (170 per treatment group). To account for 2% non-compliance with the protocol (possibly due to intraoperative complications or protocol deviations) the total sample size required was estimated to be 354 patients (177 per arm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par44">We are implementing a number of initiatives to maintain recruitment, including regular tracking, monitoring and reporting of recruitment activity at each participating site, regular newsletters, progress reports and regularly scheduled investigator and research staff meetings.

Comparative analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat principle (i.e., based on the participant&#x02019;s randomized study arm allocation). To address the primary objective of the effect of systemic tranexamic acid compared to placebo on the proportion of patients requiring red blood cell transfusion within 30&#x000a0;days, a chi-square test of proportions will be used. The effect size will be derived with an unadjusted RR and 95% confidence limits. If notable baseline imbalances are present, an adjusted estimate will be derived for the RR by stratifying on the potential confounders and pooling with a Mantel-Haenszel RR estimator. Secondary analyses of the effect of tranexamic acid on the volume of intraoperative blood loss and the perioperative adverse event rate will follow in a similar fashion, using chi-square or <italic>t</italic> tests, depending the outcome, and logistic or linear regression to estimate the magnitude of effect. A Poisson regression model will be fit to assess the difference in the number of transfused blood products between trial arms. Subgroup analyses will also be presented for clinically important baseline factors that may influence the effect of the drug, including sex, patient age (&#x0003c;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;years, 60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;years, 71&#x02013;80&#x000a0;years, and&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;years), preoperative hemoglobin (&#x0003c;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;g/L, 100&#x02013;120&#x000a0;g/L, and&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;120&#x000a0;g/L), and previous history of cardiac disease (yes/no).

As outlined, given the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid, that being the inhibition of clot breakdown, it could be anticipated that this medication would increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Contrary to this notion, previous studies of tranexamic acid with enrollment of thousands of patients with cardiovascular disease have not observed an increased risk of these adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Tranexamic acid has been approved for use by Health Canada and has a well-established side-effect profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Tranexamic acid is used predominantly in cardiac surgery, but has also been studied in orthopedic surgery and trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A recently updated systematic review of lysine analogs (including tranexamic acid) identified 252 trials, of which 173 were conducted in cardiac surgery and 53 in orthopedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Data regarding adverse effects of tranexamic acid was drawn from this Cochrane systematic review as well as a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the use of tranexamic acid in a trauma setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The Cochrane review of anti-fibrinolytics identified 65 trials containing 2528 patients comparing tranexamic acid with placebo to prevent blood loss and transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, none of the trials in this systematic review included patients treated with radical cystectomy. From this review of RCTs, the risk of red blood cell transfusion was 39% lower among patients who received tranexamic acid compared to placebo or standard of care (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.70).</p><p id="Par57">The use of tranexamic acid was not associated with increased risk of death (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.10), MI (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.52), or stroke (RR 1.23, 95%CI 0.49 to 3.07). Tranexamic acid was not associated with increased risk of developing a DVT (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.43) or a PE (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.99). Treatment with tranexamic acid did not appear to increase the risk of developing renal failure or dysfunction (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.37). The CRASH-2 trial randomized 20,211 adult trauma patients to tranexamic acid or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this trial, there were 33 deaths (0.3%) in the tranexamic acid arm vs. 48 (0.5%) in the placebo arm related to vascular occlusion (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.96) including 7 vs. 22 deaths from MI, 8 vs. 5 from stroke, and 18 vs. 21 from PE, respectively. Vascular occlusive events, fatal or non-fatal, did not differ significantly with 168 (1.7%) patients with one or more vascular occlusive events (MI, stroke, PE, DVT) in patients receiving tranexamic acid vs. 201 (2%) in patients receiving placebo (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02).</p><p id="Par58">In a retrospective study of 604 patients undergoing cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], it was reported that post-operative seizures occurred significantly more frequently in patients treated with tranexamic acid compared to epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Twenty-one tranexamic acid-treated patients (7.6%) compared to 13 (3.3%) epsilon-aminocaproic acid-treated patients (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.019) developed post-operative seizures. There was no control group in this study to which comparisons could be made. Patients in this study received a high dose of tranexamic acid with an initial 2-g bolus at the beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass followed by infusion of 0.5&#x000a0;g/h until chest closure and 2&#x000a0;g added to the priming fluid of the cardiopulmonary bypass system. Other recent retrospective studies have also shown that tranexamic acid, when given in high doses of 61 to 259&#x000a0;mg/kg, is associated with elevated rates of post-operative seizure compared to epsilon-aminocaproic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We have not found data indicating increased risk of seizure in trials using a similar dose to what we have chosen for our trial.</p><p id="Par59">Finally, the recent tranexamic acid RCT of 200 radical prostatectomy patients used a comparable dose to our study (500&#x000a0;mg loading and 250&#x000a0;mg/h infusion). They captured adverse events at 1 and 6&#x000a0;months following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. No deaths occurred and thromboembolic events were more common in the control group (five in the placebo vs. two in the tranexamic acid arm; RR 0.4; 95%CI 0.09 to 1.74).</p><p id="Par60">Given the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss during other surgical procedures without increasing the number of thromboembolic events compared to placebo, we hypothesize that tranexamic acid will eliminate the need for transfusion in a significant proportion of patients, reduce overall blood utilization, and not result in increased incidence of adverse events. Despite the large volume of evidence establishing safety of tranexamic acid in cardiac and orthopedic surgical patients, we acknowledge the theoretical risks and, therefore, we are monitoring vascular occlusive events, seizures, and other potential serious adverse reactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Auditing</title><sec id="Sec33"><title>Compliance with study allocation</title><p id="Par61">In this study, compliance refers only to receiving the study intervention administered during the intraoperative period, under supervision by attending urologists and anesthesiologists. We classify patients as being fully compliant if the patient is administered a complete dose schedule of the allocated agent (tranexamic acid or placebo), partially compliant if the patient is administered an incomplete dose schedule of the allocated agent, and non-compliant if the patient does not receive the allocated agent. Reasons for partial and non-compliance may range from errors in randomization/drug administration, physician and pharmacy errors in allocation, intraoperative complications, death, etc. Compliance is not based on patient tolerance and is very likely to be random. We expect partial/non-compliance to be less than 1%, although our sample size adjustment accounts for a total of 2% partial compliance and non-compliance. The degree of compliance is documented in the intraoperative CRF. Any partial compliance or non-compliance requires additional documentation by way of the Protocol Deviation or Protocol Violation Form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Loss to follow-up</title><p id="Par62">We expect complete follow-up at hospital discharge and at 30&#x000a0;days postoperative given the complexity of care and necessary short-term follow-up.

As shown in previous studies, tranexamic acid has the potential to significantly reduce operative blood loss. However, based on a recent survey of urologists and a recent systematic review of the academic literature, tranexamic acid is not commonly used by urologists and no previous trials have assessed the benefits and harms of this drug for patients treated with radical cystectomy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only registered trial evaluating a lysine analog during cystectomy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> search on 7 July 2017).</p><p id="Par71">Use of tranexamic acid during surgery at the study dose is inexpensive (less than 40 Canadian dollars per surgical case), technically easy to administer, and has been successfully performed in several trials evaluating other surgical procedures. Anesthesiologists are familiar with the use of tranexamic acid during cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, and other procedures where significant blood loss is anticipated. However, the uncritical use of tranexamic acid is not warranted without rigorous and definitive evidence to inform clinical practice. While most individual studies of tranexamic acid for non-urological surgeries revealed benefit of the drug, some did not. For example, in a study of myomectomy (surgical removal of benign tumors from the uterus), 50 patients were randomized to tranexamic acid and 50 were randomized to a control group which did not receive tranexamic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, tranexamic acid did not reduce the risk of receiving an allogeneic blood transfusion (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.01). This evidence conflicts with findings that tranexamic acid was efficacious in reducing the number of transfusions required in other pelvic surgeries (e.g., radical prostatectomy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and further highlights the need for more in-depth investigation of the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in pelvic surgery through a RCT. Furthermore, cystectomy patients are at high risk of thromboembolic complications and, theoretically, lysine analogs may increase this risk.</p><p id="Par72">At the completion of the trial, we will better understand the benefits and risks of systemic tranexamic acid during radical cystectomy. Specifically, we will know if tranexamic acid reduces the risk of exposure to blood transfusion among patients undergoing radical cystectomy. Given that there are few exclusion criteria and multi-institutional involvement, we expect our findings to have broad applicability. As this is the first RCT evaluating the use of a systemic anti-fibrinolytic during radical cystectomy, the findings may have an immediate impact on patient care. If the study is negative, we can avoid unnecessary exposure of patients to tranexamic acid during radical cystectomy. If the study reveals a benefit of tranexamic acid, we will change our standard of practice regarding radical cystectomy procedures, and procedures common to other major pelvic surgeries associated with significant blood loss will be challenged (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par73">Since the trial opened in June 2013, 147 patients have been accrued and successfully randomized. 13 research sites are participating in the trial, eight of which are currently active.
