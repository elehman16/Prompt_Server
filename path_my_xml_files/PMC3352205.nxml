However, recent studies and meta-analyses underline the clinical advantages of LAAM with respect to the reduction of heroin use. Thus a reappraisal of LAAM has been demanded. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative impact of LAAM on QTc-interval, as a measure of pro-arrhythmic risk, in comparison to methadone, the current standard in substitution therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>ECG recordings were analysed within a randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of maintenance treatment with LAAM compared with racemic methadone. Recordings were done at two points: 1) during a run-in period with all patients on methadone and 2) 24 weeks after randomisation into methadone or LAAM treatment group. These ECG recordings were analysed with respect to QTc-values and QTc-dispersion. Mean values as well as individual changes compared to baseline parameters were evaluated. QTc-intervals were classified according to CPMP-guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Complete ECG data sets could be obtained in 53 patients (31 LAAM-group, 22 methadone-group). No clinical cardiac complications were observed in either group. After 24 weeks, patients receiving LAAM showed a significant increase in QTc-interval (0.409 s &#x000b1; 0.022 s versus 0.418 s &#x000b1; 0.028 s, p = 0.046), whereas no significant changes could be observed in patients remaining on methadone. There was no statistically significant change in QTc-dispersion in either group.

There are many studies comparing the efficacy and safety of LAAM with methadone as medication in maintenance treatment for heroin addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In clinical trials, LAAM was found to be comparable to methadone with respect to reduction of illicit opiate use, treatment retention, employment, clinic attendance, and involvement in illegal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The safety of LAAM in long-term treatment was similar to that of methadone in a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Reports of cases of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (especially torsade de pointes) have raised concerns about potential arrhythmogenic effects both of LAAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and methadone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Both LAAM and methadone belong to a group of drugs that block cardiac potassium channels responsible for mediating ventricular repolarisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the context of these cardiac side effects, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) recommended the suspension of the marketing authorization for LAAM in 2001 and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the addition of a "black box" warning on the LAAM label [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, a recent study showing higher efficiency of LAAM with respect to suppression of heroin use revived the discussion whether potential risks for cardiac arrhythmias really outweigh the advantages of LAAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In clinical practice, the prolongation of the QT-interval (time interval including myocardial de-and repolarisation) is a surrogate marker for the risk of developing torsades de pointes tachycardia (TdP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Little is known regarding the extent of LAAM-induced QT-prolongation and the relative risk of LAAM compared with racemic methadone for the occurrence of QT-prolongation. Therefore the aim of the present study was to analyse corrected QT-duration and QT dispersion as measures of potential arrhythmogenic effects of LAAM in comparison to methadone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>ECG recordings were obtained from participants in a phase III clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Clinical studies suggest that LAAM is at least as efficient for substitution treatment as methadone. In addition, LAAM provides the option of less-than-daily doses which is made possible by the long half-lives of its two active metabolites. However, reports on potential proarrhythmic side-effects of LAAM raised concerns about its role as therapy for opiate dependence. Thus the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) recommended to suspend the marketing authorization for LAAM in 2001, and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the addition of a "black box" warning on the LAAM label.</p><p>Prompted by recent reports on potential advantages of LAAM with respect to promoting reduction of opiate use, the need of a re-evaluation of LAAM has been demanded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus the aim of the present study was to compare specific ECG changes in patients on LAAM and methadone substitution, the current standard in opioid substitution. The main finding of the present randomized study in opioid addicts is that switching from methadone to LAAM treatment increases the mean QTc-interval and the number of individual patients with abnormal QTc-interval compared with patients continuously on racemic methadone.</p><p>To our knowledge there is only one randomized study by Wedam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] examining the effect of methadone, LAAM and buprenorphine on QT-intervals. They found that the incidence of prolonged QTcintervals were considerable higher with LAAM and methadone than with buprenorphine. LAAM showed a tendency towards enhanced absolute QTc-values and an increase under medication as compared to methadone, what is in concordance with our findings.</p><p>There are several studies investigating QTc-prolongation and cardiac arrhythmia in patients on methadone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Generally, QTc-interval is increased as compared with patients taking heroin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] or with a reference group with the same age and sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Clinical complications and arrhythmias under methadone medication have predominantly been observed under high dosages (markedly more than 100 mg per day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], whereas mean daily methadone dosage was 69 mg in our study. As in the present study patients were on methadone during the run-in period, the rise in QTc-intervals and the increase of patients with prolonged QTc-intervals under LAAM medication might point to a higher pro-arrhythmic impact of LAAM when taking QTc-interval as a surrogate marker for arrhythmic risk.</p><p>In several clinical and epidemiological studies the reliability of the QT-interval measurements in the lead Einthoven II has been validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A prolongation of the QTc-interval is associated with an increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], mainly in patients with prior cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, a direct cause-effect relation between a prolonged QTcinterval and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias has not been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition to the drug induced change of mean values of QTc-intervals in a population, the effect of the drug on QTc-intervals in individual patients has to be assessed. The evaluation of individual cases is of special interest as there is a particular predisposition for the occurrence of torsades de pointes tachycardias in certain individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. On the basis of observational studies it has been speculated that ion channel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be partially responsible for this susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus if a patient develops a marked prolongation of the QTc-interval, this must be considered as a significant and potentially serious drug effect which might be more important than a slight increase in mean values described in a sample of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Given our results and the literature, there should be a careful weighing up of the pros and cons regarding the availability of LAAM as maintenance drug in the EU. On the one hand, LAAM is a maintenance drug of proven efficacy and with some advantages compared to methadone. On the other hand, there is an increased risk of cardiac complications. We agree with Stimmel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] that the known cardiac risk should lead to the improvement of cardiac monitoring, but not to a principal withdrawal of LAAM from the market. Known risk factors for cardiac side effects under LAAM are previous cardiovascular disease, excess doses of LAAM, medication inhibiting the P450-3A4 system, and medication lowering serum potassium or magnesium. Taking these factors into account, Stimmel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] recommended a baseline ECG in all patients prior to LAAM treatment with a subsequent exclusion of patients with prolonged QTc-interval. Additional ECGs should be performed two weeks after onset of LAAM treatment and after every substantial change of dosage. Eventually, in individual cases there might be the dilemma between the risk of continuous heroin use and the risk of cardiac complications under methadone or LAAM treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>84 subjects were initially enrolled in the study and 53 complete ECG data sets could be obtained. This discrepancy was due to lack of compliance with study procedures, e.g. drop-out from study treatment. It reflects the difficulties in conducting clinical studies in this patient group and has also been reported from other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>QTc-intervals and QT-dispersion represents only surrogate markers for an increased risk for arrhythmias. The present study is not powered to evaluate hard endpoints as sudden cardiac death. Notwithstanding QTc-interval is the best surrogate marker for TdP at the moment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study we could show that an indicator for an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmia was significantly more pronounced in patients after switching from methadone to LAAM compared with patients remaining on methadone. This suggests that LAAM might have a higher potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias than does methadone in comparable dosages, however, no clinical cardiac symptoms were reported in either group. In sum, in patients with known cardiac risk factors, methadone might be preferable to LAAM, but the statement of Jaffe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] should be seriously considered that it would be beneficial for opiate addicted patients if LAAM were available as a maintenance drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Statement of interests</title><p>The study was supported by Hexal (Germany).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Jaffe</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Senay</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuster</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Renault</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>DiMenza</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><article-title>Methadyl acetate vs. methadone: A double-blind study in heroin users</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>1972</year><volume>222</volume><fpage>437</fpage><lpage>442</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jama.1972.03210040013004</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4561559</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Senay</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name><name><surname>Dorus</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Renault</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name><article-title>Methadylacetate and methadone: An open comparison</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>1977</year><volume>237</volume><fpage>138</fpage><lpage>142</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jama.1977.03270290038023</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">318710</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Trueblood</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Judson</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><article-title>Acceptability of methadyl acetate (LAAM) as compared with methadone in a treatment program for heroin addicts</article-title><source>Drug Alcohol Depend</source><year>1978</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>125</fpage><lpage>132</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/0376-8716(78)90025-X</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">631012</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name><name><surname>Czertko</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><article-title>A comparison of thrice weekly LAAM and daily methadone in employed heroin addicts</article-title><source>Drug Alcohol Depend</source><year>1981</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>215</fpage><lpage>222</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/0376-8716(81)90064-8</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7327086</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Glanz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Klawansky</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>McAullife</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Chalmers</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><article-title>Methadone vs. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol (LAAM) in the treatment of opiate addiction.
