Accordingly, lifestyle intervention remains the corner stone in the management of T2D. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the optimal intervention programmes in T2D ensuring both compliance as well as long-term health outcomes. Our objective is to assess the effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention (the U-TURN intervention) on glycaemic control in patients with T2D. Our hypothesis is that intensive lifestyle changes are equally effective as standard diabetes care, including pharmacological treatment in maintaining glycaemic control (ie, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)) in patients with T2D. Furthermore, we expect that intensive lifestyle changes will decrease the need for antidiabetic medications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study is an assessor-blinded, parallel group and a 1-year randomised trial. The primary outcome is change in glycaemic control (HbA1c), with the key secondary outcome being reductions in antidiabetic medication. Participants will be patients with T2D (T2D duration &#x0003c;10&#x02005;years) without complications who are randomised into an intensive lifestyle intervention (U-TURN) or a standard care intervention in a 2:1 fashion. Both groups will be exposed to the same standardised, blinded, target-driven pharmacological treatment and can thus maintain, increase, reduce or discontinue the pharmacological treatment. The decision is based on the standardised algorithm. The U-TURN intervention consists of increased training and basal physical activity level, and an antidiabetic diet including an intended weight loss. The standard care group as well as the U-TURN group is offered individual diabetes management counselling on top of the pharmacological treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been approved by the Scientific Ethical Committee at the Capital Region of Denmark (H-1&#x02013;2014&#x02013;114). Positive, negative or inconclusive findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, at national and international conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT02417012.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2</kwd><kwd>Risk reduction behaviour</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Drug therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The clinical care of type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires multifactorial intervention, including the pharmacological regulation of hyperglycaemia, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia to minimise T2D complications.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> Polypharmacy is often accompanied by an increased risk of adverse medication effects, a decreased quality of life and economical costs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, the strategies of lifestyle interventions are equally efficient in maintaining glycaemic control as the pharmacological treatment is well warranted.</p><p>Lifestyle changes, such as healthy diet and increased physical activity, are established cornerstones in diabetes management.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> In addition to the beneficial effects on glycaemic control, improved physical activity and training are also likely to improve mental and physical well-being as well as reducing stress and distress in adults.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Only one study has studied the effects of lifestyle-driven weight loss in patients with T2D (the Look AHEAD trial). These reports indicate that short and long-term reductions in antidiabetic, lipid lowering and antihypertensive medication can be achieved with a weight-loss intervention in patients with T2D.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, the weight loss was partially obtained by pharmacological treatment. Moreover, the pharmacological treatment was not standardised between the intervention and the control group, and the hypoglycaemic treatment was initially performed by the study physicians in the intervention group only.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Accordingly, it is difficult to interpret to what extent healthy lifestyle changes (diet, aerobic and strength conditioning as well as decreased physical inactivity) per se can be used as a treatment for T2D as a substitute for the pharmacological treatment without compromising glycaemic control and metabolic health. Thus, studies of the effect of the U-TURN lifestyle intervention on the need for clinical T2D care alongside the effect on glycaemic control are needed in order to implement an intensive lifestyle treatment in clinical care.</p><p>A decade after the cessation of the predefined trial period in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, significant reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction and improved mortality were observed in newly diagnosed patients with T2D allocated to early and aggressive glucose lowering treatment.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It was then proposed that intensifying glycaemic control in patients with T2D with short T2D duration could be beneficial in reducing macrovascular and microvascular complications, whereas it had no effect or no adverse effects on patients with severe long-standing T2D.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Thus, it could be speculated that an intensive lifestyle intervention could prove to be more efficient in patients with T2D with shorter disease duration.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Study objective and hypothesis</title><p>The objective of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of the U-TURN lifestyle intervention in a sample of patients with short duration of T2D. We hypothesise that the U-TURN intervention would be comparable with the conventional multifactorial care in maintaining glycaemic control, while reducing the need for antidiabetic medications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design and study setting</title><p>The study is a parallel-arm, single-blinded, randomised clinical equivalence trial where the primary end point is glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) monitored across 12&#x02005;months.

In addition, resistance training is recommended three times per week at moderate to vigorous intensity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, as evidence suggests, a greater reduction in HbA1c levels occurs with more than 150&#x02005;min of structured training per week compared with 150&#x02005;min of structured training per week or less.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The training volume in the intervention will aim for 240&#x02013;420&#x02005;min training/week. During phase 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009764F2">figure 2</xref>), the participants will complete four aerobic training sessions per week of 45&#x02013;60&#x02005;min duration. Additionally, two combined training sessions consisting of aerobic and resistance training are included. The aerobic part of the training session will have a time duration of 30&#x02013;35&#x02005;min and the resistance part will be of 30&#x02005;min duration. In phase 3, the participants will complete two aerobic training sessions and three combined training sessions. The duration span of the aerobic training will be maintained in phase 3. Once a week the training session will take place outside whereas all the other training sessions will take place in a fitness centre. The training will be structured, with supervision across the entire project period as evidence supports the beneficial effect of structured training on improving glycaemic control in patients with T2D.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The supervision is reduced across the intervention period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009764F2">figure 2</xref>) and is supported with online supervision of the participants&#x02019; self-reported and objective training data.</p><p>All training is performed in groups of 4&#x02013;8 participants. The groups are composed based on the geographical location of the participants&#x02019; home address. Each group will be assigned at least two certified coaches (minimum one physiotherapist) with one trainer being present at a supervised training session. Each week, a training programme is delivered from the intervention coordination centre to the coaches. An example of a weekly training programme sent to the coaches is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009764TB1">table 1</xref>. This will contain the overall distribution of aerobic and resistance training as well as the detailed programming. In the programme, the aerobic training is described, including the duration and intensity. Furthermore, the resistance training is described with muscle groups, sets and repetitions so that participants from across all groups follow the same training programme. The training modality within the aerobic training (eg, power walking and cycling) and resistance training (eg, machines and bodyweight) is the only factor that may vary between groups. The modality is decided by the trainers in order to prevent and minimise the frequency and severity of injuries. No running is permitted during phase 1. An example of a training programme is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009764TB1">table 1</xref>.

Self-monitoring is central to this process and includes paying deliberate attention to one's own actions as well as conditions under which these occur. In a review of 22 studies focusing on self-monitoring of diet, training or physical activity, Burke <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> found that more frequent self-monitoring was significantly and consistently associated with larger weight loss.</p><p>The U-TURN lifestyle intervention will entail a self-monitoring component, which is based on subjective evaluation on a daily basis. A simple questionnaire-containing eight inquiries regarding the intervention components and personal development is emailed to the participants every day. The participants rate the statements on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 is non-compliant and 10 is highly compliant). They rate the components of training (ability to follow training programme), daily physical activity (ability to comply with the physical activity goal&#x02014;10&#x02005;000 steps/day), diet (ability to follow the diet plan), sleep (sleep duration and sleep quality) and personal issues such as stress (perceived level), mood and general motivation. In case the participants&#x02019; score 1 (very low) in any of the items, the participants are asked to indicate the primary reasons for scoring so low. In case of a low score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009764F3">figure 3</xref>) or when a participant repeatedly (three times/week) does not fill out the questionnaire, an email will be sent or a phone call will be made to the participant from the intervention coordination centre once a week. However, if the participant has contacted the coordination centre and informed them about circumstances which do not allow them to fill in the questionnaire (eg, vacation, work, etc) the follow-up procedure is not initiated. The dietician or training coach will follow-up with the participant directly based on the guidelines made by the intervention coordination centre. The self-monitoring serves two primary purposes: (1) to create a heightened awareness in each participant about their daily lifestyle choices in order to increase compliance with intervention guidelines, and (2) to prevent loss to follow-up. In addition, it offers the opportunity to adjust and individualise programmes within the overall framework for higher compliance and to prevent loss to follow-up.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015009764F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>One electronic inquiry with eight (1&#x02013;8 in figure) sub-inquiries is administrated to the participants&#x02019; intervention (U-TURN) and rated on a daily basis.

Thus, based on mixed linear models, our primary model is based on analysis of covariance for continuous end points. The model will include group and sex as fixed effects, with the baseline value of the relevant variable as a covariate. Categorical data for dichotomous end points will be analysed with the use of logistic regression with the same fixed effects and covariates as the respective analysis of covariance.</p><p>Assuming that the data on potential drop-outs are MAR, both linear mixed models and multiple imputation procedures would be applicable to handle missing data.</p><p>While the null hypothesis in a superiority trial is that treatment effects are identical (with H<sub>A</sub> implying that these are not), the null hypothesis for the primary outcome in this trial is defined with reference to an acceptable clinical difference in treatment effects (ie, equivalence margin).<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> As mentioned above, we define the threshold for not &#x02018;too different&#x02019; or not &#x02018;unacceptably worse&#x02019; as a potential difference (95% CI) in HbA1c of&#x000b1;0.4% points. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of the primary analyses, including repeated measures with baseline observation carried forward, and multiple-imputation techniques (with the latter using model based approaches to &#x02018;replace&#x02019; missing data).</p><p>Exploratory analyses of the treatment effects will be performed on the secondary outcomes. The analysis plan will be developed prior to data analysis, and will be performed in parallel independently by two blinded researchers. Group allocation is not disclosed before consensus about the interpretation of the data is reached. In essence, the information about treatment and the N is concealed until consensus is reached. Discrepancies in the analysis outcome between the researchers will be resolved using a blinded third party statistician.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The U-TURN study is expected to provide evidence that lifestyle change (without use of weight loss enhancing pharmacological additives as a part of the treatment) is equally effective in treating T2D as the recommended multicomponent care. Furthermore, the study will provide valuable insights into motivational mediators and moderators for adherence to intensive lifestyle treatment. Although intensive, the intervention contains components which can be directly included in the rehabilitation of the patients with T2D and thus, it might have a broad appeal. If the intervention is effective in maintaining glycaemic control and reduces the need for antidiabetic pharmacological care, it will provide an alternative to the current standard care and thus decrease some of the side effects induced by the medications used in standard clinical care.</p><p>The study is unique as the methodology is stringent and systematic, thus providing scientifically viable data. A major strength of the study is the blinding of assessors and participants at the baseline assessment, and the assessor and endocrinologist blinding at all follow-up assessments thereby limiting the risk of bias. It is not possible to blind the participants during follow-up in this type of trial, which could introduce a bias. The inclusion of predefined medications used in the pharmacological care (ie, not all combinations and medications are considered) limits the interpretation to patients receiving these combinations. As the choice of medications in the study is in line with the recommended first line-treatments,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> the observations made in this study will still apply to a large number of patients. Furthermore, the inclusion of self-reported physical activity and adherence pose a potential information bias, limiting the interpretation of the effects of the single intervention components on HbA1c.</p><p>The U-TURN study is initiated with a 6-week prerandomisation open label run-in period for all participants, in which the medical treatment is adjusted according to the treatment algorithm used in the study. This is done in order to adjust for differences in prestudy medication due to either non-compliance or insufficient prescriptions (too little or too much medication) and to have a uniform status of medication at baseline. A titration period of 6&#x02005;weeks is chosen to ensure steady state of new prescribed medication before allocation. In order to dissect the combined effect of medication and intervention in contrast to medication alone, we aim for homogenous pharmacological treatment and reliable estimates of adherence. This is done by a clear pharmaceutical treatment algorithm and administering of an interview every third month focusing on adherence to medication. The study is designed as a treat-to-target study aiming at specific goals for glycaemic control, blood pressure and lipids. This implies intensification or decrease in medical treatment according to clinical data (HbA1c, glucose measurements, blood pressure and lipids). We are aware that regulation of medication prior to allocation and during the study period may have a &#x02018;carry-over effect&#x02019; affecting the following measurements. Hence, a 3-month period between follow-ups is chosen as this should be sufficient time to obtain sustained effect of medical regulation. Also tapering of medication is done gradually to ensure that any improvement in clinical outcome is sustained even after withdrawal of medication.</p><p>The study will be conducted according to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration II.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Prior to inclusion, all participants received written and oral information about the study and provided written as well as oral informed consent. The participants can discontinue participation in the full study or part of the study at all times with no obligation to provide a reason. This will not have any consequences for their future treatment. If discontinued, the participants will receive the standard T2D care according to the Danish clinical guidelines; however, this will be delivered by their own GP.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Medical regulation will be performed by experienced endocrinologists throughout the study in accordance with the predefined algorithms and strict safety criteria, and registration of adverse outcomes is employed. Thus, the study is expected to result in limited risks, adverse effects and discomfort to the participants. The results are to be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Negative, positive and inconclusive results will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed scientific journals at national and international conferences. Access to data can be granted on approval for a formal request to the steering committee.</p><p>All participants will be provided with their results. Postrandomisation, all participants are ascribed a unique personal identifier to anonymise the data. Thus, no participant identifying information is stored alongside study data. A transfer key (ID to personal information) is available, but is encrypted and stored separately from the trial data. After trial cession all data are anonymised and stored on the server of Copenhagen University Hospital. Additional biological materials are stored in a research bio-bank for up to 20&#x02005;years.</p><p>As far as we are aware, the U-TURN study is the first study to investigate if lifestyle intervention is effective in maintaining glycaemic control while aiming at discontinuing pharmacological care in patients with T2D. The results from this trial are of great importance for clinical care of T2D and can provide important knowledge on how to implement and conduct treatments using the lifestyle changes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MR-L, RC, KBH and KK drafted the manuscript.
