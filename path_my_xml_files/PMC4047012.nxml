This study explored the acceptability and feasibility of procedures for a trial and for an intervention, including its potential costs, to inform a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a nurse-led personalised care intervention for primary care CHD patients with current chest pain and probable depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Multi-centre, outcome assessor-blinded, randomized parallel group study. CHD patients reporting chest pain and scoring 8 or more on the HADS were randomized to personalized care (PC) or treatment as usual (TAU) for 6 months and followed for 1 year. Primary outcome was acceptability and feasibility of procedures; secondary outcomes included mood, chest pain, functional status, well being and psychological process variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p>1001 people from 17 General Practice CHD registers in South London consented to be contacted; out of 126 who were potentially eligible, 81 (35% female, mean age&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;65 SD11 years) were randomized. PC participants (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;41) identified wide ranging problems to work on with nurse-case managers. Good acceptability and feasibility was indicated by low attrition (9%), high engagement and minimal nurse time used (mean/SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;78/19 mins assessment, 125/91 mins telephone follow up). Both groups improved on all outcomes. The largest between group difference was in the proportion no longer reporting chest pain (PC 37% <italic>vs</italic> TAU 18%; mixed effects model OR 2.21 95% CI 0.69, 7.03). Some evidence was seen that self efficacy (mean scale increase of 2.5 <italic>vs</italic> 0.9) and illness perceptions (mean scale increase of 7.8 <italic>vs</italic> 2.5) had improved in PC <italic>vs</italic> TAU participants at 1 year.

Depression increases the incidence of coronary symptoms and death in CHD patients<xref rid="pone.0098704-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Established depression treatments (antidepressants and psychotherapies) have only a moderate effect on improving mood and reducing cardiac events but no effect on mortality<xref rid="pone.0098704-Rutledge1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. More complex systems approaches, such as collaborative care, may be more successful<xref rid="pone.0098704-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Collaborative care involves structured management plans, scheduled follow-ups and enhanced inter-professional working, i.e. case manager/practice nurse, primary care practitioner and mental health specialist working together <xref rid="pone.0098704-Katon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and has been shown to improve indirect cardiac outcomes such as disease control and 10-year cardiovascular disease risk as well as depression<xref rid="pone.0098704-Katon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098704-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> in people with CHD and/or diabetes.</p><p>The above trials were conducted in the USA<xref rid="pone.0098704-Katon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and Australia<xref rid="pone.0098704-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>where healthcare systems differ from the NHS, in particular, there is less interprofessional working<xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The UPBEAT-UK programme of research<xref rid="pone.0098704-Tylee1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to explore the relationship between CHD and depression and to develop a new intervention feasible for use in UK primary care.</p><p>The intervention examined in this pilot study was developed in line with accepted guidance that interventions for health improvement should be informed by evidence and based on a theory of how they cause change &#x0201c;so that weak links in the causal chain can be identified and strengthened&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0098704-1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Using guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions<xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, we conducted and published a systematic review<xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and qualitative research with patients<xref rid="pone.0098704-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and primary care staff<xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> to develop a novel intervention. We used iterative literature review to synthesise our empirical work and to identify evidence and theory to inform the intervention, which was modified following a patient focus group; this process has been reported<xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, our development studies were consistent in indicating that there is wide variation in the problems that depressed people with CHD report as contributing to their low mood, but that social problems are very common and that primary care staff are unsure how to manage them. Another key finding was that GPs reported having no time to deliver depression interventions; this was similarly the case for practice nurses, who also reported a lack of confidence in depression management<xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It was clear from these findings that the UPBEAT intervention needed to be tailored to individual need, brief to deliver and compatible with current practice.</p><p>An established component of chronic disease management in primary care is the provision of self management support; this means enabling patients to take better care of themselves, for instance by providing information and helping them to change unhealthy behaviours. Our literature review showed that accepted health psychology models agree on two factors important for behaviour change: belief in the importance of an outcome and belief in capacity to succeed (self efficacy)<xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; we therefore incorporated established behaviour change techniques, such as goal setting and action planning, which aim to enhance the patient's self efficacy to achieve their desired outcomes.</p><p>In line with our aim to develop an intervention feasible for UK primary care, our intervention is designed to enhance usual care. Practice nurses are already responsible for supporting CHD patients' self management and have been found to be effective case managers in the treatment of chronic depression<xref rid="pone.0098704-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In our intervention, the practice nurse helps the patient to identify problems important to them and then draws on a &#x02018;tool box&#x02019; of techniques to help the patient address these problems. The nurse also sign posts the patient to relevant existing sources of help and makes referrals to other agencies where appropriate. Hence the practice nurses, acting as case managers, deliver care that is more holistic than that currently provided.</p><p>Our findings of uncertainty around the needs of depressed CHD patients and lack of confidence in managing them led us to conduct a pilot study, in which the intervention was delivered by nurse researchers, that would inform the best methods for a definitive RCT<xref rid="pone.0098704-Tylee1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We knew, from our cross-sectional analyses of the UPBEAT cohort study <xref rid="pone.0098704-Walters1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, that CHD patients have high levels of co-morbidity and that for some patients on GP CHD registers any cardiac event would have been several years previously; we therefore only recruited those patients with symptomatic CHD (i.e. reporting current chest pain) in order to ensure that they would understand the intervention in terms of their heart disease. The current study therefore explored the acceptability and feasibility of procedures for a trial and for the intervention, including its potential costs, to inform a definitive RCT of a novel, practice nurse-led personalised care intervention for CHD patients who have at least probable depression and current chest pain.</p><p>To this end, we examined: a) the rate of participant recruitment and reasons for non-participation; b) research procedures including randomization, blinding and data collection; c) the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention; d) potential costs of the intervention; and e) the appropriateness of primary outcome and secondary outcome measures in relation to patients' reported problems. Mediator analyses were conducted to identify trends between the groups in changes in self efficacy and illness beliefs and the impact of these on depression outcomes and to determine whether therapist effects or intervention intensity (nurse time) are likely to be important.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098704.s006">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098704.s007">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was reviewed and approved by the South East London Research Ethics Committee (REC Ref no: 10/H0808/5).

In this and the published protocol <xref rid="pone.0098704-Walters1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, one aim was to explore potential primary outcomes, we focused on depression as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). In this report, since we also had collected another measure of depression - the PHQ-9 (as per protocol), we also explored this as a primary outcome as a further examination of the appropriateness of the HADS as a primary outcome for a future trial. In addition, during the pilot study the intervention group participants identified pain as an important problem contributing to their depression; in this report, we therefore also examined our measure of chest pain as a potential primary outcome. In our original protocol, we referred to our intervention as &#x02018;case management&#x02019;, however following our intervention development process, summarized here and reported in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0098704-1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, the term &#x02018;personalised care&#x02019; was considered more appropriate. Finally, our original protocol does not detail the specific analysis plan reported here. All data will be deposited in an accessible archive at King's College London.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study setting</title><p>Practices in South London were recruited via the Greater London Primary Care Research Network (PCRN-GL). To be included, the practice had to keep a register of patients with CHD for the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)<xref rid="pone.0098704-Centre1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and be willing to liaise over patients in the PC arm when necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Participants</title><p>Adults with symptomatic CHD (registered on GP CHD QOF register and reporting chest pain), reporting depression symptoms were eligible. All patients on practice case registers for CHD were asked by their GP for consent to contact from a researcher. Those consenting were contacted by a researcher and assessed for depressive symptoms using the PHQ-2<xref rid="pone.0098704-Kroenke1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and for symptoms of current chest pain using the Modified Rose Angina Questionnaire<xref rid="pone.0098704-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Patients scoring 3 or more on the PHQ-2 (i.e. a score of 3 is considered the optimal cut point for depression screening and which indicates further screening is necessary), and who reported current chest pain were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)<xref rid="pone.0098704-Zigmond1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. If they scored &#x02265;8 on the depression scale of HADS (HADS-D)(i.e. the score validated to indicate probable depression caseness) they were eligible to participate. Patients who were temporary registrants, actively suicidal, suffering from psychotic depression, non-English speaking or currently hospitalised were excluded. Other physical and mental co-morbidities were allowed. Participants were recruited between October 2010 and June 2011.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Intervention: Personalised care (PC)</title><p>Full details have been reported<xref rid="pone.0098704-Barley2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In brief, the nurse acting as case manager conducts a standardised, face to face, bio-psychosocial assessment (including physical and mental health, difficulties with current treatment regimens, problems with daily activities and social problems). Patients are then helped to identify up to three problems which they consider contribute to their depression and which they most want to address. The nurse-case managers provide information, sign-post patients to existing resources (e.g. leisure centres, social clubs, Improving Access to Psychological Therapy (IAPT) services) and use evidence based behaviour change techniques to help patients set and achieve goals. The underlying intention of the intervention is to increase the patient's self-efficacy to achieve their desired goals (as opposed to goals determined by others such as symptom management or reduction of cardiac risk factors).</p><p>Details of the assessment and action plan are recorded in a &#x02018;personalised health plan&#x02019; which the patient holds. Follow up interviews to determine progress and/or set new goals are conducted via telephone. Calls are planned to last 15 minutes and are scheduled weekly initially then at increasing intervals according to patient need. During the 6 month intervention period weekly meetings were held with research team clinicians (a GP academic (AT) and two psychiatrists (AM, PW) to ensure fidelity to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Control: treatment as usual (TAU)</title><p>All patients received primary care TAU from their GP and/or Practice Nurse (PN); this may include specific depression intervention such as antidepressant prescription or referral to talking therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Measurement</title><p>Data were collected face to face at baseline and via telephone at 1, 6 and 12 months post randomisation.

Economic costs were calculated from a healthcare plus informal care perspective. PC costs included the time spent by practice nurses with patients in face-to-face assessments and subsequent telephone reviews.

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of the sample and the acceptability and feasibility data.</p><p>We developed a single statistical model to estimate the difference in mean scores between participants randomised to PC and TAU across the three follow-up points (one, six and twelve months). A linear mixed effect model for longitudinal data (random intercept model) was used to estimate (using maximum likelihood) the difference between treatment arms in scores at 1, 6 and 12 months overall. The assumption of normality for the residuals was checked visually from probability plots. The pre-specified covariates that were included in the model consisted of the baseline outcome score and the randomisation group. Time was included to estimate the time trends over the whole sample. An interaction between time and intervention was also examined for evidence of a differential effect over time. All tests of hypotheses were two-tailed and associated 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) are reported; due to the exploratory nature of the analysis, p-values are reported for the preliminary primary outcome (HADS-D) only.</p><p>The median number of responders (&#x02265;50% decrease in score from baseline at follow up) and remitters (score &#x0003c;8 at follow up) according to the HADS-D score was compared between groups using chi-square tests. We compared mean scores for self efficacy and illness perceptions between groups using independent two-sample t-tests. We controlled for the effects of self efficacy and illness perceptions on changes in depression severity using a linear mixed effect model for longitudinal data (random intercept model) to estimate (using maximum likelihood) the difference between treatment arms. We repeated these analyses to explore nurse (therapist) effects.</p><p>We used multiple regression analysis to estimate mean differences in costs and QALYs. Baseline and follow-up data were used as the dependent variables and the group identifier as an independent variable. The models for follow-up costs and QALYs were adjusted for baseline costs and utility scores. Cost-effectiveness comparisons were made using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and the net benefit (NB) approach. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated by dividing the difference in mean total costs between the PC and TAU groups by the difference in mean QALYs. Net Benefit from the intervention to society was defined as the product of the willingness-to-pay for a QALY (within a range of &#x000a3;0 to &#x000a3;60,000) and the actual QALY gain minus the service costs (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0098704.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula>). Net benefits were then compared between the PC and TAU groups for each willingness-to-pay value. Missing utilities at follow-up were imputed using the last value carried forward (LVCF) method<xref rid="pone.0098704-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>To account for the highly skewed distribution of the cost data, the non-parametric bootstrap method was used to make cost comparisons between the two groups<xref rid="pone.0098704-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Bootstrapping involved repeatedly estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to account for the uncertainty surrounding the estimates of costs and benefits. Likewise, estimates of the proportion of iterations in which the intervention of interest had the maximum expected net benefit (NB), or equivalently, a positive incremental net benefit (INB) was determined for a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds. The estimates were produced by repeatedly sampling with replacement (1000 times) from the existing pilot study population<xref rid="pone.0098704-Fenwick1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The results of the bootstrap analyses were plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane (CEP) and used to estimate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). CEACs show the probability that each of the treatment options is optimal, subject to a range of ceiling ratios, which represent the maximum amount society would pay for a one unit improvement in QALYs<xref rid="pone.0098704-Fenwick1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>17 practices were approached by the Greater London Primary Care Research Network (PCRN) and agreed to participate. Practices were recruited between October 2010 and June 2011; practice recruitment was therefore completed in considerably less than the 12 months planned in the study proposal indicating that recruitment of practices for a definitive trial would be feasible. Data collection was completed by July 2012.</p><p>Participant recruitment is detailed elsewhere<xref rid="pone.0098704-Tylee2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In summary, 3325 persons on the 17 GP CHD registers, 1001 consented to be contacted. 126 were eligible for assessment (PHQ2 score &#x02265;3 and reporting current chest pain). Of the 126, 40 had a HADS score 8, 2 had experienced hallucinations, 2 had no current chest pain and 1 did not have sufficient English. Following interview, 81 were found to be eligible, consented and randomised (41 to PC, 40 to TAU). Recruitment of patients for a definitive RCT therefore seems promising.</p><p>Fifty-two male and 29 female patients were enrolled. Ages ranged 38 to 95 years (mean 65 <italic>SD</italic>11), 83% were white. Forty-eight participants reported having ever been diagnosed with depression (21/41&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;51% PC, 27/40&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;67% TAU) of these 12 had had one episode, 7 had had two episodes, 4 had had three episodes, and 23 reported having had 4 or more episodes (data on number of episodes were missing for 2 participants). Forty-six participants had previously received treatment for depression; of these 41 had taken antidepressants and 29 had had talking therapy. Eighteen reported having received other treatment such as &#x02018;anger management&#x02019;, seeing a psychiatrist, ECT, inpatient psychiatric care and relaxation and assertiveness courses. Our participants therefore represent a chronic and severe group.</p><p>Twenty-four participants reported that they were currently receiving treatment for depression (9 in PC, 22%, 15 in TAU, 38%). According to the medical notes data, 13 in PC (32%) and 17 in TAU (43%) were taking some form of antidepressant medication at baseline. Despite being prescribed antidepressants, these participants were still reporting depressive symptoms. Nineteen participants reported their current episode had lasted more than 12 months, 2 said it had lasted between 6 and 12 months, and 3 said it had lasted less than 6 months.</p><p>Mean baseline HADS-D scores (PC 12, <italic>SD</italic>3; TAU 11, <italic>SD</italic>3) indicated moderate depression and mean PHQ9 scores (PC 16, <italic>SD</italic>5; TAU 15, <italic>SD</italic>6) indicated moderately severe depression in both groups. At baseline, according to the HADS-D, 21 (51%) participants in the PC group could be considered mild, 14 (34%) moderate, 6 (15%) severe; in the TAU group there were 19 (47%) mild, 15 (37%) moderate, 6 (15.0%) severe. For the PHQ9, 3 (7%) were mild, 10 (24%) moderate, 14 (34%) moderately severe, 12 (29%) severe in the PC group and 8 (20%) were mild, 8 (20%) moderate, 14 (35%) moderately severe, 9 (22%) severe in the TAU group. The correlation between baseline HADS D and PHQ9 was r &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.48.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics of intervention (PC) and control (TAU) groups</title><p>Participants in each group had similar mean age, mean years in education and mean BMI score compared. The PC group had more males, people of non-white ethnicity and people in paid employment compared to the TAU group. The TAU group had more females, more non-drinkers and more people in this group lived alone compared to the PC group. Those randomised to PC had marginally greater IMD scores than those in the TAU group indicating slightly higher levels of deprivation. However differences between the groups appeared small. Due to an oversight, 3 patients who were ineligible due to no current chest pain were randomised in error (2 in the PC group). Based on the intention to treat principle these were included in all analyses; a sensitivity analysis found that our conclusions were unaffected when these patients were omitted from the analyses. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0098704-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the baseline demographic and lifestyle data by group and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0098704-t002">Table 2</xref> shows baseline scores for all outcome measures by group.

The BIPQ had the most missing scores, with 14% missing at 6 months. At one or more assessment points, between 5% and 10% of scores were missing for the General Self Efficacy Scale, the BIPQ (items 3 and 4), the WEMWBS; all other measures had fewer than 5% of scores missing at any time.

The PC intervention was aimed at tackling the problems that each participant felt were important rather than addressing specific cardiac risk factors as has been tested in other trials, however it appears that patients consider CHD-related lifestyle factors to contribute to their depression, so inclusion of a measure of these factors should be considered for a definitive trial of PC.

The nurse-case managers contacted the GP or PN of the majority of PC group participants; however they reported difficulties: several telephone attempts needed, lack of response to emails, and even when contact was made, guideline informed treatment was not necessarily delivered (e.g. due to anxiety concerning multi-pharmacy and IAPT services being unavailable in some areas). Difficulties in implementing collaborative working for comorbid problems such as depression and CHD and uncertainties about the best service delivery approaches have been identified by other researchers<xref rid="pone.0098704-Knowles1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In a future trial procedures for delivering guideline informed treatment should be pre-determined and case managers should be embedded within practices to increase interprofessional working (e.g. by having planned times for discussion of cases). In addition, in a future trial, more active treatment of anxiety should be tested. Anxiety is associated with worse depression outcome<xref rid="pone.0098704-Penninx1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>; our participants reported high anxiety levels and we found some evidence of anxiety as a mediator for depression improvement.</p><p>The potential to detect differences between PC and TAU in our pilot study may have been reduced because TAU is itself an active intervention: at baseline 43% of the TAU group versus 32% of the PC group was prescribed antidepressants (according to their medical notes), we were unable to control for this difference in our analyses. It is also possible that TAU may have been intensified during the pilot study: during our qualitative work GPs and PNs reported greater awareness of the problem of co-morbid depression and CHD as a result of participation in our cohort study, the same may apply to participation in our pilot study, although from the medical notes it appeared that the number of mental health consultations were similar for both groups. In a future trial, changes in TAU during the trial should be recorded.</p><p>A PC manual (available from the authors) was produced and, in weekly study group meetings, the multidisciplinary clinical team was satisfied that the intervention was delivered as planned. Nevertheless our findings of potential therapist effects suggest that training in the behaviour change aspects of the intervention is important. However, other studies have shown that nurses and GPs trained in behaviour change techniques may have difficulty applying them<xref rid="pone.0098704-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098704-Noordman1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098704-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Further research into how non-psychologists can be trained to work more psychologically is needed. Implementation of self management support interventions within primary care is known to be problematic<xref rid="pone.0098704-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>; a strength of our intervention compared with that of others<xref rid="pone.0098704-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>is the very short amount of nurse time required and the lack of need for specialist materials to be used or developed.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Potential costs of PC</title><p>There were no great differences in service use and costs between PC and TAU, with the exception of inpatient care, which also accounted for a substantial proportion of total costs. Overall, it appears that PC reduced costs compared with TAU, but produced slightly lower benefits. However, costs may have been underestimated due to reliance on patient self-report in service use, the lack of medication and sick-leave data at all time points and the approach used to quantify informal care. Informal care constitutes a major cost driver in chronically ill populations. In this analysis, the &#x0201c;proxy good method&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0098704-Koopmanschap1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>and the unit cost of home care worker was used to calculate informal care. However, in a future trial, an alternative cost, such as the national minimum wage, could be used to quantify informal care in the context of a sensitivity analysis. A future trial should also test whether a longer time-horizon is needed for this particular patient group to benefit from an intervention of this kind.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have developed an intervention for primary care CHD patients with probable depression and current chest pain. We found that this intervention and our study protocol were feasible and acceptable for an RCT in this population. This pilot study was not powered to detect between group differences over time, but our data suggests that to be more effective case managers should be trained in behaviour change techniques, the intervention should be more focused on delivering guideline informed care, do more to address anxiety and include more intensive follow up. Collaborative working will be more feasible with case managers based within trial practices. The effects of differences in TAU will need to be considered in a future RCT. In addition, careful thought should be given to which primary outcome to use to reflect differences between patients in their desired outcomes, depression outcomes may only improve in the longer term. The UPBEAT personalized care intervention helps patients to address a wide range of problems which are not currently managed in primary care and appears to be cheaper than TAU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0098704.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
