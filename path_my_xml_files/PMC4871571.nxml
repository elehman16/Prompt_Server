Two weeks after the second HIV-MVA vaccination 34 (97%) of the 35 previously vaccinated developed Env-specific binding antibodies, and 79% and 84% displayed IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses to Gag and Env, respectively. Binding antibodies to subtype C Env (included in HIV-DNA and protein boost), subtype B Env (included only in HIV-DNA) and CRF01_AE Env (included only in HIV-MVA) were significantly boosted by the CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations. Functional antibodies detected using an infectious molecular clone virus/peripheral blood mononuclear cell neutralization assay, a pseudovirus/TZM-bl neutralization assay or by assays for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) were not significantly boosted. In contrast, T-cell proliferative responses to subtype B MN antigen and IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses to Env peptides were significantly enhanced. Four volunteers not primed with HIV-DNA and HIV-MVA before the CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations mounted an antibody response, while cell-mediated responses were rare.

Of the six HIV vaccine efficacy trials conducted to date, only one has demonstrated efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In 2009, the RV144 &#x0201c;Thai&#x0201d; trial reported 31.2% protection against HIV infection, with no associated impact on HIV viral load or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count in vaccinated infected individuals. This placebo controlled trial conducted in a low incidence, largely heterosexual population in Thailand randomized 16402 men and women to receive four immunizations with canarypox (ALVAC&#x02013;HIV vCP1521) given twice on its own and then twice more in combination with a monomeric envelope protein (AIDSVAX B/E gp120) in alum [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The modest reduction of acquisition of HIV infection is thought to correlate with non-neutralizing antibodies, most likely associated with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The HIVIS/TaMoVac consortium has optimized the delivery of multisubtype HIV-DNA and HIV-MVA vaccine candidates in a series of trials, and have shown them to be safe and potent T-cell and B-cell immunogens [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The recent TaMoVac 01 trial focussed on the optimization of needle free priming and included 120 healthy men and women in Tanzania. The volunteers were randomized to receive (i) 600 &#x003bc;g or 1000 &#x003bc;g of HIV-DNA as either (ii) pooled or separate Env and Gag encoding plasmid pools intradermally (ID) via the needle free Zetajet device [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There were no vaccine related safety concerns and no significant differences between the groups with respect to the magnitude of IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses or the proportion of individuals who responded (87&#x02013;97%). Similarly, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of binding antibody responses (83&#x02013;97% responders although the titers were low. The simplified regimen offered clear practical and logistical advantages.</p><p>An Env protein gp140 (gp120 plus the external domain of gp41) from a subtype C envelope clone p97CN54 (CN54rgp140) has been given to HIV negative women in Europe, formulated in a vaginal gel in MucoVac1 [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and via the parenteral, nasal and vaginal routes in MucoVac2 [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In MucoVac2, nine women received three immunizations of 100 &#x003bc;g of the CN54rgp140 protein given IM with glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA-AF) over eight weeks, with a subset of five individuals receiving two further immunizations 12&#x02013;24 weeks later. The adjuvant, GLA-AF is a synthetic monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)-like molecule which has shown to be a potent activator of dendritic cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The vaccines were immunogenic when administered parenterally, eliciting systemic specific IgG antibodies in 9/9 (100%) and cervico-vaginal antibodies to CN54rgp140 in 4/9 (44%) vaccine recipients [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The results of the RV144 trial reinvigorated interest in the role of non-neutralizing antibodies and the benefits of combining immunogens such as pox viruses and envelope proteins. The HIVIS/TaMoVac consortium had access to the CN54rgp140 protein formulated in GLA-AF through partnership with the UK HIV Vaccine Consortium and we were keen to assess the impact of additional boosting of TaMoVac 01 vaccinees with this Env protein. We hypothezised that this combination would be more potent than the alum adjuvanted AIDSVAX used in RV144. Vaccinees who had received their first immunization 58 weeks or more and had completed the schedule in the TaMoVac 01 trial were invited to receive two further immunizations with 100 &#x003bc;g CN54rgp140 adjuvanted with 5 &#x003bc;g GLA-AF, four weeks apart to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this combination regimen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review boards of the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS), and the Mbeya Medical Research Ethics Committee.

We were able to conduct the study as an amendment to a phase IIa trial in which healthy Tanzanian volunteers received three immunizations ID with HIV-DNA/placebo followed by two immunizations with HIV-MVA/placebo IM [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Forty volunteers were recruited to receive two additional immunizations with subtype C CN54rgp140 envelope protein adjuvanted with GLA-AF 31&#x02013;70 weeks after the last HIV-MVA/placebo and 39 received both immunizations. The adjuvanted Env protein was well tolerated, except in one patient with pre-existing hypoglycaemia who experienced a clinically asymptomatic, transient aggravation of severe hypoglycaemia. Severe hypoglycaemia related to the CN54rgp140 has not been reported in the previous phase I trials using this protein [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155702.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but has been speculated to be associated with some vaccines, especially in metabolically vulnerable individuals [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus vaccine-induced hypoglycaemia warrants further study in future trials.</p><p>In the current study both humoral and cellular immune responses were boosted by CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations. Systemic binding antibodies to CN54rgp140 increased significantly after each vaccination and reached titers of a median 23400. In the RV144 trial, in which the AIDSVax gp120 Env protein in alum was given twice together with ALVAC after &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; twice with ALVAC alone, the estimated geometric mean antibody titer to gp120 subtype B MN was 31207 and to gp120 subtype E A244 was 14558 [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the present study, binding antibody responses to subtype B gp160 and subtype E gp120 Env proteins were also significantly boosted by the CN54rgp140/GLA-AF protein but only in response to the first and not the second immunization. The effect of the adjuvanted gp140 Env protein on functional antibody responses was, however, disappointing with no detectable impact on IMC/PBMC neutralization or ADCC responses. The DNA and MVA envelope inserts did not match the CN54rgp140 although one DNA envelope plasmid was also subtype C. Optimal prime for CN54rgp140 boost may be a sequence matched envelope insert for DNA and/or MVA. This combination is not available in cGMP vaccine for human use. It is worth noting that the frequency of ADCC-mediating antibody responses in the present TaMoVac 01 trial was lower than reported in our previous phase I HIVIS03 trial where Tanzanian vaccinees received three HIV-DNA immunizations either 1 mg ID or 3.8 mg IM followed by two HIV-MVA vaccinations IM [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The RV144 trial reported modest efficacy. Similar to what is described here, binding antibodies to Env were seen in 98% of individuals [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Extensive post-hoc analyses of the RV144 trial generated two correlates; antibodies to Env V1/V2 scaffolded protein correlated with reduced infection risk, whereas the levels of monomeric IgA Env-specific binding antibodies correlated with increased risk. In the presence of low levels of Env-specific IgA, ADCC-activity was inversely correlated with risk of infection, suggesting that IgA might interfere with protective antibody function, presumed to be mediated via ADCC [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The same Env vaccine (gp120 AIDSVAX B/E) and adjuvant (alum) were used in the VAX003 trial, which reported no efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The authors suggested that the seven repeated relatively high doses of 600 &#x003bc;g of gp120 given in VAX003 in comparison to the four doses given in the RV144 trial may have had some bearing on the different balance in the distribution of antibody isotypes seen, which is assumed to be relevant to protection [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There has been much speculation around whether the co-administration of AIDSVAX B/E and ALVAC canarypox vaccine contributed to the functional antibody responses and this remains a possibility. In the recently completed TaMoVac II phase IIa trial, 198 volunteers in Tanzania and Mozambique have been randomized to receive three ID HIV-DNA immunizations given with or without electroporation followed by two HIV-MVA immunizations given with or without CN54rgp140 protein boosts in a factorial design.</p><p>In the present study there were increases both in the frequency and magnitude of Env-specific IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses and T-cell proliferative responses to AT-2 treated subtype B MN and CRF01_AE CM235 antigen after the CN54rgp140/ GLA-AF boosts. We have previously shown the HIV-DNA and HIV-MVA vaccines to be particularly potent T-cell and B-cell immunogens resulting in strong balanced Gag and Env-specific T-cell responses [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>This study has some limitations. We did not measure antibody responses by isotype, nor antibody responses to scaffolded Env V1/V2 protein, and so opportunities for direct comparison with findings in the RV144 trial are limited. The titer of binding Ab which we observed was in the same range as that reported in the RV144 trial. The antibody avidity was not assessed after recombinant protein boost in this study due to limitations in funding but we know from our previous study that the DNA/MVA regimen could increase the avidity of induced antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0155702.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>There was considerable variation in the time between the last HIV-MVA and the first CN54rgp140 boost (8&#x02013;17 months) but this did not appear to affect immune response results. After two CN54gp140/GLA-AF immunizations, we found a trend towards higher median anti-CN54 rgp140 subtype C titers in vaccinees previously immunized with three HIV-DNA and two HIV-MVA vaccinations (n = 35) compared to the four unprimed vaccinees who had received placebo five times before the CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations (p = 0.07). The findings are inconclusive due to the low number of unprimed vaccinees. The recruitment into this amendment of the protocol was on a first come first serve basis and the number of volunteers having received placebo vaccinations instead of HIV-DNA and HIV-MVA was low. Therefore, only five placebo recipients were recruited and received CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations.</p><p>In conclusion, we report significantly enhanced and broad binding antibody responses, and boosted Env-specific cell-mediated immune responses after two immunizations with a subtype C rgp140 protein adjuvanted in GLA-AF in individuals previously immunized with HIV-DNA and HIV-MVA, but no boosting of functional antibody responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155702.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155702.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155702.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The absolute concentration of CN54rgp140-specific IgG measured at three time points.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155702.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155702.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>A positive correlation between HIV-1 subtype C CN54 anti-gp140 and HIV-1 subtype B IIIB anti-gp160 titers.</title><p>The figure shows findings at A) four weeks after receipt of three HIV-DNA and two HIV-MVA vaccinations, B) four weeks after the first CN54rgp140/GLA-AF boost and C) four weeks after the second CN54rgp140/GLA-AF boost.
