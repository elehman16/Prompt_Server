We are not sure about the systemic absorption and side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of low dosage of intra-articular tranexamic acid injection combined with 2-hour clamp drain in minimally bleeding computer-assisted surgery total knee replacement (CAS-TKR). A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in a total of 48 patients underwent CAS-TKR. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either of a mixed intra-articular solution of tranexamic acid 250 mg with physiologic saline (TXA group), or physiologic saline (control group) and then followed by clamp drain for 2 hours. Postoperative blood loss was measured by three different methods as drainage volume, total hemoglobin loss and calculated total blood loss. Transfusion requirement and postoperative complications were recorded. All patients were screened for deep vein thrombosis and the functional outcomes were evaluated at 6 months after surgery. The mean postoperative drainage volume, total hemoglobin loss and calculated total blood loss in TXA group were 308.8 mL, 2.1 g/dL and 206.3 mL compared to 529.0 mL, 3.0 g/dL and 385.1 mL in the control group (P=0.0003, 0.0005 and &#x0003c;0.0001 respectively). Allogenic blood transfusion was needed for one patient (4.2%) in TXA group and for eight patients (33.3%) in the control group. Postoperative knee scores were not significantly different between groups. No deep vein thrombosis, infection or wound complication was detected in both groups. In this study, low dose intra-articular tranexamic acid injection combined with 2-hour clamping drain was effective for reducing postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirement in CAS-TKR without significant difference in postoperative complications or functional outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>computer assisted surgery</kwd><kwd>total knee replacement</kwd><kwd>intra-articular</kwd><kwd>tranexamic acid</kwd><kwd>blood loss.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transfusion of allogeneic blood components is the major concern in many surgical specialists due to the risk of transfusion-related morbidity; for instance viral infections, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs), and transfusion-associated sepsis (TAS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> In orthopaedics, total knee replacement (TKR) is major surgery in which associates to large amount of blood loss and blood transfusions may be required in particular patients. Even with computer-assisted surgery total knee replacement (CAS-TKR) procedure that, by theoretically, should be reduced blood loss because intramedullary femoral guide was not necessary,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> however, in our experience, we found that blood loss was high up to 1320 mL and require transfusion as 0.41 unit/patient.</p><p>Tranexamic acid (TXA), an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been demonstrated the efficacy to reduce perioperative blood loss and transfusions in orthopaedic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> In TKR, results from meta-analysis confirmed that intravenous tranexamic acid (IV-TXA) application significantly reduce perioperative blood loss by 40&#x02013;50% and proportion of the patients requiring blood transfusion to about 10% when compared to placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> However, disadvantages of IV-TXA method are prolonged high systemic drug level from multiple injections or continuous infusion, and leading to drug-induced systemic thromboembolic events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup></p><p>Recently, intra-articular tranexamic acid (IA-TXA) application in TKR was introduced and has been proved to significantly reduce postoperative blood loss and knee swelling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> However, through our knowledge, the protocol for the IA-TXA application, regarding to the dosage, the need of non-using drain or clamp drain technique, is still not established. Moreover, the amount of TXA used in previous studies was high as 2000&#x02013;3000 mg. Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the plasma concentration of TXA only of 10 mg/L was appropriated for anti-fibrinolytic action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> which was correlated to the concentration 10&#x02013;20 mg/mL in the topical TXA solution in that had been proved in previous clinical studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> Additionally, Kiely <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the drains could be clamped for 2 h without compromising the final clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Therefore, we hypothesized that the concentration of IA-TXA solution only 10 mg/mL combined with 2-hour clamp drain should be or may be sufficient to reduce postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirement. The objective of this randomized study was to evaluate the effect of a very low concentration of IA-TXA solution for reducing blood loss and transfusion in CAS-TKR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants, inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomization</title><p>This was a single-center prospective, non-stratified, triple-blinded, randomized study with 1:1 allocation ratio and prior approval was obtained from our institutional review board.

</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic agent in which helps to decrease blood loss by inhibition of clot degradation through competitive inhibitor of plasminogen activation mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> The result from recent studies demonstrated the advantage of the IA-TXA application to reduce postoperative blood loss and knee swelling associated with the TKR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> In this prospective randomized controlled study, we developed a new method, for decreasing blood loss in CAS-TKR, which combined low dose IA-TXA injection with 2-hour drain clamping and evaluated its efficacy and safety.</p><p>The use of IA-TXA injection has many theoretically and practically advantages. First, local activation of thrombosis and fibrinolysis started during and after surgery while systemic activation of those started when local mediators from the injured limb are released after tourniquet deflation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Therefore the local (intra-articular) and intra-operative application of TXA would be more specific method than systemic (intra-venous) route. Second, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, TXA showed the ability to increase thrombus formation as dose-dependent action and reduce time to occlusion when compared to control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> Thus, using only small amount of TXA in limited knee joint volume to create the high TXA concentration inside knee joint should result in greater thrombus formation and shorter time to occlusion compared to lower tissue level after drug distribution from IV-TXA injection. Third, animal study showed topical delivery of TXA had very low systemic absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> Hence, systemic absorption after IA-TXA method combined with delayed drain release should be lower than those after IV-TXA method resulting in avoiding systemic side effect. And fourth, IA-TXA method was simple, inexpensive and easy to perform (The cost of TXA 1 ampule in our country was about 1 $).</p><p>Previous studies supported the use of TXA as intra-articular agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> In 1997, Akizuki <italic>et al.</italic> used a method combined multiple haemostatic agent, including fibrin glue, carbazochrome sodium sulfonate and TXA, and 30-min. clamp drain in the patients underwent primary cementless TKR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> None of patients required blood transfusion. However, this study was case series study and the pure effect of IA-TXA has not been demonstrated.</p><p>Wong <italic>et al.</italic>, in 2010, compared two topical TXA solutions with different concentration, containing 1.5 g and 3.0 g of TXA in 100 mL of physiologic saline (150 and 300 mg/mL), with a placebo solution in the patients underwent primary TKR. The solution was applied to the open joint surfaces and left in contact with tissue for five min., and then surgical wound was closed without using drain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> The results showed that topical TXA application reduced postoperative bleeding by 20&#x02013;25% and resulted in 16&#x02013;17% higher postoperative Hb values without increasing thromboembolic or other complications. Nevertheless, the authors found that plasma TXA concentration, one hour after tourniquet release, was above than minimum therapeutic concentration and concluded that the effect of their method may be secondary to systemic absorption.</p><p>Ishida <italic>et al.</italic>, in 2011, compared IA-TXA injection, containing 2.0 g of TXA in 20 mL (100 mg/mL), with a placebo solution in the patients underwent primary TKR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> After injection, the drain was clamped for 30 min and followed by gradual release protocol. The results showed IA-TXA injection could reduce postoperative blood loss, by decrease in Hb reduction, and knee joint swelling. However, the authors concluded that, in their study, the total amount of TXA used was not low dose and the true incidence of DVT was not identified due to lack of methods detecting clinically asymptomatic DVT (such as ultrasound or venography).</p><p>The preparation of IA-TXA solution in our study was TXA 250 mg in the 25-mL physiologic saline that equivalent to the concentration of 10 mg/mL. This concentration has been used in routine cardiothoracic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> The 25 mL volume of solution was the amount of solution contained inside the knee joint without leakage. 2-hour clamp drain was appended, to maintain intra-articular drug concentration for allowing sufficient time to create anti-fibrinolytic action from topical application and should also prevent immediate brisk blood loss resulted by increased in the initial blood flow and created temponade effect after tourniquet release without excess morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup></p><p>According to the results of this study, TXA group showed the ability to reduce postoperative blood loss and blood transfusion requirement. The decreasing blood loss effect was as 42% of drainage blood loss (P=0.0003), 30% of total Hb loss (P=0.0005), and 46% of calculated total blood loss (P&#x0003c;0.0001). When compared to control group, proportion of the patients requiring blood transfusion was significantly reduced to only 12.5% (absolute risk reduction of transfusion requirement was 29.1% and number needed to treat (NNT) was 3.42).</p><p>Concerning of any potential factors might affect on perioperative blood loss, subgroup analysis was performed in patients received regional anesthesia and LCS prosthesis. The results were consistent with those seen in all patients&#x02019; analysis. In the patients received regional anesthesia, the mean DBL, THL and CTBL in TXA group (n=23) were 302.6 mL, 2.1 g/dL and 195.5 mL compared to 537.9 mL, 3.0 g/dL and 377.8 mL in the control group (n=21) (P=0.0004, 0.0006 and &#x0003c;0.0001 respectively). In the patients received LCS prosthesis, the mean DBL, THL and CTBL in TXA group (n=19) were 292.6 mL 2.1 g/dL and 201.1 mL compared to 536.8 mL, 3.0 g/dL and 383.0 mL in the control group (n=19) (P=0.0003, 0.0034 and &#x0003c;0.0001 respectively). Moreover, according to systematic review, Macfarlane et al found no difference in perioperative blood loss in patients received general anesthesia versus regional anesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> Additionally, there is still no clear evidence showed the effect of prosthesis design or patella resurfacing on perioperative blood loss. However, with the randomization, the effect of these factors would be controlled equally in each study group.</p><p>Our findings of reducing postoperative blood loss are consistent with the findings of previous studies of IA-TXA application in patients underwent TKR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> Additionally, this present study has been demonstrated the effectiveness of the combined IA-TXA injection with 2-hours clamp drain method in the aspect of decreasing postoperative transfusion requirement. Our study are also comparable with the results of previous meta-analyses of the IV-TXA application in patients underwent TKR which demonstrated a reduction of proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion (summary odds ratio 0.10, 95% confidence interval 0.06-0.18: P&#x0003c;0.00001) when compared with patients who received placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, the amount of TXA use in our intra-articular method was much less than those in previous studies (at least 6 to 12 times).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Because of this very low TXA amount use and expected very low systemic absorption in intra-articular application, therefore it could be implied that the therapeutic effect of IA-TXA in our study should be local effect in surgical wound.</p><p>Although clamp drain had theoretical advantages as prevention of immediate blood loss and promoting blood clot formation from temponade effect, but the results of clamp drain were controversial among literature. One previous study in CAS-TKR with 1-hour clamp drain found no significant difference in drainage blood loss while another study in conventional TKR with 1-hour clamp drain found significant reduced postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> Thus, it implies that IA-TXA method should add on the clamp drain effect in TXA group to increase thrombus formation and prolong clot lysis resulting in less total blood loss and blood transfusion when compared to control group which had only clamp drain effect. Moreover, this add-on effect should also be temporary effect, explained by a significant DBLR reduction in TXA group in only first 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Our findings of thromboembolic or wound complication and postoperative knee function were comparable with those in previous IA-TXA study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> This very low incidence of thromboembolic manifestation, detected by duplex doppler ultrasound, may be explained by small population size and the decreasing emboli effect related to CAS-TKR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup></p><p>The present study had some limitations. First, the study population was limited to patients underwent CAS-TKR, therefore the result might be different with conventional TKR. Second, though there was shown positive result for decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirement but it needed more study population to find any possible complication.</p><p>In conclusion, low dose IA-TXA injection, as only 250 mg of TXA, combined with 2-hour clamp drain in patients undergoing CAS-TKR was one interesting option in reducing postoperative blood loss by 40&#x02013;46% and proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion to 13% as compared to placebo. Its application was simple, inexpensive, easy to perform, and effective as compared to previous IA-TXA or IV-TXA method without any significant thromboembolic or other complications. The further research was required for the effectiveness in conventional total knee replacement.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments:</title><p>the authors are thankful to Department of Orthopaedics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi hospital, Mahidol University for all of the kindly help and permission to carry out this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vamvakas</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name><name><surname>Blajchman</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Transfusion-related mortality: the ongoing risks of allogeneic blood transfusion and the available strategies for their prevention</article-title><source>Blood</source><year>2009</year><volume>113</volume><fpage>3406</fpage><lpage>17</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19188662</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Conteduca</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Massai</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Iorio</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Blood loss in computer-assisted mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty.
