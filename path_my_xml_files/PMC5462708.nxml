exercise on cardiopulmonary function in chronic stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods]
Twenty participants (age, 62.7 &#x000b1; 7.3&#x02005;years; height, 163.3 &#x000b1; 8.5&#x02005;cm; weight, 68.8 &#x000b1;
10.3&#x02005;kg) were recruited for this study, and randomly allocated to the modified Pilates
exercise group (n=10) or the control group (n=10). Graded submaximal treadmill exercise
test was used to examine the status of patients&#x02019; cardiopulmonary function, based on
maximal oxygen intake, at the end of a patient&#x02019;s exercise tolerance limit. [Results] The
resting heart rates, maximal oxygen intake, and maximal oxygen intake per kilogram were
significantly different after 8 weeks of modified Pilates exercise. In addition, these
variables were also significantly different between the Pilates and control groups after 8
weeks. [Conclusion] This study has demonstrated that 8 weeks of modified Pilates exercise
program can have a positive influence on patients with chronic stroke, potentially by
enhancing the cardiopulmonary function, which may have positive implications for
increasing their functional ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cardiopulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Pilates exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>One in two stroke survivors have reduced physical activities due to hemiplegia following
the onset of stroke<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reduced respiratory
functions due to hemiplegia can lead to reduced endurance, and increased risk of dyspnea and
stroke relapse<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reduced balance and
hemiplegia, which characteristically result from stroke, cause the body alignment to become
asymmetrical due to the difference between the paralyzed side and non-paralyzed sides. This
causes a bias of in the pressure center toward one side, and consequently, always exposes
the patient to a risk of fallings<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Compensatory movements occur in various parts of the body in hemiplegic patients, causing
them to consume more energy than normal persons do. These patients eventually lose physical
independence, and experience a reduction in their gait and balance abilities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. This eventually leads to reduced physical
activity, and subsequently, reduced respiratory function<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reduced respiratory
functions further compromises physical activity by increasing energy expenditure to account
for 55&#x02013;100% of the energy consumed during normal walking<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Without sufficient strength to perform physical activities,
respiratory functions weaken over time, and the risk of cardiovascular disorders increases
in a vicious cycle. Therefore, interventions that promote functional and cardiovascular
recoveries must be developed to help patients restore their physical activities<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, in addition to physical training that can
strengthen their respiratory muscles and improve respiratory functions. Breathing increases
one&#x02019;s level of concentration, and relaxes and stretches stiff muscles to increase their lung
capacity. Breathing also prepares the body to perform movements in the best condition
possible<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, most types of exercise do not involve conscious
breathing. Pilates is a whole-body exercise that involves continuous breathing practice
through which a patient can connect his/her spiritual with physical self, and improve
his/her body alignment and balance.</p><p>Regarding cardiovascular responses during exercise, blood supply should be adequately
distributed to exercising muscles to maintain body homeostasis, and heat generated from
muscle contraction should be dispersed and adequately supplied to the heart and blood.
Respiratory functions can be functionally improved by trainings<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with stroke should improve their respiratory
functions through high intensity aerobic exercise to prevent and recover from functional
loss of respiratory muscles and reduced endurance<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Interventions involving exercises such as leg cycle ergometry,
treadmill training, and combined upper- and lower-limb ergometry have beneficial
cardiovascular effects on patients with acute and chronic stroke<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, these interventions focus on improving patients&#x02019; gait and balance abilities,
rather than their respiratory functions<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the included exercises do not reach the target intensity of 70%
of heart rate reserve (HRR), which is recommended by the American Heart Association to
prevent decline in physical functional health of a patient<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Chang et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> have recently reported
that robot-assisted gait training significantly improves the maximal oxygen consumption, but
has limited intensity settings. In addition, they reported that treadmill gait training
improved the abilities of both gas transport in the cardiovascular system and gas exchange
by the lungs<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. They further demonstrated
that this training is expected to positively affect the maximal oxygen consumption, which is
a marker of these two factors. Nevertheless, further clinical reports on this training
method are needed.</p><p>Therefore, the present study sought to investigate the effects of Pilates training on
respiration, balance, and gait functions of patients with chronic stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study targeted 20 stroke patients in a rehabilitation center for the disabled (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of subjects (n=20)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PG (n=10)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG (n=10)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 males/4 females</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 males/5 females</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.2 (7.9)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.1 (6.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.5 (10.4)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.0 (10.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.6 (7.7)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.9 (9.2)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>PG: Pilates exercise group; CG: Control group.

more than 2&#x02005;years previously, had a stroke for the first time, and had no cognitive
disorders with more than 24 cores of MMSE (mini mental state examination) &#x02212; K (Korean),
those who could communicate, those who had no apraxia or hemi-neglect, and those who could
walk at least for more than 10 minutes were selected. Patients who had a cardiac disorder,
uncontrollable high blood pressure and pain, orthopedic problems, such as fracture on the
pelvic limb or traumatic damage of peripheral nerves, and a visual impairment, visual field
defects, or hearing impairments were excluded. Subjects provided written informed consent
after receiving detailed information regarding the requirements and purpose of this study.
This study was conducted with approval of the Korea National Sport University.</p><p>This study was designed as a randomized, controlled trial. After pretesting, 20
participants were randomized into an experimental group (n=10) and control group (n=10). The
randomization process was performed using random allocation software<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The experimental and control groups both participated in
conventional stroke rehabilitation program, but only the experimental group participated in
Pilates exercise. Conventional stroke rehabilitation consisted of joint mobility, muscle
strengthening and walking exercise for 30 minutes once a day, 5 days a week, over 8
weeks.</p><p>The exercise group performed Pilates exercise, using a mat that was modified to be suitable
for stroke patients. Pilates in these patients involved the use of props such as balls,
magic circles and theraband. The exercise group participated in the exercise 24 times. One
subject in the control group declined his participation due to health reason. Therefore,
test results from the Pilates group and the control group, which each consisted of 10
patients, was used for statistical analysis.</p><p>The Pilates exercise was organized based on mat movements, and made stroke patients with
hemiparalysis smoothly perform movements using props (i.e. ball, magic circle and
theraband). Each session was conducted for an hour, three times a week for 8 weeks. Two
certified Pilates instructors and one experienced physical therapist were in charge of the
class. One instructor demonstrated movements for patients to follow and the other instructor
and a physical therapist assisted and helped patients perform the exercises. All movements
of this Pilates exercise were based on 8 sets. To improve core stability, patients started
with a breathing exercise in a sitting posture before and after all movements for 10
minutes. A mat based Pilates exercise comprised spine mobility exercises, upper limb
exercises and lower limb strengthening exercises. Each part was composed of the following
detailed movements. First, spine mobility: chin up and down; spine stretch forward and side
with theraband in sitting position. Second, upper limb exercise; draw a sword; deltoid lift
in sitting position with theraband. Third, lower limb strengthening exercise: top leg
pulse-down and bottom leg pulse-down in side-lying position with magic circle; foot and
ankle strengthener in sitting position with theraband. Particularly, unlike general Pilates
exercise, lower limb strengthening exercises were designed to help strengthen the
quadriceps, gluteus medius, adductor magnus, gastrocnemius, and anterior tibilalis<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Measurement of cardiac functional capacity was performed using a graded submaximal
treadmill exercise test to estimate the best state of subjects&#x02019; cardiopulmonary function,
using maximal oxygen intake, after finishing exercise before a subject reaches maximum
exercise. In this study the test was conducted using treadmill and radio wire metabolic
analyzer (Quark b2, COSMED, Italy, 2011), after resting heart rate and target heart rate
were measured before the test. A radio wire metabolic analyzer measures and assesses maximal
aerobic capacity while walking on treadmill. The slope of treadmill was set 0&#x000b0;. The target
walking velocity was selected for patient&#x02019;s walking stability and continuous treadmill
test<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects were asked to use a
minimal level of handrail support. In addition, the subjects were asked to wear a belt
around their waists to provide security during testing, and to use shoes or aids. Moreover,
when they expressed difficulty while walking, they were offered modest amounts of help. The
cardiopulmonary function test was conducted using the Harbor protocol, which is applicable
to patients with weakened physical function, such as the elderly or hemiplegic patients. The
transformed Harbor protocol tested treadmill velocity starts with the usual walking speed,
for 10 minutes by increasing 0.09 m/s (0.2 mph) every 2 minutes. The test was conducted
until it reached 80% of the aged-predicted maximum heart rate of each subject<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Subjects were instructed to use maximal effort and to display the thumb-down signal when
they wished to terminate the test. Termination of testing followed ACSM guidelines<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The graded submaximal treadmill exercise test was used to assess the
maximal oxygen intake (VO<sub>2 </sub>max) and maximal oxygen intake per body weight. The
Time Up and Go test (TUG) was used as a test of dynamic gait ability and balance, which is
commonly used to examine functional mobility of chronic stroke patients in this study.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS for Window Version 18.0. A paired t-test was used to compare
the pretest and posttest subordinate variables in each group. An independent t-test was used
to compare the differences in subordinate variables between the Pilates and control group.
All statistical significance level (&#x003b1;) of all statistical materials were set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Cardiopulmonary function, as indicated by resting heart rates, VO<sub>2</sub> max, and

sensory dysfunction, thereby seriously restricting physical activity<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, stroke patients, owing to a reduction in
physical activity, show muscular weakness, balance reduction and hypokinesia, a decline in
body metabolic function; and a reduction in cardiopulmonary function by 50&#x02013;70%, compared to
healthy people<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that chronic stroke patients can develop
accompanying respiratory deficits over time, due to restrictions in physical activity and a
decline in movement<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Respiratory
function weakness causes a vicious cycle that restricts physical activity, thereby further
aggravating respiratory function<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, reduction in respiratory function is an important problem to overcome in stroke
patients. Accordingly, a reduction in cardiopulmonary capacity of various damaged parts of
the chronic stroke patients occupies a large part of the physical disabilities and works as
an important element with reduction of ambulation ability, when they return to the
communities after the nervous system rehabilitation treatment<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study
tried to determine the degree of the cardiopulmonary function, by measuring resting heart
rate, maximal oxygen intake and maximal oxygen intake per body weight, targeting chronic
stroke patients, to assess if the continuous Pilates exercise was of help to the increase in
their cardiopulmonary capacity, which takes an important part when they return to their
daily lives.</p><p>The resting heart rate is the heart rates under stable conditions; which inversely is
related to exercise tolerance. If physical strength improves, the resting heart rate
decreases. Therefore, the heart rate recovers more quickly after exercise. Measurements of
resting heart rate, as conducted in this study, showed a statistically significant reduction
after training in the Pilates, while the resting heart rate increased statistically
significantly in control group (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>,
p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>The maximal oxygen intake is defined as the maximum amount of oxygen that can be consumed
per minute during maximum exercise. It is a value obtained by direct measurement; and is a
primary indicator that assesses absolute capacity of the cardiopulmonary system<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, when the maximal oxygen
intake is assessed, maximal oxygen intake per body weight is used for relative evaluation,
which is reported to show the most suitable cardiopulmonary capacity when a trained person
and an untrained person are compared<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Oxygen is necessary for contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscles mobilized during long
exercise. The whole body including breathing, circulation, nervous system activity, and
muscles uses this oxygen. Therefore, a higher oxygen intake, indicates an improved ability
to perform intensive exercise within a given time<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Huang et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that continuous
moderate exercise of more than 3 days per week improves maximal oxygen intake by 35&#x02013;50% and
differences in VO<sub>2</sub> max changes were significantly related to exercise intensity,
which accounts for the approximately 11% variance in VO<sub>2</sub> max responses. A study
on the maximal oxygen intake related to the cardiovascular system of the stroke patients
showed that a higher Barthel index according to independence in daily life correlates to
more oxygen intake<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kelley et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the level of subacute stroke
patients&#x02019; maximal oxygen intake, gait velocity and endurance was just 50% of a normal
person.</p><p>This study showed that Pilate&#x02019;s group maximal oxygen intake increased significantly from
819.4&#x02005;ml/min before exercise to 964.8&#x02005;ml/min after exercise, while control group&#x02019;s maximal
oxygen intake was significantly reduced before and after exercise from 1,048.78&#x02005;ml/min to
1,027.33&#x02005;ml/min (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, p&#x0003c;0.05). In
addition, Pilate&#x02019;s group maximal oxygen intake per body weight statistically significantly
increased from 12.06&#x02005;ml/kg/min before exercise to 14.31&#x02005;ml/kg/min after exercise, while the
control group experienced a statistically significantly reduction from before to after
exercise 14.68&#x02005;ml/kg/min to 14.38&#x02005;ml/kg/min (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table
3</xref>, p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>The results of this study are similar to the results of a 16-week Pilates exercise that
Guimar&#x000e3;es et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted in 16
patients with heart failure; Guimar&#x000e3;es et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> said that these changes meant an increase in stroke volume,
arteriovenous oxygen difference, or an improvement in muscular metabolic adaptation related
to the former two.</p><p>In addition, we believe that the results of this study are due to that the maintenance of
motor unit recruitment and of muscle mass in patients through regular aerobic exercise, such
as Pilates<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Alternatively, the
mobilization of additional motor units after exercise maintains oxygen consumption ability
by maintaining the number of active mitochondria<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Breathing is central to Pilates exercise. Therefore, if breathing
is ceased, muscles become strained and insufficient postures are aggravated. The muscles
that are associated with breathing, such as the diaphragm, transversus abdominis, pelvic
floor muscles, multifidus muscles, intercostal muscles, serratus anterior, scalenus and
upper trapezius muscle, become strained. Therefore, breathing improves lung capacity and
concentration, and elevates strengthening and movability of muscles during exercise, that we
can perform movements easily<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, a Tug test was performed to assess the gait and balance abilities. The
results of this study are consistent with previous studies, which reported that improvements
in respiratory functions affected mobility.</p><p>Therefore, it is believed that, as Pilates regimen includes breathing exercise, it
contributes to a reduction in kinetic energy necessary to experience an increase in
ventilation efficiency and movement. As the Pilates exercise showed a positive effect on
improvement in cardiopulmonary function and a possible therapeutic role, more studies should
be conducted in the future to assess the effects of Pilates on long-term improvements in
cardiopulmonary function.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>J&#x000f8;rgensen</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakayama</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Raaschou</surname><given-names>HO</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Recovery of walking function in stroke patients: the
