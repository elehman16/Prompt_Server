important in the management of horizontal and vertical
strabismus for a long time irrespective of oblique muscle
over actions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> However, availability of graded weakening

The results obtained by subjective and objective methods of
measurement of cyclodeviation are found to differ from each
other. This has been attributed to various naturally occurring
adaptive mechanisms including a motor response through
cyclovergence eye movements and a sensory component
limited to the extent of Panum&#x02032;s fusional areas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>Very few studies have measured the changes in cyclotorsion

was to measure the cyclotorsional changes following weakening
procedures on the superior and inferior oblique muscles in cases
of horizontal strabismus, by using the subjective and the objective
methods and to find a correlation between the two methods.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study design was a comparative case series. The statistician
decided the numbers on the basis of average number of cases
of squint operated in 6 months (study period), about 300 cases
and assuming the expected prevalence to be about 25% (c.i,
13 to 40%). A sample of 36 was required with power of study
80% and alpha 5%. We planned equal number of cases in each
group, but is also a known fact that V patterns with bilateral
inferior oblique over action (IOOA) are more common than A
patterns with bilateral superior oblique over action (SOOA).
Each group was further subdivided into two types of oblique
muscle weakening procedure which was done randomly using
chit system. During randomization, each group was assigned
two types of weakening procedures in equal halves and the
chits were prepared accordingly.</p><p>Thirty - six consecutive cases of horizontal strabismus
with bilateral oblique muscle over action were recruited for
the study from the squint and amblyopia clinic of our center.
Sixteen cases (32 eyes) had bilateral SOOA with significant
A pattern which was (defined as a difference of more than
10 prism diopter (pd) in the horizontal deviations in the up
and down gazes, the deviation in the up gaze more than the
deviation in the downgaze in esodeviations and vice versa in
exodeviations. These cases were randomly assigned to one of
the two treatment groups (8 cases each) of superior oblique
weakening procedures- superior oblique silicone expander
(SE) and translational recession (TR). Twenty cases (40 eyes)
had bilateral IOOA with significant V pattern (defined as a
difference of more than 15 pd in the horizontal deviations in
the up and down gazes, the deviation in the up gaze more
than the deviation in the downgaze in exodeviations and vice
versa in esodeviations). These cases were randomly assigned
to one of the 2 treatment groups (10 cases each) of inferior
oblique weakening procedures- Fink&#x02032;s recession (FR) of 10
mm and modified Elliot and Nankin&#x02032;s (MEN) inferior oblique
anteropositioning. All cases underwent appropriate horizontal
muscle surgery (without vertical displacement) in addition.</p><p>The study protocol was explained to the patients and their
parents (in case of minors) and an informed consent was
obtained. The study was performed as part of the doctoral
thesis of one of the authors and was approved by the Ethics
Committee set up by the institute. Patients were excluded if they
had a previous ocular surgery or if they were not cooperative
for orthoptic evaluation.</p><p>All the subjects included in the study underwent a complete
orthoptic workup including measurement of cyclotorsion by
objective and subjective methods before and after the surgery.
The binocular status in all the cases was assessed by the
Bagolini&#x02032;s striated glass. Subjective cyclotorsion was measured
by synoptophore using the vertical slit after-image slides, the
details of which have been given by Sood <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p><p>Objective cyclodeviation was determined from the fundus
photograph after measurement of the disc- fovea angle. The
fundus was photographed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> monocularly after dilating the
pupil with the non-fixating eye patched. A spirit level fixed to
the head ensured a proper head posture (horizontal intercanthal
plane) while the fundus was photographed. The subject was
asked to fixate on the camera&#x02032;s internal fixation marker and
the photograph of the 50&#x000b0; field of the posterior pole centered
on the fovea was obtained on a 400 ASA film. A 5&#x02033; by 9&#x02033; size
positive print was developed and the disc fovea angle (between
the line joining the fovea to the geometric center of the disc and
the horizontal line passing through the geometric center) was
measured from the print using a protractor. This angle was
used as a measure of objective torsion.</p><sec><title>Surgical technique</title><p>Superior oblique SE: after performing a superior oblique
tenotomy, a 7 mm segment of No 240 silicone retinal band
was inserted between the cut ends of the tendon 3 mm nasal

mm posterior, along the lateral border of the inferior rectus.</p><p>Postoperatively the subjects were reevaluated at 3 months
and complete orthoptic workup including torsion measurements
were performed. The index of surgical effect on torsion (ISE)
was calculated as</p><p>ISE = (correction achieved/ preoperative torsion) x 100</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the STATA 6.0
intercooled version software (STATA, STATA Corp, Houston,
TX). Statistical analysis was performed on the means of the
torsion measures preoperatively and postoperatively. Owing to
small sample sizes, nonparametric tests were used to check the
statistical significance of the differences between groups. The
Wilcoxon matched pair signed-rank test was used for evaluating
differences between the objective and subjective measures of
torsion and the Mann Whitney U test for the differences between
the procedures. Results were considered statistically significant
if the <italic>P</italic> value was less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 36 cases included in the study, 13 were males and 23
females. The mean age was 13.2 years (range 5 to 24 years). The
mean preoperative ocular torsion [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] for inferior oblique
weakening procedures measured on the synoptophore was
1.2&#x000b1;1.9&#x000b0; for patients undergoing FR and 3.6&#x000b1; 2.6&#x000b0; for patients
undergoing the MEN recession. The correction achieved was
2.1&#x000b1;1.9&#x000b0; and 3.8&#x000b1;2.3&#x000b0; respectively. The ISE was 113% and
115% respectively for patients in the FR and MEN group, the
differences in torsion between the 2 groups was not statistically
significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.93). Same results were obtained by the objective
measurements from fundus photographs [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>], which
showed a mean preoperative extorsion of 9.8&#x000b0; in the FR group
and 11.4&#x000b0; in the MEN group with a postoperative torsional
change of 2.5&#x000b0; and 4.7&#x000b0; respectively, the difference not being
statistically significant.</p><p>The mean preoperative ocular torsion [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] for superior

</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Cyclodeviation is a well-known feature of oblique muscle
disorders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> The symptoms resulting from cyclodeviations
vary and depend on the age of onset, the etiology of the
disorder, the amount of cyclotorsion, the level of cyclofusion
and sensory adaptation of the visual system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Cyclotropia of
the congenital variety are often asymptomatic as the subject
utilizes adaptive physiological and psychological mechanisms
to offset the cyclodisparity between the images. None of
the cases in our study were symptomatic with regard to the
cyclotropia. Uncontrolled oblique muscle surgery in cases of
horizontal strabismus with well-adapted cyclodeviations may
induce torsional disparities through over or under corrections.
If these disparities exceed the cyclofusional reserve, the patient
may become symptomatic for cyclodiplopia. It may also hinder
the development of fusion and finer stereopsis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Hence, it is
important to know the cyclotorsional changes produced by the
different surgical procedures on the oblique muscles.</p><p>It is understood that horizontal muscle surgery alone
does not alter the cyclodeviations, unless accompanied by
vertical transpositioning or differential (slanting) recessions
or resections. Thus associated horizontal procedures were not
considered to be responsible for the cyclodeviations.</p><p>Cyclodeviations can be measured by numerous methods, only
a few being useful clinically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> The subjective methods include
the double Maddox rod (DMR),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> the Polaroid dissociation stereo
projector (PDS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and the synoptophore,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> which was found to be
useful in this group of patients for measuring cyclodeviations.
The advantages of the synoptophore include a better control of
the patient&#x02032;s head, simultaneous correction of the horizontal and
vertical deviations and ability to measure even small amount
of cyclotorsion. The synoptophore however, is considered less
physiological than the PDS, as it is more dissociative.</p><p>Objective assessment of cyclodeviation is best done by
measuring the disc fovea angle on the fundus photograph done
using a standard protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> as described above. Foveal location in
normal patients is found to be 0.3 to 0.6 disc diameters below a
horizontal line extending temporally from the geometric center
of the optic nerve head creating a mean angle of 7.25&#x000b0; to 12.5&#x000b0;
from the horizontal axis at the geometric center of the optic disc.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
In their study measuring cyclorotatory changes after inferior
oblique muscle recession by subjective and objective methods,
Schworm <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> have assumed a 7&#x000b0; excyclodeviation to indicate
the subjective zero cyclodeviation. The subjective and &#x02032;adjusted&#x02032;
objective measurements still differed indicating adaptation.
The possibility of modulation in the sensorial adaptation to
cyclotropia was suggested by the differences in the preoperative
and postoperative measures of cyclotorsion by the subjective
and objective methods.</p><p>Our study showed significant differences in the subjective
and objective methods of measuring torsional changes, which
is highly suggestive of the presence of sensory adaptations.
However the differences in the subjective and objective
measurements for the superior oblique weakening procedures
were lesser than those seen after the inferior oblique weakening
procedures [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. This suggests that the torsional changes
induced by oblique muscle weakening procedures are only
partially amenable to sensory adaptations, especially when the
superior oblique is weakened.</p><p>While the postoperative subjective torsion was less than 1&#x000b0; in
the FR, MEN and the SE groups, the superior oblique TR group
showed a subjective extorsion of -3.5&#x000b0; at 3-month postoperative
follow up. A number of patients were symptomatic for ocular
torsion.</p><p>In our study the extorsional changes in cases with SOOA
was 3 times more after the TR surgery as compared to the SE
surgery. This can be explained by the loss of the fanning of the
superior oblique tendon fibers in the TR surgery. The increased
weakening of the intorting action makes it a less physiological
superior oblique weakening surgery. Harada <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> evaluated
the effects of anterior partial recession of the superior oblique
muscle in cases of cyclovertical muscle abnormalities causing
torsional problems. They reported that a 6 mm recession of the
superior oblique produced a mean extorsion change of 12&#x000b0;. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in literature
to have reported the torsional effects of the superior oblique
recession surgery.</p><p>There are numerous studies on the effect of inferior oblique
weakening procedures on ocular torsion. Harada <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
evaluated the effect of anterior partial recession of the inferior
oblique on the torsional status and found a 1&#x000b0; change for every
1 mm recession. Kushner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> evaluated the cyclorotatory effects
following oblique muscle surgery objectively by noting the
axis of astigmatism and concluded that bilateral weakening
of the inferior oblique by recession caused an intorsion of the
axis of astigmatism of about 9.75&#x000b0;. Santiago <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> have shown
overall net change of 6.2&#x000b1; 4.8&#x000b0; in excyclotorsion after anterior
transposition of the inferior oblique adjacent to or anterior to
the inferior rectus insertion on objective measurement using
fundus photograph. Our findings also compared favorably
with the above studies. Both the procedures produced an
equitable amount of intorsional shift, which is within the normal
physiological range. FR is a generalized weakening procedure,
weakening all the functions (elevation, abduction and extorsion)
of the inferior oblique equally. MEN procedure is also a
generalized weakening procedure but was expected to have an
increased effect on weakening the elevation and strengthening
the extorsion because of the anteropositioning. However, it
appears that the slack induced by the recession, neutralizes
any significant increase in the extorsion produced by the
anteropositioning. This also corroborates with the observations
form a previous study from the same center<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> wherein we
compared Parks&#x02032; method and the MEN anteropositioning
with pure anteropositioning. While Parks&#x02032; method produced a
torsion change of 3&#x000b1;2.5&#x000b0; and the MEN procedure, a change of
3.9&#x000b1;3.2&#x000b0;, &#x02032;pure&#x02032; anteropositioning produced a torsional change
of 0.36&#x000b1; 0.9&#x000b0;.</p><p>Some limitations of our study are a small sample size and
inability to use subjective methods like DMR, due to the lack
of binocularity. Further studies in acquired oblique muscle
anomalies with binocularity may add to more useful data in a
field with very few studies available.</p><p>We conclude that significant differences are seen in the
measurement of cyclotorsion by subjective and objective
methods, implying the presence of compensatory mechanisms.
The torsional changes produced by different oblique muscle
weakening procedures vary, with the maximum effect seen in
the translation recession of the superior oblique. To prevent
symptoms of postoperative cyclotorsion it is important to
choose procedures according to the amount of torsional changes
produced by them.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>The paper was presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of
