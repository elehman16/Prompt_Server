Erythropoietin (EPO) stimulating agents are known as alternatives to transfusion. However, they expose patients to thrombosis and are expensive. Recently, a new phenomenon, the normobaric oxygen paradox (NOP), has been described. In brief, transient hyperoxia followed by a prolonged return to normoxia acts as an effective trigger for EPO production. The mechanism depends on free oxygen radicals and on reduced glutathione (GSH) availabilities. Also, <italic>N</italic>-acetylcystein (NAC) is known to regenerate the stock of GSH. Very few clinical trials have investigated this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The goal of this study was to test the NOP theory on the evolution of hemoglobin and reticulocytes in patients receiving intermittent oxygen with or without NAC compared to a control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized study included 78 patients (three groups). The first group (G1; <italic>n </italic>= 26) received 60% FiO<sub>2 </sub>for 2 consecutive hours on the first, third, and fifth days postoperatively. The second group (G2; <italic>n </italic>= 26) in addition to oxygen received NAC 200 mg/day for 5 days. The third group (G3; <italic>n </italic>= 26) was the control group which did not receive any oxygen variation. On postoperative day 6, hemoglobin, hematocrit and reticulocytes were measured and compared to the baseline values. A total of five patients (three in G1 and two in G2) were excluded for discontinuing oxygen and/or early discharge from hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The reticulocyte count in G1 showed statistically different values compared to G2 and G3. These findings correlate with other clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The fact that no statistical difference of hemoglobin level was recorded could be attributed to the lack of follow-up after patient discharge (postoperative day 6).

However, further investigations are needed to confirm these findings and their impact on hemoglobin.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><name><surname>Balestra</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/><source>J Appl Physiol</source><year>2006</year><volume>100</volume><fpage>512</fpage><lpage>518</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1152/japplphysiol.00964.2005</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16239610</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><name><surname>Theunissen</surname></name><etal/><source>Crit Care</source><year>2011</year><volume>15</volume><issue>Suppl 1</issue><fpage>P422</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1186/cc9842</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
