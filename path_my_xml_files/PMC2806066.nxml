SSc&#x02014;interstitial lung disease (ILD)&#x02014;is not uncommon in patients with the diffuse form of the disease and represents the clinical manifestation that dictates prognosis; this manifestation responds poorly to treatment. Therapeutic options for treating SSc-associated ILD are limited and most of the drugs tested so far have shown poor or modest results. Cyclophosphamide (CYC) has shown statistically significant but clinically questionable efficacy in the treatment of SSc-associated ILD, but is associated with immunosuppression underscoring the necessity for novel, more effective and less toxic therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>]. We and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>] have employed mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the treatment of a limited number of patients with SSc-related ILD with encouraging, yet preliminary, results.</p><p>It has been suggested that targeting B cells could be a candidate therapy for SSc, since several lines of evidence point in the direction of B cells having a possible pathogenic role in this debilitating disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. B cells from tight skin mice&#x02014;an animal model of SSc&#x02014;exhibit chronic hyperactivity and exaggerated calcium responses after B-cell receptor (BCR) cross-linking. B cells from this animal model show augmented CD19 (an important positive BCR response regulator) signalling caused by impaired function of CD22, a negative BCR response regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Likewise, B cells from patients with SSc overexpress CD19, compared with B cells from healthy subjects and disease control patients, and are chronically activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, studies revealed that B-cell genes were specifically transcribed in SSc skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and that B-cell infiltration was a prominent feature of SSc-associated ILD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Rituximab (RTX) is a chimeric mAb against human CD20 that depletes peripheral B cells. It has been successfully introduced in the treatment of systemic rheumatic diseases and exhibits an acceptable safety profile. In animal models of SSc, administration of anti-CD20 mAb to newborn tight skin mice led to significant suppression of skin fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. On the other hand, there are encouraging data from the literature regarding the use of RTX in chronic graft <italic>vs</italic> host disease (GVHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>]. GVHD is a late complication of heterologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and exhibits several similarities to SSc, such as scleroderma-like skin manifestations and circulating autoantibodies. Furthermore, chronic GVHD has been considered by some as a systemic autoimmune disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22">19&#x02013;22</xref>]. The observed microchimerism in a significant percentage of patients with SSc may further suggest pathogenetic similarities between the two entities, justifying similar therapeutic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Recently, two uncontrolled studies have explored the potential clinical efficacy of RTX in SSc. In the first one, skin fibrosis as assessed clinically and histologically improved significantly in the RTX-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the second one, even though no overt clinical benefit was observed, skin biopsies from RTX-treated patients exhibited a significant reduction in the myofibroblast score and the patients remained clinically stable throughout the study period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. There are also two additional reports (in abstract form) showing improvement of skin fibrosis (27, 28) and a case report of improvement of SSc-associated ILD (29). The preliminary encouraging results from the use of RTX in animal models of SSc and in humans with chronic GVHD and SSc has led us to investigate more thoroughly the potential efficacy of RTX in patients with SSc in an open-label, proof-of-principle, randomized, controlled study. We report herein that RTX treatment of patients with SSc and SSc-associated ILD led to improvement of lung function and was well tolerated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>We enrolled 14 patients with a diagnosis of SSc, fulfilling the preliminary ACR criteria for the classification of the disease (30). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. All patients underwent a complete physical examination and a detailed review of their medical records prior to study enrolment. Other variables were also evaluated (full blood count, biochemistry profile, autoantibody profiles, urinalysis, ECG and cardiac ultrasound). Inclusion criteria were: (i) the detection of anti-Scl-70 autoantibodies in their sera; (ii) the presence of SSc-associated ILD as indicated by findings in either high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest or pulmonary function tests (PFTs) or both; and (iii) the absence of any changes in medications and/or dosage of treatment administered during the last 12 months before enrolment. All patients belonged to the diffuse variety of the disease as documented by the clinical presentation of skin involvement at the time of the study and/or its course over time since diagnosis. Moreover, all patients were anti-Scl-70 positive and had significant ILD, a feature of diffuse SSc. No changes in medication were allowed during the study.

In order to obtain contiguous images of lung abnormalities, a second low-dose scanning (120 kV, 200 mA) was performed with slice thickness of 1.25 mm, covering the whole thorax. This protocol permitted data reconstruction and evaluation of images in coronal and saggital levels using multiplanar reformatting algorithm. The severity and extent of lung involvement was assessed according to the scoring system proposed by Warrick <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] as follows: one point was assigned to ground glass appearance, two points to irregular pleural margins, three to septal/subpleural lines, four to honeycombing and five to subpleural cysts. The sum of points results in the severity score (0&#x02013;15 points). Extent score was calculated giving 1 point when involvement of one to three lung segments was present, 2 points for four to nine segments and 3 points to more than 10 segments (0&#x02013;15 points). Total score was obtained by adding the two above scores (0&#x02013;30 points).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical assessment of skin thickening</title><p>The MRSS was used for clinical assessment of skin thickening at baseline and at 1 year, by an experienced assessor in a blinded fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Skin histology</title><p>Histological assessment of skin fibrosis was made by skin biopsies performed at baseline and at 24 weeks of evaluation (a 5-mm punch biopsy of lesional skin).

There was a trend towards a decrease in all three endothelium activation/injury markers and ET-1 serum levels in the RTX group at 24 weeks, compared with baseline, which did not reach statistical significance.

In this study, we report an improvement in lung function with an increase in FVC and DL<sub>CO</sub> at 1 year, following two cycles (composed of four weekly doses each) of RTX in patients with SSc compared with the control group. Perhaps more importantly, none of the RTX-treated patients exhibited worsening of either FVC or DL<sub>CO</sub>, whereas five out of six patients had declining FVC and DL<sub>CO</sub> values at 1 year in the control group. These results indicate that RTX may favourably affect lung function parameters in patients with SSc. We should note, however, that patients in the control group tended to have more early disease and better lung function parameters (although not statistically different from the RTX group) making them more likely to deteriorate over the time of the study. Radiological assessment of ILD by HRCT revealed no changes in the RTX group, whereas there was a minor deterioration of two patients in the control group. It is of importance to note that none of the patients in the RTX group displayed worsening of lung fibrosis assessed by HRCT. Therefore, our HRCT studies support the idea that RTX treatment may stabilize pulmonary lesions apparent on imaging in diffuse SSc. The contrast between the RTX-induced improvement of lung function and the lack of improvement in the imaging studies may stem from using the Warrick scoring system, which is a rather crude method of assessment, or because the time interval of evaluation (24 weeks) was too short. Alternatively, most of the lesions apparent on HRCT may represent established fibrosis and not active lesions even though the effects of RTX are incompletely understood on both these parameters.</p><p>Although improvement in skin thickening, assessed by MRSS, has been reported in some studies evaluating the efficacy of different therapeutic agents in SSc, histological confirmation of improvement has only been documented following stem-cell transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Improvement of skin fibrosis also occurs in the long term during the physical course of the disease. In this study, improvement of skin thickening, as assessed clinically, was evident in the isolated analysis in the RTX group but head-to-head comparisons with the control group revealed that differences strongly tended to reach statistical significance, but did not reach it. This may be due to the small number of participants and the short time interval (24 weeks) between biopsies. Nevertheless, the improvement depicted in our figures from skin histology may suggest a potentially modifying role of RTX in the pathological process of skin fibrosis in SSc.</p><p>Two recent uncontrolled studies have explored the potential clinical efficacy of a single cycle of RTX in SSc. In the study by Smith <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], clinical and histological improvement of skin fibrosis was observed at 24 weeks following RTX treatment and in the study by Lafyatis <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], a significant reduction of the myofibroblast score in skin biopsies of RTX-treated patients was reported. These data are in agreement with ours and suggest that RTX may favourably affect skin fibrosis in SSc. Lung function tests at 24 weeks were stable in both the previously mentioned studies. We should note, however, that only 7 out of 15 patients in the study by Lafyatis <italic>et al.</italic> and 5 out of 8 patients in the study by Smith <italic>et al.</italic> had evidence of mild ILD (since patients with significant ILD were excluded), whereas in our study the presence of ILD was one of the inclusion criteria (and most patients had significant ILD). Furthermore, our study is the first in the literature to report lung function parameters at 1 year following RTX administration and the first to report the effects of two consecutive cycles of RTX on lung function and skin thickening in SSc.</p><p>Although RTX has been successfully introduced lately in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases, its exact mechanism of action is not completely understood. Pathogenesis of SSc is largely unknown but the results of the present study indicate that B cells may play a role and RTX may have a favourable effect on the disease process. RTX targets B cells that are present in skin biopsies of patients with scleroderma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and are the source of autoantibodies, some of which may contribute to pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In addition, it has become clear that apart from peripheral B-cell depletion, RTX indirectly affects other immune cells such as T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], which have been implicated in SSc pathogenesis as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In our study, improvement of skin fibrosis was more commonly encountered in patients with evidence of B-cell depletion in the skin, indirectly supporting a potential role of B cells in SSc. Although our data are preliminary, we may propose that the number of infiltrating B cells in the dermis, as assessed by skin biopsy, could serve as a marker of response to RTX therapy in patients with SSc.</p><p>Our study has several potential limitations. The first one is the small number of patients recruited, which does not provide the study with sufficient statistical power to prove efficacy. Indeed, this is a proof-of-principle study that was performed in order to obtain preliminary data regarding the effect of RTX on a limited number of patients with SSc. We designed the study as an open label randomized controlled one, so that we can compare the results of the RTX-treated patients with a similarly affected control group of patients receiving standard treatment and care. An additional limitation is that most patients had long-standing disease and had received various forms of immunosuppressive treatment in the past. The patients enrolled in our study are heterogeneous in terms of disease duration, severity and previous treatments. Ideally, one should have recruited patients with early disease and with no previous exposure to other forms of immunosuppressive treatment, but this approach might be hampered by disease rarity. Yet another limitation is that patients in both the RTX and the control group received several concurrent immune-based therapies and even though they were on the same treatment for a significant amount of time prior to enrolment, one cannot rule out the possibility that these therapies contributed to the outcomes reported in this study. Furthermore, improvement of skin fibrosis may associate with the natural course of the disease; nevertheless, improvement of skin fibrosis was seen only in our RTX-treated group and not in the control group.</p><p>We report herein the results of a controlled study evaluating the efficacy of RTX in patients with SSc and SSc-associated ILD. Our data, although preliminary and on a small cohort, indicate a possible disease-modifying role of RTX in SSc, particularly in SSc-associated lung disease. However, in SSc treatment several therapeutic agents have shown some efficacy in small-scale studies but failed to do so in larger scale studies. Taking into consideration the limitations of the present study, definite conclusions should not be drawn. Nevertheless, our data could serve as a good starting point for the design of larger scale, multicentre studies with longer evaluation periods and especially in earlier stages of the disease.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="kep093b1.jpg"/></p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/kep093/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> Online.</p></sec>
