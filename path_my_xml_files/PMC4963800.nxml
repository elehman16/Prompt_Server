Our aim was to study the feasibility of MRV to measure change in thrombus volume in patients with acute symptomatic objectively confirmed proximal DVT in an open-label multicenter trial (edoxaban Thrombus Reduction Imaging Study, eTRIS). We randomized patients in a 2:1 allocation ratio to edoxaban 90 mg/day for 10 days followed by 60 mg/day versus parenteral anticoagulation bridging to warfarin for 3 months. The primary efficacy outcome was a surrogate end point of the relative change in MRV-quantified thrombus volume from baseline to Day 14&#x02013;21. A total of 85 eligible patients from 26 study sites were randomized to edoxaban monotherapy (<italic>n</italic>=56) versus parenteral anticoagulation as a &#x02018;bridge&#x02019; to warfarin (<italic>n</italic>=29). The mean relative change in MRV-quantified thrombus volume from baseline to Day 14&#x02013;21 was similar in patients treated with edoxaban and parenteral anticoagulation as a &#x02018;bridge&#x02019; to warfarin (&#x02212;50.1% vs &#x02212;58.9%; 95% confidence interval of treatment difference, &#x02212;12.7%, 30.2%). However, thrombus extension was observed in eight patients in the edoxaban monotherapy group and in none in the warfarin group. Rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism (3.6% vs 3.6%, <italic>p</italic>=0.45) and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (5.4% vs 7.1%, <italic>p</italic>=0.34) were also similar. No major bleeds occurred in either on-treatment group during the study period. In conclusion, MRV can assess change in thrombus volume in patients with acute DVT randomized to two different anticoagulant regimens.</p><p>

The first study was performed within 36 hours after randomization, and the second was performed between days 14 and 21 after randomization.

Thrombus volume was assessed utilizing contrast-enhanced MRV images after the contrast agent circulated for 5 minutes to ensure a steady state in the blood pool. To determine locations and extent of thrombus, pre- and post-contrast 3D gradient echo sequences were acquired from: (1) the mid-calf to above the knee, (2) above the knee to the thigh and lower pelvis, and (3) thigh and lower pelvis to abdomen.</p><p>Image analysis (Supplementary material) was performed on a dedicated workstation (Apple Mac Pro&#x000ae; with OsiriX MD) by two treatment-blinded experienced image analysts. Baseline and follow-up MRV images were compared for each subject for the following venous segments: external iliac, common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, gastrocnemius, and peroneal veins.</p><p>For MRV images, analysts traced 3D curved multiplanar reconstructions, using contours following the centerline of each venous segment, and produced 1 mm axial slices perpendicular to the curved path. Analysts then manually segmented regions of interest corresponding to the thrombus. Thrombus volume was calculated by multiplying the area of interest (thrombus) by the slice thickness (1 mm) using a custom MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) script.

All subjects who permanently stopped taking the study drug were expected to have a follow-up visit 30 days later. Overall, 82 of the 85 patients randomized (96.5%) completed the 30-day follow-up visit.

The primary safety analysis (on-treatment) was performed using the safety analysis set: all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of randomized study drug according to the treatment actually received. Data analyses were performed using software SAS Version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p><p>The relative change of thrombus volume from baseline was calculated as the difference between Day 14&#x02013;21 and baseline measurements divided by the baseline measurement, then multiplied by 100. The relative change from baseline was summarized within each group and compared by providing the treatment difference and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference. The relative change from baseline (MRV measurement) at Day 14&#x02013;21 was also analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group and stratum as factors and baseline measurement as a covariate. The composite of recurrent DVT, PE, or VTE-related death was summarized by treatment, and a 95% CI was generated for the difference between the two groups for the mITT analysis set.</p><p>Of a total trial population of 85 patients, 56 were randomized to edoxaban monotherapy and 29 to a parenteral anticoagulant &#x02018;bridge&#x02019; (with unfractionated heparin or LMWH) to warfarin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1358863X16645853">Figure 1</xref>).

Compared with venous ultrasound, MRV provides a more comprehensive and contiguous assessment of the presence of thrombus as well as volumetric analysis. Unlike conventional venography, MRV is non-invasive. Compared with CT venography, MRV avoids ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast. Thus, MRV shows promise as a research tool.

We evaluated a novel oral monotherapy dosing regimen for edoxaban in a rigorous randomized controlled trial setting for the treatment of acute symptomatic DVT. Finally, we obtained clinical follow-up in 96.5% of study patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section18-1358863X16645853"><title>Conclusions</title><p>MRV can assess change in thrombus volume in patients randomized to two different anticoagulant regimens. The subset of patients in the edoxaban monotherapy group that experienced an increase in thrombus volume on follow-up MRV suggests that initial parenteral anticoagulation may be important for treatment with edoxaban.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplemental_Methods_645853.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1132" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> Dr Piazza receives research grant support from Daiichi Sankyo, EKOS, a BTG International Group company, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Janssen.
