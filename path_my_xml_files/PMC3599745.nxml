fluid resuscitation (boluses) in African children with severe febrile illnesses increases the 48-hour mortality by 3.3% compared with controls (no bolus). We explored the effect of boluses on 48-hour all-cause mortality by clinical presentation at enrolment, hemodynamic changes over the first hour, and on different modes of death, according to terminal clinical events. We hypothesize that boluses may cause excess deaths from neurological or respiratory events relating to fluid overload.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Pre-defined presentation syndromes (PS; severe acidosis or severe shock, respiratory, neurological) and predominant terminal clinical events (cardiovascular collapse, respiratory, neurological) were described by randomized arm (bolus versus control) in 3,141 severely ill febrile children with shock enrolled in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial. Landmark analyses were used to compare early mortality in treatment groups, conditional on changes in shock and hypoxia parameters. Competing risks methods were used to estimate cumulative incidence curves and sub-hazard ratios to compare treatment groups in terms of terminal clinical events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 2,396 out of 3,141 (76%) classifiable participants, 1,647 (69%) had a severe metabolic acidosis or severe shock PS, 625 (26%) had a respiratory PS and 976 (41%) had a neurological PS, either alone or in combination. Mortality was greatest among children fulfilling criteria for all three PS (28% bolus, 21% control) and lowest for lone respiratory (2% bolus, 5% control) or neurological (3% bolus, 0% control) presentations. Excess mortality in bolus arms versus control was apparent for all three PS, including all their component features. By one hour, shock had resolved (responders) more frequently in bolus versus control groups (43% versus 32%, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c;0.001), but excess mortality with boluses was evident in responders (relative risk 1.98, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 4.17, <italic>P </italic>= 0.06) and 'non-responders' (relative risk 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 2.28, <italic>P </italic>= 0.001), with no evidence of heterogeneity (<italic>P </italic>= 0.68). The major difference between bolus and control arms was the higher proportion of cardiogenic or shock terminal clinical events in bolus arms (n = 123; 4.6% versus 2.6%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.008) rather than respiratory (n = 61; 2.2% versus 1.3%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.09) or neurological (n = 63, 2.1% versus 1.8%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.6) terminal clinical events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Excess mortality from boluses occurred in all subgroups of children. Contrary to expectation, cardiovascular collapse rather than fluid overload appeared to contribute most to excess deaths with rapid fluid resuscitation. These results should prompt a re-evaluation of evidence on fluid resuscitation for shock and a re-appraisal of the rate, composition and volume of resuscitation fluids.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN69856593">ISRCTN69856593</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>fluid resuscitation</kwd><kwd>human albumin solution</kwd><kwd>mortality</kwd><kwd>saline</kwd><kwd>shock</kwd><kwd>terminal clinical events</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p>See related article: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed/1741-7015/11/67">http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed/1741-7015/11/67</ext-link></p></notes></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial, African children with shock randomized to early rapid fluid resuscitation (20 to 40 ml/kg boluses) with normal saline or 5% human albumin had a 3.3% increased absolute risk of death by 48 hours compared with no-bolus controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Following publication, commentary papers, letters and discussion groups have speculated on reasons for this surprising result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], given that bolus resuscitation is the gold standard for shock-management in well-resourced countries (albeit based on weak levels of evidence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>FEAST was a pragmatic trial conducted in African hospitals without ventilation facilities. It included children with shock caused by a heterogeneous group of conditions including sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] but excluded those with gastroenteritis and severe malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Consistency of adverse outcome was shown over all sites and in all possible subgroups, with no benefit of boluses observed for any working diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], for any definition of shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], or presence or absence of anemia or under-nutrition. As reasons for harm caused by boluses remained unclear, we undertook further analyses to explore possible mechanisms and modes of death in children randomized to bolus resuscitation versus control. We hypothesized that boluses may cause excess deaths from neurological or respiratory events, particularly those relating to fluid overload. We explored the effect of boluses on 48-hour mortality according to signs and symptoms at enrolment (presentation syndrome, PS); predominant clinical syndrome in each patient prior to death (terminal clinical event, TCE); and changes in vital signs, measured prospectively at pre-specified times.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial design and population</title><p>The methods and the outcome of the trial have been reported in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In brief, children, aged 60 days to 12 years, with severe febrile illness (classed as impaired consciousness (prostration or coma) and/or respiratory distress (increased work of breathing) plus clinical evidence of impaired perfusion (one of capillary refill time &#x0003e;2 seconds, lower limb temperature gradient, weak radial pulse volume or severe tachycardia) at six centers in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were enrolled into two strata according to systolic blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Stratum A included 3,141 children without severe hypotension who were randomized to immediate bolus of 20 ml/kg (increased to 40 ml/kg after protocol amendment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]) of 5% albumin (albumin-bolus: 1,050 children) or 0.9% saline (saline-bolus: 1,047 children), or no-bolus (control, maintenance fluids 4 ml/kg/hour: 1,044 children). The saline-bolus and albumin-bolus arms, but not the control arm, received an additional 20 ml/kg bolus at one hour if impaired perfusion persisted. In all three arms, further 40 ml/kg boluses of study fluid (saline for the control arm) were only prescribed beyond one hour if severe hypotension developed (see definition below). Stratum B included 29 children with FEAST entry criteria plus severe hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;50 mmHg if &#x0003c;12 months; &#x0003c;60 mmHg if 1 to 5 years; &#x0003c;70 mmHg if &#x0003e; 5 years) who were randomized to albumin or saline boluses of 40 to 60 ml/kg only. The primary endpoint was 48-hour mortality. Children with severe malnutrition, gastroenteritis, trauma, surgery or burns were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline and follow-up data collection</title><p>Trial clinicians completed a structured clinical case report form at admission. A venous blood sample was taken for immediate biochemical analyses with a handheld blood analyzer (iSTAT, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA), hemoglobin was measured with HemOcue (&#x000c4;ngelholm, Sweden), glucose and lactate were measured with an On-Call glucometer and a Lactate Pro meter respectively and HIV antibody testing. Blood smears for malaria parasites were prepared for immediate reading and subsequent quality control. Standardized clinical reviews were conducted at 1, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours including vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring. A working clinical diagnosis was recorded at 48 hours as well as history of prior neurodevelopmental progress and any pre-admission neurological deficits. Children were managed on general pediatric wards; mechanical ventilation (other than short-term 'bag-and-mask' support) was not available. Basic infrastructural support for emergency care as well as oxygen saturation and automatic blood pressure monitors were provided for each site. All trial patients received intravenous antibiotics, antimalarial drugs (for those with falciparum malaria) and intravenous maintenance fluids (2.5 to 4 ml/kg/hour as per national guidelines) until the child was able to retain oral fluids. Antipyretics, anticonvulsants and treatment for hypoglycemia (blood sugar &#x0003c;2.5 mmol/l) were administered according to nationally agreed protocols. Children with a hemoglobin level &#x0003c;5 g/dl were transfused with 20 ml/kg of whole blood over 4 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Assignment of presentation syndrome and terminal clinical event</title><p>Prior to and throughout the trial, clinical staff received onsite training in triage and emergency life support management to optimize case recognition, implement supportive management and ensure protocol adherence. Throughout the hospital admission, severe adverse events were reported immediately and clinical features of pulmonary edema and raised intracranial pressure, and evidence of hypovolemia and allergic events were actively solicited. An independent clinician removed all references to randomized arm or fluid management prior to review by the Endpoint Review Committee (ERC), which included an independent chair (JE), five independent pediatricians (experienced in high dependency care and/or working in Africa), and center principal investigators. The ERC had access to 'blinded' clinical narratives, bedside vital observations (below), iSTAT results (baseline, 24 hours), microbiology, malaria and HIV status, and concomitant treatments. They adjudicated (blind to randomized arm) on whether fatal and non-fatal events could be related to bolus interventions and the main causes of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, the ERC chairperson and another non-center ERC member reviewed all deaths occurring within 48 hours; using pre-specified criteria, they stratified all children by presentation syndrome (PS) and classified the predominant clinical mode of death (TCE).</p></sec><sec><title>Presentation syndromes definitions</title><p><bold><italic>Severe shock or acidosis presentation </italic></bold>was any one of blood lactate &#x0003e;5 mmol/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], base excess &#x0003e;-8 mmol/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; World Health Organization shock definition (all of cold hands or feet; capillary refill time &#x0003e;3 seconds; weak and fast pulse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or moderate hypotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 50 to 75 mmHg in children aged &#x0003c;12 months, 60 to 75 mmHg in children aged 1 to 5 years, and 70 to 85 mmHg in children aged &#x0003e;5 years).</p><sec><title>Respiratory presentation</title><p>hypoxia (oxygen saturation &#x0003c;92% measured by pulse oximetry) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] plus one of history of cough, chest indrawing or crepitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Neurological presentation</title><p>coma or seizures at or immediately preceding hospital admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Terminal clinical event syndrome definitions</title><sec><title>Cardiogenic/cardiovascular collapse</title><p>signs of shock at the point of demise - severe tachycardia or bradycardia plus one of prolonged capillary refill time &#x0003e;2 seconds, cold peripheries or low SBP.

All comparisons between combined bolus and control arms were performed according to intention-to-treat, and all statistical tests were two-sided.</p><p>PS prevalence was described by randomized arm and 48-hour mortality was compared by randomized arm within each PS. Forest plots were constructed to show comparisons between arms for 48-hour mortality according to PS and all individual features of each PS. Hazard ratios for the comparison between bolus and no-bolus arms were estimated for different levels of oxygen saturation and hemoglobin from Cox proportional hazard models, with a single indicator for treatment group, the level of the parameter and an interaction between treatment group and parameter. Competing risks methods were used to estimate cumulative incidence curves and sub-hazard ratios to compare the two treatment groups in terms of TCEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Oxygen saturation, axillary temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, SBP, glucose values and a composite measure of shock or impaired perfusion (defined as any of the following: capillary refill time &#x0003e;2 seconds, lower limb temperature gradient, weak radial pulse volume or severe tachycardia (&#x0003c;12 months, &#x0003e;180 bpm; 1 to 5 years, &#x0003e;160 bpm; &#x0003e;5 years, &#x0003e;140 bpm)) were summarized for survivors over time (at baseline, 1, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours) with box and whisker plots and bar charts. Treatment groups were compared in terms of mortality after one hour, conditional on changes in shock and hypoxia parameters 1-hour post-randomization. Our analyses focused only on early changes where the number of deaths was similar across randomized arms; thereafter, because of excess deaths in bolus arms, results would be subject to survivorship bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethics Committees of Imperial College London, Makerere University Uganda, Medical Research Institute, Kenya and National Medical Research Institute, Tanzania approved the protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In FEAST stratum A, 3,141 children were randomized between 13 January 2009 and 13 January 2011 (1,050 albumin-bolus, 1,047 saline-bolus, 1,044 control) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

We found no evidence that excess 48-hour mortality associated with boluses differed by type of PS, by individual constituent components of each syndrome, or by baseline hemoglobin level. Remarkably, in every subgroup we examined, there was consistent evidence of harm by boluses. Paradoxically, the syndromes where most concern has been expressed over trial inclusion (respiratory or neurological alone and/or less severe shock criteria) not only had lower mortality overall, but also tended to have smaller differences between bolus and control, although care must be taken with interpretation of smaller subgroups. The only exception was hypoxia, present in a quarter of children at admission, which surprisingly appeared to be associated with significantly less harm from boluses. There appears to be no good rationale for this finding, which could have occurred by chance.</p><p>Even though this trial was conducted in settings with limited resources and no access to intensive care, the conduct of the trial complied to the highest standards of good clinical practice including adherence to intervention strategy and completeness of follow-up, 100% source document monitoring and the robust and blinded methodology for determining PS and TCE. An intention-to-treat analysis with no need for imputation for missing data minimized the likelihood of bias and underpinned the magnitude and importance of the unexpected findings of the trial and further analyses.</p><p>Noteworthy is that, consistent with global clinical experience, we observed a superior resolution of impaired perfusion by one hour in the bolus arms compared with the control arm. However, importantly, this did not translate into a superior outcome when compared with children with continued impaired perfusion: in both cases, boluses resulted in higher mortality. Mortality excess with boluses among children with and without hypoxia at baseline occurred to a similar extent irrespective of oxygen saturation status at one hour. Although <italic>de novo </italic>development of hypoxia at one hour was more common in the bolus arms, it was not associated with a significant increase in 48-hour mortality - suggesting that, if fluid boluses were causing pulmonary edema (and hypoxia), this was not a unifying mechanism for increased mortality from boluses. Moreover, there was little evidence that fluid overload was the mechanism for excess deaths with boluses from our analyses of neurological or respiratory TCEs. Overall, cardiovascular collapse was the main TCE and contributed most substantially to the excess mortality in the bolus arms compared to control, peaking at 2 to 11 hours post-bolus. Whilst it is possible that subtle effects of fluid overload on the lungs or brain could have been missed, our findings do not lend support to this hypothesis, particularly as the ERC review process was blind to randomization and used pre-specified TCE definitions.</p><p>A limitation of our trial was that we were unable to undertake invasive or point-of-care continuous monitoring to provide greater insight into TCEs, as in high-income intensive care settings. However, the availability of patient-centered variables from our bedside observations and laboratory data from most children at baseline has enabled further characterization of the trial participants into clinically relevant presentations (PS) in the context of where the trial was conducted. It has provided a more in-depth understanding of the spectrum of clinical groupings of children enrolled in the trial and the degree of adverse outcome fluid boluses had in these groups. Our bedside observations at pre-defined times following randomization, as well as adjudication of cause of death by the ERC, blind to randomized arm and using pre-specified criteria (TCE), provide more speculative data but remain informative because they are largely operator-independent. These methodologies are central to the internal validity of our analysis, which sought to minimize systematic bias.</p><p>Whereas initial improvement in circulatory status following bolus resuscitation is consistent with global clinical experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the observation of excess subsequent cardiovascular collapse and excess mortality, even in the early responders, was only made possible because of exemplary adherence to randomized allocation, and in a trial protocol in which further boluses were given to only (very few) children developing severe hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The possibility that fluid resuscitation lead to hemodilution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in already anemic children, reducing oxygen delivery to the myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and leading to ischemia and cardiac dysfunction, is largely ruled out by the lack of heterogeneity in the TCEs by hemoglobin level, and by the analysis showing excess harm with fluids across the whole range of hemoglobin values. These findings challenge the presumption that early and rapid reversal of shock by fluid resuscitation translates into longer-term survival benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] in settings where intensive care facilities are not available. They do raise a possibility that rapid fluid resuscitation may cause adverse effects on vascular hemodynamics and myocardial performance, driving the requirement for inotropic and pressor support. Rapid restoration of microcirculatory perfusion may come at the expense of requiring other components of the sepsis bundle, including inotropes and ventilation. This possibility could be explored in future clinical and preclinical research examining the natural history of shock in patients managed by maintenance only (as in the control arm) and with fluid boluses.</p><p>Adverse effects of hyperchloremia, at the doses given in this trial, remain controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Intriguingly, the most deleterious effects of boluses were in those patients with severe acidosis at baseline, the group with the least <italic>a priori </italic>equipoise regarding the potential benefits of fluid resuscitation - lending support to the notion of adverse effects of the resuscitation fluids on acid-base equilibrium. Alternatively, this may indicate lethal reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] or a surge of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] in cases with advanced shock. As previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], shock may be an adaptive, time-dependent response sustaining children through a prolonged period prior to hospital admission - only to die within hours of reperfusion.</p><p>Whatever the explanation, these findings raise important questions about the pathophysiological mechanisms of shock and goal-directed management, questioning whether the protocol-driven requirement for inotropes and vasoactive drugs has been driven, in part, by aggressive fluid challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, informed by a modified Delphi process, graded the pediatric recommendation (20 ml/kg boluses over 5 to 10 minutes up to 60 ml/kg) as 2C, indicating a weak recommendation with low quality of evidence. The pediatric studies on which these recommendations were based included only two retrospective, observational studies of initial resuscitation volume on the outcome of children with putative sepsis from a single tertiary referral center, involving 34 and 91 children respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The inclusion criteria for both studies were children who survived to intensive care unit admission, but were inotrope-dependent and had pulmonary arterial catheters <italic>in situ</italic>. Higher initial fluid boluses and early shock reversal in 9 and 24 children in the two respective studies were associated with improved global outcome. However, the study design and the patient population had major limitations in terms of survivorship bias and external validity to other settings. Other sources of evidence that were referenced to inform fluid resuscitation guidelines include dengue shock. We suggest these are largely irrelevant to the management of sepsis, because shock as a complication of dengue occurs 7 to 10 days after fever defervescence, secondary to gross intravascular leakage leading to vomiting, abdominal pain, increasingly tender hepatomegaly, narrow pulse pressure and hemoconcentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The American College of Critical Care Medicine guideline, and similar guidelines, nevertheless have been adopted by many countries worldwide where point-of-care testing and intensive care facilities are available and are considered to be best practice. These are now being recommended as standards of care for resource-poor settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; indicating that the FEAST trial had limited generalizability because the adverse effects of fluid boluses were largely confined to children with malaria and/or anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The data presented in the original manuscript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], subsequence correspondence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and this detailed sub-analysis definitely counter this interpretation. A recent systematic review assessing the evidence base for fluid resuscitation in the treatment of children with shock due to sepsis or severe infection found only 13 pediatric trials. Whilst the majority of all randomized evidence to date comes from the FEAST trial, they recommended that implementation of simple algorithms for children managed at hospitals with limited resources to ensure identification of children who maybe potentially be harmed by fluid boluses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The findings we report here raise questions over the rates, volumes and types of solutions recommended in pediatric resuscitation protocols, most of which remain untested in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the FEAST trial together with findings from these additional analyses suggest that rapid administration of fluid boluses increase the risk of subsequent cardiovascular collapse in children with shock, rather than increasing the risk of fatal fluid overload.
