Rasch analysis has confirmed that the PC-PART contains two unidimensional scales providing interval-level measurement: the <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scales. This study investigated validity and responsiveness of these PC-PART scales using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirteen hypotheses about <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scale scores were established prior to conducting the analyses. Data from a prospective randomized controlled trial of additional (weekend) inpatient rehabilitation in Melbourne, Australia, were used. The 996 participants had a mean (SD) age of 74 (13) years and were admitted with orthopaedic (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;581), neurological (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;203) or other disabling impairments (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;212). <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scores were compared to functional independence (FIM), comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index), whether activities of daily living goals were met, and discharge destination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Low to moderate correlations between FIM and PC-PART scales&#x02019; scores supported hypotheses that the PC-PART measures a different construct from functional independence: <italic>Self Care r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> -0.52(95 % CI -.46 to -.57) and <italic>Domestic Life r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> -0.32(95 % CI -.25 to -.38). The scales had low to moderate discriminative ability for discharge destination, with the area under the curve for <italic>Self Care</italic>, 0.70 (95 % CI 0.62-0.78), and <italic>Domestic Life</italic>, 0.72 (95 % CI 0.64-0.80). The discharge to community living cut-off scores for <italic>Self Care</italic>: 5.50 (sensitivity .83, specificity .53) and <italic>Domestic Life</italic>: 7.50 (sensitivity .75, specificity .60), represented patients having no participation restrictions. Change scores from admission to discharge demonstrated larger effect sizes for the <italic>Self Care</italic> (1.67) and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> (1.50) scales than for the FIM (1.10), supporting hypotheses about responsiveness. Ten of the 13 hypotheses were supported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provided evidence supporting construct validity, criterion validity and responsiveness of the PC-PART <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scales for inpatient rehabilitation. Clinicians, managers and researchers who wish to measure the patterns and extent of people&#x02019;s participation restrictions in activities of daily living and the associated burden of care, before and/or after intervention, can be somewhat confident about the PC-PART&#x02019;s validity and responsiveness for this purpose.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Data used in this research were gathered during a registered randomized controlled trial: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx?searchTxt=ACTRN12609000973213&#x00026;ddlSearch=Registered">ACTRN12609000973213</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Rehabilitation aims to improve activity performance and address barriers to patients&#x02019; participation in their life situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Rehabilitation services assist patients to adapt to challenges they face in their daily life as a result of their impairments. Participation is a key outcome of rehabilitation programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] is a commonly used framework in rehabilitation that informs assessment and measurement of patients&#x02019; functioning and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The functioning and disability aspect of the ICF framework provides three separate constructs (impairments, activities, participation). However, only two components are described: one for impairments, and one for activities and participation, combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Researchers have commented on the lack of clarity in the interpretation of, and operationalization of the activity and participation concepts within the ICF framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In particular, there is lack of consensus on interpretation of the definition for, and measurement of, participation-related&#x000a0;constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It seems accepted that measures eliciting information about an individual&#x02019;s ability, level of difficulty or level of dependence in performing tasks, without inclusion of the modifying effects of the environment in the instrument&#x02019;s metric, measure activity limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. With respect to measurement of participation restrictions, one view is that measures eliciting information about performance of tasks in natural environments and that include influences of the environment on performance in the instrument&#x02019;s metric, measure participation restrictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The Personal Care-Participation Assessment and Resource Tool (PC-PART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was designed to measure the presence or absence of participation restrictions experienced by individuals in self care and domestic activities of daily living (ADL) required for community life. It systematically identifies unmet ADL needs which persist in individuals&#x02019; living environments despite their own efforts, use of assistive devices, and supports or assistance from others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The PC-PART provides one conceptual perspective on the measurement of participation restriction in self care and domestic life domains.</p><p>The PC-PART differs from commonly used ADL instruments, such as the FIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the Barthel Index (BI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], in a fundamentally important way. The FIM and BI measure patients&#x02019; level of dependence in self care and mobility, rating their abilities and their need for assistance or adaptive equipment or both. They can be considered to measure activity limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such instruments are not able to capture what ADL will actually be accomplished. The PC-PART differs in that it measures both the need for assistance or equipment and whether any required assistance is available and is provided in the patients&#x02019; living environment. Such information is critical, for example, for discharge planning from inpatient settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and for admission decisions in emergency departments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) is an internationally recognised framework, developed through international consensus of experts in the measurement of health status outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The COSMIN checklist provides a framework of criteria for rating the methodological quality of research investigating the reliability, validity, responsiveness and interpretability of health measurement instruments. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It can also guide the development of rigorous methods to investigate measurement properties of health related outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>A systematic review of the measurement properties of the PC-PART using the COSMIN checklist showed that PC-PART items demonstrated good content validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Other aspects of the instrument&#x02019;s validity could not be confirmed from the systematic review. Subsequent research has demonstrated that the PC-PART has good inter-rater reliability for group applications but not for individual applications, such as in the clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Using Rasch methods, a further study generated evidence supporting internal validity of 30 of the original 43 items, when grouped into separate <italic>Self Care</italic> (16 items) and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> (14 items) scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The objective of this present study was to evaluate the construct validity, criterion validity and responsiveness of the Rasch-derived <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scales in an adult inpatient rehabilitation setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This is an instrument validation study guided by the COSMIN framework, involving secondary analysis of existing data from a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT). The RCT investigated what effect providing additional Saturday rehabilitation during inpatient rehabilitation had on functional independence, quality of life and length of stay, compared to 5&#x000a0;days per week of rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were the 996 adults enrolled in the trial, conducted in two public hospital multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation units in Melbourne, Australia. Participants with orthopaedic (e.g. fractures, elective joint replacements), neurological (e.g. stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease) or other disabling condition (e.g. cardiac, pulmonary, deconditioning) were included. Patients were not excluded if their primary language was different from English or if they had reduced cognition, but were excluded if they were admitted for &#x02018;Geriatric Evaluation and Management&#x02019; (otherwise known as slow stream rehabilitation) or if they were enrolled in another trial. Patients are typically accepted for inpatient rehabilitation if assessed as being able to participate actively in rehabilitation with the expectation they will improve sufficiently to return to community living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Ethics approval for this study, involving secondary analysis of the RCT data, was received from University and Health Service Human Research Ethics Committees. Participants gave written informed consent to take part in the RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><p>Data from all measures used in the RCT were available for this study and these are detailed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hypotheses for this present study were generated prior to all analyses with knowledge of the available measures used for the RCT. Only data from measures relevant to the hypotheses for this present study were used.</p><p>The <bold>PC-PART</bold> was administered to gather data for the RCT at admission (baseline) and again at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. It was administered by occupational therapists using a combination of patient interview, key informant interview and task observation (see Appendix A: Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref> for item examples). Prior to commencement of data collection the occupational therapist assessors were provided with standardized education in the use of the PC-PART. This consisted of a one-hour training session. In addition, the occupational therapists were provided the PC-PART manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and a recorded audiovidual presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The PC-PART assessment was administered to identify participants&#x02019; existing participation restrictions in ADL in their discharge living environments. Items were scored as either <italic>OK by self</italic> (patients will manage the activity alone with or without aids in their living environments), <italic>OK with help</italic> (patients will manage the activity with help from others, and this help is available and provided in their living environments), or <italic>Not OK</italic> (patients will not&#x000a0;manage the activity in their living environments despite their own efforts, use of aids and help from available support from others). Both <italic>OK by self</italic> and <italic>OK with help</italic> were scored 0 (<italic>no</italic> participation restriction present), and <italic>Not OK</italic> was scored 1 (participation restriction <italic>was</italic> present). Each <italic>Not OK</italic> represented an ADL participation restriction. These item response categories were shown to be valid using Rasch analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. When used clinically, the raw score for each scale is the total number of <italic>Not OK</italic> scores observed for an individual patient, with a range of possible scores of 0&#x02013;16 (<italic>Self Care</italic>) and 0&#x02013;14 (<italic>Domestic Life</italic>). Rasch-derived conversion scores for each scale use a 0&#x02013;100 scale, where 0 reflects no ADL participation restriction and 100 represents complete ADL participation restriction. <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scale total scores cannot be combined to form an overall PC-PART score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Rasch-derived scores for the 16 <italic>Self Care</italic> scale items and 14 <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scale items were used for all analyses in this present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To aid clinical interpretation where relevant, Rasch-derived scores were related back to corresponding total raw <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scores using a conversion table [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The <bold>FIM</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] consists of 18 items from motor (13 items) and cognitive (5 items) domains. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale, where 1 represents complete dependence and the need for total assistance and 7 represents complete independence. Scores range from 18 (complete dependence on all items) to 126 (complete independence on all items) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Items cover activities such as eating, grooming, bathing, dressing, toileting, sphincter control, , transfers, locomotion, communication and social cognition. There is evidence from studies conducted in the past two decades across several countries and different patient populations, supporting reliability, validity and responsiveness of the FIM as a measure of disability for patients receiving rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus, the FIM was viewed as a suitable comparison instrument for the PC-PART. It is a measure of activity limitations according to ICF concepts and terminology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It has sufficient similarity in the content of its domains to the PC-PART, to generate hypotheses reflecting expected convergence and divergence between their scores at admission and discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. The FIM was administered as part of routine care by FIM trained assessors, including physiotherapists and occupational therapists. It was scored during multidisciplinary team meetings at admission (baseline) and at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. At both points, the FIM was completed on a separate occasion to the PC-PART.</p><p>The <bold>Charlson Comorbidity Index</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] was selected as the best available measure used in the RCT to enable testing of hypotheses about the PC-PART&#x02019;s scores related to the level of patients&#x02019; co-morbidity. The sum of the index score, adjusted for age, is an indicator of disease burden and an estimator of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It provided a mechanism to quantify the severity of a patient&#x02019;s overall state of ill-health, given the number and seriousness of health conditions experienced. The index has been widely used and validated in population studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but it is recognized that some conditions (e.g. rheumatological disease) are less accurately coded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The score was calculated at admission.</p><p>ADL discharge goals were established by the patients and treating occupational therapists at admission. This information was gathered for the RCT but not with the structured approach of goal attainment scaling. <bold>Achievement of ADL goals</bold> was measured and recorded at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation by the treating occupational therapist as being either met/unmet. Partially met goals were categorized as unmet.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; <bold>discharge destinations</bold>, that is, patients&#x02019; living situations immediately following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation were categorised as <italic>home</italic> (usual place of residence), <italic>low-level residential care</italic>, <italic>high-level residential care</italic>, <italic>acute hospital transfer</italic>, or <italic>transitional care</italic>. The transitional care program involved continued inpatient care for either lower intensity rehabilitation activities or to await placement in residential care facilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>COSMIN checklist</title><p>The COSMIN checklist provided criteria for evaluating construct validity, criterion validity and responsiveness.

In accordance with COSMIN&#x02019;s recommendations, construct validity was evaluated by five hypotheses of expected mean score differences between impairment groups, and expected correlations between PC-PART scores and FIM and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

Overall, there was support for 10 of the 13 hypotheses.</p><p>Given that both the PC-PART and the FIM have provided evidence of reliability and validity, the lack of a strong negative correlation between the measures at admission could be interpreted as suggesting that the PC-PART measures a different construct to FIM. The FIM measures activity limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The PC-PART scales performed in accordance with theoretical expectations, supporting construct validity of the PC-PART&#x02019;s <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scales as measures of ADL participation restriction.</p><p>To our knowledge, the PC-PART is the only instrument that specifically targets the transaction between people, their activity and the available supports in their living environments to record participation restrictions in activities of daily living required for community life. Other instruments seem similar, for example, the Assessment of Living Skills and Resources-Revised 2 (ALSAR-R2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]; Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]; Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]; and the Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, these assesments have applications in different areas of functioning than the PC-PART (e.g. performance in education, work, leisure tasks and body functions) and vary in the degree and manner in which they incorporate the need for, and availability of, supports, resources or assistance into their scoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The PC-PART therefore provides an important and unique contribution to health state measurement through its measurement of participation restrictions.</p><p>The relationship between comorbidity and PC-PART scores needs further investigation. Contrary to our expectations, the number and severity of comorbidities did not influence PC-PART scores (hypothesis 3). Overall, patients in this sample had relatively low comorbidity scores. Lack of variability in comorbidity scores may have affected the estimate of the correlation coefficient. It is possible that the Charlson Comorbidity Index was not sensitive to subclinical and chronic impairments that may impact people&#x02019;s functioning (e.g. chronic pain or rheumatological conditions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Further evidence using prospective methods gathering more detailed information about comorbidity may add to our understanding about the measurement of participation restriction as related to the number and severity of co-existing impairments.</p><p>Admission PC-PART scores were shown to be higher for patients with stroke, compared to patients from other impairment groups, showing a lack of support for hypothesis 4, which postulated no difference between impairment groups. It may be that the sudden nature of stroke onset and combination of physical and cognitive impairments associated with stroke results in more participation restrictions in the accompishment of ADL than for people with other impairments. This result suggests that the PC-PART may be sensitive to impairment type, however this premise requires testing in a specifically designed study. If PC-PART scores are shown to differ between impairment groups, then it is possible the PC-PART may be useful for identifying groups of patients who are likely to require interventions focused on accomplishment of ADL required for community living as part of discharge planning.</p><p>The modest probability of both PC-PART scales&#x02019; scores ability to accurately reflect patients&#x02019; discharge destination shown in this study (hypothesis 6), seems likely to be an underestimation of their true discriminative ability. This result seems to have been influenced by the high proportion of missing PC-PART discharge data for patients discharged to acute inpatient care, as well as, a high proportion of patients with resolved participation restrictions in the transitional care group&#x02019;s PC-PART discharge data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The acute hospital and transitional care group discharge PC-PART scores were probably not representative of the group they were intended to represent, that is, patients transferred to acute care due to ongoing problems requiring medical management. On reflection, separation of patients discharged to acute hospital and transitional care into separate groups may have provided more robust validation data. Thus, these are preliminary findings. Prospective and specifically designed investigations of the PC-PART&#x02019;s discriminative ability are required to produce more robust evidence about the ability of the <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scale scores to accurately identify people who can return to community life from inpatient rehabilitation and those who continue to require inpatient services.</p><p>Both PC-PART scales appeared responsive. Their scores were shown to change in the direction expected when change had occurred, as indicated by other variables and instruments. Both scales demonstrated large effect sizes from rehabilitation admission to discharge. The correlation between change scores reflected a greater relative improvement in PC-PART scores than FIM scores between admission and discharge. This finding is consistent with theoretical expectations about PC-PART scores; that there should be a complete resolution of ADL participation restrictions prior to discharge home or to residential care (in residential care, the expectation is that all ADL needs are met). In contrast, it is possible for patients to be discharged to the community without complete independence scores on every FIM item, that is, without complete resolution of activity limitations, provided adequate supports are in place.</p><p>In this study, all patients&#x02019; <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scores between admission and discharge showed large effect sizes, irrespective of discharge destination. For patients discharged to home or supported living environments, the large effect size of PC-PART scores between admission and discharge supported its responsiveness. It is possible that the patients discharged to transitional care (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;69), who had no ADL participation restrictions at discharge because they were waiting for residential care placement, may have inflated the effect sizes for the acute and transitional inpatient care discharge group. Also, missing discharge PC-PART data for 13 of 17 patients transferred to acute care may have influenced the results by under-representing this group in the data. Thus, caution is advised when interpreting findings for hypothesis 13 due to limitations of the data as well as potential bias introduced during analyses. Responsiveness of the PC-PART scales should be further investigated in prospective, specifically designed studies.</p><p>One of the challenging decisions in validation research is whether to test hypotheses with the aid of structured guidelines, such as the COSMIN checklist, or whether to use more exploratory approaches. Formulating hypotheses prior to data analysis reduces the risk of bias when interpreting the results because criteria for validity are set before viewing the data. This avoids the temptation to think of alternative explanations for low correlations or no difference between groups, instead of concluding that the instrument may not be valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Limited existing validation research for the PC-PART influenced development of accurate hypotheses for this present study. The hypotheses used in this study were generated from some testing of the instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], clinical knowledge and experience, combined with theoretical expectations of the instrument. The use of a more exploratory approach may have been useful for generating hypotheses for future testing, but would not have permitted the testing of evidence carried out in this study. Overall, the results of this study are positive, with the majority of hypotheses supported.</p><p>The COSMIN checklist provided a transparent, rigorous methodological structure for this research that assisted in minimizing methodological bias. It would be useful to use the COSMIN checklist to further evaluate the PC-PART scales in prospective, specifically designed research to build more evidence about the scales&#x02019; validity and responsiveness.</p><p>In clinical practice the PC-PART may aid discharge planning. The derived cut-off scores of zero <italic>Self Care</italic> and zero <italic>Domestic Life</italic> participation restrictions, desirable for discharge home or to residential care living situations, intuitively match clinical reasoning. The scales may be used to identify and prioritise areas for intervention and to ensure that patients who are discharged to community living environments do not have ADL participation restrictions at the time of discharge.</p><p>The PC-PART scales may be useful for clinical practice, clinical research and health care system management. In clinical practice, they may identify the presence of participation restrictions in ADL required for community life, enabling prioritisation of intervention and discharge planning. This may facilitate the reduction of barriers to discharge from inpatient care, which include issues of accommodation and supply of appropriate supports in community living environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In clinical research, changes that occur through interventions designed to reduce ADL participation restrictions, and their economic value, can be measured using the PC-PART scales. For the health care system, the PC-PART scales may be used to identify the nature and extent of participation restrictions experienced by populations in activities of daily living required for community life. This may aid understanding of the nature and extent of supports needed to enable people to live in the community and in turn, enable resources to be allocated where they are most needed.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Limitations</title><p>The retrospective use of existing data limited the scope of analysis to the type and nature of the existing variables, which were collected for a different purpose. Use of existing data also meant that specific methodological requirements for some analyses (criterion validity) were not favorable. The combined grouping of patients discharged to acute and transitional care may have resulted in an underestimation of the discriminative ability and responsiveness of the PC-PART scales. Therefore, the results of this study need to be interpreted in light of its limitations. Prospective studies could ensure more detailed, useful and specific data for comparison with PC-PART scores are gathered. Finally, testing of PC-PART scores in relation to assessments such as the ALSAR-R2, SMAF or LIFE-H, which all focus on accomplishment of some ADL as well as broader life activities, may provide opportunity for further validation research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, results of this rigorous validation study using the COSMIN checklist support the construct validity and criterion validity of the PC-PART&#x02019;s <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scales for inpatient rehabilitation and show they are responsive to clinical changes, as measures of ADL participation restrictions in activities of daily living required for community life. Evidence from this study adds to existing research establishing the PC-PART scales as unidimensional interval-level measures of participation restriction. Health service clinicians, managers and researchers may confidently use the PC-PART scales to measure the pattern and extent of people&#x02019;s participation restrictions in activities of daily living required for community life, to gain an understanding of the burden of care associated with these needs and to aid resource allocation of services.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec34"><title>Appendix A</title><p><table-wrap id="Tab8"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>Example: two items from each of the PC-PART <italic>Self Care</italic> and <italic>Domestic Life</italic> scales</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Item Label</th><th>Question to patient</th><th>Question to key informant</th><th>Observation<sup>a</sup>
