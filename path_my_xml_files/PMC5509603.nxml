on micronutrient absorption in urban residential school children. [Subjects and Methods]
The study population comprised 66 urban school children aged 11&#x02013;15 years staying in a
residential school in Pune City, Maharashtra, India. A stratified random sampling method
was used to divide the students into experimental and control groups. There were 33
students in experimental group and 33 students in control group. Both experimental and
control groups were assessed for the status of zinc, copper, iron and magnesium at the
baseline and at the end of 12 weeks of yoga training. The study participants of
experimental group underwent yoga training for 12 weeks, for one hour in the morning for
six days a week. The control group did not undergo any yoga training during this time
period. [Results] The experimental group participants showed significant improvement in
micronutrient absorption as compared to control group. [Conclusion] The findings of this
study indicate that yoga practices could improve micronutrient absorption in urban
residential school children.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Micronutrient</kwd><kwd>Yoga</kwd><kwd>Urban school children</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Malnutrition is a major health concern in both rural and urban adolescent children in
India<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as, other parts of the
World<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Micronutrients are the
substances which are needed by the body in minuscule amounts, which enable the body to
produce hormones, enzymes and other essential substances for proper growth and development.
Nevertheless, the consequences of their absence are extremely severe. Lack of micronutrients
such as Iodine, vitamin A and iron represent a major threat to growth and development of
populations throughout the world. Children and pregnant women are at major risk of
micronutrient deficiency in low-income countries<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Micronutrient deficiency leads to Iron deficiency anaemia<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, stunting, underweight, thinness<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The 2016 Global Hunger Index Report ranked
India 28th, which represents serious hunger situation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Adolescents from rural areas, generally having low socio economic
background, are found to be more nutritionally deprived as compared to urban adolescent
children<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The diet of rural children
was found to be deficient in several micronutrients such as iron, calcium, phosphorus,
potassium, magnesium, vitamin A and C, and beta-carotene<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, a deficiency in micronutrients and macronutrients is
observed among children belonging to low-income countries<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless, due to progressive urbanisation and associated
changes in lifestyle, the energy expenditure balance is changing<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Obesity in children is an equally challenging health
problem in many developing countries. However, it is under- recognized<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In India, overall nutritional status of urban adolescents was found to be
unsatisfactory<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to a study,
micronutrient deficiencies and malnutrition are widely prevalent in school going children of
urban area<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, childhood obesity
is a major health problem among adolescent school children of urban area. In spite of
persistently high burden of malnutrition, a rapid rise in the number of obese and overweight
children has been observed<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study
conducted in India showed an increasing prevalence of obesity and overweight in urban
male<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as, female adolescent
school children<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Micronutrient deficiency may have bearing upon improper dietary practices such as
inadequate food allocation in the family and individual likes and dislikes, high phytate
content of Indian diet, worm infection, parents&#x02019; education, living conditions, family
income, fathers&#x02019; income, family size, fathers&#x02019; profession, and physical activities.</p><p>Micronutrient deficiency leads to poor physical and mental health among adolescent
children. In fact, nutritional education to improve the micronutrient intake is considered
to be necessary. Food-based approaches with dietary diversification and provisions of
hygienic environment are important sustainable strategies for correction of micronutrient
deficiency<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Educational strategies
focussing on consumption of balanced diet along with provision of variety of nutrient rich
healthy food, are needed<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless,
physical activity is useful to improve digestion, metabolism and micronutrient absorption in
urban children. In this context, ancient Indian traditional Yoga practices may be useful in
improving digestion, metabolism and micronutrient absorption. Yoga is also useful in
improvement of mental and physical health. Effect of yoga in micronutrient absorption in
rural adolescent children has been studied<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. However it is unknown whether the same would be effective in urban
adolescent school children in India. Therefore, this study was conducted with a view to
observe the effect of yoga practices on selected micronutrient absorption in urban
adolescent school children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted in Pune City, Maharashtra, India in the year 2015&#x02013;16. The study
population consisted of 66 urban school children (48 Males and 18 females) aged 11&#x02013;15 years
(12.63 &#x000b1; 1.01), staying in a residential school in Pune District. A stratified random
sampling method was used to divide the students into experimental and control groups. There
were 33 students (24 males and 9 females) in experimental group and 33 students (24 males
and 9 females) in control group. Both experimental and control groups were assessed at the
baseline and at the end of 12 weeks of yoga training. The study participants of experimental
group underwent yoga training for 12 weeks, under the supervision of yoga teacher, for one
hour in the morning, excluding Sundays and holidays for a period of 12 weeks. The control
group did not undergo any yoga training during this time period. Nevertheless, both the
groups continued participating in extracurricular activities such as sports, dance, physical
exercise, etc. during their school hours. However, at the end of 12 weeks, three students (1
from experimental and 2 from control group) dropped out of the study due to various reasons
such as disinterest, ill-health, and not being able to report for post test.</p><p>The selected school was located in the urban area of Pune district, Maharashtra, India. The
researcher briefed the Principal and warden of the school about the aims and objectives of
the research study. The study participants and their parents were also briefed about the
research study and procedures involved at the outset for obtaining their written informed
consent. The research study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee as well as
the Research Advisory Board of Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute, Lonavla, Pune. The
Institutional Ethical Clearance number is kdham/SRD/RAC/IEC-04/2013.</p><p>The height and weight of each study participant was recorded using a standardized scale and
stadiometer at the baseline and at the end of 12 weeks. Height was measured using
stadiometer (height to the nearest 1&#x02005;mm) and weight was measured using a digital weighing
scale TANITA (HD-318) (weight to the nearest 0.1&#x02005;kg). All the students were barefooted and
wore school uniforms at the time of measurements. Chronological age was expressed to the
nearest month. A comprehensive physical examination was conducted for all the study
participants prior to the start of yoga training by a Medical Officer appointed by
Kaivalyadhama. Serum Iron (Fe), Zinc (Zn), Magnesium (Mg), and Copper (Cu) were measured at
the baseline and at the end of 12 weeks of yoga training. They were measured using Minias
Globe Diagnostic SRL (Italy) diagnostic kit on Statfax &#x02212;2000 analyzer (Awareness Technology,
USA). Blood samples were collected in the school premises in a hall provided by school
authorities. Non-fasting blood samples were collected from median incubital vein by
venipuncture using 5&#x02005;ml sterile disposable syringe and needle. The collected blood was
allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes. The collected blood sample was kept in
an ice box and transported to the testing laboratory within 4 hours. Later on, the serum
samples were separated from collected blood samples using vaccutainer blood collection tubes
(Becton Dickinson) with the centrifugation at 1,000&#x02005;g for 10 minutes and kept at &#x02212;40&#x000b0;C until
analysis of Fe, Zn, Mg, and Cu was completed.</p><p>Yoga training sessions were conducted for about one hour per session for five days a week,
for 12 weeks in a practice hall provided by the school authorities. The Yoga module was
prepared by a senior Yoga expert from Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute, Lonavla. The yoga
teacher was certified from Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute. Each Yoga session started with Om
chanting and mantra chanting, and concluded with Shanti Path. The yoga practices were
selected, based on the experience of Kaivalyadhama&#x02019;s senior yoga teacher while working with
students. These practices have been found to be effective in improving physical and mental
health. The Experimental Group practiced Yoga asanas (postures) and Pranayama (breathing
techniques) as per the yoga protocol. Each asana was initially held for 15&#x02013;30 sec, and for 1
minute in the later stages. Duration of Pranayama was initially 2&#x02013;3 minutes and was
increased to 5 minutes in the later stages, gradually.</p><p>The supine pose asanas included were <italic>Ekpaduttanpadasana (Single leg raise pose),

indicate that yoga intervention can improve micronutrient absorption in urban residential
school children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results of this randomized controlled trial showed significant improvement in Zinc,
Iron, Copper and Magnesium. These micronutrients are essential for proper mental and
physical development of young rural, as well as, urban adolescent residential school
children<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Past studies showed that
malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent in the adolescent urban
residential school children<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
in spite of increasingly high burden of malnutrition, urban children are found to be obese
and overweight<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is probably due to
intake of high calorie junk food, which has extremely low nutritional value along with
sedentary lifestyle of young urban children<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Micronutrient deficiency is related to
poor mental and physical growth of young adolescent urban children, which includes poor
cognitive development, depression, anxiety, poor memory, growth retardation, and low
scholastic achievements. It has been found that the effect of micronutrient deficiency can
be irreversible, long-term and detrimental to the mental and physical health of young
adolescent children<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
Zinc, Iron, Copper and Magnesium showed significant improvement after twelve weeks of yoga
practices in experimental group while wait-list control group did not show any significant
improvement. Earlier studies also reported that physical activity and yoga have led to
improvement in micronutrient absorption<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Improvement in Zinc, Iron, Copper, and Magnesium in experimental group can be attributed to
twelve weeks of yoga training. The yoga postures involved in training program helped in
improved digestion by massaging of internal digestive glands, which in turn, helped in an
enhanced absorption of micronutrients. Yoga practices help in gentle and automatic massaging
of internal organs and, therefore, facilitate the functioning of digestive system,
respiratory system, circulatory system, nervous system, endocrine system, and excretory
system<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Past research studies also
showed that yoga practices may be helpful in improving gastrointestinal and digestive
problems<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The diet of the study participants of both experimental and
control group consisted of food provided by the school canteen which mostly comprises of
fast food. The researcher did not suggest any food fortification or micronutrient
supplementation during the entire study period. However, there was improvement in
micronutrient status of experimental group, which suggests that it might be solely due to
yoga practices.</p><p>Although, the results obtained are highly encouraging, there are some limitations in the
study. The duration of the study was only twelve weeks and no follow-up was conducted. Also,
both experimental and control groups comprised of disproportionate number of girls and boys.
This might affect the results of the study as there are various factors such as hormonal
differences in boys and girls, in adolescence, which may influence the findings of the
present study. Follow-up studies with larger sample size, other essential micronutrients and
homogenous groups are recommended for further studies. The present study demonstrated that
twelve weeks of yoga intervention improved micronutrient absorption in young, adolescent
urban school children. Although no external micronutrient supplementation was provided to
the study participants, they showed significant improvement in micronutrient status. Thus,
yoga, being inexpensive and simple regimen, can be included in child health initiatives as
an effective therapy in schools of rural, as well as, urban areas of India. Future studies
