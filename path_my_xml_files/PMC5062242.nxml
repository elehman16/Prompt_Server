Switching over to balanced fluids can substantially decrease the incidence of lactic acidosis and hyperchloremic acidosis. The deleterious effects of unbalanced fluids are more recognizable during major surgeries. We prospectively studied the influence of Sterofundin (SF) and Ringer lactate (RL) on acid&#x02013;base changes, hemodynamics, and readiness for extubation during scoliosis surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Subjects and Methods:</title><p>Thirty consecutive children posted for scoliosis surgery were randomized to receive either RL (<italic>n</italic> = 15) or SF (<italic>n</italic> = 15) as intraoperative fluid at 10 mg/kg/h. Fluid boluses were added according to the study fluid algorithm. Arterial blood was sampled and analyzed at hourly intervals during surgery. Red blood cell transfusion was guided by hematocrit below 27.

The extensive dissection over spine with instrumentation and pedicle screw fixation involves significant blood loss and intraoperative hemodynamic instability.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Over the last decade, considerable research has been done to identify the most proper fluid to be used during surgery. The impact of correct fluid therapy has proven to improve the postoperative outcome in major surgical exercises.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The controversy of colloid versus crystalloid seems to have shifted to decision between balanced or unbalanced fluids. The pharmaceutical companies are bringing newer research molecules as balanced crystalloids with acetate and maleate as anions, limiting the degree of lactic acidosis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Theoretically, these solutions should not affect the pH even after several liters of infusion. However, lactate depends on the liver for metabolism and has a higher O<sub>2</sub> consumption; hence, it might be nonsuperior to acetate-based solutions for intraoperative use.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The present study aims at a preliminary comparison between two balanced crystalloid regimes &#x02013; Sterofundin (SF) and Ringer acetate (RL). Their effect on blood pH, lactates, electrolytes, and strong ion difference (SID) was investigated. The secondary aims were the influence of either regime on hemodynamics, blood loss, and readiness for extubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted in thirty children from 8 to 14 years of age, posted for scoliosis corrective surgery. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of our institute. Legal guardians of the patients were briefed about the study, and written informed consent was obtained. The exclusion criteria were defined as patients with significant renal, cardiac, or liver impairment, congenital heart diseases, generalized edema, electrolyte imbalances, and known allergy to SF.</p><p>Patients were randomized into one of two groups, an RL group or an SF group, using a random number generator in sealed envelopes. Research personnel were not directly involved in the care of these patients and hence were blinded to the treatment assignments.</p><p>All patients fasted after midnight and received 0.25 mg alprazolam orally as premedication in the morning. Anesthesia was induced using propofol (2 mg/kg), fentanyl (2 &#x000b5;g/kg), and rocuronium (0.8 mg/kg) and was maintained with a balanced technique involving isoflurane, 50% N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub>, and infusion of atracurium and fentanyl. Ventilation was adjusted to maintain an EtCO<sub>2</sub> 30&#x02013;35 mmHg. Temperature was maintained at &#x02265;35.5&#x000b0;C with forced air warmer. All patients received central venous (internal jugular vein) and radial invasive arterial cannulation for hemodynamic monitoring. Heart rate, blood pressure (BP), SpO<sub>2</sub>, central venous pressure (CVP), EtCO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, urine output, and entropy monitoring were instituted before induction and continued throughout the intraoperative period. Fasting fluid requirements were calculated as 2 ml/kg and infused over 3 h (1/2, 1/4, and 1/4 of total calculated volume).</p><p>Group RL patients were infused RL at 10 mg/kg/h, whereas Group SF patients received SF at the same rate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. A bolus of 100 ml of either fluid was given if systolic BP (SBP) fell below 100 mmHg and/or systolic pressure variation was &#x02265;5 mmHg. Packed cells were transfused if hemoglobin was reported below 9 g%. All patients were electively ventilated postoperatively with intravenous fentanyl infusion 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg/h and paracetamol 20 mg/kg as analgesic supplements. Fluid regime was discontinued after admission to the Intensive Care Unit where after departmental routines ensued. Arterial blood gas was sampled postinduction, end of each hour during surgery, immediate postoperatively, and 4 h later; the pH, sodium, lactates, chloride, base excess, and bicarbonates were recorded and analyzed by a standard blood gas analyzer.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study algorithm Parameters not achieved Inadequate or no response</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-532-g001"/></fig><p>Hemodynamic instability was defined as an SBP below 90 mmHg for more than 10 min, not responding to a 100 ml fluid challenge. This was managed with a bolus dose of phenylephrine (0.002 &#x000b5;g/kg), decreasing inhaled concentration of isoflurane, and hemoglobin estimation. Readiness for extubation was achieved when the patient was awake with stable vitals and acid&#x02013;base physiology. A &#x000b1;5% deviation from the normal values was acceptable.</p><p>To analyze further, the apparent SID was calculated by a simplified Steward approach;</p><p>Apparent SID = ([Na<sup>+</sup>] + [K<sup>+</sup>]) &#x02212; ([Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] + [lactate])</p><p>The mean values with variance of acid&#x02013;base parameters, hemodynamics, requirement of fluid boluses, blood transfusions, and vasopressors were entered in Excel spreadsheet and analyzed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 17.0, Ilinios Inc, Chicago). Categorical variables were studied by Chi-square test whereas repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied to continuous observations. Pairwise comparisons were performed by Tukey's test if statistical significance was obtained on ANOVA test. The median units of blood transfused and the number of fluid boluses were compared by Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test. A <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance.</p><p>Sample size estimation was based on the expected 0.05 difference in the pH in the mean population and an alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 0.2. A minimum of 15 subjects was required to be enrolled in each arm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We did not notice significant differences between the two groups in patient's demographic data [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Scoliosis surgery is associated with substantial blood loss with the potential for hemodynamic instability.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The primary objective was to evaluate the role of fluids in acid&#x02013;base change.</p><p>A balanced solution has the physiological electrolyte pattern of plasma in terms of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chloride and their relative contributions toward osmolality, and a physiological acid&#x02013;base balance achieved with metabolizable anions to replace bicarbonate.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The study protocol depended on an increase in systolic pressure variation as a guide for fluid resuscitations rather than CVP. CVP can be misleading as a guide of ventricular filling in the prone position.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The pH of SF is 5.1&#x02013;5.9 as compared to 6.1 for RL. Literature suggests that infusion of balanced crystalloids should increase the pH due to the presence of metabolizable anions (acetate or lactate).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In our study, the pH, bicarbonates, and base excess remained more stable and recovered faster to normal range earlier with infusion of SF than RL. This finding is similar to as observed in the previous study by McCague <italic>et al</italic>. The authors have reported no change in pH after trauma resuscitations with acetated Ringer solutions.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The mild acidosis, which we have noticed in SF group, can be subsequent to red cells transfusion.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The change in acid&#x02013;base parameters are known to be highly influenced by intraoperative hypothermia and hypotension. Adherence to the study protocol in our patients ensured the absence of any effect secondary to hypothermia and hypotension. Balanced fluid or volume replacement prevents the development of acidosis, and hence coagulopathy, which, along with hypothermia forms the lethal triad.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>A constant increase in chloride concentration with SF which should have influenced pH to become acidotic, whereas the SID of 36.8 mmol/L should induce a mild alkalosis. As these changes are occurring in opposite directions, the stability of pH is more guaranteed with SF. A Wooten's multicompartmental model about fluid redistribution between compartments based on the infusion rate and availability of metabolic turnover of metabolizable anions can also explain this phenomenon.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>SID of balanced crystalloids is zero <italic>in vitro</italic>; however, <italic>in vivo</italic> the metabolism of anions increases the SID. We have noticed a gradual decrease in apparent SID in both groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. The important observation was a regain of about normal SID in SF-infused patients in the early postoperative period. However, our findings are limited to only apparent SID as Stewart's approach to effective SID calculation, requires plasma albumin levels.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of strong ion difference between the two groups (BL, T1&#x02013;T6, PE, and PO<sub>4</sub> = Baseline, 1&#x02013;6 h measurements, postextubation, and 4 h after extubation, respectively. RL = Ringer lactate, SF = Sterofundin. Mean values for calculated strong ion difference)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-532-g007"/></fig><p>Lactate levels have increased in both groups although the rise is earlier and higher in RL-infused patients. However, the evidence is equivocal for RL infusion and increasing lactate levels.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The liver has a high capacity to metabolize lactate. Prolonged anesthetic for long surgeries with inhalation agent, prone position with inadvertent compression over liver, and blood transfusions can put a significant stress over the functional capacity of the liver and can predispose to lactic acidosis. Infusion of large quantities of lactate-containing infusions in healthy volunteers transiently and slightly elevates the serum lactate levels but does not decrease the pH.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The preclinical use of RL for volume replacement has different effects depending on the severity of hemorrhagic shock. RL exhibits detrimental effects in cases of severe shock, whereas it stabilizes acid&#x02013;base parameters and decreases organ damage (protective effects) in cases of moderate shock in a rat model.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Whether these findings can be extrapolated to human clinical studies is questionable. Acetate has a number of significant advantages over other metabolizable anions, especially over lactate, which should no longer be used as a metabolizable anion.</p><p>In a study by Yunos <italic>et al</italic>., the safety profile of balanced fluids is linked to the decreased chloride intake.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] SF has a chloride concentration of 127 meq/L. Baxter Pharmaceuticals contend that high chlorides are necessary for the formulation and stability of SF. The acidosis noticed in SF Group patients can be multifactorial to hyperchloremia, low bicarbonate levels, and the slightly elevated lactate levels can be the three possible factors.</p><p>SF did exhibit a positive impact on hemodynamics and blood loss. This effect of balanced fluids has been previously reported by Guidet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Blood loss up to 15% of the blood volume and optionally still be replaced with crystalloid balanced solutions.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The patients who received SF fluid therapy achieved the criteria for extubation earlier in the postoperative period. The stability of hemodynamics and the blood biochemistry during surgery are the main reasons for this effect.</p><p>The limitation of our study is a small sample size and the power of our study is 80%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>SF fluid replacement and volume therapy prevent major acid&#x02013;base changes and preserve the plasma biochemistry during scoliosis surgery.
