Publicly accessible information on outpatient waiting times is scant and inconsistent. The Australian National Outpatient Care Database does not report waiting times
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Queensland Health hospital performance data indicate that 54% of non-urgent outpatient referrals (not specifically orthopaedics) will take over a year to be seen
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and data from some hospitals reveal that the waiting time to see orthopaedic specialists may extend beyond 3&#x000a0;years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, demands on orthopaedic services and subsequent waiting times are expected to worsen as the population ages
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and rates of obesity and arthritis increase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>To combat future escalating delays for patients to access services such as orthopaedics, it has been proposed that the future health workforce should include greater role substitution and skill transference across professions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The early management of orthopaedic referrals by physiotherapists is one example. Physiotherapists have demonstrated high levels of agreement with orthopaedic surgeons in the diagnosis and management of orthopaedic conditions of the hip, knee
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and shoulder
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Orthopaedic models of care involving extended scope physiotherapy practice have also reported reduced costs, reduced waiting times and improved health outcomes; however, the quality of this evidence to date is generally low
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Corticosteroid injection by specially trained physiotherapists has been formally available in the UK since 2000 with a good safety record
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Contemporary UK laws and service delivery models permit appropriately trained physiotherapists autonomy in areas of prescribing, injecting, investigation and referral. In contrast, physiotherapists in Australia are prevented by legislation from prescribing and administering medicines. They are also hindered in requesting radiologist injection or referring to other specialties by Medicare funding rules, which require that the request be made by a doctor. While early physiotherapist assessment of orthopaedic patients has been implemented in some Australian hospitals, patients in need of specific pharmaceuticals or invasive procedures such as injection are typically returned to waiting lists because their needs are beyond the scope of Australian physiotherapists. This presents a service gap in comparison to UK models of care, particularly with regards to some orthopaedic conditions such as subacromial impingement syndrome of the shoulder.</p><p>Shoulder pain is a common problem, with a population prevalence of 20 to 33%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], annual prevalence of 2.4% and an annual general practitioner (GP) care-seeking incidence of 1.5%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Subacromial impingement syndrome encompasses multifactorial pathology and is the most frequent cause of shoulder pain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Injection of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic to the subacromial space, sometimes combined with physiotherapy, is a common management strategy supported by clinical
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and economic evidence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The management of shoulder pain by Australian GPs is reported to be highly variable, often suboptimal and characterised by a high reliance upon specialist referral
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Yet, despite shoulder pain being one of the most frequent orthopaedic conditions referred to physiotherapists working in early-access orthopaedic services in Australia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], these physiotherapists are unable to provide corticosteroid injection, resulting in delayed care for these patients. The capacity for injection delivery by physiotherapists in Australia may provide a solution; however, little is known of the clinical and economic outcomes of this model of care.</p><p>Existing literature concerning corticosteroid injection by physiotherapists is sparse and generally low quality. Positive health outcomes and the absence of adverse events have been reported; however, data are greatly limited to observational reports
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. No clinical trials have yet directly investigated corticosteroid injection by physiotherapists. Some information pertaining to corticosteroid injection by physiotherapists may be inferred from studies into physiotherapist-led orthopaedic models of care that have included physiotherapist injection amongst treatments provided. One unblinded randomised clinical trial utilised superiority statistics and reported that partially supervised physiotherapist care was not significantly different to that of junior orthopaedic doctors in terms of health outcomes or patient satisfaction, but hospital costs were lower because physiotherapists requested fewer X-rays. In this study, some participants in the physiotherapy group received corticosteroid injection but the study did not report the body region injected, nor whether the physiotherapist actually delivered the injection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Another unblinded (and non-randomised) clinical trial compared physiotherapist management of selected orthopaedic referrals to that of junior doctors and included physiotherapist corticosteroid injection as a treatment option. However, satisfaction and health outcome measures were not described and, again, the region of the injection was not reported
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Physiotherapists delivered injections in a shoulder treatment trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] but the efficacy of the physiotherapist as the provider of the injection was not investigated.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this trial is to investigate the clinical and economic feasibility of a physiotherapist undertaking patient selection, and prescribing and delivering subacromial corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection to the shoulder in an Australian public hospital setting. The primary aim of the study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of subacromial injection for shoulder pain, as delivered by a physiotherapist versus a consultant orthopaedic surgeon. Secondary study aims are to assess the agreement between the physiotherapist and orthopaedic surgeon in patient assessment and selection for injection, to estimate the economic burden of shoulder pain for patients awaiting orthopaedic care, and to calculate the costs of physiotherapist versus orthopaedic surgeon delivery of injections for shoulder pain. In our opinion, this is a novel and innovative study in that these research questions have not previously been investigated in a specific orthopaedic condition such as shoulder pain, in comparison to a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, or with a non-inferiority design. Furthermore, physiotherapist injection has not been previously reported in an Australian orthopaedic setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>A double-blinded (patient and outcome assessor) non-inferiority randomised controlled trial design will be used to compare injection decision and delivery by an orthopaedic surgeon to a model in which the physiotherapist makes the injection decision and gives the injection. Clinical decision-making between the two clinicians will also be compared. Economic data will be obtained for calculation of disease burden and a within-trial economic evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting, process, inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The study will take place at the Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, with one upper limb staff specialist orthopaedic surgeon and one experienced physiotherapist who has prior training (in the UK) and experience in injecting and prescribing. A research assistant will identify appropriate orthopaedic referrals, contact potential participants, distribute study information, co-ordinate appointments and gain informed consent from participants for each part of the research. All participants will receive verbal and written information about the risks and benefits of participation and told that they can change their mind or withdraw at any time. Data will be stored in locked cabinets and password-protected digital files. Throughout the trial these will only be accessible by the research assistant and investigator (LB). The principal investigator will be given access at trial completion.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Part One and entry criteria for Part Two</title><p>Participants will be included in Part One, the initial assessment phase of the study, if they are aged 18&#x000a0;years and over, have a new referral from their primary care doctor to the hospital orthopaedic department for shoulder pain and have the ability to read trial literature (in English) and give consent. Participants will be excluded if they have prior knowledge of either the research physiotherapist or the research orthopaedic surgeon (for example, from previous interactions or consultation), or have had no X-ray of the shoulder in the past 12&#x000a0;months. Written informed consent for Part One will be gained by the research assistant, following which baseline demographic and outcome measure data will be collected. The orthopaedic surgeon and physiotherapist, blind to the other&#x02019;s assessment and decision, will independently examine each participant and their completed assessment forms will be compared by the research assistant. The order of examination (orthopaedic surgeon or physiotherapist first) will vary according to clinician availability. Participants will be unaware of decisions made by their first assessor while being examined by their second assessor. In bilateral presentations the side requested in the GP referral will be addressed. In bilateral referrals both sides will be assessed, the participant asked to nominate their most troublesome side and practitioners will make same-day injection decisions for one side only. Participants will be eligible to enter Part Two of the study if there is agreement between the orthopaedic surgeon and physiotherapist on the question &#x0201c;would you provide subacromial injection today?&#x0201d; In addition, Part Two participants must be able fill in the questionnaires and follow post-injection instructions. If the clinicians disagree about injection or the side to be injected or both mark &#x0201c;no&#x0201d;, the participant will take no further part in the research and receive care as directed by the surgeon. Additional exclusion criteria for entry into Part Two includes previous surgery to the involved shoulder, current use of anticoagulant medication, the need for prophylactic antibiotics with the injection, pregnancy or breastfeeding. The flow of participants into Part One and Part Two of the study are demonstrated in Figure&#x000a0;

Participants will then be randomised using concealed allocation to receive an injection from either the physiotherapist or the orthopaedic surgeon. The computer-generated randomisation sequence will be developed using Excel software by one investigator (LB) who will conceal the schedule from both the treating practitioners and the outcome assessor. Participants will be given a sealed opaque envelope by the research assistant, containing a standardised treatment sheet. This will direct the participant to one of two treatment rooms (Room A or Room B). The professional affiliation of the treating practitioner in each room will be unknown to both the study participants and the outcome assessor. Following participant randomisation to a treatment room (that is, a treating practitioner), the participant will provide written informed consent for the procedure before receiving the injection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Blinding</title><p>Throughout Part One the surgeon and the physiotherapist, blind to each other&#x02019;s findings, will assess participants independently, in separate rooms. Participants will be blind to the profession of surgeon and the physiotherapist at all times throughout the entire trial. The outcome assessor will also be blind to the treating practitioner. Physiotherapists providing post-injection care will be asked to not seek information regarding the profession of the injecting clinician and not discuss the identity or profession of injecting clinicians with participants. They will be asked to report any breaches in blinding to the research assistant. The success of blinding will be assessed immediately post-injection, and at 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks, when participants and the outcome assessor will each be asked to tick whether they think they received their injection from the physiotherapist or the surgeon. Unblinding of a participant will only be permitted in the event of an adverse event requiring management by the orthopaedic surgeon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Injection delivered by surgeon or physiotherapist</title><p>Participants will receive, from either the physiotherapist or the surgeon, 1&#x000a0;ml betamethasone (Celestone Chronodose; 5.7&#x000a0;mg/ml) mixed with 5&#x000a0;ml 1% lignocaine hydrochloride, delivered to the subacromial space via an aseptic injection technique. Methylprednisolone acetate (1&#x000a0;ml; Depo-medrol; 40&#x000a0;mg/ml) will be used as an alternative, and recorded as such, if Celestone is unavailable. Standard post-injection advice will be given verbally and through a written information sheet advising reduced activity for 1&#x000a0;week, attendance at physiotherapy, as well as recognition of, and reporting procedures, for any adverse reactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Physiotherapy</title><p>All participants who were injected will be referred for a course of physiotherapy within the hospital&#x02019;s outpatient physiotherapy department, beginning approximately 1&#x000a0;week post-injection. The injecting physiotherapist is not part of this department and will not provide post-injection treatment. Treating physiotherapists will be middle to senior outpatient staff with experience in treating musculoskeletal conditions. The treating physiotherapists will develop a consensus regarding best practice exercise and manual therapy interventions used for shoulder pain. Treatment will be delivered pragmatically with specific interventions and the number of sessions at the discretion of the treating physiotherapist. All treating physiotherapists will be directed to not deliver acupuncture to participants and this will be monitored by the research assistant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcomes will be measured at baseline, and at 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks follow-up by the blinded assessor. These time points were chosen on the basis of a previous study evaluating subacromial corticosteroid injection that found greater improvements in the injection group at 6&#x000a0;weeks than at 12&#x000a0;weeks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. At baseline the demographic, service, economic disease burden and clinical data will be recorded, including age, gender, duration of condition, imaging findings, dominant arm, affected side, medicines, occupation, shoulder-related direct and indirect costs, and usual service waiting time for care.

A Data Safety Monitoring Committee has been established comprising health service clinicians and experienced university academics, none of whom are involved in the study. Serious adverse events will be reported directly to both the Data Safety Monitoring Committee and the Human Research Ethics Committee. The biostatistician (SKN) will monitor the progress of the trial through interim statistical analyses at approximately one- and two-thirds completion. If the number of interim analyses is not small (for example, over five), the overall type I error rate could be controlled by adopting a higher level of significance for each interim statistical test
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Alternatively, a more formal alpha spending function approach
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] could be used to allocate some of the pre-specified overall type I error to each interim analysis.

This margin is specified based on clinical judgment and is approximately two-thirds of the minimum clinically important difference of 23.1 points for the SPADI at 6&#x000a0;weeks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The standard deviation is obtained by adding 25% to the reported standard deviation for the change in SPADI scores at 6&#x000a0;weeks from baseline in a previous study comparing the responsiveness for SPADI and several indices in patients with shoulder pain receiving corticosteroid injection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The power calculation is conservative in the sense that it ignores the added power inherent in the repeated measures design (assuming a first-order autoregressive covariance structure with a within-subject correlation coefficient of 0.5, the same sample size will have an increased power of above 90% using a generalised estimating equation (GEE) approach
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] for testing the difference in changes in scores between groups with two repeated follow-up measurements
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]). However, it is appropriate when treatment comparisons at the two individual time points (6&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;weeks) are performed to assess the interaction treatment effect at different time after the injection. Allowing for a drop-out rate of 15%, we will recruit a total of 64 participants (32 per group) for injection. We anticipate this will require us to assess approximately 256 participants in total, because we estimate that 25% of participants assessed will be randomised for injection. This estimate is based on a study in which an orthopaedic surgeon sent 38% of patients for subacromial injection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We anticipate some practitioner disagreement will bring the final figure to approximately 25%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis with alpha level set at 0.05.

Treatments from the two clinicians will be compared over time (pre- to post-intervention) on an intention-to-treat basis using the GEE
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] with a first-order autoregressive working correlation structure to account for within-subject correlation for repeated measurements. Robust estimator for covariance matrix will be adopted. The effects of time (within-group differences), practitioner (between-group differences), and practitioner by time interaction (between-group differences over time) will be included in all models and assessed using the Wald chi-square test. Non-inferiority of injection by physiotherapist to injection by surgeon will be declared if the upper limit of the one-sided confidence interval for the difference in mean change of SPADI in the physiotherapist group relative to the surgeon group is smaller than the non-inferiority margin of 15 points. Model fit and assumptions will be checked where appropriate within the GEE framework. The GEE approach works well with missing observations on outcome measures provided that they are missing completely at random
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], which will be tested using likelihood ratio statistics
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. If the validity of the missing completely at random assumption was violated, adjustment using weighted GEE

The time horizon for this economic evaluation will be 12&#x000a0;weeks. Direct costs will include labour costs of the clinician providing the injection, post-injection physiotherapy and change in medicine usage. Univariate, multivariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be conducted to confirm stability of results and adjust for uncertainty in clinical and economic data.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings of this study will provide further evidence informing policy makers, regulators, health professionals, and the public as to the feasibility and safety of appropriately trained physiotherapists in Australia in requesting prescribing and administering medicines. The model of care to be evaluated in this study has the potential to reduce waiting times and improve access to appropriate and expedited care for patients who presently face long orthopaedic waiting times for specialist orthopaedic services. We anticipate this will have subsequent effects in improving patient flow, which could ultimately benefit both surgical and non-surgical orthopaedic pathways. The results may also have application for the management of other musculoskeletal presentations.</p><p>A non-inferiority randomised controlled trial design was chosen as it is appropriate when comparing an alternative treatment with an established proven effective treatment for a condition, and it is hypothesised that the alternative will not be superior in efficacy to the established treatment. In this case the objective is to determine whether the alternative treatment (physiotherapist injection) is not inferior to the existing gold standard (orthopaedic surgeon injection). This is done by assessing whether the alternative treatment falls within the non-inferiority margin
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>This study will be limited by its involvement of only one injecting physiotherapist. This is necessary because there is presently no regulatory framework, recognised training curriculum or accreditation process for Australian physiotherapists to prescribe or administer medicines by injection. The physiotherapist in this study obtained governance approvals on the basis of their overseas training and is not representative of other physiotherapists in Australia. If physiotherapist-led prescribing and injecting were to be implemented on a wider scale, appropriate training and regulatory frameworks would be required.</p><p>Further potential limitations of the study include differences in practice recency and frequency between the surgeon and the physiotherapist, as governance approvals permit the physiotherapist to inject only within the trial. In contrast the surgeon has recent practice and will have regular ongoing injection practice through their work outside of the research.</p><p>In summary, several knowledge gaps will be addressed by this research. It will evaluate the safety, feasibility, and cost of physiotherapists injecting in an Australian setting. To our knowledge, it will also, for the first time, compare the decision-making processes and clinical efficacy surrounding injection by a physiotherapist to that of a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, for a specific orthopaedic condition. We believe this to be the first study of a physiotherapist injecting corticosteroid in Australia, and it could serve as a benchmark from which subsequent studies can be conceived to further our understanding of the potential health benefits of extended-scope activity within physiotherapy, as well as other allied health professions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment began in January 2013, with the first participant randomized 16 January 2013.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L</term><def><p>European quality of life (five dimensions, five levels)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p>Generalised estimating equation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPADI</term><def><p>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analogue scale.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>DM: conception and design, manuscript writing and final approval of the manuscript.
