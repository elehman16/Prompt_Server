The study followed a cross-over design protocol. Twelve elite male cyclists were randomly assigned to three groups (with recovery duration of 1, 2 and 3 min, respectively). All the subjects performed 4 repeated Wingate tests (4 &#x000d7; 30 s WT) at 48 h intervals for three different recovery periods. No significant interaction was observed between the effects of recovery duration and repetition (p&#x0003e;0.05), whereas there was a significant main effect of repetition on peak power, mean power, and a fatigue index (p&#x0003c;0.05). Peak power decreased significantly in repeated WTs with 1 and with 2 min recovery duration (p&#x0003c;0.05), but it did not change significantly in a repeated WT with 3 min recovery (p&#x0003e;0.05). In contrast, mean power decreased significantly in repeated WTs with 1, 2 and 3 min recovery duration (p&#x0003c;0.05). The fatigue index increased significantly in a repeated WT with 1 min recovery duration (p&#x0003c;0.05), but no significant difference was observed in the fatigue index in repeated WTs with 2 and 3 min recovery (p&#x0003e;0.05). In a 4 &#x000d7; 30 s WT, peak power decreased in cycles with 1 and 2 min recovery duration, but remained unchanged with 3 min recovery duration, whereas mean power decreased in all recovery duration procedures. The WT with 1 min recovery duration caused greater fatigue. Although recovery duration affected both peak power and mean power, the effect on peak power was greater.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>repeated Wingate test</kwd><kwd>recovery</kwd><kwd>anaerobic power</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Shorter recovery duration plays a decisive role in short-term high-intensity exercise in elite athletes. The nature and duration of intervening recovery periods determine the ability to produce and maintain high power output during successive sprints required in many sport events (<xref rid="b15-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Glaister, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b16-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Glaister et al., 2005</xref>). Intermittent high-intensity sprint efforts combined with short recovery periods have been identified as a key factor in physical performance (<xref rid="b19-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Cooper, 2014</xref>). Thus, numerous studies have focused on effects of a warm-up on anaerobic performance (<xref rid="b23-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Poprz&#x00119;cki et al., 2007</xref>), as well as fatigue and recovery processes in repeated-sprint performance (<xref rid="b8-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b21-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">McGawley and Bishop, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b13-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Dupont et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b20-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Kohler et al., 2010</xref>). These studies have demonstrated a decrease in repeated-sprint performance closely related to the number of repetitions, exercise duration and the subject&#x02019;s ability to recover from the periods of work.</p><p>Power output during the first 30 s in a maximal intensity exercise requires the ability to rapidly resynthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from anaerobic sources, i.e. phosphocreatine (PCr) degradation and glycolytic pathways, as well as aerobic pathways, approximately 28, 56 and 16%, respectively (<xref rid="b18-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Hultman and Sj&#x000f6;holm, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="b25-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Hill, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="b14-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al., 2005</xref>). After a maximal intensity exercise, oxygen uptake is increased during recovery due to the replenishment of tissue oxygen stores, PCr resynthesis, the removal of lactate and inorganic phosphate (<xref rid="b7-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b16-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Glaister et al., 2005</xref>). At the same time, lactate removal from the blood following exercise appears to be of great importance in improving the subsequent performance, particularly when the exercise is repeated at high intensity (<xref rid="b1-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Ahmaidi et al., 1996</xref>). Recovery duration plays a decisive role in the successful completion of these processes. Although a complete recovery affects each of these variables, the recovery of maximum power production is primarily dependent on PCr resynthesis (<xref rid="b7-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1995</xref>). Previous studies have found that the halftime of PCr resynthesis was ~22 s after maximal dynamic exercise (<xref rid="b17-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 1976</xref>); that after 30 s maximal sprint cycling, it took 1.5 min to replenish 65% of PCr stores (<xref rid="b7-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1995</xref>); and that the full return of PCr stores to resting levels took &#x0003e;3 min (<xref rid="b27-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Wragg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b26-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Spencer et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, <xref rid="b24-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Sahlin et al. (1979)</xref> reported that resynthesis of ATP to ~80&#x02013;100% of resting levels required 2&#x02013;4 min of recovery.</p><p>Repeated sprint protocols have typically involved a bout of 2 to 25 sprints of 4&#x02013;10 s (<xref rid="b27-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Wragg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b6-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="b26-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Spencer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b20-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Kohler et al., 2010</xref>). The influence of recovery duration on repeated-sprint performance has been investigated using a range of methods and recovery periods of different duration (from 2&#x02013;3 s to 120 s), with 30 s recovery being the most common (<xref rid="b6-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="b16-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Glaister et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b5-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Billaut and Basset, 2007</xref>). In those studies, repeated-sprint performances were of shorter duration, involved multiple repetitions and shorter recovery periods, as is characteristic of team sports. In contrast, relatively few studies have investigated the effect of 30 s-4 min rest periods on recovery in sprint performances with fewer repetitions and longer duration (20&#x02013;30 s) (<xref rid="b8-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b13-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Dupont et al., 2007</xref>). However, those studies focused more on different recovery types (active and passive) than on recovery duration. In a recent study, <xref rid="b10-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Glaister (2014)</xref> reported that when rest periods were short, a passive recovery strategy appeared to optimize repeated short sprint (RSS) performance, and as the recovery duration increased, subsequent RSS performance appeared to benefit from an active recovery strategy. The effect of longer recovery duration of 6&#x02013;9&#x02013;12 min in 3 &#x000d7; 45 s repeated-sprint performances has only been investigated by one previous study (<xref rid="b2-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Ainswort et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>The time ratio between recovery and exercise is a key factor in repeated-sprint performance. Thus, the present study was designed to examine the effects of various recovery duration on repeated anaerobic performance. For this purpose, the effect of recovery duration of 1, 2 and 3 min between maximal intensity exercise during a 30 s Wingate test (WT) on peak power (PP), mean power (MP), and fatigue index (FI) variables was investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>This study followed a cross-over design protocol. The 12 subjects included in the study performed 4 repeated-sprint cycle tests (Wingate protocol) at 48 hour intervals on 3 different days. The subjects were randomly assigned to three groups of four on the first test day; on each test day, while one group performed the test with 1 min recovery duration, another followed the same protocol with 2 min recovery duration, while the third group with 3 min rest periods. To avoid learning and fatigue effects, all the subjects had performed four repeated WTs at 48-hour intervals, each with different recovery duration, i.e., 1, 2 and 3 min. The subjects rested passively on the cycle ergometer seat between WTs. All WTs were performed between 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm. The subjects did not perform any other exercise 24 h pre-WTs and during the five-day WTs. All participants were instructed to avoid alcohol consumption and ensure adequate hydration 24 h before each trial and to refrain from consuming food and fluids (except water) for 2 h before each WT. The subjects ingested their daily food and fluid intake during the 24 hours before the first WT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Twelve elite male cyclists, who were national (n=10) and Olympic team (n=2, participants in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London) athletes with a minimal training load of 15 h per week during the season participated in this study.

Furthermore, pairwise analyses confirmed that PP decreased significantly in repeated WTs with 1 and 2 min recovery durations (p&#x0003c;0.05). In contrast, the unchanged PP values found in a repeated WT with 3 min recovery duration confirmed that PP was sustained during the WTs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jhk-49-171">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Significant differences were found for MP in repeated WTs with 1 (F(3,33)=43.03, p&#x0003c;0.05), 2 (F(3,33)=39.48, p&#x0003c;0.05) and 3 min recovery periods (F(3,33)=13.29, p&#x0003c;0.05).

Peak power decreased in repeated WTs with 1 and 2 min recovery periods, whereas no significant decrease was found for peak power in a repeated WT with a 3 min rest interval. The effect of recovery duration on repeated anaerobic performance had frequently been examined in studies with shorter recovery duration between relatively shorter multiple sprints. It was reported in a study of 20 &#x000d7; 5 s repeated sprints with 10 and 30 s recovery duration that 30 s recovery duration produced higher PP values (<xref rid="b13-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Dupont et al., 2007</xref>). It was also demonstrated that increased (from 10 to 50 s, with 5 s intervals) and decreased (from 50 to 10 s) recovery duration and constant recovery duration between 10 &#x000d7; 6 s cycling sprints were effective on PP, and that increasing recovery duration resulted in a smaller decrease in PP values (<xref rid="b5-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Billaut and Basset, 2007</xref>). In the current literature, maximal power output is associated primarily with resynthesis of PCr (<xref rid="b7-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1995</xref>); in addition, the half-time for PCr repletion was reported to be ~22 s or more (<xref rid="b17-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 1976</xref>), while full recovery of PCr stores required &#x0003e; 3 min (<xref rid="b22-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Meyer, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="b9-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, as the recovery duration between repetitions increased, the subsequent sprint intensity became greater due to the recovery of PCr stores. In addition, in a study on 2 &#x000d7; 8 s sprints with 15, 30, 60 and 120 s recovery duration, PP decreased with 15 s recovery in both sexes, whereas it remained unchanged in other recovery duration (<xref rid="b4-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Billaut et al., 2003</xref>). In those studies, as in the present study, the rate of decrease of PP was lower for longer recovery duration. However, repeated sprints with duration similar to this of the present study (20&#x02013;30 s) were performed with fewer repetitions (2 or 4 repetitions) and longer recovery duration (30 s &#x02013; 4 min) in those studies (<xref rid="b2-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Ainswort et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="b8-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b13-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Dupont et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b20-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Kohler et al., 2010</xref>). In the sole study in which longer repeated sprints (3 &#x000d7; 45 s, workload 53.9 N) with recovery cycling performances of different duration (6, 9 and 12 min, workload 9.8 N) were performed, the power output was significantly less on the 6 min repeated test than on the 9 and 12 min tests, and at least 9 min of recovery cycling was recommended to maintain power output on a repeated 45 s cycling test (<xref rid="b2-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Ainswort et al., 1993</xref>). As in the study by <xref rid="b2-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth (1993)</xref>, the constant peak power values found in the present study for only 3 min recovery duration suggested that longer recovery duration favorably affected the sustainability of power output. However, the studies investigating 20&#x02013;30 s repeated sprints focused more on recovery types (active and passive) than on recovery duration (<xref rid="b8-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b13-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Dupont et al., 2007</xref>). Those studies reported that a shorter passive recovery (15 s) protocol between repeated sprints resulted in greater power output values than an active recovery protocol (<xref rid="b13-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Dupont et al., 2007</xref>). In another study, active recovery with longer duration (4 min) and lower intensity in 2 &#x000d7; 30 s sprints had positive effects on anaerobic performance (<xref rid="b8-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1996</xref>). Both studies showed that passive recovery produced positive effects in shorter recovery duration to restore performance, whereas active recovery had a positive effect on anaerobic performance in longer recovery duration. In the present study, 3 min passive recovery affected peak power positively, although the study was not focused on the recovery protocol. In terms of physiological processes of recovery, this finding suggested that 3 min recovery resulted in the replenishment of tissue oxygen stores, PCr resynthesis, lactate metabolism, and the removal of inorganic phosphate (<xref rid="b7-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b14-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, MP significantly decreased in all recovery duration. Longer recovery periods between shorter repeated sprints had been found to produce a lower rate of decrease in MP values (<xref rid="b16-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Glaister et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b5-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Billaut and Basset, 2007</xref>). However, duration of the sprints performed in those studies was 8&#x02013;10 s, duration that is more likely to affect PP than MP. It had also been shown that longer recovery duration between longer repeated sprints produced a smaller decrease in MP (<xref rid="b2-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Ainswort et al., 1993</xref>). In the present study, the number and duration of repeated sprints were relatively greater. At this duration and number of repetitions, 1, 2 and 3 min recovery periods were not enough to sustain MP. The intensity of the repetitions in repeated sprints is directly related to the duration of the preceding sprint. In a study in which the power output values obtained from 30 s sprints performed after a 10 s sprint and a 20 s sprint were analyzed, it was found that the PP values for the 10 s sprint were similar to those of the subsequent 30 s sprint, however, the MP values were different. Furthermore, for the 30 s sprint performed after the 20 s sprint, both PP and MP values found for the 30 s sprint were lower than the corresponding values for the preceding 20 s sprint and lower than the corresponding values for a 30 s sprint performed after a 10 s sprint (<xref rid="b9-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1998</xref>). The decrease observed in MP in the present study is consistent with the results of previous studies. The reason for all the decreases in MP found for all recovery duration in the present study might be that restoration of MP would require higher rates of ATP regeneration. The incomplete resynthesis of PCr and a possible reduction of glycolysis (35%) owing to elevated H<sup>+</sup> are expected to reduce anaerobic ATP regeneration (51%) (<xref rid="b9-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1998</xref>), while the increase in aerobic metabolism is most likely not significant to compensate (<xref rid="b8-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanis et al., 1996</xref>). The FI values were higher only in the 1 min group. This finding suggested that 1 min recovery duration caused more fatigue. On the other hand, the fatigue index was the least reliable of the three Wingate test indices, and its validity was questioned as it largely depends on aerobic performance. Nonetheless, the validity of mean power as an index of anaerobic capacity is as questionable as the validity of the fatigue index (<xref rid="b12-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Driss and Vandewalle, 2013</xref>).</p><p>HR values after repeated WTs were similar for all recovery duration. This result indicated that cyclists generated similar metabolic responses in repeated sprints. However, HR values after recovery intervals of the 1min group were higher than those of the 2 and 3 min groups. The results of the present study showed that HR responses after WTs were similar and submaximal. <xref rid="b11-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Chamari et al. (1995)</xref> reported a submaximal HR of 83% in an exercise protocol of 6 s sprints with 5 min recovery duration. This submaximal HR response was attributed to the long recovery periods and to the test characteristics, as the test maximally involved the subject&#x02019;s muscles without overloading the cardioventilatory system (<xref rid="b11-jhk-49-171" ref-type="bibr">Chamari et al., 1995</xref>). Additionally, the same study found that HR response values for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> test and recovery were significantly higher than the 1<sup>st</sup> test and recovery values. The HR responses after recovery reported in that study were similar to those of the present study. In addition, the similar fatigue index levels observed in all recovery duration suggested that the HRs after the WT were also similar.</p><p>The present study has a few limitations. The first was the relatively small sample size of highly fit individuals, which most likely decreased our statistical power to detect repeated anaerobic performance differences in trained men. Future studies using a larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings. The second limitation was diet control: the participants were informed about dietary measures, however, diet was not controlled. Thirdly, the current data set is limited to elite athletes, and it might not be generalized to sedentary adults or elderly individuals. The major limitation may be related to the lack of biochemical evaluations, most of all LA and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> variables.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In 4 &#x000d7; 30 s repeated-sprint performances, PP decreased in 1 and 2 min recovery duration, but did not change in the 3 min recovery duration, whereas MP decreased in all recovery periods. However, repeated sprints with 1 min recovery duration resulted in greater fatigue. These results indicate that recovery duration had a greater effect on peak power than on mean power.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author thanks all the cyclists for their efforts.
