It followed by resuscitation is considered as an insult frequently induces a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that results in multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which is a major clinical problem. HS represents the acute hypovolemia and hemodynamic derangement and the mechanism is recognized to be the increasing of reactive oxygen species generation, and endothelial activation after supplementation with ambient oxygen in a prior ischemic field, and inducing many systemic inflammatory factor released[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Fish oil as pharmacological nutrients could directly and indirectly decreasing the production of inflammatory eicosanoids, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species and the expression of adhesion molecules[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Pscheidl EM et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and Pscheidl E et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have shown that fish oil not only attenuates inflammatory reactions, but ameliorates host defense and even improves splanchnic blood flow. Anti-inflammatory properties and benefit in splanchnic blood flow by fish oil could be protective for these tissue in ischemia/re-perfusion (I/R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Accordingly, this maybe a new approach to alleviate inflammation and hemodynamic stabilization in HS treatment. However, almost researches were focused on the pre-feeding of fish oil and few articles were after HS treatment.</p><p>So, our hypothesis was that infusion of fish oil before resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock rats, would help to minimize the post-resuscitation inflammatory responses and to stabilize hemodynamics.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals and methods</title><sec><title>Rat model of Hemorrhagic Shock and Resuscitation</title><p>Forty-eight male SD rats of a mean(&#x000b1; SD) weight of 269.26 &#x000b1; 12.68 g were used. Animals were provided by Medical Experiment Animal Center of Jinling Hospital(Nanjing, China). Temperature range between at 25&#x000b0;C-28&#x000b0;C with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Rats were allowed free access to water and chow. The protocol were approved by the institutional animal care committee.</p><p>HS/R model: All rats were anesthetized with 60 mg/kg ketamine intramuscular injection and placed on a temperature-controlled heating pads, which was heated while shock was induced and temperature was sustained 37&#x000b0;C. The left femoral artery and femoral vein were exposed and cannulated through a short incision[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Heparin (200 U/kg) was infused immediately through femoral vein following cannulation. The artery catheter was connected to a multi-channel recorder (Electronics for Medicine, TX) for the monitoring of systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures (MAP) per 3 minutes, heart rate(HR) was also measured. The target MAP(35 ~ 40 mm Hg) was induced by removing blood slowly through the femoral vein cannula during a total time of 15 minutes and maintained at 35 to 40 mm Hg for 60 minutes. The animals in shock group were induced without resuscitation and killed at the end of shock instantly. At the point of 75 minute, resuscitation which would take 30 minutes and begin by returning half of the shed blood to the animal at the speed of 0.5 mL/min and giving Ringer's solution was carried out in HSR group and FO group. And Infusion was withheld if MAP exceeded 90% of baseline and re-started if declined. The rats in FO group were injected by fish oil (0.2 g/Kg) through the caudal vena at 45th minute. The rats in sham group were cannulated without inducing of shock and kept anesthetized for a same length of time with other groups'. At the end of 30 minutes of resuscitation, half of the animals of these three groups were randomly sacrificed to collect blood samples, and the others were killed at the end of 4 hours. The 2-3 ml sample was centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C. After centrifugation, serum was kept refrigerated at -80&#x000b0;C until assayed.

And an increase in systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines was associated with cellular injury and remote organ dysfunction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. On this concept, the routine clinical medical treatment should minimize excessive inflammatory reaction induced by ischemia/re-perfusion. Many animal studies published so far, have shown the advantage of fish oil on ischemia/re-perfusion and hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation through alleviating the inflammatory response and organ protection. Similarly, several clinical studies have confirmed that fish oil may decrease inflammatory cytokine release in several diseases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and improves splanchnic blood flow[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the benefits of clinical use of fish oil in HS/R patients remains unclear, which in part prompted the present study.</p><p>The present study found that during shock induction the blood volume withdrawn were same in every group. And the volume in FO group at shock maintenance was slightly more than the other groups', although without statistically significant(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The probable reason is that the infusion of fish oil increased volume loss for maintenance of shock in FO group.</p><p>The use of fish oil was associated with hemodynamic stability. In fact, the FO group required less resuscitation fluid than HS/R group, and had higher urinary output at the recovery from hemorrhagic shock than HS and HS/R groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, we could find that there was no difference in MAP among the groups at the end of resuscitation, but after that the MAP of HS/R group and FO group both dropped without intervention. So the four time points were selected to analyze the MAP in each group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Except the 105th min, at other three time points, the MAPs in FO group were higher than HS/R group's. Meanwhile, the MAP of HS/R group was dramatically decreased and significantly less than the MAP in the previous time points. It may be argued that it merely was the extra infusion of fish oil improved the MAP in FO group. There are three reasons advocating that not the infusion of itself, but the pharmacological effects of fish oil worked. Firstly, during the infusion of fish oil, the MAP was maintained by withdrawing and infusion blood through femoral vein and the loss volumes during shock have no significantly difference between HS/R group and FO group. Secondly, at the end of resuscitation each group has the same MAP. Thirdly, the intravenous supply of fish oil can lead to a change in membrane FA patterns after a short time(3-5 hours)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], exerts anti-inflammatory and alters spectrum of metabolites in the situation of inflammatory stimulation. Moreover, the bolus administration of FO solution in rats achieves incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into cell membranes after only 60 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. So, these three causes provide a credence to the aspect that the pharmacological effects rather than the infusion itself ameliorated the MAP.</p><p>Additionally, at 30 minutes post-resuscitation, the levels of IL-6, MDA and MPO in FO group were significantly lower than HS group's and HS/R group's, but this difference was not found in TNF-&#x003b1;. At 4 hours post-resuscitation, the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, MDA and MPO in FO group were dramatically lower than those in HS group, and the levels of IL-6, MDA and MPO were lower than HS/R group's. The "classic" explanation for the effects of fish oil on regulation of inflammatory host responses is that the administration of fish oil inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, and seems to positively modulate the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Ertel et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] pre-fed mice with fish oil for 3 weeks, subjected them to HS/R, and harvested peritoneal macrophages at 24 hours post-resuscitation. They found that fish oil prevented an increase in levels of circulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release seen in mice fed with corn oil or safflower oil.</p><p>In this study, we observed that the concentration of endotoxin in FO group was significantly lower than shock group and HS/R groups. The reason should be that intestinal ischemia/reperfusion results in damage to the intestinal mucosa, with loss of barrier function for endogenous bacteria. This means that bacteria and toxins from the intestine can be translocated into the bloodstream and other organs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. But the administration of fish oil promoted intestinal blood flow in the rats and thus possibly prevented the destruction of intestinal barrier function associated with ischemia/reperfusion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A study with endotoxemia rats confirmed the positive effects of fish oil infusion on the microcirculation in the splanchnic area, and the number of viable bacteria in the liver and small bowel lymph node were significantly reduced[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>At the same time, we found that the concentration of endotoxin in FO group at 4 hours point was dramatically higher than sham group, however there is no difference in oxidative stress and Inflammatory indexes between them. Why the rats in FO group have slightly pathological changing with obvious endotoxemia? This phenomenon might ascribe to the blunting of the response to endotoxin and reducing of inflammatory release. Pittet. YK et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] have proved that 0.2 g/Kg perfusion of fish oil immediately (2 hours before endotoxemia) can blunted the response to endotoxin in healthy subjects after 3 hours. Once fish oil administrated, the fatty acids it contained would incorporate into cell membrane phospholipids and play key roles in physicochemical and functional characteristics of the cell membranes. It can modify macrophage membranes and reduce its phagocytosis and adhesion function, and decreases the mortality and severity of SIRS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Mayer et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have shown that several hours of parenteral nutrition with fish oil significantly decreases the &#x003c9;-6/&#x003c9;-3 FA ratio in the plasma-free FA fraction and in the monocyte membrane lipid pool which was associated with a suppression of monocyte generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, Interleukin-1, -6, -8) in response to endotoxin. Oz et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] showed that 6 days of a fish oil diet could protect rats from the hepatic damage associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.</p><p>In this study, the HS rats were resuscitated with half of the shed blood and Ringer's solution and administered fish oil before resuscitation in order to ensure the model simulates clinical practicing. The results from the present study support our hypothesis that treatment with fish oil can alter the inflammatory response to HS/R, blunt the response to endotoxin and improve the hemodynamic stabilization after resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study firstly demonstrates that infusion of fish oil before resuscitation not only can alter the inflammatory response to HS/R but also blunt the response to endotoxin. Finally, the alleviation of inflammatory response and endotoxemia results in hemodynamic stabilization.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Alam</surname><given-names>HB</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><article-title>New developments in fluid resuscitation</article-title><source>Surg Clin North Am</source><year>2007</year><volume>87</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>55</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><comment>vi</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.suc.2006.09.015</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17127123</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Jarrar</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaudry</surname><given-names>IH</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><article-title>Organ dysfunction following hemorrhage and sepsis: mechanisms and therapeutic approaches (Review)</article-title><source>Int J Mol Med</source><year>1999</year><volume>4</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>575</fpage><lpage>583</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10567665</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Baue</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><article-title>Multiple organ failure, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome-where do we stand?</article-title><source>Shock</source><year>1994</year><volume>2</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>385</fpage><lpage>397</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/00024382-199412000-00001</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7743367</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Deitch</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><article-title>Multiple organ failure.
