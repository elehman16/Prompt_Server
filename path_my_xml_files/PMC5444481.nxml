Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies have shown that Gla-300 is released from the subcutaneous depot at the injection site more gradually than Gla-100, resulting in a prolonged and more constant pharmacokinetic profile with a duration of action that extends beyond 24&#x02009;h.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref></sup> As a result, Gla-300 is able to maintain blood glucose control for up to 36&#x02009;h after administration.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The efficacy and safety of Gla-300 versus Gla-100 has been compared in six multinational, open-label studies in the EDITION phase 3a clinical program, which included trials evaluating patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and patients from different regions.

In both trials, glycemic control was comparable between Gla-300 and Gla-100 at 6 months, but patients treated with Gla-300 experienced fewer nocturnal confirmed (&#x02264;3.9&#x02009;mmol/L) or severe hypoglycemia events compared with patients treated with Gla-100.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, patients receiving Gla-300 gained less weight, a difference that reached statistical significance in EDITION 2.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is a tool used by managed healthcare organizations to assess real-world performance of care and service, and to document health plan performance in diabetes care.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> NCQA HEDIS 2014 diabetes criteria take patient age and comorbidities into account and are used to stratify patients as either low risk (LR) or high risk (HR); this can then be used to assign individualized HbA1c targets (&#x0003c;7.0% [53&#x02009;mmol/mol)] for LR patients or &#x0003c;8.0% [64&#x02009;mmol/mol] for HR patients) to assist in personalizing patient management, as recommended in the 2015 joint position statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD).<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>In the present study, real-world diabetes performance measures based on ADA guidelines and selected NCQA HEDIS 2014 diabetes management criteria were applied to post hoc analyses of datasets from the EDITION 2 and 3 clinical trials to assess glycemic control and the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with T2D.

The percentage of patients who achieved the primary composite endpoint of target HbA1c without confirmed or severe hypoglycemia at 6 months was higher in the Gla-300-treated group compared with Gla-100, however, this only reached statistical significance in the LR group of the EDITION 3 study. Similarly, a higher percentage of LR and HR patients treated with Gla-300 achieved the composite endpoint of target HbA1c without nocturnal hypoglycemia than those treated with Gla-100, but neither comparison reached statistical significance. Changes in HbA1c from baseline were similar in both LR and HR patients treated with either Gla-300 or Gla-100, regardless of prior insulin experience. Since the improvement in glycemic control was similar in all cohorts, these findings were driven by the difference in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia rates, of confirmed or severe, and nocturnal hypoglycemia, tended to be lower in patients treated with Gla-300 in both risk cohorts of EDITION 2 and EDITION 3 trials.</p><p>Although large clinical trials have improved our clinical understanding of the potential benefits and risks associated with intensive glycemic control,<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref></sup> and the current ADA/EASD guidelines for T2D recommend individualizing glycemic targets,<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> there are limited data to guide patients and clinicians in both the clinical trial and real-world settings. The NCQA HEDIS quality care measures have been designed to determine appropriate HbA1c targets based on age and the presence of comorbidities, and can therefore be used as a tool to classify patients according to risk, and consequently, to set individual target levels for glycemic control a priori. A recent cross-sectional, observational study modeling a similar stratification technique based on age and comorbidities found that up to one-third of patients with diabetes in a primary care setting would be reclassified from having uncontrolled to controlled glycemia using this approach, without differentially affecting vulnerable patient subgroups (e.g., patients with low socioeconomic status) who may potentially benefit greatly from early intervention to achieve good glycemic control early in the disease process.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>The individualization of patient glycemic targets is in line with the &#x0201c;Triple Aim&#x0201d; concept of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. This aims to simultaneously improve the health of the U.S. population, improve the individual experience of care, and reduce the <italic>per capita</italic> cost of healthcare.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The use of less stringent HbA1c targets (8.0% [64&#x02009;mmol/mol]) for patients who are older, or who have comorbidities as indicated by the NCQA HEDIS performance criteria, is particularly relevant to this. Reducing hypoglycemia in HR groups, while maintaining sufficient glycemic control, is likely to improve overall population health and individual care experience, and minimize management costs.</p><p>Importantly, the principal costs of care associated with insulin use are due not only to costs of the medicine, but also to the high cost of treating diabetes treatment-related complications such as hypoglycemia.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Thus, healthcare costs may be reduced by adopting insulin treatment and dosing strategies associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, patients at HR of hypoglycemia, such as the elderly and those with multiple comorbidities, are at significant risk of further complications (falls, fractures, and vascular disease) as a consequence of repeat hypoglycemia episodes and therefore more likely to benefit from reducing the risk of a hypoglycemia event.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Thus, in the context of both the &#x0201c;Triple Aim&#x0201d; strategy and the current guidelines on diabetes management from the ADA/EASD, the reduction of hypoglycemia, along with HbA1c control, is clearly an important component in the management of T2D. In this study, notwithstanding the similar glycemic control achieved with Gla-300 and Gla-100, a consistent trend toward lower rates of confirmed or severe hypoglycemia, and nocturnal hypoglycemia, was observed with Gla-300 compared with Gla-100 in both LR and HR patients, regardless of prior insulin experience. The consistency in the findings between LR and HR patients also indicates that the benefit associated with Gla-300 persists at stringent (&#x0003c;7% [53&#x02009;mmol/mol] for LR) and more conservative target HbA1c levels (&#x0003c;8% [64&#x02009;mmol/mol] for HR). Although the post hoc arbitrary separation of patients into LR and HR cohorts does not represent real-world management practices, and the advantages in terms of a reduction in hypoglycemia with Gla-300 did not reach significance for the HR patients, the data from this analysis may be used to inform prospective real-world trials currently in progress for Gla-300. Such real-world studies include the ongoing ACHIEVE CONTROL,<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> REACH CONTROL, and REGAIN CONTROL studies that aim to compare the clinical effectiveness of Gla-300 with other basal insulins in a standard care setting and to capture additional measures relating to healthcare resource utilization and patient-reported outcomes.</p><p>This study presented several limitations. Most importantly, the subdivision of each study population in EDITION 2 and EDITION 3 into LR and HR cohorts and the overall relatively low rate of both confirmed or severe hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia resulted in very limited power to detect clinically relevant differences in outcomes between groups. Additionally, the treat-to-target design used in the EDITION 2 and EDITION 3 trials may have contributed to limited power due to small differences in glycemic outcomes as a result of the design. Furthermore, there would have been a bias toward patients largely being classified as LR because of the inclusion/exclusion criteria in the EDITION 2 and EDITION 3 trials (e.g., EDITION 2 and 3 excluded patients with a history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease; patients with stroke were also excluded from EDITION 2).</p><p>Sample sizes were relatively small because of variation within the populations. Indeed, numbers of patients in each category separated by both study and risk group were small. Although the decision to analyze subgroups within each of the two EDITION trials separately (rather than pooling data for the EDITION 2 and 3 populations as a whole) was justified because of the differences in patient characteristics and treatment backgrounds between the two trials, it may be an important factor contributing to the reduced power of the study. The combination of these factors may have affected the statistical power of this analysis. This exploratory post hoc analysis also involved retrospective reassignment of HbA1c goals for the HR group. These patients were still treated to meet a &#x0201c;stringent&#x0201d; goal during the study, thus hypoglycemia rates could have been even lower if they had been treated to reach this more &#x0201c;liberal&#x0201d; goal.</p><p>The study was also designed to show noninferiority. In clinical practice, there is always a trade-off between glycemic control and avoidance of hypoglycemia, but this balance may not have been implemented in a trial setting. Hypoglycemic events may have been under-reported if patients treated their symptoms without confirmation of hypoglycemia through the measurement of blood glucose levels. Moreover, the incidence of patient-reported hypoglycemia symptoms without SMBG confirmation was not reported in this post hoc analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, the assessment of diabetes performance measures to guide treatment strategy in a real-world setting is an important consideration for healthcare decision makers in diabetes management. The findings from this retrospective analysis of phase 3a data point to a nonsignificant but consistent trend, suggesting that Gla-300 might reduce the clinical and economic burden of hypoglycemia compared with Gla-100 in patients with T2D irrespective of whether they are classed as LR or HR based on age- and NCQA HEDIS-derived comorbidities. Future planned or ongoing real-world studies are required to confirm this potential clinical advantage of Gla-300, which has important implications for diabetes management. In the meantime, current evidence suggests that basal insulin treatment with Gla-300 is effective and safe for use in LR and HR patients alike, with the potential to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia compared with Gla-100.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s018" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The contents of this article and the opinions expressed within are those of the authors, and it was the decision of the authors to submit the article for publication.
