Detailed run-in data were not collected but the majority of patients had received TOBI for 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;years (median 2&#x02005;years). Most events diminished after 28&#x02005;days when they were similar to the levels seen with TIS. A long-term study is necessary to monitor possible long-term effects.</p><p>One suggested advantage of inhaled therapies is that they deliver a higher fraction of drug to the bronchopulmonary system, although part is inevitably lost through impact with tissues in the mouth and pharynx. In this study the levels were measured using a single-reference microbiological assay, the only available validated assay at the time, which is now thought to lack sensitivity and precision (lower limit of quantification=0.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/ml). However, the results do confirm previously reported findings. An ongoing study using improved assay techniques will be reporting soon.</p><p>Inhalation time with older nebulisers is up to 20&#x02005;min twice a day, although newer models are much quicker. A clean environment is required to prepare the solution, and regular cleaning is required to avoid the apparatus becoming a source of infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> The compressor also requires regular maintenance.</p><p>Users of inhaled dry powder devices should be able to take an effective dose of one capsule in around 1&#x02005;min. Administration of a dose from the TOBI Podhaler, the dry powder formulation of tobramycin, requires 6&#x02013;7&#x02005;min as four capsules are inhaled for each dose;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Colobreathe only requires one capsule per dose. No special storage conditions are required for the Colobreathe capsules. The Turbospin device is cleaned with a dry wipe and does not require washing. It is discarded after 28 days&#x02019; use, but remains effective during this period without any clogging of the delivery mechanism.</p><p>Patients in this study rated CDPI more highly for ease of use. Although adherence and the possible impact on long-term efficacy were not measured in this study, other studies have shown that improved convenience and reduced complexity of treatment can have a positive impact on adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>

The Results section of the abstract have been updated to read: After logarithmic transformation of data due to a non-normal distribution, adjusted mean difference between treatment groups (CDPI vs TIS) in change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1% predicted) at week 24 was -0.98% (95% CI -2.74% to 0.86%) in the intention-totreat population (n=373). The Efficacy section has been updated to read: The adjusted mean difference between the groups in the change in FEV1% predicted at week 24 was therefore -0.98% (95% CI -2.74% to 0.86% (ITT LOCF)). The lower limit of the 95% CI (-2.71%, for patients who completed the study).
