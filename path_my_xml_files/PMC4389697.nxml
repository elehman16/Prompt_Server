It is estimated that VVA affects up to approximately 40&#x02013;50% of postmenopausal women<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Women can now expect to spend more than one-third of their lives in a postmenopausal state due to an increased life expectancy<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, the proper diagnosis and treatment of VVA have become increasingly important in the care of postmenopausal women<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p>Multiple studies have demonstrated the negative impact of VVA on quality of life and sexual function in postmenopausal women<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. REVIVE, a survey of 3046 menopausal women, found that VVA significantly interferes with overall healthy sexual functioning<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. A separate study, the Menopause Epidemiology study, evaluated 1480 postmenopausal women; respondents reporting sexual dysfunction were 3.84 times more likely to have VVA<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The CLOSER survey found that VVA-related painful sex negatively affected relationships for both male and female partners<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and a survey of 363 sexually active women found that more frequent dyspareunia was associated with less frequent sexual intercourse<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Currently available treatment options for postmenopausal VVA include over-the-counter products (e.g. vaginal lubricants and moisturizers), systemic hormonal therapies (when treatment of other menopausal symptoms is needed), vaginal estrogen therapies (intravaginal tablets, rings, and creams), and ospemifene (for dyspareunia)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Oral and local estrogen therapies have been reported to improve sexual functioning in some studies but not in others. The reasons for the inconsistent findings are not clear. One hypothesis is that the increase in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels after oral estrogen therapies results in a decreased bioavailability of testosterone, which may impact the assessment of sexual function<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p><p>Various assessment tools have been used to measure factors associated with female sexual dysfunction (FSD). The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was developed as a brief, easy-to-administer, self-report tool for assessing key dimensions or domains of sexual function and quality of life (Arousal, Desire, Orgasm, Lubrication, Satisfaction, and Pain) in various populations of women<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The FSFI questionnaire has been used in postmenopausal women, although it has not been specifically validated in a VVA population. Other assessment tools were developed prior to the revision of sexual disorder classifications but do not address some aspects of the current definitions. For example, to increase clinical relevance, the FSFI domains of Desire and Arousal were separated to allow factors such as lubrication or subjective arousal/desire to be measured as separate, nuanced responses to sexual stimulation.</p><p>Ospemifene is an oral, non-estrogen, tissue selective estrogen agonist/antagonist approved in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia associated with VVA due to menopause<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. A phase-3, randomized, double-blind clinical trial assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ospemifene in the treatment of postmenopausal VVA<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.

The co-primary endpoints of the trial have been previously reported<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Among the secondary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in total score (at Weeks 4 and 12), change from baseline in the domains of the FSFI (at Weeks 4 and 12), and change from baseline in serum sex hormones (at Week 12).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>FSFI assessments</title><p>Study participants completed the FSFI questionnaire at baseline, Week 4, and Week 12 (or last observation carried forward, LOCF). The questionnaire consisted of 19 questions, each rated on a scale ranging from 0 to 5 or 1 to 5, with 0 indicating no sexual activity in the past month (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Scores for each of the six domains were calculated in the standard fashion by adding individual domain question scores and multiplying by the domain factor (i.e. 0.6 for Desire, 0.3 for Arousal and Lubrication, and 0.4 for Orgasm, Satisfaction, and Pain). The total FSFI score is the sum of the scores for the six individual domains. Of a total possible score of 36, 26.55 or less is considered to constitute sexual dysfunction in a population of premenopausal and postmenopausal women<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.

These symptoms are directly related to the physiological changes of the vaginal epithelium (e.g. thinning, narrowing, reduced elasticity, and increased vaginal pH) due to a decrease in circulating estrogen levels after menopause<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The link between postmenopausal VVA and FSD has been demonstrated<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. An epidemiologic study in sexually active postmenopausal women examined the relationship between VVA (defined as pain, itching, and dryness associated with sexual activity) and sexual dysfunction (desire, arousal, and orgasm) using the Arizona Sexual Experience questionnaire<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The prevalences of sexual dysfunction (55%) and VVA (57%) were similar and there was substantial overlap of the two conditions (40% of the study participants had both conditions). The authors of that study concluded that the pain associated with VVA may preclude women from desiring, initiating, or responding to sexual activity. Nonetheless, 52% of menopausal women aged 50&#x02013;79 years in the Women's Health Initiative Observational study reported that they had been sexually active with a partner in the past year<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and most published literature suggests that approximately 10&#x02013;30% of women over 70 years of age still engage in sexual intercourse<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Therefore, one may hypothesize that therapies aimed at improving VVA symptoms may help maintain life-long sexuality and potentially improve sexual function. A recent Cochrane review<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> found that estrogen alone or in combination with progestogens (EPT) was associated with a small to moderate improvement in sexual function, and the review reported data on selective estrogen receptor modulators and sexual function to be limited and inconclusive. Some studies with EPT have also failed to detect corresponding improvements in sexual satisfaction, even when VVA was improved<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, since the Women's Health Initiative, substantial numbers of women have declined to initiate or continue estrogen-based therapies and are seeking alternatives<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>Ospemifene, an oral non-estrogen drug with tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist effects, exerts an agonistic effect on vaginal epithelial tissue<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Previously published results of this phase-3 trial demonstrated that ospemifene 60 mg/day was effective in improving physiological vaginal changes (maturation index and pH)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and, for participants with an MBS of dyspareunia, significantly reduced the severity of dyspareunia<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p>This trial also evaluated the effect of ospemifene on FSFI scores, a pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint, as reported in the current article. Treatment with ospemifene led to significantly greater improvements, compared with placebo, in total FSFI composite score and individual FSFI domain scores for the ITT population. In general, improvements were observed as early as Week 4 and continued to increase in magnitude up to Week 12. Although underpowered, exploratory subgroup analyses were carried out to evaluate dyspareunia and dryness strata, in hysterectomized as well as non-hysterectomized participants. Statistically significant improvements in FSFI scores were observed in the dyspareunia stratum. However, women in the vaginal dryness stratum had numerical improvements in FSFI scores that did not reach statistical significance. Both subgroups of women, with or without an intact uterus, had significant improvements in FSFI scores with ospemifene treatment. Overall, results were highly consistent across FSFI domains and patient subgroups.</p><p>Serum levels of some hormones (e.g. testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone) are known to affect FSFI scores<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In the current study, clinically non-relevant increases in mean total testosterone and moderate increases in mean SHBG were observed in women receiving ospemifene; mean estradiol and free testosterone levels were unchanged, whereas mean FSH and LH levels had a clinically non-relevant decrease with ospemifene treatment. These data suggest that the significant improvements in FSFI scores noted in women treated with ospemifene were unlikely to be attributed to changes in serum sex hormone levels, but rather appear to be due to the positive effects of ospemifene on the physiology of the vaginal epithelium (maturation index and vaginal pH) and the VVA symptom of dyspareunia. It is important to note that treatment with ospemifene resulted in improvement not only in pain and lubrication, but also in the scores in all six FSFI domains. Since a systemic non-steroidal ligand such as ospemifene might have selective genomic or non-genomic effects on genital, extragenital, and central nervous system tissues, other potential central and peripheral mechanisms for the improved sexual response and function demonstrated here deserve further study<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p><p>The data reported here have several limitations. First, although the FSFI is a widely used tool that has been documented in more than 700 publications and validated in the postmenopausal population, it has not been validated specifically in a VVA population such as the one analyzed here. Second, the change in FSFI score was pre-specified as a secondary efficacy endpoint for this phase-3 trial but was not a primary outcome. Third, the subgroup analyses presented here were underpowered and were performed solely for hypothesis generation. Fourth, the FSFI data are based on patient self-reported diaries with the known potential inconsistencies of diary data. Additionally, the evaluation of serum hormones could have potentially been imprecise due to the inexact timing of sample collection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s13"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In a phase-3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trial, oral ospemifene 60 mg/day demonstrated significant improvements in the co-primary endpoints of physiological vaginal changes in postmenopausal women with VVA due to menopause and reduced severity of dyspareunia. Treatment with ospemifene also significantly improved the total FSFI score and FSFI domain scores in the ITT population and in the dyspareunia stratum. There was no apparent relationship between serum hormone levels and changes in FSFI scores.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title/><p><italic>Conflict of interest</italic> GDC: Consultant for: Shionogi Inc.; SAK: Consultant for: Apricus, Emotional Brain, Palatin, Novo Nordisk, Shionogi Inc., Sprout, Pfizer, SST, and Teva; DJP: Consultant for: Shionogi Inc., Sprout, Palatin, Noven, Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Actavis, Exploramed.
