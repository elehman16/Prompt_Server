A large proportion of infants (36&#x02013;55%) in Bangladesh is born with low birthweight. Nutritional status of women during pregnancy is critical for optimal growth and development of the fetus. Nutrition education has been found to improve maternal nutritional status. Our study aims to determine whether nutrition education with a practical demonstration during pregnancy is an effective intervention for improving the birthweight of infants compared with standard nutrition education only.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>We will conduct a community-based cluster randomised controlled trial in one rural district of Bangladesh. Treatments will be allocated evenly between the study clusters (n=36). Participants in the intervention clusters receive &#x02018;balanced plate nutrition education&#x02019; with a practical demonstration from community health workers 4&#x02013;7 times throughout their entire pregnancy, starting from the first trimester. The control clusters will receive standard nutrition education delivered by public and other healthcare providers as per ongoing antenatal care protocol. Our sample size would be 900 pregnant women to determine 100 g differences in mean birthweight, considering 5% type 1 error, 80% power and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.03. The primary outcome of the trial is birthweight of the infants and the secondary outcomes include daily caloric intake and dietary diversity score among the pregnant women. Outcomes will be measured at enrolment, third to ninth month of gestation (monthly) and at delivery. Community health workers blinded to the study hypothesis will collect all data.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the James P Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University Ethical Review Committee, Dhaka, Bangladesh. We will communicate the final results to relevant research and public health groups and publish research papers in peer-reviewed journals.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12616000080426.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>low birthweight</kwd><kwd>pregnant women</kwd><kwd>balanced plate</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>James P.

LBW indirectly accounts for 60% of the deaths among neonates and more than 13&#x02009;million disability adjusted life years among children aged less than five years.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> LBW significantly impacts on health throughout the life course; in childhood it causes hyperactivity and inattention, emotional and behavioural problems and poor educational attainment,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> while in adulthood it leads to the development of chronic diseases<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and lower economic productivity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is the probable cause of LBW in babies born at term (&#x02265;37 weeks of gestation)<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; this may be partly due to the impairment of the placental development and function in the presence of maternal undernutrition.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There is strong evidence that poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy leads to intrauterine growth restriction and thus LBW.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> Thirteen percent of Bangladeshi women of reproductive age (15&#x02013;49 years) are short statured (height &#x0003c;145&#x02009;cm) and 19% are thin (body mass index &#x0003c;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>),<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> which indicates that these women enter pregnancy with chronic undernutrition. Moreover, in Bangladesh during pregnancy women consume far less than the recommended dietary energy. Alam and colleagues found that the average daily energy intake among Bangladeshi women in late pregnancy was 1464&#x000b1;416 kcal per day, much lower than the recommendation of ~2500&#x02009;kcal.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Among women from low-income families, diets lack protein and micronutrients.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Dietary diversity, which is believed to be strongly associated with nutrient adequacy, was 4.5 (out of nine food subgroups) in women&#x02019;s regular diet in rural Bangladesh.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This nutritional deprivation during pregnancy may impair placental development, leading to reduced nutrient transfer to the fetus and ultimately to IUGR.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A longitudinal study conducted in Iran between 2009 and 2010 found that energy and protein intake was associated with the birthweight of infants. Pregnant women who consumed 1794&#x000b1;54&#x02009;kcal per day gave birth to neonates with a mean birthweight of 2600 g, whereas pregnant women who consumed 2698&#x000b1;107&#x02009;kcal gave birth to neonates with a mean birth- weight of 3600 g. Similarly, an increase in protein intake from 38.7&#x000b1;4.7&#x02009;g to 72.8&#x000b1;7.4 g per day was associated with an increased birthweight from 2500 g to 3400 g.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Antenatal nutrition education has been found to improve dietary behaviour and significantly increase total energy intake (from 2269 to 2431 kcal per day, p&#x0003c;0.05) among low-income pregnant women.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A systematic review examined the effect of antenatal nutrition education on birthweight of infants and found a significant increase in birthweight by 105 g. However, the stratified analysis showed that the effect was significant only for high-income countries and when nutrition education was provided with nutritional supplementation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A Cochrane review reported a significant increase in birthweight among undernourished women who received nutrition education (difference in mean 490 g; 95%&#x02009;CI 428-552 g), while no significant increase was observed for adequately nourished women.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These findings are based on studies with some methodological weaknesses including small sample size or few events and quasi-experimental studies or randomised controlled trials with design or analysis limitations.</p><p>Bangladesh has had a large-scale community-based nutrition programme since 1995 and mainstreamed antenatal nutrition education and supplementation programmes since 2010.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Despite these programmes, the LBW rate still remains a public health concern, estimated at 36&#x02013;55%.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> In this context, innovative interventions are needed to accelerate reductions in LBW at the population level to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal targets of nutrition by 2030.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Shifting from conventional nutrition education and food supplementation to more effective enhanced nutrition education could be one of the potential sustainable ways of improving dietary behaviour during pregnancy and to increase birthweight at the population level.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Study objectives and hypothesis</title><p>We have designed a nutrition education intervention that actively teaches and empowers pregnant women to prepare their own balanced plate of food that includes an appropriate selection of items with maximisation of diversity and adequate portion size from foods readily available in their kitchen. The objective of the study is to compare the impact of this &#x02018;balanced plate nutrition education&#x02019; approach with the standard nutrition education programme for pregnant women on their dietary behaviour and birthweight of their infants.</p><p>Our primary hypothesis is that women who receive &#x02018;balanced plate nutrition education&#x02019; during pregnancy will deliver babies 100 g heavier than those who receive standard nutrition education. Secondary hypotheses are that &#x02018;balanced plate nutrition education&#x02019; will increase daily caloric intake by 300 kcal and increase the dietary diversity score to at least five (out of nine food subgroups with minimum consumption of 15 g from each group) among pregnant women compared with standard nutrition education.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We will conduct a two-arm parallel community-based cluster randomised controlled trial with pregnant women. Women allocated to the intervention arm will receive the &#x02018;balanced plate nutrition education&#x02019; with practical demonstrations and women in the control arm will receive standard nutrition education (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). This is an effectiveness trial to be conducted through the existing health programme of BRAC (an NGO formerly known as Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee or Building Resources Across Communities), a nationwide community-based healthcare intervention.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015393f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Formative research</title><p>We will conduct a food attributes exercise applying the ProPAN methodology.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In this regard, a group of qualitative interviews will take place with key target populations such as pregnant women, influential family members (eg., husbands, mothers and mother-in-laws of the pregnant women) to generate information about key foods taken during pregnancy, positive and negative characteristics attributed to key foods, and conditions and changes required for pregnant women to consume nutrient-rich foods that are not currently taken or inadequately taken. These data will inform the design of the &#x02018;balanced plate nutrition education&#x02019; intervention, which will then be pilot tested to assess its acceptability to the community and the feasibility of implementation prior to the commencement of the actual trial. We will conduct focus group discussions with pregnant women; their husbands, mothers and mother-in-laws; and <italic>Shasthya Kormis</italic> (community health workers of BRAC who are the major antenatal care providers in the respective community) in two different sites of the study area. The data will assist with understanding the cultural compatibility of the proposed approach along with identifying local norms, beliefs, priorities and any cultural food restrictions and prescriptions during pregnancy. Information about the availability of foods in different seasons will also be considered. The final messages will be developed, refining the menu by incorporating the results of the pilot trial on local preferences, acceptability and seasonal variation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study setting</title><p>The proposed research will take place in the villages of Sherpur district, situated in the northern part of Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).

The trial uses the established pregnancy surveillance and home-based ANC system of BRAC. There are ~346&#x02009;health volunteers (called <italic>Shasthya Shebika</italic>) who pay home visits to women of reproductive age and detect delayed or missed menstrual cycles. Women missing a menstrual cycle in the previous six&#x02009;weeks are screened for possible pregnancy using a urine test and, if the pregnancy is confirmed, start receiving ANC from the <italic>Shasthya Kormis</italic> (<italic>SK</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study clusters</title><p>We have chosen clusters as the unit of randomisation instead of individuals for greater logistical convenience and to prevent contamination of the intervention.

The entire study district is divided into 135 exclusive clusters. Clustering will help minimise sharing of nutrition messages among pregnant women, which would occur if the intervention and control were administered among women from the same village or neighbouring villages. Clusters will be eligible for inclusion in the trial if the corresponding <italic>SKs</italic> have work experience for at least six&#x02009;months in the maternal, neonatal and child health programme in the specific region.

For the first sub-district (Jhenaigati), we will select four clusters from a list of the clusters in that area using random numbers generated by a computer program in MS Excel spreadsheet (using the RANDOM function), and apply the same method to the rest of the sub-districts until we obtain the 36 clusters.

The treatment sequence will alternate between A (intervention) and B (control), starting with A. One volunteer (not involved with the study) will pick the papers blindfolded. For the first sub-district, there will be four pieces of paper and the treatment assignment sequence will be ABAB, which means the first number picked will go to treatment A and the next to treatment B and so on.

The education session has two parts: one-to-one nutrition-specific counseling and practical demonstration. For counselling, <italic>SK</italic>s will use written and pictorial menus. The core contents of the counselling are included in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box</xref>. The nutritional messages are developed with reference to the current Bangladeshi recommendations,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> which incorporates the following: (a) intake of food-yielding at least 2500 kcal energy per day; (b) consumption of diversified food; (c) inclusion of animal sourced food in the diet, at least two servings per day; and (d) eating at least five times a day (five different plates for five meals). Rather than endorsing new or expensive foods, indigenous foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamins will be promoted in the study. Considering the high price and low consumption of protein-rich foods in general, both from the plant (ie, lentils) and the animal (ie, meat, fish, egg and milk) sources, we will advise the cheapest options for protein from animal source such as fish grown in local farms. There are varieties of inexpensive fish available in the market, such as tilapia, certain catfish (e.g., <italic>pangas</italic>) and carp (e.g., silver carp). We will motivate the pregnant women to consume an adequate amount of these fish by making them realise that these are equally as nutritious as other costly protein-rich foods. Five different menus will be developed for five daily meals yielding collectively 2500 kcal energy and essential micro- and macronutrients for the day (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>). A pictorial menu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>) and a pictorial food chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>) in the local language will be provided to all women, who are

the pregnant women and their family members in a participatory way. For this, participant women will be encouraged to share food from their own. If the available food items are not sufficient to make a balanced meal, then the neighbours will be asked to contribute. Sharing food between households is common and culturally acceptable in rural Bangladesh. <italic>SK</italic>s will measure portion sizes for carbohydrate, protein and vegetable groups using a local utensil (250&#x02009;mL size dish) and display the assembled meal on a regular dinner plate. From this visual presentation, pregnant women will be able to actively identify the food groups where they should make a change. Pregnant women are then encouraged to make their own plate for each meal following the given menu. The <italic>SK</italic>s will invite the key influential family members to join the balanced plate preparation demonstration and the counselling sessions. The mother-in-law and/or mother of the pregnant woman (depending on where the women stay at the time of counselling/demonstration) and her husband (if he is available) will be invited. In the absence of the mother-in-law or mother, an influential senior female member will be invited. In addition to providing counselling on the maternal nutrition and balanced diet, the <italic>SK</italic>s will motivate these family members to provide support to the pregnant women for their adherence to the nutritional messages. We expect that their active support will create an enabling environment for the pregnant women to practise improved diet.</p><p>The intervention will commence in the first trimester (ideally before 12 weeks of gestation) and will continue every month until birth. Each pregnant woman will have 4&#x02013;7 sessions throughout her entire pregnancy. The sessions will last for approximately 30&#x02013;45&#x02009;min.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Control intervention</title><p>Government health facilities provide nutrition education, following a national standard protocol, to all pregnant women seeking ANC.

During the monthly follow-ups, information on health condition, current pregnancy status and healthcare services will be collected. We will conduct longitudinal dietary assessment for 4&#x02013;7 non-consecutive days. All live newborn infants&#x02019; birthweights will be assessed within 72&#x02009;hours of birth with a hand-held spring balance scale (Salter scale with a capacity of five&#x02009;kg and an accuracy of 100 g). Infants will wear only light clothes; the wrapping blanket will be taken off during weighing. The scale will be adjusted for the weight of the dress that the infant will be wearing before the process starts. <italic>SK</italic>s will collect the data during their regular scheduled visit to pregnant women and newborn children. A detailed schedule of assessment is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>.</p><p>Field supervisors will check 5% of the data randomly and notify a potential measurement problem. In addition, we will validate the dietary assessment data by repeating the assessment with independent interviewers in a subsample of participants (72; 36 each from intervention and control). Field supervisors, blinded to the outcome of interest, will also recapture 25% of the birthweight measures for data validity. The Salter scales used will be standardised every month. For institutional births, the recorded birthweights will be used.</p><p>Women will be designated as &#x02018;lost to follow-up&#x02019; if they withdraw or move away and are untraceable for more than three consecutive visits.

This makes the data hierarchical in nature due to the assumption of non-independence among those who live in the same cluster; hence we will use multilevel models to examine outcomes. Births being nested within clusters, we will use mixed effects regression models to measure the difference in effect (random intercept) between the treatment groups accounting for clusters and report the ICC. We will treat cluster as a random effect in the models, while the other explanatory variables will be treated as fixed effects. We will compare the distribution of prognostic factors between treatment groups and check for the effectiveness of randomisation. Any imbalance in the important prognostic factors will be adjusted by including them as covariates in the models.</p><p>We will use multivariable regression analysis to assess intervention effects holding other predictors constant, such as gestational age, infant sex, parity, age, socioeconomic status, education, the number of visits and time of the first visit after adjusting for the clusters.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> To assess the treatment effect on dietary caloric intake and diversity over time, we will use data from each visit distributed across subjects.

At the end of the week in a follow-up visit, the SKs will interview the women and identify significant barriers to incorporating the balanced diet into their dietary practices. The TIPs findings will provide feedback to adjust the design of the communication technique based on the practical experience of the trial participants. The feedback will be shared in the monthly meetings to adapt the content and strategy of the communication. Apart from the TIPs, we will assess the progress of the study against some verifiable indicators including the number of pregnant women enrolled and the number of nutrition messages delivered. Ticking the boxes through direct observations will check the number of nutrition messages delivered to the pregnant women. Any deviation from the target will be investigated for recovery actions. Any decline in performance against some verifiable indicators (pregnancy identification, ANC and postnatal visits) will suggest probable task overload of <italic>SK</italic>s.

Nutrition education for pregnant women is understood to influence nutrition-related knowledge and dietary behaviour, pregnancy weight gain and birthweight.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>This new approach using a practical demonstration is a unique and promising method of behaviour change communication. This intervention is easy to implement by the existing community health workers and its participatory nature engages the pregnant women involved. It does not require any additional props or tools that are not readily available. Unlike typical nutrition education, our approach is more visual and interactive, which makes it easier for the participants to understand the messages clearly. Importantly, it does not require any food supplementation, which makes this intervention highly scalable and more likely to be sustainable in resource-poor settings including Bangladesh.</p><p>Nutrition education, which has been defined as &#x02018;any combination of educational strategies, accompanied by environmental supports, designed to facilitate voluntary adoption of food choices and other food and nutrition-related behaviours conducive to health and well-being&#x02026;&#x02019; has essentially three phases or components: motivational phase, action phase and environmental component.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Our intervention addresses all the three components: verbal communication increases awareness and enhances motivation of the pregnant woman to adopt the intended behaviour; practical demonstration facilitates the ability to take action in practising a balanced meal; and communication with influential family members (husband, mother-in-law and mother) provides an enabling environment to support the woman&#x02019;s changed dietary behaviour. All of these three components are grounded in a health behaviour change communication theory, the &#x02018;Integrative Model of Behavioural Prediction&#x02019;. According to this theory, a strong intention of a person to perform a behaviour, accompanied by the necessary skills and abilities to perform it, and a conducive environment results in the expected behaviour change.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Using a practical demonstration in maternal nutrition education is a novel approach. However, this approach has been proved to be quite effective in other health education interventions. A study addressing oral health, provided a one&#x02009;hour lecture and practical demonstration to caregivers on oral hygiene, and measured the impact on oral infections (gingivitis and stomatitis). The results showed that gingivitis scores in the intervention group decreased to 0.28 units from a baseline of 1.37, and the rate of stomatitis in the intervention decreased from 17% at baseline to 4%.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Gill and O&#x02019;May investigated the utility of a practical pouring exercise to inform participants of their daily limits of alcohol consumption and found that almost half of the participants (46%) were able to confirm exactly when they would exceed the limit. One-fifth of the participants thought that this practical pouring might influence their future alcohol drinking habit.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Successful behaviour change is already observed in infant and young child feeding practices in Bangladesh with approaches like practical demonstration and counseling.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> An educational tool for practical demonstration (food plate and nutrition messages) to improve dietary diversity during pregnancy has been tested in one project in Bangladesh with the intention of improving maternal nutrition.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Contamination due to communication between the service providers cannot be completely ruled out as the study will be conducted in one geographic region.

These two groups will receive training separately and have monthly meetings in distinct groups. There is no chance of overlapping at the community level as <italic>SK</italic>s work in distinct villages (villages are usually geographically separated by farm lands, canals and roads). Another limitation of the study is the multipurpose role of <italic>SK</italic>s who will provide the &#x02018;balanced plate nutrition education&#x02019; intervention and also act as data collectors.
