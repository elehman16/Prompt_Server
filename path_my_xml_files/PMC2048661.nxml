We investigated the safety and efficacy of azithromycin or artesunate combined with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine used for treatment of malaria in pregnant women in Blantyre, Malawi.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Findings</title><p>This was a randomized open-label clinical trial, conducted at two rural health centers in Blantyre district, Malawi. A total of 141 pregnant women with uncomplicated <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria were recruited and randomly allocated to 3 treatment groups: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; 3 tablets, 500 mg sulfadoxine and 25 mg pyrimethamine per tablet); SP plus azithromycin (1 g/day&#x000d7;2 days); or SP plus artesunate (200 mg/day&#x000d7;3 days). Women received two doses administered at least 4 weeks apart. Heteroduplex tracking assays were performed to distinguish recrudescence from new infections. Main outcome measures were incidence of adverse outcomes, parasite and fever clearance times and recrudescence rates. All treatment regimens were well tolerated. Two women vomited soon after ingesting azithromycin. The parasite clearance time was significantly faster in the SP-artesunate group. Recrudescent episodes of malaria were less frequent with SP-azithromycin [Hazard Ratio 0.19 (95&#x00025; confidence interval 0.06 to 0.63)] and SP-artesunate [Hazard Ratio 0.25 (95&#x00025; confidence interval 0.10 to 0.65)] compared with SP monotherapy. With one exception (an abortion in the SP-azithromycin group), all adverse pregnancy outcomes could be attributed to known infectious or obstetrical causes. Because of the small sample size, the effect on birth outcomes, maternal malaria or maternal anemia could not be evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both SP-artesunate and SP-azithromycin appeared to be safe, well tolerated and efficacious for the treatment of malaria during pregnancy. A larger study is needed to determine their safety and efficacy in preventing poor birth outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinialTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00287300">NCT00287300</ext-link>

Infection with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> during pregnancy can cause maternal anemia, abortions, stillbirths, preterm deliveries and low birth weight <xref rid="pone.0001166-Brabin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-Guyatt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In areas of high transmission, most of the infections in pregnant women are asymptomatic and consequently, malaria infection may go undiagnosed <xref rid="pone.0001166-Shulman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. All pregnant women in these areas should be provided with intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) at antenatal visits to prevent infection <xref rid="pone.0001166-World2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), first introduced in Malawi in 1993, has now been adopted by many countries in sub-Saharan Africa as the drug of choice for IPT. Studies have shown that IPT significantly reduces the prevalence of placental malaria and low birth weight <xref rid="pone.0001166-Shulman2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0001166-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>The increase in the resistance to SP in sub-Saharan Africa is recognized as a growing public health problem <xref rid="pone.0001166-Wongsrichanalai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. There are currently few chemotherapeutic options available for treatment and prevention of malaria during pregnancy. In addition, limited data exist on the safety of anti-malarial drugs as pregnant women have been frequently excluded from most malaria treatment trials for fear of toxicity to the fetus<xref rid="pone.0001166-PhillipsHoward1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Research is urgently needed to identify alternative anti-malarial drugs that are safe, acceptable and efficacious in treating and preventing malaria infection in pregnant women.</p><p>The use of combination anti-malarial drugs that target different pathways is being strongly advocated as a strategy for improving efficacy and delaying the emergence of drug-resistant parasites <xref rid="pone.0001166-White1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The combination of conventional anti-malarial drugs with artemisinin derivatives has been proposed as the next best option for the treatment of resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Artesunate, one of the artemisinin derivatives, has been used widely in South-East Asia in non-pregnant individuals. There have been no reports of severe adverse effects in studies when it was given as treatment in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0001166-McGready1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-McGready2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, due to the small number of women in these studies, there is still need for more information on the safety of artesunate in pregnant women. Additionally, there have been no studies that have assessed the use of artesunate as IPT in pregnant women.</p><p>Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, which has been found to have anti-malarial effect <xref rid="pone.0001166-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, has been used in pregnant women to treat sexually transmitted infection (STIs), and other infections with a good safety profile <xref rid="pone.0001166-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-Sarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, there have been no studies that have investigated its efficacy in treating and preventing malaria in pregnant women. The objective of this pilot study was therefore to compare the safety and efficacy of SP combined with azithromycin or artesunate to SP monotherapy (the currently recommended regimen in Malawi), in treating malaria in pregnant women.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Participants</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001166.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001166.s002">Protocol S1</xref>. The study was conducted at Mpemba and Madziabango health centers in Blantyre District, Malawi from September 2003 to September 2004. Blantyre district has a population of approximately 950,000 people <xref rid="pone.0001166-Malawi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Malaria transmission is perennial, but peaks during the rainy season (November&#x02013;March). <italic>P. falciparum</italic> causes over 90&#x00025; of all malaria infections. The two health centers have maternity beds for delivery of low risk pregnancies. Women with high risk pregnancies are referred to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), a tertiary hospital located about 10 km from the health centers for management.</p><p>Women were eligible if they had peripheral parasitemia (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>), were 15&#x02013;49 years old, the estimated fetal gestational age was 14&#x02013;26 weeks, the mother had felt fetal movements and if they were available for follow-up until delivery. Women were excluded if they had multiple gestations, a history of chronic diseases such as tuberculosis and diabetes, a mental disorder, known allergies to drugs containing sulfonamides, macrolides or pyrimethamine, pregnancy complications, or if they had taken anti-malarial drugs within 28 days before enrollment. Written or witnessed verbal informed consent was obtained prior to enrollment. This study was approved by the College of Medicine Research Committee (University of Malawi) and the Institutional Review Boards of the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, North Carolina).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was an open-label, randomized clinical trial. At enrollment, a standardized questionnaire was administered to collect demographic information, history of malaria illnesses, and past medical and obstetric history. The women received routine antenatal assessment and could choose to be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, with pre- and post-test counseling. A venous blood sample was obtained to measure hemoglobin concentration and prepare thick blood films.</p><p>The women were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms and received two doses of the assigned treatment. The first dose was given at enrollment. The second dose was administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose, irrespective of whether or not parasitemia was detected. Thick films were examined for parasitemia on days 1,2,3,7 and 14 after each treatment, and at scheduled and unscheduled antenatal visits. Body temperature was recorded every 6 hours after treatment until it became normal (&#x0003c;37.5&#x000b0;C). The women were followed until delivery, and at each subsequent visit they received routine antenatal care, and information was obtained on malarial illnesses, use of anti-malarial drugs, and potential side effects of the study drugs. The women were asked not to self-administer anti-malarial drugs, but to return to the health centers for evaluation any time they experienced symptoms of malaria.</p><p>All symptoms reported by the women at any time after taking the study medication were recorded by the study nurses. The study physician assessed these reported symptoms by conducting further interviews and physical examination. Treatment was discontinued if there were serious adverse events, and these were reported to the institutional review boards of the University of Malawi, College of Medicine and the University of North Carolina within 48 hours. A Data Safety Monitoring Committee reviewed adverse event data midway through the study. Symptoms present at baseline in women with parasitemia were considered to be attributable to malaria. Women with mild or moderate adverse events were monitored at the health centers with outpatient management as recommended by the study physician. Women with severe adverse events requiring hospitalization were monitored at the health centers or referred to QECH. They were visited daily by the study nurses and/or physician in order to document progression and resolution of the symptoms and to provide any clinical assistance deemed necessary.</p><p>All HIV-positive women were given nevirapine (Roxane Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio, USA) at the onset of active labor according to the HIVNET 012 protocol <xref rid="pone.0001166-Guay1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Newborns delivered at the health centers or QECH were examined for the presence of visible physical congenital abnormalities by trained midwives who were not blinded to treatment allocation. The newborns were weighed using a digital scale (to the nearest gram) and gestational age was estimated using the Ballard score <xref rid="pone.0001166-Ballard1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> within 24 hours of delivery. A blood sample was obtained from a maternal peripheral vein, the placenta and the umbilical cord for preparation of thick films and estimation of maternal hemoglobin concentration. Full thickness placental biopsies were collected to prepare histology slides. If a traditional birth attendant was present during home deliveries, birth weight was measured using color-coded scales that indicated red for birth weight less than 2,500g and green for birth weight at least 2,500 g. Peripheral, placental and cord blood thick blood films were prepared and forwarded to the health-centers through community health workers. Newborns delivered at home were later examined by the trained midwives when the mother presented at the health centers.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>The three treatment arms were: (1) SP (3 tablets; 500 mg sulfadoxine and 25 mg pyrimethamine per tablet); (2) SP (3 tablets) plus azithromycin (1 g/day for 2 days) and (3) SP (3 tablets) plus artesunate (200 mg/day for 3 days). Administration of the drug was under direct observation. A full dose of the drug was re-administered if the medication was vomited within 30 minutes of ingestion. Women stayed at the health center for at least an hour after taking the drug. Women who lived far away spent 2 nights at the health center or were visited at home. Women with parasitemia between days 7 and 28 after taking the assigned treatment were given quinine (600mg, 3 times/day for 5 days). All drugs were purchased at once from the same batch and stored in a dry cool place. The women were also given 200mg of ferrous sulfate and 0.25 mg of folic acid for daily administration, and insecticide treated bed-nets.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the trial was to compare the safety of the combination of SP with azithromycin or artesunate to that of SP alone, which is the current standard treatment for malaria and IPT in pregnant women Malawi. The secondary objective, efficacy was assessed by recrudescence rates, parasite and fever clearance times, and birth outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Adverse events</title><p>Adverse events were classified as mild if symptoms were transient or there was mild discomfort requiring no medical intervention. Moderate adverse events were defined as symptoms that caused mild to moderate limitation in activity, with no or minimal medical therapy. Symptoms were classified as severe adverse events if they caused marked limitation in activity and required medical intervention or hospitalization. Life threatening adverse events caused extreme limitation with significant medical therapy and hospitalization.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Treatment failure</title><p>Recurrent episodes detected between days 7 and 14 were classified as recrudescence without genotyping, because they were assumed very unlikely to be new infections <xref rid="pone.0001166-World3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

Prematurity was defined as delivery before 37 estimated weeks of gestation. Abortion was defined as delivery of a non-viable fetus before 28 weeks of gestation. Stillbirth was defined as delivery of a dead fetus after 28 weeks of gestation. Neonatal death was defined as death occurring during the first 27 completed days of life. Women were defined as having anemia if they had hemoglobin concentration less than 11g/dL.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>This study was designed as a pilot for a larger randomized clinical trial. The sample size was chosen based on financial and logistical restraints.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomization: Sequence Generation, Concealment and Allocation</title><p>The women were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups using a list of random numbers that were grouped in blocks of 4&#x02013;10. These random numbers were generated by an independent statistician who was not involved in conducting the study. Each of the generated numbers was assigned a treatment group, sealed in envelopes and forwarded to the local investigator prior to the start of the study. The randomization list was then secured in a locked cabinet at the study site, accessible only by the study nurse. Once a patient met the inclusion criteria and had given consent, she was assigned the number following the one of the previous patient. The envelope corresponding to that number was opened by the research nurse to identify the treatment group. The entire process was completed before any procedure was started for the following patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Blinding</title><p>Neither the study nurses nor the patients were blinded to the treatment allocation.

The primary end point was the frequency of adverse events in the women and the newborns. The secondary outcomes included recrudescence rates, parasite and fever clearance times, the prevalence of maternal anemia, peripheral and placental parasitemia at delivery, and the incidence of low birth weight. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables were compared using the analysis of variance for normally distributed, and the Kruskal-Wallis tests for non-normally distributed variables.</p><p>The difference in the HTA-adjusted recrudescence rates for the three treatment groups was determined by survival analysis. Follow-up time was calculated in days from initial infection to occurrence of an event (recrudescence), or censoring (delivery or loss to follow-up). Kaplan-Meier survival curves assessed the independent predictors of treatment outcome. Comparison of the survival curves was performed using the Log-rank test. A conditional risk-set Cox proportional hazards regression model compared the efficacy of the three treatment regimens <xref rid="pone.0001166-Therneau1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-Andersen2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.The baseline hazard was stratified by the number of treatment doses received. Only women with new infections were included in the analysis because they were at risk for recrudescence. A robust variance estimator was included in the model to account for the intra-individual correlation <xref rid="pone.0001166-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Other covariates included in the analysis were baseline parasite density, gravidity, HIV status, and history of receiving quinine during the follow-up period.

In addition, the artesunate combination shortened the clearance time of parasites. Both regimens were well tolerated. No treatment-related severe adverse events were demonstrated, but larger studies will be needed to rule out associations with abortions, still births and neonatal deaths. We could not evaluate the difference in the birth weight, maternal hemoglobin concentration, peripheral and placental parasitemia across the treatment groups because of the small sample size in this study.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that the combination SP-artesunate is effective against uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection in African children <xref rid="pone.0001166-Priotto1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-Dorsey1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, very few studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of SP-artesunate in treating malaria during pregnancy. A study conducted in Sudan found that SP-artesunate was efficacious in treating uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in 32 pregnant women with no adverse effects <xref rid="pone.0001166-Adam1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Women who were exposed to SP-artesunate in the Gambia during mass drug administration did not experience adverse effects and delivered babies with higher birth weight compared with women who did not receive treatment <xref rid="pone.0001166-Deen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Other studies have also found that artesunate alone or in combination with mefloquine, atovaquone, proguanil or quinine was efficacious and safe in all trimesters of pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0001166-McGready1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-McGready2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-McGready3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0001166-Piola1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The rapid elimination of parasites by SP-artesunate would increase the number of days that pregnant women are aparasitemic hence reducing the risk for low birth weight and maternal anemia.</p><p>However, SP-azithromycin may have several advantages. First, although the parasite clearance rate was slow compared with the SP-artesunate group, the rate of recrudescence was similar to SP-artesunate. Secondly, there has been concern expressed about the use of artemisinin derivatives in first trimester based on animal studies <xref rid="pone.0001166-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. While there is no evidence for similar adverse events in human pregnancies <xref rid="pone.0001166-World4" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, it is very difficult to prove safety and there will be a continued reluctance to use artemisinin containing drugs in first trimester. In contrast, azithromycin has been used in pregnant women to treat STIs and other infections even in the first trimester of pregnancy with a very good safety profile <xref rid="pone.0001166-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-Sarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-Adair1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Thirdly, the use of azithromycin for the prevention of STIs in pregnant women has been shown to reduce the incidence of low birth weight and neonatal deaths <xref rid="pone.0001166-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In most developing countries where the prevalence of malaria and STIs is high, resources are limited. Screening and laboratory confirmation of STI-related symptoms is usually not feasible. Therefore, using SP-azithromycin to treat pregnant women with malaria may also protect mothers against other infectious causes of poor birth outcomes. Fourthly, azithromycin has a relatively long half-life compared with artesunate. The combination of artesunate and a drug with a long half-life (such as SP) would leave the longer-acting drug unprotected, increasing the probability of parasites encountering sub-therapeutic drug levels, and promoting the development of resistance <xref rid="pone.0001166-Hastings1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>Studies have found that pregnant women who are co-infected with HIV have higher prevalence rates of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection and higher parasite density levels compared with HIV non-infected women, indicating that HIV impairs the immune response against malaria <xref rid="pone.0001166-terKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The optimum approach for IPT in HIV-infected women still remains unclear. Many women in our study refused to have an HIV test, limiting our ability to analyze the effect of HIV on efficacy of the combination therapies because of the small sample size. However, when we re-analyzed our primary endpoint in the subgroup of women whose HIV status was known, and incorporated HIV status into our model, the Hazard Ratios we derived for treatment failure remained very similar, suggesting HIV infection was not compromising the higher efficacy of the two combinations over SP alone.</p><p>The two combination regimens were relatively well tolerated. The minor side-effects reported by the women, were difficult to distinguish from symptoms of uncomplicated malaria. There was no difference in the perinatal mortality in the three treatment groups. Although spontaneous abortions only occurred in the SP-azithromycin group, three of the four abortions occurred long after drug ingestion in women with HIV and/or malaria infections. This single unexplained abortion could have been a chance occurrence. A previous study reported 6 abortions out of the 123 women who were exposed to azithromycin during pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0001166-Sarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, this outcome needs to be closely monitored in future studies that use azithromycin to rule out an association. Three still births occurred in the SP-artesunate group, but, again, a long time had elapsed between the time of drug administration and the occurrence of the still births. The short half-life of artesunate would suggest that it was unlikely these still births were associated with the treatment. Additionally, other obstetric explanations could be found for all 3 still births.</p><p>Malawi introduced SP as first-line treatment for uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection and for IPT in 1993. The prevalence of clinical failure and drug resistance mutations in parasite enzymes associated with resistance to SP have risen in recent years <xref rid="pone.0001166-Plowe1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001166-Alker2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, but currently SP is still effective as IPT <xref rid="pone.0001166-Filler1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. While SP may eventually become obsolete, combinations of SP and either artesunate or azithromycin may provide a more effective alternative to SP IPT until new agents can be developed. Choosing the optimal drug combination will depend on many factors such as transmission dynamics, cost, safety, dosing requirements and acceptability. There is also a need to consider interactions with anti-retroviral drugs in areas where the HIV prevalence is high, as is the case for Malawi <xref rid="pone.0001166-Brentlinger1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, this pilot trial found that SP combined with azithromycin or artesunate was efficacious in treating and preventing malaria in pregnant women. These preliminary results are promising and should encourage further and larger treatment studies to confirm the efficacy and safety of the combination of SP with artesunate or azithromycin in pregnant women. This information will be very important for the formulation of anti-malarial drug policy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001166.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001166.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001166.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol</p><p>(0.16 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001166.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Mrs Chaluluka, the drivers, study nurses, technicians and traditional birth attendants in Mpemba and Madziabango areas, the nurses at QECH labor ward for their co-operation and all the women who agreed to participate in this study.
