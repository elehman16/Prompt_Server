In addition, several studies have evaluated metabolic responses to GH treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. GH replacement therapy in children induces favourable changes in metabolic indices and improves body composition, bone density and remodelling, physical and cardiac performance, as well as overall quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. If individual responsiveness is taken into account, the metabolic response to GH treatment does not differ markedly between short children with and without classic GH deficiency (GHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The data at baseline has previously been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It has been discussed whether any cut-off level of GH secretion chosen to distinguish between children with GHD and idiopathic short stature (ISS) may be arbitrary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Dose-dependency with regard to GH has only been studied in a few clinical trials. It has been shown that GH treatment increases adult height in a dose-dependent manner in children with ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. GH dose-dependency of metabolic variables has not been clearly defined in short children owing to a lack of controlled trials on metabolic outcomes in response to different GH doses.</p><p>In a randomized, controlled, clinical trial we have recently shown that the anabolic and lipolytic effects of GH can be dissociated in a GH dose range between 17 and 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/day. Anabolism was found to be dose-dependent while lipolysis was not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], despite a lipolytic effect being noted in all subjects. It was interpreted that the lipolytic effect of GH was overridden in the dose range used, and that dose-dependency may therefore become apparent at lower doses.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate and compare the GH doses required to achieve different metabolic responses. The hypothesis was that there are dose-dependent thresholds for different tissues and metabolic functions. It was expected that the results would provide insight into the effective GH dose required to influence metabolic processes and cardiac tissue in short children with different GH secretion capacities and GH responsiveness. The key question was &#x02018;What is the appropriate GH dose in prepubertal children to compensate for deteriorations in body composition and to avoid unfavourable metabolic effects?&#x02019;</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Ethical consideration</title><p>The study protocol (TRN 98-0198-003) was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Universities of G&#x000f6;teborg (for G&#x000f6;teborg and Halmstad), Ume&#x000e5;, Uppsala and Malm&#x000f6; and the Medical Product Agency of Sweden.

Individual GH responsiveness was estimated by our growth response prediction model for children with GHD and ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and the patients were randomized in 1:2 proportions to receive either a standard or an individualized GH dose during 2 years of catch-up growth to a preset growth target, mid-parental height SDS (MPH<sub>SDS</sub>). Randomization variables included gender, weight<sub>SDS</sub> at birth, height<sub>SDS</sub> at age 1 year, GH<sub>max</sub>AITT (during an arginine&#x02013;insulin tolerance test), GH<sub>max</sub>24h profile (during 24h spontaneous GH sampling), age and height<sub>SDS</sub> at start, the child&#x02019;s height<sub>SDS</sub> difference to its MPH<sub>SDS</sub> (diff MPH<sub>SDS</sub>) at start, and predicted 1<sup>st</sup> year &#x00394; height<sub>SDS</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. No patients with syndromes, chronic diseases or complete GH insensitivity were included in the study population.</p><p>Upon inclusion, all patients had a height<sub>SDS</sub> below &#x02212;2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and a growth velocity below &#x02212;1.0 SDS. 128 children (38 girls, 90 boys) followed the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Both the results from the GH<sub>max</sub>AITT and the GH<sub>max</sub>24h profile were used to separate children with GHD from those with ISS. Classic GHD was defined based on a GH<sub>max</sub> below 32 mU/L (using polyclonal assay, WHO IRP 80&#x02013;505) corresponding to 24 mU/L (using monoclonal assay) and equivalent to the &#x02018;old cut-off of 10 &#x003bc;g/L&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. According to this definition, 39 children had isolated GHD and 89 had ISS. However, when using GH<sub>max</sub> results exclusively from the AITT, 90 children were assigned the diagnosis of GHD and 38 the diagnosis of ISS. Additionally, all of our patients fulfilled the criteria for GHD according to a growth velocity lesser than &#x02212;1.0 SDS, IGF-I below &#x02212;1 SD of sex and age specific references, bone age retardation of more than 1,5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>To address the question concerning GH thresholds and to study the possible dose-dependency, the analysis focused on the individualized treatment group (n=87). We used data from prepubertal children included in a trial, randomized to individual GH doses in the range of 17&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g/kg/d according to their growth-related GH responsiveness; with dose-adjustment for the estimated difference to the preset height target (i.e. MPH<sub>SDS</sub>) at 2 years on GH in order to make it possible for each child to reach its MPH<sub>SDS</sub> within a 2 year period. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Children with a higher predicted growth response, calculated before start of treatment, received a lower individual GH dose, and those with a lower predicted growth response received a higher GH dose. The GH doses used in the individualized-dose group were 17 &#x003bc;g/kg/day (n=3), 33 &#x003bc;g/kg/day (n=27), 40 &#x003bc;g/kg/day (n=10), 50 &#x003bc;g/kg/day (n=26), 66 &#x003bc;g/kg/day (n=14), and 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/day (n=7): the mean GH dose in this group was 49 &#x003bc;g/kg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The fixed GH dose group was used as a control group for estimating a metabolic effect of the dose selection procedure in the trial by regressing the metabolic variables on the intended dose of the fixed GH dose group. The intended dose is the GH dose that the patients would have been given if they had been randomized to the group treated with individualized dose. Since this group was randomised to receive the fixed GH dose, any metabolic effect of the intended dose implicates an effect of the dose selection procedure independent of the dose given. None of the six metabolic effects appeared to be related to the dose selection procedure in the trial. &#x00394; ALP, &#x00394; LST<sub>SDS</sub>, &#x00394; insulin and &#x00394; IGF-I<sub>SDS</sub> showed no significant effect, whereas &#x00394; LVDd and to a lesser extend &#x00394; height<sub>SDS</sub> were even somewhat negative correlated to the intended dose of the fixed GH dose group (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory analyses and growth evaluation</title><p>GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) assays were performed at the G&#x000f6;teborg Pediatric Growth Research Center (GP-GRC) laboratory (accredited number 1899).

Each child was examined longitudinally throughout the study by the same cardiologist/ sonographer. Interventricular septum thickness (IVSd), left ventricular diameter (LVDd) and left ventricular posterior wall (LVPWd) thickness were measured in diastole using M-mode.

A p-value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p><p>Delta values (&#x00394;-values) for the metabolic variables were calculated in order to quantify changes at 2 year of treatment compared with baseline. S-shaped piecewise linear regression models were fitted with GH dose as the predictor variable and the &#x00394;-value of the metabolic variables as response variables. It consists of 3 pieces: a horizontal head and tail and a linear piece in the middle and was plotted based on the GH-dose effect on the dependent metabolic variables. Fitting this regression comes down to fitting a bounded linear model with four parameters; the usual slope and intercept of a linear regression and an upper and lower bound for the fitted model values. The GH dose effect was given by the maximum range of the fitted piecewise function, which is equal to the difference between the fitted upper and lower bound. Half of the GH dose effect on the respective variables was calculated based on the value halfway between the lowest and highest level of the piecewise function (50% &#x00394; effect). The number of cases within each dose group was taken into account by weighting. Corresponding 90% confidence bands were calculated.</p><p>The fitted upper and lower bounds minus the fitted intercept, divided by the fitted slope provide the two breakpoints of the predictor variable separating the middle linear part from the horizontal head and tail. The ED 50% required to achieve (50% &#x00394; effect) is located halfway the two breakpoints of the predictor variable and a corresponding 90% confidence interval is computed. We considered the ED 50% values of pairs of metabolic variables as significantly different if their ED50% values were mutually outside each other's 90% confidence interval, each providing a 5% significance level one-sided. This ED 50% is halfway the two breakpoints of the predictor variable separating the middle linear part from the horizontal head and tail.</p><p>A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with GH dose as a bounded continuous predictor was performed to test the piecewise linear GH effect. A non-parametric comparison of group means (robust test of equality of means &#x02013; Welch test and Brown&#x02013;Forsythe test) was conducted when variances of dependent variables were not equal across groups. To examine the influence from the 17 &#x003bc;g/kg/day dose group consisting of only three children, analysis were repeated with these children excluded. No significant differences resulted compared to the the complete study population.

This is in line with the findings of Capalbo <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] who found that LVDd increased during treatment with a dose of 30 &#x003bc;g/kg/d. From the available data, it is difficult to draw conclusions concerning the mechanism responsible for GH effects on heart size. We have, however, previously shown the presence of GH receptors in cardiac tissue in children, indicating that a direct effect of GH on the heart is likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Even though GH responsiveness was high, there were no adverse effects seen on any measurement of cardiac function or on blood pressure during the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>GH dose-effect on body composition</title><p>It has been shown that GH treatment at a dose of 57 &#x003bc;g/kg/d given to children born small for gestational age (SGA) can lead to an increase in muscle mass, and a concomitant decrease in fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, data showing a dose-dependency increase in LST are lacking. We found that LST mass increased in a dose-dependent manner for the six GH doses administered. This effect was most marked at GH doses above 33 &#x003bc;g/kg/d, and the ED 50% for gain in LST mass was in the mid-range (47 &#x003bc;g/kg/d). This dose is in the same range as that found to promote longitudinal bone growth (51 &#x003bc;g/kg/d), confirming our previous findings of anabolic GH effects.</p><p>As demonstrated previously using principal component analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a strong lipolytic effect was found for all GH doses, seen by changes in fat mass and fat mass index, but no GH dose&#x02013;response effect was seen. A possible explanation is that in the dose range studied the lipolytic effect had already reached its maximum, making lipolytic variables the most sensitive to GH. Early leptin reduction after the start of GH treatment was found previously to be positively correlated with first year growth response in a group of short children treated with 33 &#x003bc;g/kg/day; however, there was a wide range in &#x00394; leptin levels as for growth response; at that time no individual responsiveness was possible to estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is well known that fat mass decreases in GH-deficient adults when they are treated with GH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Further studies are needed to determine the dose response for the lipolytic effects at lower doses in children.</p></sec><sec><title>GH effect on alkaline phosphatase</title><p>Increased serum bone-specific ALP is known to be a reliable and early sign of increased bone metabolism and correlates to first year growth response in GH-deficient children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the present study, ALP activity was found to be more responsive than longitudinal bone growth to a given GH dose.</p></sec><sec><title>GH dose-effect on insulin and insulin-sensitivity</title><p>GH doses above the common dose range of 25&#x02013;35 &#x003bc;g/kg/d used for GH-deficient children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], resulted in greater insulin increases than lower doses, although insulin levels did not exceed the normal range. This confirms previous studies that insulin levels are lower than normal at baseline in GH-deficient individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In short children born SGA, no impaired GH dose&#x02013;response effect on insulin has been reported in a dose range between 33 and 66 &#x003bc;g/kg/d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>GH exerts both insulin-like and insulin-antagonistic effects <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. An insulin-like effect has been reported in some <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but not in all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the present study the ED 50% for the insulin enhancement was 48 &#x003bc;g/kg/d, which is very close to the ED 50% of 51 &#x003bc;g/kg/d for height gain found in the present study. Thus, the insulin antagonist effect of GH seems to be equally or more responsive to GH than the effect on IGF-I. An explanation for this may be that we used SDS for IGF-I, but not for fasting insulin, where mU/L was used. Insulin may be required as a growth factor during the catch-up growth phase, so the observation of a dose-dependent increase should be viewed as more than just compensation for GH-induced insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>GH dose-effect on IGF</title><p>We demonstrated a marked dose&#x02013;response effect on IGF-I<sub>SDS</sub>. Thus, as for LST mass, the prediction of growth response is not valid for IGF-I<sub>SDS</sub> levels. This is in line with findings in groups where individual responsiveness was not addressed, and GH therapy resulted in increasing IGF-I<sub>SDS</sub> in a dose-dependent manner in prepubertal children, with more dramatic changes being observed at higher doses (50 and 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/day vs 25 &#x003bc;g/kg/d) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/d compared to 43 &#x003bc;g/kg/d in pubertal GH-deficient patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the ED 50% for IGF-I<sub>SDS</sub> was 57 &#x003bc;g/kg/d, which was the highest dose observed for any metabolic variable. Therefore, liver response to IGF-I secretion was found to have a higher threshold than both height gain and muscle growth in the present study.</p></sec><sec><title>GH dose-effect on catch-up growth</title><p>In order to be able to compare metabolism and growth, height gain was studied in the present study and not the height target of the study, i.e. the diff MPH<sub>SDS</sub>. The growth effect associated with individualized GH doses was quantified and presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Thus, a GH dose of 51 (47, 56) &#x003bc;g/kg/d was necessary in order to achieve half of the height gain. In previously performed studies in children with ISS, GH had a dose-related effect on longitudinal bone growth in the dose ranges of 33&#x02013;67 &#x003bc;g/kg/d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and 31&#x02013;47 &#x003bc;g/kg/d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In GH-deficient children, an increase in GH dose from 25 to 50 &#x003bc;g/kg/d resulted in a sustained increase in growth velocity, whereas in this study no additional effect was observed with a further increase in dose to 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/d, the highest GH dose in the trial given only to the most non-responsive children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, in a randomized GH dose study during puberty in GH-deficient children, a dose dependent effect (33 &#x003bc;g/kg/d vs. 67 &#x003bc;g/kg/d) was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This is in line with prior evidence for a dose-dependent effect of higher doses on adult height in children with ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. To summarize, the adult height achieved in GH-deficient children treated with GH replacement therapy has been found to be dose-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], as has adult height in children with ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Effects on metabolism</title><p>There are, however, only a few studies on the metabolic consequences of GH therapy in children. Ciresi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] studied metabolic parameters in GH-deficient children, but the question of dose-dependency was not investigated. Mauras <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] compared IGF-I levels in two different GH dose groups in adolescents with GHD. Cohen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] analyzed the response of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c and height to three different GH doses (25, 50, and 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/day) in prepubertal GH-deficient children. However, the question of whether there were different metabolic thresholds was neither addressed nor individual responsiveness.</p><p>In a recent report on our study group, we found dose-dependent effects on height gain, body composition and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There are no comparable prospective randomized studies. Nevertheless, our data can be compared with reported qualitative effects in response to different GH doses, which suggest that dose&#x02013;response effects exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Our study included children classified as both GHD and ISS as our study also includes aspects on tissue responsiveness, ranging from high to low within both diagnostic groups. Without a wide range, it would not have been possible to perform our study on the hypothesis of varying thresholds for different tissues and metabolic markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>A fact that influences the interpretation of the results is, that the individual GH dose in the trial was selected based on GH responsiveness according to estimated/expected growth response and adapted so that the child would reach MPH<sub>SDS</sub> within 2 years, although limited by the set maximal GH dose of 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/d. None of the metabolic effects presented here was found to be related to the dose selection procedure in the trial.</p><p>The strengths of the present study are that we were able to compare many different effects within the same individual, as well as assessing inter-individual variations. When monitoring GH treatment in the clinical setting, it is essential to know which processes will be affected and which marker will be the first to react to treatment based on responsiveness. The aim with estimating individual responsiveness is to set a target for treatment effect &#x02013; it may be growth response for which we now have prediction models. In the future, prediction models may also be constructed for the metabolic markers studied in this paper.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>GH dose-dependent thresholds for different metabolic effect were found in the current study, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. Cardiac tissue was found to be the most responsive to GH treatment, followed by muscle tissue and height gain. Insulin levels incresed, reflecting GH-induced resistance and insulin was found to be more sensitive to GH than IGF-I, suggesting that insulin is as a growth factor during the catch-up growth phase in prepubertal short children.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALP: Alkaline phosphatase; ANOVA: Analysis of variance; Apo A-II: Apolipoprotein A-II; BMC: Bone mineral content; BMD: Bone mineral density; &#x00394;: Delta; ED 50%: Effective dose 50%; DBP: Diastolic blood pressure; DXA: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; DPX-L: Proper name of the Lunar pencil beam scanner; GH: Growth hormone; GHD: Growth hormone deficiency; GP-GRC: G&#x000f6;teborg Pediatric Growth Research Center; HbA1c: Glycosylated haemoglobin; HDL: High-density lipoprotein; HOMA: Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance calculated as ((fasting serum insulin* fasting plasma glucose)/22.5); IGF-I: Insulin-like growth factor I; ISS: Idiopathic short stature; IVSd: Interventricular septal thickness in diastole; LDL: Low-density lipoprotein; Lp(a): Lipoprotein (a); LST: Lean soft tissue; LVDd: Left ventricular diameter in diastole; LVM: Left ventricular mass; LVPWd: Left ventricular posterior wall in diastole; SBP: Systolic blood pressure; SDS: Standard deviation score.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>R Decker and A Nygren declare that they have no competing interests.
