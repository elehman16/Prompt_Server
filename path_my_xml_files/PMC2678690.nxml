This study evaluated the effect of the &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) polymorphism on lung function and asthma control with regular use of combination treatment of an inhaled ICS plus LABA.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>43 Korean asthmatics who were symptomatic despite regular ICS use for at least 3 months were enrolled. For a 2-week run-in period, they received ICS (budesonide 800 &#x000b5;g/day) plus terbutaline (5 &#x000b5;g prn). as needed. During the 24-week active treatment period, they received budesonide 160 &#x000b5;g and formoterol 4.5 &#x000b5;g b.i.d. as maintenance and rescue medication. Pulmonary function and quality of life scores were monitored every 8 weeks; morning/evening peak expiratory flow meter (PEFR) was recorded daily.

Patients with moderately persistent asthma were recruited, based on the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. All subjects participated in this study were ethnically Korean. Men and women, aged 18-55 years with a documented history of asthma for at least 6 months, no history of smoking or reported history of viral infection in the proceeding 6 weeks, and an FEV<sub>1</sub> of at least 60% of the predicted value, were recruited at Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, and Dankook University Hospital, Cheonan, Korea. All study patients had not been exposed to long acting &#x003b2;2 agonist for 3 months prior to this study, and they provided written informed consent as approved by the local committee on human research.</p><p>Outpatients included were required to have been on maintenance therapy with less than 800 &#x000b5;g of inhaled budesonide for at least 3 months and to have a history of at least 1 asthma exacerbation in the previous 12 months. For at least 30 days before enrollment and during the 2-week run-in period, patients took a constant daily dose of 800 &#x000b5;g of budesonide. To be eligible, patients had to have an FEV<sub>1</sub> of 60-100% of the predicted value with 12% or more reversibility after 100 &#x000b5;g of salbutamol inhalation compared to baseline, and should have used a short-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist for asthma symptoms on at least 5 of the last 7 days of the run-in. During the 24-week active treatment period, all patients were asked to use combination therapy, while consisted of budesonide 160 &#x000b5;g and formoterol 4.5 &#x000b5;g combined in a device, twice a day as maintenance treatment and for relief as needed. The pretreatment peak expiratory flow meter (PEFR) was assessed twice daily using a Mini-Wright PEFR meter (Clement Clark, Harlow, UK). Daily symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, and rescue medication use were recorded on diary cards. FEV<sub>1</sub> was assessed 5 times (at -2, 0, 8, 16, and 24 weeks) by calibrated spirometry. Both PEFR and FEV<sub>1</sub> were presented as percent predicted values. An Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ; range: 0, absent, to 6, severe) was completed 4 times (at 0, 8, 16, and 24 weeks), and the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ; range: 1, severe impairment, to 7, not impaired) validated by the Korean Society of Allergology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> was recorded 3 times (at 0, 8, and 24 weeks).</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping</title><p>Genotyping of the ADRB2 Arg16Gly polymorphism was performed all study using a single base extension method. The sequences of the amplifying and extension primers for the ADRB2 Arg16Gly polymorphism were forward 5'AAAATTA TGCTCCAGGAGTCTCA-3', reverse 5'-ATAAGTTTCTTGG CTGATTAAGATCA-3', and extension 5'-tttacttgtgatgaatagaa aaatt3'. Primer extension reactions were performed with the SNaPshot ddNTP primer extension kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The results were analysed after completion of this study, using the ABI Prism GeneScan and Genotyper software (Applied Biosystems). Among the study subjects, 13 individuals were Arg/Arg homozygous, 25 individuals were Arg/Gly heterozygous and 5 individuals were Gly/Gly homozygous genotypes. Study subjects were categorized into 2 groups: Arg/Arg and Arg/Gly plus Gly/Gly groups, because of limited number for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Lung function [percent predicted value of FEV<sub>1</sub>, forced vital capacity (FVC), and MMEF] and the change in ACQ and AQLQ scores between groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Student's t-test was used to compare demographic data among the study groups. Values of <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 were regarded as significant. The primary outcome of the study was asthma control characterized by FEV<sub>1</sub> and MMEF (% predicted value), measured at every visit. Secondary outcomes were morning/evening PEFR (% predicted value), morning/evening PEFR variability (evening PEFR minus morning PEFR as a percentage of evening PEFR), asthma symptoms (range: 0 absent to 3 severe), frequency of rescue medication use, and ACQ and AQLQ scores. Patients were stratified into two groups depending on the ADRB2 codon 16 genotype, Arg/Arg and Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly. Owing to the repeated measurements of primary and secondary response variables within each phase of experiment, longitudinal data analysis was applied within the context of the intention-to-treat principle. Mean PEFR from each individual was parallel transformed into origin of y axis at starting point of the study. The transformed data were presented as reversible PEFR. The data were fitted and modeled using a non-linear regression (SIGMAPLOT 9.0) for the 2 genotype groups. The regression equations were satisfied by independency, normality and constant variance of residual error.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The clinical and physical characteristics of 43 enrolled patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. There were no significant differences in baseline spirometry results between the 2 genotype groups, with the Arg/Arg genotype group having a mean FEV<sub>1</sub> of 77.8% and the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotype group having a mean FEV<sub>1</sub> of 73.5%. Mean age and serum total immuno globulin (Ig) E level were significantly higher in the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotype group than in the Arg/Arg genotype group (41.5 &#x000b1; 10.9 vs. 30.8 &#x000b1; 10.6 years, 2.34 &#x000b1; 0.5 vs. 1.89 &#x000b1; 0.57 IU/mL, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, respectively).

After 24 weeks of active treatment, the treatment effects showed significant differences between the 2 genotypes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the requirement for rescue medicine according to genotype (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>The morning PEFR, measured daily in all subjects, increased after active treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>); the regression equations were y = 89.59 + 5.99&#x000d7;(1 - 0.97^ time) for the Arg/Arg genotype and y = 74.91 + 3.13&#x000d7;(1 - 0.95^ time) for the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotypes. The evening PEFR level was also increased after active treatment, and the equations were y = 90.78 + 6.49&#x000d7;(1 - 0.97^ time) for the Arg/Arg genotype and y = 75.30 + 3.52&#x000d7;(1 - 0.97^ time) for the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The slopes were calculated using the differential equation of the best-fit line (y = -b&#x000d7;c^ time&#x000d7;In&#x0003c;c&#x0003e;), the plotted line of each genotype showed different inclination; the slope for the Arg/Arg genotype was steeper than that for the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotype during the active treatment period, however it wasn't calculated by a statistical tool. The time to reach the plateau morning and evening PEFR levels was longer for the Arg/Arg genotype (87 days for the morning PEFR, 98 days for the evening PEFR) than for the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotype (52 and 81 days, respectively).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The ADRB2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates the actions of catecholamines in multiple tissues.

Our findings suggest that patients with the Arg/Arg genotype would receive greater benefit from the regular use of the combined treatment of ICS and LABA as a maintenance treatment than patients with the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotype. Our primary outcome variables were FEV<sub>1</sub>% and MMEF% predicted values, which are recognized as useful indicators that correlate well with clinical outcomes in asthma. Along with these improvements in lung function, patients in the Arg/Arg group exhibited parallel changes in other outcome variables, such as the symptom and quality of life scores and morning/evening PEFR, all suggesting a clinically relevant genotype-specific effect. Although the Arg/Arg group was younger in age, asthma duration was not different between the 2 groups and lung function parameters were presented as % predicted value, and therefore, the effect of age is likely minimal. Moreover, these findings on the difference in the rates of increase of morning and evening PEFR were replicated, as seen in 2 different genotype-specific equations. Therefore this model could be applied to predict morning/evening PEFR responses with long-term regular use of combination treatment.</p><p>The pharmacogenetic response to &#x003b2;2-agonist in this study was not consistent with previous studies in Caucasian subjects that subjects carrying the Gly/Gly genotype at codon 16 of ADRB2 achieved a greater bronchodilation response to a short-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist and a long-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist without ICS,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> however similar to a previous study in a Korean population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> that individuals carrying the Arg/Arg genotype achieved a better response to short-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist. This inconsistency result might be due to pharmaco-ethnic difference: ethenic-specific pharmacogenetic difference of ADRB2 Arg16Gly was previously reported between Puerto Rican and Mexican subjects with asthma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> There are several polymorphisms in ADRB2 gene, and these functional SNPs can change in receptor expression and signal transduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref> This means drug response to inhaled &#x003b2;2-agonists can be altered according to specific haplotype which is constructed by polymorphisms. In the present study, however, we focused on the Arg16Gly because of its important clinical relevance and high minor allele frequency compared to other polymorphisms. Therefore, we couldn't exclude possibility of any pharmacogenetic effect of other polymorphisms and the pharmaco-ethnic difference observed might be related to other polymorphisms in linkage with the ADRB2 Arg16Gly which we studied.</p><p>Different pharmacogenetic effect of ADRB2 polymorphism on the combination therapy (ICS plus LABA) may be explainable by different clinical trial. A recent 6-month double blind randomized study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> revealed no genotype effect of ADRB2 on the combination therapy in 2,250 asthmatics. These investigators enrolled larger numbers of Arg/Arg homozygous in a longer treatment period than that of Wechsler et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> The size of the study population and design of clinical trial are important for observing pharmacogenetic effect of ADRB2.</p><p>In the present study, LABA treatment was combined with ICS, therefore it is quite possible that the differences in response to ICS between genotype groups could account for the observed differences. However, this possibility is quite unlikely, because that all the study subjects used the same regimen of ICS during the 2-week run-in, and showed improvement in both FEV<sub>1</sub> and MMEF, with no significant differences observed between genotype groups. Our preliminary study demonstrated that genetic variance of ADRB2 at Arg16Gly could not influence the effect of ICS in a Korean population (unpublished data). Therefore, we propose that the genotype-specific effects found in this study may have been derived from the effects of the long-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist and the ADRB2 Arg16Gly polymorphism, although the effects of ICS on the differential response to LABA according to ADRB2 genotype could not completely be excluded.</p><p>Another explanation for the difference between this study and that of Wechsler et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> involves the choice of LABA; formoterol vs. salmeterol. Cho et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> studied the response to a short-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist in a Korean population using albuterol, and found that those carrying the Arg/Arg genotype had better responses to albuterol. This result is similar to our present result, however, dissimilar the finding of long-term albuterol treatment reported by Israel et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> Further investigation is needed to replicate these observations in other Asian populations and confirm these apparent pharmaco-ethnic differences.</p><p>In this study, FEV<sub>1</sub> and MMEF levels in patients with the Arg/Arg genotype decreased with disappearance of a significant difference in the FEV<sub>1</sub> level between the 2 genotype groups at 24 weeks. However, these findings were observed in subjects with the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotype from 16 weeks. Moreover, the morning/evening daily PEFR results demonstrated that the time to reach the plateau of PEFR levels was significantly shorter in the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotype, suggesting that adverse effects such as downregulation of &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor occur earlier in the Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly type, although the mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In conclusion, Korean asthmatic patients carrying the Arg/Arg genotype at codon 16 of ADRB2 achieve better asthma control with long-term use of combined treatment with a long-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist and ICS, as evidenced by airway function, asthma symptoms, and quality of life. Because of these effects and potential pharmaco-ethic differences in response, ADRB2 genotyping is likely to play an increasingly important role in the choice of treatment for asthmatic patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the Basic Research Program of the <funding-source>Korea Science and Engineering Foundation</funding-source> (<award-id>R01-2006-000-10775-0</award-id>) and the <funding-source>Korea Health 21 R&#x00026;D Project of the Ministry of Health and Welfare</funding-source>, Republic of Korea (<award-id>A07001</award-id>).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>O'Byrne</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bisgaard</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Godard</surname><given-names>PP</given-names></name><name><surname>Pistolesi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Palmqvist</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Budesonide/formoterol combination therapy as both maintenance and reliever medication in asthma</article-title><source>Am J Respir Crit Care Med</source><year>2005</year><volume>171</volume><fpage>129</fpage><lpage>136</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15502112</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pauwels</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>L&#x000f6;fdahl</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Postma</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Tattersfield</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Byrne</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Barnes</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effect of inhaled formoterol and budesonide on exacerbations of asthma.
