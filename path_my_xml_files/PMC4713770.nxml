in endurance athletes. [Subjects] Eighteen female university athletes requiring high
endurance exercise capabilities were classified into 2 groups: 10 retired players
(detraining group) and 8 active players (training group). [Methods] Brachial-ankle pulse
wave velocity, an index of arterial stiffness, was measured a total of 6 times:
immediately before retirement of the detraining group and at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months
after retirement. [Results] Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was measured in the
training group at the same 6 points to allow comparison with the detraining group. The
brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in the detraining group increased significantly at 3
and 12 months as compared with that at 0 months and showed a significant increase at 12
months compared with that at 1 month. Moreover, the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in
the detraining group was significantly higher at 3, 6, and 12 months than in the training
group. [Conclusion] These results revealed that detraining may result in increased
arterial stiffness from 3 months onward in endurance athletes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Branchial-ankle pulse wave velocity</kwd><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It is well known that heart and cerebrovascular diseases rank high among causes of death
associated with arteriosclerosis progression in the Japanese population. Therefore,
preventing the onset of arteriosclerosis or inhibiting its progression is key to reducing
mortality rates. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a widely used index of arteriosclerosis. PWV
represents the speed of an arterial wave caused by cardiac contraction and circulation of
blood from the center to the periphery, reflecting arterial stiffness, a functional
characteristic of arteriosclerosis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
noninvasive method was established by Bramwell and Hill in 1922, over 90&#x02005;years ago<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. While carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV) is the
current gold standard, the development of devices that can easily measure brachial-ankle PWV
(baPWV) and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) with high reproducibility has resulted in
renewed interest concerning PWV measurement in clinical research.</p><p>Although genetic factors are involved in arteriosclerosis, it is also known to be greatly
affected by lifestyle habits such as lack of exercise. Thus, there are many reports on the
relationship between arterial stiffness and exercise. For example, aerobic exercise reduces
arterial stiffness, and the PWV is low in individuals who habitually engage in aerobic
exercise as compared with those who do not<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, arterial stiffness is reportedly low in endurance
athletes who continue to perform advanced aerobic exercise as compared with healthy people
in general<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Arterial stiffness
improvement is observed after an aerobic exercise intervention with a relatively short
period of just 8 weeks<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and high efficacy
is observed at an exercise frequency of 2 to 5 days a week<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meanwhile, the effect of muscle training on arterial stiffness has
also been studied. According to these studies, arterial stiffness was higher in muscle
strength-trained athletes than in untrained subjects<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>; high-intensity muscle training increased arterial stiffness,
medium-intensity muscle training did not<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and low-intensity muscle training reduced
arterial stiffness<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thus, the types of sports, as well as their optimal durations and frequencies, needed to
reduce arterial stiffness have been clarified. However, the duration of persistence of such
arterial stiffness improvement has not been elucidated. In this study, we examined the
effects of detraining on temporal changes in arterial stiffness in endurance athletes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Eighteen female university athletes requiring high-endurance exercise capabilities were
included in this study. We examined these 18 subjects by classifying them into 2 groups:
10 retired players (detraining group; DeTr group) and 8 active players (training group; Tr
group). The subjects exercised for 2.5 hours a day 4 to 5 times a week. In previous
studies, female university field hockey players had O<sub>2</sub> max values of
42&#x02013;52&#x02005;mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which were markedly higher than the average
O<sub>2</sub> max in young women<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Past research demonstrates that field hockey requires a
substantial amount of cardiovascular fitness<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. None of the subjects in the present study smoked or habitually
drank alcohol, and none had a family history of coronary heart disease or its risk
factors. None of the females were taking oral contraceptives or undergoing hormone
replacement therapy. In addition, no subjects in the DeTr group began new exercise habits
after retirement. The objective, methods, and safeness of the study were explained to the
subjects in writing or verbally, and each participant submitted an informed consent form
after obtaining a full understanding of the study contents. The study was approved by the
ethics review board of Osaka University of Health and Sport Sciences. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Subjects&#x02019; characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DeTr</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tr</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.7&#x000b1;0.2 *</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.0&#x000b1;0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sport career (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42.7&#x000b1;0.3 *</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.0&#x000b1;3.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156.8&#x000b1;1.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.9&#x000b1;1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.3&#x000b1;2.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.0&#x000b1;1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.6&#x000b1;0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.5&#x000b1;0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body fat (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.7&#x000b1;1.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.4&#x000b1;1.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are shown as the mean &#x000b1; SE. *p&#x0003c;0.05 for the difference between DeTr and Tr.

DeTr group (0&#x02005;M) and at 1 (1 M), 2 (2 M), 3 (3 M), 6 (6 M), and 12 months (12&#x02005;M) after
retirement. In order to examine the effects of detraining, arterial stiffness was measured
at the same 6 time points in the Tr group, which served as the control and continued
training as usual. Arterial stiffness was measured approximately 3 hours after breakfast;
subjects were prohibited from performing strenuous exercises within 12 hours before
measurement and from consuming caffeine after waking up. Arterial stiffness was measured
in a room with the temperature controlled at approximately 24&#x02005;&#x000b0;C after the subjects had
rested for at least 5 minutes<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels were measured at
the left and right brachial arteries by the oscillometric method using form
PWV/ABI<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Omron Colin Co., Ltd., Komaki, Japan), and the mean left and right
brachial artery blood pressures were adopted as the representative level.</p><p>Arterial stiffness was measured by baPWV, which was determined using form
PWV/ABI<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Komaki, Japan). With baPWV, artery stiffness can be measured
noninvasively; a cuff for blood pressure measurement is used to detect pulse waves at both
forearms and ankle joints, and the PWV is obtained based on the time difference in the
pulse wave rise point, from pulse waves at the forearms and ankle joints, and the blood
vessel length (the distance obtained by subtracting the blood vessel length from the
valvular ostium to the ankle joints and forearms). Because baPWV corresponds to the PWV
between the brachial and peroneal arteries, a muscular artery is measured instead of
elastic arteries such as the aorta; however, as the value obtained for the muscular artery
shows a high correlation with the PWV of the aorta by the catheter method and has
favorable reproducibility, it is widely applied clinically as the index of
arteriosclerosis in Japan<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mean of
the left and right baPWVs was used as the representative value<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous research, the within- and between-observer
coefficients of brachial ankle PWV variation were 6.5% &#x000b1; 4.1% and 3.6% &#x000b1; 3.9%,
respectively<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All results of this study are presented as means with standard errors. The baPWV and
blood pressure levels were compared using two-factor analysis of variance (group &#x000d7; time).
For statistical calculations, IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 21.0, IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan)
was used, and a p value of less than 5% was considered to indicate a statistically
significant difference.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No interaction between groups and time was observed for SBP. <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Changes in DBP</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 M</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 M</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 M</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 M</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 M</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 M</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DeTr</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.1&#x000b1;1.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.3&#x000b1;1.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.2&#x000b1;1.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.9&#x000b1;1.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.1&#x000b1;2.1 &#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.4&#x000b1;1.5 *&#x000a7;&#x02020;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tr</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.8&#x000b1;1.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.1&#x000b1;1.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.6&#x000b1;1.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.2&#x000b1;1.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.8&#x000b1;1.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.0&#x000b1;2.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are shown as the mean &#x000b1; SE.</p><p>*significantly higher than 0&#x02005;M (p&#x0003c;0.05). &#x000a7;significantly higher than 1&#x02005;M

endurance athletes. Although several past reports have examined the effects of detraining
after relatively short exercise interventions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, no report has examined changes in
arterial stiffness caused by detraining following continuous long-term exercise as in this
study. A prior study, which included an 8- to 12-week exercise intervention, showed that the
arterial stiffness value returned to the pre-exercise level after approximately 4 weeks of
detraining. Although the value before continuous exercise was not measured in the study
subjects, baPWV increased after 3 months (12 weeks) of detraining as compared with the value
after continuous exercise, suggesting that the effects of exercise on arterial stiffness
might be more sustained as the period of continued exercise is increased. This concept is
supported by a previous study conducted by Otsuki et al. that compared arterial stiffness in
endurance athletes based on years of exercise continuation and showed that arterial
stiffness levels were lower in athletes who continued exercise for a longer duration<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was assumed that the effects of exercise
on arterial stiffness would be sustained longer as the duration of exercise increased. The
factors most affecting baPWV, an index of arterial stiffness, were reported to be age,
gender, and blood pressure<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on
its measurement principles, baPWV is considered highly dependent on blood pressure. In the
study subjects, DBP increased significantly after detraining. However, a significant
increase in DBP was not observed until 6 months of detraining, whereas a significant
increase in baPWV was observed at 3 months of detraining.</p><p>Next, we attempted to determine the mechanism by which baPWV increased in the DeTr group.
Increased baPWV, i.e., an increase in arterial stiffness, is mainly attributable to organic
factors associated with changes in the elastin and calcium contents of the arterial wall and
functional factors associated with autonomic nerves and vascular endothelial function.
Considering that baPWV increased in the relatively short period of just 3 months, it is
highly likely that increased arterial stiffness is a change associated with functional
factors. It is assumed that arterial stiffness would be particularly affected by the
presence of vasoactive substances such as the vasorelaxant nitric oxide (NO) and the
vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1), both of which have key vascular endothelial functions.
These vasoactive substances are reportedly increased and decreased (NO and ET-1,
respectively) by exercise; furthermore, blood NO levels increased and blood ET-1 levels
decreased after an 8-week aerobic exercise intervention, returning to the pre-exercise
levels after detraining for 8 weeks<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
has also been reported that blood NO levels are high in young atheletes<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Animal studies
have shown that administration of NO synthetic inhibitors increases PWV in the common iliac
artery without accompanying changes in mean blood pressure (MBP)<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, while administration of ET-1 receptor antagonists
decreases PWV in the common iliac artery without accompanying changes in MBP<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Presumably, an increase in baPWV due to
detraining may be the result of reduced NO production and increased ET-1 production.</p><p>An increase in baPWV was observed earlier than an increase in DBP, suggesting that baPWV is
a useful vascular index for understanding the effects of detraining at an early stage.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Yamashina</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomiyama</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Takeda</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Validity, reproducibility, and clinical significance of
