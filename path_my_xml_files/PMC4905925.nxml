movements on muscle activity in male adults with functional ankle instability. [Subjects
and Methods] 28 adults with functional ankle instability, divided randomly into an
experimental group, which performed balance training by applying knee joint movements for
20 minutes and ankle joint exercises for 10 minutes, and a control group, which performed
ankle joint exercise for 30 minutes. Exercises were completed three times a week for 8
weeks. Electromyographic values of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, peroneus
brevis, and the lateral gastrocnemius muscles were obtained to compare and analyze muscle
activity before and after the experiments in each group. [Results] The experimental group
had significant increases in muscle activity in the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus,
and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, while muscle activity in the peroneus brevis increased
without significance. The control group had significant increases in muscle activity in
the tibialis anterior and peroneus longus, while muscle activity in the peroneus brevis
and lateral gastrocnemius muscles increased without significance. [Conclusion] In
conclusion, balance training by applying knee joint movements can be recommended as a
treatment method for patients with functional ankle instability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Functional ankle instability</kwd><kwd>Balance training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Modernly, more and more people participate in sport activities for leisure, leading to an
increase in sport-related injuries. The most frequently damaged area in the body is a lower
extremity, accounting for approximately 77% of all injuries. More specifically, damage to
the knee joints accounts for 21% of injuries, and that to the ankle joints accounts for 18%
of injuries<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, ankle sprain
is one of the main causes of the impediment of activity, and 20&#x02013;40% of patients with
sprained ankles progress into having chronic ankle instability, which causes pain and
instability in ankle joints, thereby causing reinjury of the ankle sprain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Ankle instability can lead to pain, weakened muscle strength, decreased proprioception,
balance difficulties, and the impediment of activities. Thus, balance training,
proprioceptive-stimulation training, muscle-strengthening exercises, and manual therapy are
used to increase the stability of ankle joints<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these treatments, balance training is
a widely used method that can improve posture control and proprioception and increase the
stability of ankle joints<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study,
balance training with knee joint movements was used rather than balance training alone.
Balance training increases the stability of ankle joints, and a previous study reported that
controlling ankle joints through knee joint flexion can not only absorb the impact of the
ankle joints appropriately, but knee joints can also strategically compensate for weakened
muscle strength and ankle instability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, patients are easily upset by
balance training due to its monotony and may quit the training sooner than planned; however,
patients using a balance-training apparatus to apply knee joint movements can watch the
monitor while exercising, thereby achieving active exercise with a will to move, and they
are more easily able to overcome feelings of monotony<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of balance training by applying knee
joint movements on muscle activity in the ankle joints of male adults with ankle instability
while inducing sudden inversion of ankle joints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study selected 28 adult male subjects between 19 and 30&#x02005;years of age who had

an ankle sprain at least once, those who felt giving way in their ankle joints, those with a
Cumberland Ankle Instability Toolscore below 24 points, and those who could support their
body weight fully while conducting the tasks in this study. The exclusion criteria were as
follows: those with no other particular diseases than ankle instability, those who had
experienced ankle joint surgery in the past, and those who felt pain in their ankles while
performing daily activities.</p><p>All of the subjects understood the purpose of this study and gave their written consent
before participating, according to the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration.
Ethical approval was obtained by the local university or hospital research ethics
boards.</p><p>In this study, subjects were divided into an experimental balance-training group, to which
knee joint movements were applied, and an exercise control group, which conducted muscle
stretching and muscle strengthening exercises. Examination was conducted prior to
intervention, and a post-examination was conducted after eight weeks of intervention.</p><p>For the balance trainer, a Bal Pro (Man &#x00026; Tel Co., Korea) was used, and knee joint
movements were applied. The balance trainer consists of a screen, a pressure sensor that can
sense the horizontal movements of weight loads on the foothold, a tilt sensor that can
perceive the angle of the knee joint, and a main body containing programs to process the
information perceived by the tilt sensor. The pressure sensor at the foothold can sense the
body weight centers of patients to help them move horizontally using a finger-shaped cursor
on the screen during the game as the body weight is moved to the right or left. A tilt
sensor detects the angle of flexion and extension of the knee joints. For example, when the
knees are bent, a cursor is raised, and when the knees are extended, a cursor descends,
thereby performing training to touch various fruits arranged randomly on a tree on the
screen. Training difficulty consists of seven levels, which can be adjusted with the size of
the finger-shaped cursor, size of the fruits, and number of fruits. As the finger-shaped
cursor on the screen andsize of the fruits become smaller and the number of fruits
increases, the level of difficulty of the training also increases<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The balance training was conducted three times a week for 8 weeks. Each exercise timespan
was 30 minutes. Out of the 30 minutes, 20 minutes were allocated for balance training, while
10 minutes were allocated for exercise treatment of the ankle joints. The intensity of the
ankle joint exercise treatment was adjusted gradually in accordance with the patient&#x02019;s
condition. The control group applied stretching and muscle-strengthening exercises. The
exercise was conducted three times a week for 8 weeks, and the intensity was adjusted
gradually according to the patient&#x02019;s condition.</p><p>For examination, a trap door was employed to analyze the ankle injuries kinematically. The
trap door was a foothold designed specifically to induce sudden ankle joint inversion,
similar to a lateral ankle joint strain. Once a patient stood on the trap door with bare
feet, a rope connected to the vertical supports at both sides was pulled, and the trap door
opened, thereby inducing sudden inversion of ankle joints. Since the patients could detect
when the trap door would open, visual and auditory information was blocked<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sudden ankle joint inversion using
the trap door was conducted three times with the dominant foot before and after the
training. The trap door was custom manufactured.</p><p>The electrodes were attached to four muscles that play a role in providingstability of
ankle joints: the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, and lateral
gastrocnemius. The electrodes were attached to the dominant foot. To obtain a mean value of
the muscle activity, three repeated measured amplitudes were averaged and converted into a
root-mean-square value for comparison and analysis. The surface electromyography was used to
generalize the collected data. It standardized measured values on the basis of the maximal
voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) or reference voluntary contraction. In this study,
MVIC was used for standardization, considering that the subjects were active adults. The
reference value of MVIC was represented as a ratio of the mean values of the activity
measured for 2 seconds from the muscle activity start time when inducing the inversion of
ankle joints<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three measurements were
performed, and the mean value was used in the calculation.</p><p>Data analyses were performed using the SPSS program version 20.0. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test was used to test for normality. To identify the changes in each parameter between
before and after training of the two groups, a paired t-test was used. Statistical
significance was accepted for values with p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The measurement result of the MVIC was based on the maximum value of muscle activity

a significant increase in muscle activity in the tibialis anterior and peroneus longus;
however, there was no statisticallysignificant difference between the groups. The study
result is consistent with previous study results, in which an 8 week ankle joint exercise
treatment program was significantly effective in improving the surrounding muscles of ankle
joints and the stability of the ankle joint. The current study&#x02019;s findings are also
consistent with the results of other studies, in which balance training on unstable
footholds increased the muscle activity of the tibialis anterior and peroneus longus
significantly<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, ankle
joint exercise treatment increased muscle activity in the tibialis anterior and peroneus
longus significantly in this study, which proved the treatment effective once again. This
result indicates that balance training by applying knee joint movements stimulates
proprioception, thereby increasing sensory nerve signaling from the damaged pressure
receptors of the ankle joints, which leads to an increase in the motion control of the
surrounding muscles of the ankle joints. The above results indicate that the tibialis
anterior and peroneus longus play an important role in preventing recurring ankle strain and
in the dynamic stabilization of ankle joints.</p><p>Both the balance-training and ankle joint exercise treatment groups had increased muscle
activity in the peroneus brevis, but it was not statistically significant. The above result
is consistent with the results of another study, which reported that the reflexive
contraction of the peroneus brevis was not significantly effective in preventing ankle joint
strain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, it is difficult
to record the electrical activities of the peroneus brevis selectively via surface
electromyography. Therefore, significant values cannot be obtained.</p><p>The balance-training group had statistically increased muscle activity in the lateral
gastrocnemius, whereas the ankle joint exercise treatment group had no significant increase
in the muscle activity in the lateral gastrocnemius. This is because the gastrocnemius
consists of two joint muscles that perform not only plantar flexion in the ankle joints but
also knee joint flexion. Thus, balance training with knee joint movements was more effective
in increasing the muscle activity of the lateral gastrocnemius than the ankle joint exercise
treatment because of the repeated motion of flexion and extension of the knee joints. For
patients with functional ankle instability, the functions of all the muscles and joints
should be considered, rather than treatment that focuses on individual muscles and
joints.</p><p>There are three limitations to this study. First, the muscle activity induced by sudden
inversion in dynamic situations was not measured. In reality, ankle joint strain occurs
frequently in dynamic situations. This study measured muscle activity while inducing sudden
inversion in the standing position, which is a static posture. Second, the muscle activity
limited to the surrounding muscles of the ankle joints was measured. When sudden postural
changes occur, knee joint and hip joint strategies are employed more than ankle joint
strategies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, future studies
should measure the activities of the surrounding muscles of the knee and hip joints. Third,
since our study subjects were limited to male adults only, this study result cannot be
generalized to both sexes or across all age groups.</p><p>The above study results indicated that both the ankle joint exercise treatment and balance
training with knee joint movements were effective for functional ankle instability therapy.
Furthermore, both improved proprioceptive sensibility and the functional capabilities of the
surrounding muscles of the ankle joints, thereby providing a coping mechanism for the
unexpected inversion of ankle joints. Therefore, both exercises can be recommended as
efficient training methods to prevent the recurrence of ankle joint injury and provide
stability to the ankle joints.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Daegu University Research Grant, 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lynch</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Assessment of the injured ankle in the
