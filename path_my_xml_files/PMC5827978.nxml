Previously it has been observed that consumption of bilberry decreases the postprandial insulin demand. The intention with the present study was to compare the impact of different supplements with various polyphenol profiles, on the postprandial glucose and insulin responses in healthy young adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In a randomized, controlled, crossover study the postprandial glycemic and insulin responses were observed in eleven healthy adults after intake of five different beverages containing bilberry (European blueberry), blackcurrant, beetroot, mango and rose hip, respectively; all drinks were enriched with the same composition of fermented oatmeal and probiotics. The control was a glucose drink. The profile and content of the polyphenols in the different beverages were determined by HPLC-DAD analysis. The antioxidative capacity of the different beverages were measured by TEAC and DPPH assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Beverages containing bilberry, blackcurrant, mango or rose hip significantly attenuated the early postprandial insulin response (0&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min), but showed no effect on glucose response. Drinks with bilberry or rose hip reduced the insulin response from the very early phase (0&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min), and had significantly lower insulin index compared with the control. The efficiency of the bilberry and rose hip to decrease early postprandial insulin responses correlated with higher phenolic contents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Supplements with bilberry, blackcurrant, mango or rose hip in the tested probiotic and oatmeal enriched beverage attenuated early-phase insulin response, but had no effect on the postprandial glycemic response. The improved ability of bilberry and rose hip to lower the very early phase of insulin response seems to be due to a higher phenolic content.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">The study was retrospectively registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> with number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03159065?term=NCT03159065&#x00026;rank=1">NCT03159065</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12937-018-0335-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bilberries</kwd><kwd>Blackcurrant</kwd><kwd>Mango</kwd><kwd>Rose hip</kwd><kwd>Beetroot</kwd><kwd>Postprandial insulin response</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Tv&#x000e4;rLivsprogrammet</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001858</institution-id><institution>VINNOVA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Postprandial hyperglycemia contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; both diseases lay burden on the healthcare systems, globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Postprandial hyperglycemia is a condition that can be improved through lifestyle and diet modifications. In functional food research, dietary polyphenols have shown potential to improve the postprandial glucose and insulin responses and promote well-being via several postulated underlying mechanisms: 1) inhibition of carbohydrate digestion and the subsequent glucose absorption, 2) stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, 3) modulation of hepatic glucose output, 4) activation of insulin receptors and glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues, and 5) modulation of intracellular signaling pathways and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Fruits, berries, vegetables, tea and coffee are the common sources of dietary polyphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Decreased postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses have been reported in healthy adults after consumption of freeze-dried fruits (apple peel, blackberry, blackcurrant and strawberry) with green tea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], beetroot juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and blackcurrants and lingonberries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In healthy adults, an attenuated postprandial insulin response, but not glucose response was also reported in some studies with extract of baobab fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and berries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similar effects were observed in obese and insulin-resistant male volunteers after intake of black tea, but not after intake of beetroot juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although the polyphenol-rich fruits and vegetables have showed improving effects on postprandial glycemic and/or insulin responses, the efficacy of the dietary polyphenols in improving postprandial glucose and insulin responses seems to be influenced by multiple factors such as source of polyphenols, dose and sort of polyphenols. For example, the postprandial response was more efficiently decreased after consumption of blackcurrant than of lingonberries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It was speculated that the difference in polyphenol compositions between the two berries could be the contributing factor. However, in another study performed by the same group, no correlation could be found between the insulin lowering effect and the polyphenol composition of the berries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we observed that intake of a drink containing oatmeal fermented by the probiotic strain <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> 299v and supplemented with bilberry (European blueberry) induced a lower postprandial insulin response compared with the white bread control. The lowered acute insulin demand was more profound with higher dose of bilberries. In addition, a corresponding drink supplemented with rose hip decreased the insulin response to some extent, however, not to a statistically significant level. Thus, it is important to clarify the relationship between dietary polyphenols and insulin response.</p><p id="Par9">In the present study, we hypothesized that polyphenol rich beverages enriched with fruits (bilberry, blackcurrant, rose hip and mango) and vegetable (beetroot) can attenuate postprandial glycemic and insulin responses. The presence of a probiotic strain with polyphenol splitting ability in the drink may enhance the physiological availability of the phenolics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The acute postprandial glycemic and insulin responses as well as the polyphenol content and antioxidative capacity of the tested beverages were measured. The relation between the polyphenol content and the postprandial glycemic and insulin responses were examined with multivariate data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par10">The study was a randomized, controlled, crossover study with the aim to investigate and compare the postprandial glycemic and insulin responses after consuming five different probiotic fruit or vegetable beverages.

The difference between the two classes was explained by 31.6% of the variance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and Bil_Rose class had higher levels of phenolics and antioxidant capacities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plots of postprandial responses data. <bold>a</bold> Model calculated to discriminate between Bilberry and Glucose (described response variation, R<sup>2</sup>Y&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63; predicted response variation, Q<sup>2</sup>Y&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48). <bold>b</bold> Model discriminating between Rose hip and Glucose (R<sup>2</sup>Y&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.43, Q<sup>2</sup>Y&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32).

Rose hip showed similar efficiency in attenuating postprandial insulin response. Except for the postprandial period 0&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min, Rose hip led to a decreased insulin response during the 30, 45 and 90&#x000a0;min of postprandial period. GI calculated at 90 and 120&#x000a0;min postprandial were not significantly different between the groups. However, Bilberry and Rose hip had significantly lower II compared with Glucose during both time periods (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These results from Bilberry and Rose hip are in agreement with our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], where we found that the bilberry drink attenuated postprandial insulin response in two separate studies and the same rose hip drink showed an insulin attenuating tendency. In addition, in the present study, Bilberry and Rose hip showed higher efficiencies in lowering the early phase insulin responses in comparison to the other test products. This was linked to their higher levels of the phenolic contents (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The different efficiencies in improving postprandial responses have earlier been observed between blackcurrants and lingonberries that containing different subclasses of polyphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">In the present study, Blackcurrant also led to a reduced early phase postprandial insulin response with a moderate rate compared to Bilberry and Rose hip. At the same time, Bilberry had highest amounts of phenolics, followed by the Blackcurrant (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Anthocyanins account for the major polyphenols in bilberries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It has been reported that consumption of a bilberry extract containing 36% (<italic>w</italic>/w) anthocyanins, reduced both postprandial glycemic and insulin responses in the individuals with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, anthocyanins have been reported to be capable of modulating insulin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, a lower level of anthocyanins in Blackcurrant may have contributed to the different efficacies in reducing insulin response. On the other hand, the observed effect from Rose hip indicates that anthocyanins could not be the sole bioactive compound accounting for the attenuated insulin response. Since the seeds were removed from the rose hip fruits, Rose hip drink did not contain any anthocyanins. On the other hand, Rose hip had the highest amount of total phenolic content. It should be noted that FC assay reagent is nonspecific to phenolic compound, instead it measures the total antioxidant capacity. Therefore, high amount of vitamin C and carotenoids in Rose hip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] could have contributed to the observed highest antioxidant capacity. The highest antioxidant capacity of Rose hip was also confirmed by the TEAC and DPPH assays. Rose hips have been used in traditional medicine for treating multiple illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Consumption of the rose hip extract significantly reduced hyperglycemia in diabetic rats. It was speculated that the antioxidant property of the rose hip extract led to a reduction in the oxidative stress, which helped preserving the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell integrity and finally led to insulinotrophic action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In a recent study in vitro, rose hip extract enhanced the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In an animal study, it was reported that intake of rose hip extract led to increased insulin sensitivity via downregulation of hepatic lipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although the bioactive compounds in rose hip contributing to the observed effects were not identified, these findings suggest that rose hip could have multiple mechanisms of action leading to an improved insulin response.</p><p id="Par34">Interestingly, despite the lowest values determined for total phenolic content, total flavonols and total antioxidant capacity in Mango we observed a decreased postprandial insulin response at 90&#x000a0;min. It has been reported that a major phenolic compound in mango, mangiferin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] could improve glucose and insulin profiles in high fat fed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Also, other bioactive compounds such as carotenoids, vitamin C and dietary fiber in mango may affect the blood glucose and insulin metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. On the contrary, the high polyphenol content in Beetroot was not associated with such a beneficial effect. Again, this indicates that the polyphenol content or antioxidant capacity itself could not be directly linked to the insulin attenuating effects of the present test products. To note, Beetroot had the second highest value of anthocyanin content, which should be from the betalains (pigment compound of beetroot) sharing structural similarities with anthocyanins. Although the retention times of the peaks from Beetroot were different from those of Bilberry and Blackcurrant, we could not distinguish between anthocyanin and betalain with the current HPLC analysis settings due to lack of standard and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis for identification. A degradation product of betalain, neobetanin was associated with a reduced early phase postprandial (0&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min) insulin response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, in the present study we did not observe beneficial effects from Beetroot. We postulated that the postprandial glycemic and insulin improving effects could be linked to the polyphenol content. The high efficiency of Bilberry and Rose hip in attenuating early postprandial insulin responses were correlated with higher phenolic contents. However, phenolic levels alone were not directly linked to the insulin lowering effect. It cannot be ruled out that specific phenolic components could serve as the contributing factors for the observed insulin attenuating effect in the four fruit supplemented test products. Moreover, other bioactive compounds present in the test products may have contributed in a synergistic manner when decreasing insulin demand.</p><p id="Par35">There are limitations in the current study that could be improved in the future research. We intended to investigate and compare the effects of test products with a baseline product containing only fermented oatmeal besides the glucose control group. Unfortunately, we had to exclude the fermented oatmeal group from the data analysis due to improper carbohydrate compensation, and could not assess the impact of probiotic fermented oatmeal per se. Although not evaluated in the current study, beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria in managing glycemic control have been demonstrated in multiple animal models and human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Further research efforts are needed to discover the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">Consistent with the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we found an inconsistency between the early glycemic and the insulin responses. The intake of test products containing bilberry, rose hip, blackcurrant or mango did not affect the postprandial glycemic response, but attenuated early stage postprandial (0&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min) insulin responses. The higher efficiency of bilberry and rose hip drinks in lowering insulin responses was associated with amounts of phenolics. The health-related relevance of our findings is that consumption of food products that induce a lower insulin response may enhance insulin sensitivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
