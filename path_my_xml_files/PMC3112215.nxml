Dofetilide significantly reduced the risk of developing atrial fibrillation compared to placebo in the entire study group and in the subgroup of patients with heart failure. The reduction in the subgroup with recent MI was not statistically significant, but the hazard ratio was similar to the hazard ratio for the heart failure patients, and there was no difference between the effect in the two studies (p = 0.89 for interaction).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Recent studies have indicated that particularly new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) following hospitalization for heart failure or myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with a greater risk of death and stroke than permanent/persistent AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although a number of studies have focused on AF in patients with heart failure and MI little is known about the incidence of new-onset AF following hospitalization in these populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Knowledge of this is important as it may influence the risk of thromboembolism and stroke and the potential benefit of antiarrhythmic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Due to lack of data on this matter, an expert panel appointed by The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has recently strongly recommended further research in AF prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The Danish Investigations of Arrhythmia and Mortality ON Dofetilide (DIAMOND) studies randomised patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and either new or worsening heart failure or a recent MI to treatment with dofetilide or placebo.</p><p>We retrospectively analyzed data from the DIAMOND studies to investigate the incidence of AF in placebo-treated patients with left ventricular dysfunction and either heart failure or recent myocardial infarction. Secondarily we examined the potential benefit of treatment with dofetilide in these populations. Additionally, we assessed risk factors that may contribute to new-onset AF in these two cohorts in order to identify a population that could benefit from treatment with prophylactic anticoagulation or antiarrhythmic agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively analyzed data which was collected by the DIAMOND Investigators from November 1993 to November 1995 (DIAMOND-heart failure), and November 1993 to July 1996 (DIAMOND-MI). The DIAMOND investigations consisted of two separate, randomised, double-blind and multicentered studies. These investigated the safety and efficacy of the oral class III antiarrhythmic agent dofetilide in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and either heart failure or a recent MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>DIAMOND-heart failure enrolled 1518 patients with new or worsening heart failure corresponding to New York Heart Association functional class III or IV and left ventricular systolic dysfunction determined by echocardiography (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &#x02264; 35%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>DIAMOND-MI enrolled 1510 patients who had experienced a MI within the last 7 days and had reduced left ventricular systolic dysfunction determined by echocardiography (LVEF &#x02264; 35%). The diagnosis required elevated enzymes and either typical chest pain and/or electrocardiographic changes suggestive of MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>This study is based on the 12-lead electrocardiograms recorded during the first 72 hours of continuous monitoring at randomisation, and at each out-patient visit, which took place every 3<sup>rd </sup>month. Patients with AF at the 12-lead electrocardiogram at randomisation were classified as baseline AF, and were excluded from the present analysis. Thus, new-onset AF was defined as patients having sinus rhythm at the 12-lead electrocardiograms recorded at randomisation and subsequently developed AF at the 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained at the out-patients visits. AF was defined as coarse or fine fibrillatory waves and completely irregular or regular RR-intervals. The diagnosis of AF was left to the discretion of the investigator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

Categorical variables are presented as counts and percentages. Continuous variables are presented as median values. All tests were two-sided. A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p><p>The competing risk of death is important to take into account when examining the incidence of AF. Simple Kaplan-Meier curves essentially assume that the risk of AF is similar in patients remaining alive and those censored at the time of death. By using a competing risk model appropriate incidences of AF in patients remaining alive are calculated.</p><p>Predictors of new-onset AF were assessed by using Cox proportional hazard regression. The model assumptions (proportional hazard assumption, lack of interaction, and linearity of continuous variables) were tested and found valid unless otherwise indicated. In multivariable analyses we adjusted for heart failure, age, gender, diabetes, ischemic heart disease and LVEF. We furthermore tested, whether there was any interaction between drug and study, drug and age, and drug and gender in order to see whether the effect of dofetilide on new-onset AF differed according to study, age or gender, respectively.</p><p>The competing risk calculations were performed using Stata/IC 11.1 for Windows, whereas all other statistical calculations were performed using the SAS statistical software package for Windows users, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 3028 patients with a LVEF &#x02264; 35% were enrolled in the two DIAMOND studies. For the purpose of this analysis 109 patients in the DIAMOND-MI study and 292 patients in the DIAMOND-heart failure study were excluded due to AF at baseline, leaving 2627 patients for further analysis. In the MI-study 693 patients (49.5%) were randomized to treatment with dofetilide and 708 patients (50.5%) to treatment with placebo.

We found that 1 in 10 patients with new or worsening heart failure and 1 in 35 patients with a recent MI developed new-onset AF during 42 months of follow-up. Dofetilide significantly reduced the incidence of AF with no interaction between drug and study.</p><p>Data from the Framingham Heart Study has found the lifetime risk of new-onset AF in the general population to be 1 in 4 in men and women from the age of 40-years and that new-onset AF is associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, a limited number of studies have investigated the incidence and risk of new-onset AF in populations with ischemic heart disease and heart failure. In this study, we examined the incidence of new-onset AF, whether AF was reduced by dofetilide and predictors of new-onset AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In our heart failure group (DIAMOND-heart failure) the cumulative incidence of new-onset AF was 9.6% (placebo group), and the cumulative incidence 6 months following hospitalization was 6.8%. Our long term result corresponds very well with the findings of recent studies. However we used a competing risk analysis to estimate cumulative risks which is in contrast to the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator employed in other studies. As the populations being studied have a high mortality, in general, the results of other studies can be difficult to interpret as they study the cumulative incidence of AF in patients, without taking the competing risk of mortality of AF development into account. Simple Kaplan Meier graphs with censoring for death assumes a similar risk of AF in patients that die to those remaining in the analyses. This can cause distorted interpretations when the risk of death is high. Diversities between studies can also be accounted for by differences in study design and length of follow-up. The Prospective Randomized study of Ibopramine on Mortality and Efficacy (PRIME) II study enrolled patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction with a mean follow-up of 4 years, during which the cumulative incidence of AF is 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The retrospective study of the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-Heft) database examined the effect of the angiotensin-II receptor blocker valsartan on development of AF in patients with symptomatic heart failure and a LVEF &#x02264; 40% compared to placebo. During a mean follow-up of 23 months 8.0% in the placebo group and 5.1% in the valsartan group develop AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the DIG trial, 8866 patients (11.1%) developed supraventricular tachycardia at least once during 37 months of follow-up. In the Carvedilol OR Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), 580 of 2429 (23%) develop AF during 58 months of follow-up.</p><p>The incidence of new-onset AF in patients with a recent MI has been the subject of few studies. In our MI group (DIAMOND-MI) the non-significant effect of dofetilide on the risk of developing AF can be explained by the few number of patients who experienced AF during follow-up (n = 32). Thus, this study statistically lacked power to provide any clear results of the association between MI and the effect of treatment with dofetilide on new-onset AF. However, we found no interaction with study that is the effect of dofetilide seemed to predict new-onset AF identically in the two populations.</p><p>The cumulative incidence of new-onset AF was 2.9% in the placebo group during 42 months of follow-up of which 2.0% happened during the first 6 months following the event. These results stand in contrast to the results of other studies, which can be explained by differences in important baseline characteristics such as hypertension and diabetes, as well as differences in the duration of follow-up. However, we cannot exclude that AF is underestimated in our study, as we did not examine for AF with continuous Holter monitoring.</p><p>In the Optimal Therapy In Myocardial infarction with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan trial (OPTIMAAL) trial the cumulative incidence of new-onset AF was 7.2% in the study population of patients with MI and either clinical signs of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF&#x02264;40%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>This corresponds to the finding in the GISSI-3 (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienza nell'infarto Miocardico-3) trial in which the overall incidence of in-hospital AF is 7.8% in the patients with a recent MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><sec><title>Risk factors of new-onset AF</title><p>Because of the high risk of stroke and death associated with new-onset AF in heart failure and MI populations, prevention of new-onset AF following hospitalization for heart failure or MI may reduce mortality or stroke. Consequently, the identification of risk factors of the development of new-onset AF in patients hospitalized with heart failure or MI are of great importance.</p><p>In our analysis we found heart failure, increasing age, male gender and LVEF to predict new-onset AF. Heart failure was found to be the strongest predictor of new-onset AF as indicated by a number of other studies in which heart failure is found to be very common in patients with AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Increasing age and male gender are established risk factors of AF which correspond to our results and the effect of dofetilide did not depend on gender or age, as there was no interaction between drug and these parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, LVEF was confirmed as a predictor of new-onset AF which makes it easier to identify patients in high risk of developing AF in the daily clinical life, as the role of echocardiography is increasing.</p><p>The combination of these risk factors may be useful in upcoming trials testing prophylactic interventions against new-onset AF.</p></sec><sec><title>The prognostic impact of AF</title><p>Reduction of the incidence of AF has not been shown to improve survival in patients with severe heart failure so far, nor has rhythm control been found to be superior to rate control in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Published data from the DIAMOND studies found no effect of dofetilide on the risk of mortality but hospitalization was reduced in the heart failure population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Prevention of new-onset AF may, potentially, reduce morbidity and mortality because of the high risk of stroke and death associated with this condition. Interestingly, dronedarone treatment has recently been shown to reduce the primary endpoint of first cardiovascular hospitalization or death of any cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These results suggest that prevention of new-onset AF may have a favourable impact on outcome, but further studies are needed, especially in relation to patients who have had an MI.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has limitations that need to be specified. During the long-term follow-up of the DIAMOND-studies numerous treatment changes occurred, especially with regard to heart failure. These changes are impossible to adjust for in multivariable analysis. Moreover, the diagnosis of new-onset AF was based only on electrocardiograms recorded at outpatient visits. Therefore our findings are an underestimation of the events. On the other hand, many of the patients might have undiagnosed paroxysmal AF at baseline. However, the message of this paper remains unchanged; the relatively high incidence of AF should be kept in mind, when managing patients with left ventricular dysfunction and, especially, new or worsening heart failure. Furthermore, if symptomatic, rhythm control can be achieved effectively through prophylactic administration of dofetilide.</p><p>The DIAMOND-studies were not designed to evaluate the incidence of AF which might have contributed to some unknown biases, although the double-blinded randomization should have minimized biases. The size of this study was a limitation, especially due to the very high competing risk of mortality in the population. This was most notable in the MI-group, as the relatively few events in this group resulted in statistical lack of power to show a significant effect of dofetilide on the risk of new-onset AF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with left ventricular dysfunction the incidence of AF at 42 months was 9.6% in patients with new or worsening heart failure and 2.9% in patients with a recent MI, and these results were based on a competing-risk analysis, that is, the estimated risk of developing AF, when the competing risk of death is taken into account.</p><p>The administration of dofetilide reduced the incidence of new-onset AF significantly by 42% compared to placebo and there was no interaction between dofetilide and study (p = 0.89 for interaction). Dofetilide is indicated as prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment of AF in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and either symptomatic heart failure or myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MDS (author of correspondence) analysed and interpreted the data, performed supplementary statistical analyses and drafted the manuscript.
