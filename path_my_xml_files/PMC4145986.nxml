We used functional MRI to investigate whether motor performance of the untrained limb could be improved using a serial reaction time task according to motor sequential learning of the trained limb, and whether these skill acquisitions led to changes in brain activation patterns. We recruited 20 right-handed healthy subjects, who were randomly allocated into training and control groups. The training group was trained in performance of a serial reaction time task using their non-dominant left hand, 40 minutes per day, for 10 days, over a period of 2 weeks. The control group did not receive training. Measurements of response time and percentile of response accuracy were performed twice during pre- and post-training, while brain functional MRI was scanned during performance of the serial reaction time task using the untrained right hand. In the training group, prominent changes in response time and percentile of response accuracy were observed in both the untrained right hand and the trained left hand between pre- and post-training. The control group showed no significant changes in the untrained hand between pre- and post-training. In the training group, the activated volume of the cortical areas related to motor function (<italic>i.e</italic>., primary motor cortex, premotor area, posterior parietal cortex) showed a gradual decrease, and enhanced cerebellar activation of the vermis and the newly activated ipsilateral dentate nucleus were observed during performance of the serial reaction time task using the untrained right hand, accompanied by the cross-motor learning effect. However, no significant changes were observed in the control group. Our findings indicate that motor skills learned over the 2-week training using the trained limb were transferred to the opposite homologous limb, and motor skill acquisition of the untrained limb led to changes in brain activation patterns in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neural regeneration</kwd><kwd>neuroimaging</kwd><kwd>cross-training effects</kwd><kwd>motor skill learning</kwd><kwd>cortical activation</kwd><kwd>cerebellar activation</kwd><kwd>serial reaction time task</kwd><kwd>functional MRI</kwd><kwd>response time</kwd><kwd>response accuracy</kwd><kwd>primary motor cortex</kwd><kwd>dentate nucleus</kwd><kwd>vermis</kwd><kwd>grants-supported paper</kwd><kwd>photographs-containing paper</kwd><kwd>neuroregeneration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><p><bold>Research Highlights</bold></p><p>(1) We examined changes in brain activation patterns after motor sequential learning in the untrained hand after training of the opposite hand.</p><p>(2) Measurements of response time and accuracy were performed, while functional MRI was scanned during performance of a serial reaction time task.</p><p>(3) Sequential motor skill was transferred to the opposite hand, which led to changes in brain activation patterns in the cerebral and cerebellar regions.</p><p>(4) Elucidation of the cross-training effect will provide valuable therapeutic guidelines for clinicians who treat patients with unilateral limb motor dysfunction.</p><p>(5) This is the first evidence for changes in brain activity patterns in the cortical and cerebellar structures according to cross transfer of motor skill acquisition.</p></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cross-training is a well-known phenomenon where training of a unilateral limb leads to movement effectiveness of the opposite untrained limb[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

This motor improvement is likely to be caused by transitional motor skills to the homogenous contralateral hand, explained by the cross-training effect.</p><p>By contrast, compared with the training group, the control group did not show significant improvements in these motor properties. In neuroimaging data, motor skills that are cross-transferred to the untrained hand reflected changes in brain activity pattern in the cortical and cerebellar structures. These findings imply that motor skill acquisition by a cross-training effect leads to a change in motor performance capacity, accompanied by efficient and effective processing of neural networks related to motor function.</p><p>Our behavioral findings are consistent with those of numerous prior studies related to the cross-training effect, suggesting that it involves a type of motor learning associated with neural plasticity in the brain[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. According to previous studies examining the effect of muscular strength by cross-transfer learning, the strength gain was achieved in the homologous muscle of the opposite untrained limb, while the same movement task was performed by the trained limb[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The average gain in maximal voluntary contraction using electromyography was approximately 15&#x02013;20% in the untrained homologous muscle, without changes in non-homologous muscles[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, previous studies have reported that electrical stimulation or mental training applied concurrently with cross-limb training result in an increase in muscle strength in the untrained limb[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Together with strength gain, behavioral effects of cross-training have been proven in a variety of motor tasks in terms of occupationally embedded exercise and ballistic motor practice[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>These behavioral changes are well established to reflect motor skill learning in multiple brain regions in cortical and subcortical structures[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As we found no significant differences between the two groups at the initial functional MRI scans, our volumetric data suggest that motor sequential activity required large-scale motor networking in the premotor area, primary sensorimotor area, posterior parietal cortex, and cerebellum. These results are consistent with prior studies examining brain activity concurrent with performance of sequence movement[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. After 2 weeks of training with the untrained hand, we found extinction of the ipsilateral hemispheric activation and decreased contralateral hemispheric activation compared with the control group during performance of sequential motor activity. In addition, blood oxygenation level-dependent signal intensity was increased in the ipsilateral dentate nucleus and the vermis of the cerebellar region. It is generally accepted that recruitment of a large-scale neural network is decreased in the automatic phase[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], as motor learning progresses from a more conscious recollection in the early learning phase to an unintentional unconscious form in the late automatic phase.</p><p>Our functional MRI findings of motor sequential learning using the untrained hand showed similar results, which are supported by previous neuroimaging studies reporting changes of cortical activation pattern accompanied by motor skill acquisition using the trained limb[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Possible mechanisms for this cross-training effect can be explained using the proficiency model and the cross-activation model. These models involve formation of dual engrams by transfer of a unilateral engram, which is stored contralateral to the trained limb[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In other words, the unilateral motor engram by repetitive training with the left trained hand is built on the right hemisphere, and its engram is then transferred to the opposite hemisphere according to the cross-training effect. Accordingly, we confirmed that behavioral modification by cross-training effects induced the changes in brain activity pattern similar to that induced by motor skill learning using the trained limb. Unexpectedly, the control subjects showed increased performance and slightly decreased activation in the same areas observed in the training group when compared with the initial test. Presumably, at that point, the subjects had some information on implicit learning strategies and task familiarity.</p><p>Elucidation of motor learning mechanisms is important in the field of neuroscience as it reflects a source of human behavioral modification and it is related to neuronal plasticity. In particular, understanding the cross-training effect will provide valuable therapeutic guidelines for clinicians who treat patients with motor dysfunction in the unilateral upper or lower limb, as unilateral training on the healthy limb in patients with unilateral motor dysfunction (<italic>i.e</italic>., spinal cord injury, hemiparesis and knee arthroplasty) may produce clinical motor improvement in skill transfer using cross-training methods. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of changes in brain activity patterns in the cortical and cerebellar structures according to cross transfer of motor skill acquisition. However, we acknowledge we had a small sample size and no measurement of retention period after motor learning in our study. Thus, further studies are required to elucidate the behavioral and neural mechanisms of the cross-training effect according to full motor learning stages (<italic>i.e</italic>., initial motor skill acquisition to retention stages).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Design</title><p>A comparative functional MRI experiment with repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Time and setting</title><p>This study was performed at functional MRI room, Medical Center, Yeungnam University, Republic of Korea, from June to August 2012.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty healthy volunteers participated in this study by recruitment notice using the following inclusive criteria: (1) right-handed as confirmed by the modified Edinburg Handedness Inventory[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; (2) no previous history of neurological or psychiatric illness; (3) no previous participation in experiments regarding motor sequencing learning with serial reaction time tasks.

The subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation of this study, in accordance with the ethical standards of the <italic>Declaration of Helsinki</italic>[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Motor task paradigm and training procedure</title><p>Subjects were seated in a comfortable chair and placed 50 cm in front of a 17-inch monitor. The square-shaped response buttons were arranged horizontally on a response box connected to a computer. The motor task paradigm was designed using SuperLab Pro 4.0 software (Cedrus Co., San Pedro, CA, USA). Each button was labeled with a number representing the finger of the left hand to be used (1, 2, 3, and 4 represented the index, middle, ring, and little fingers, respectively). Motor sequence was composed of a combination of 1, 2, 3, and 4, which were randomly presented on the center of the computer monitor, with equal probabilities of 20%. A total of 200 stimuli per session were provided, and there were 50 trials for each number. When one of the numbers was presented on the screen, the subject was instructed to press the corresponding response button as accurately and quickly as possible using the dominant (right) hand. Stimuli were presented for a period of 1 000 ms, and the interval time between each stimulus was 500 ms for preparation of the next stimuli. Finally, one training session lasting 8 minutes consisted a 5-minute run phase and a 3-minute resting phase. The non-dominant left hand in the training group performed five repetitions of each training session for 40 minutes per day. The training group received 5 days of motor training per week for 2 consecutive weeks, whereas the control group did not receive any training. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> indicates the motor task and the functional MRI paradigm in the total experimental procedure.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Schematic of the experiment.</p><p>(A) Example of training setting.

The head, trunk, and arms were restrained to prevent motion artifacts during functional MRI experiments. The serial reaction time task for functional MRI scanning was presented by SuperLab Pro 4.0 software. Through a tilted mirror on the head coil of the MRI equipment, a rear-projection screen outside of the scanner was visible to the participants. According to the visual stimulation presented on the screen, participants pressed the buttons (LU440-LINE, Cedrus Co.), which were arranged horizontally on a response box connected to a computer. For the functional MRI paradigm, the activation paradigm was designed as four repeating blocks, which consisted of the serial reaction time task phase and the resting phase (each for 63 seconds). A ready period of 3 seconds was provided to allow the participants to prepare for task performance. Finally, to test region-specific condition effects for each of the phases, we subtracted the four resting phases from the four serial reaction time task phases.</p><p>To measure the changes in motor response and cortical activation pattern according to the cross-training effect, functional MRI scanning was performed twice during pre- and post-training, while the subjects performed the serial reaction time task with their dominant right hand using the same paradigm of the training procedure. The examiner continuously monitored the situation of the task performance through a video camera outside of the functional MRI scanner. Before performance of the serial reaction time task, all subjects took a practice block for accommodation with the task and the experimental procedure. In the behavioral function of the reaction time at the two tests, response time and percentile of correct response were measured using SuperLab Pro 4.0 software.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Functional MRI analysis</title><p>The blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI measurement, which employs the echo planar imaging technique, was performed using a 1.5-T Philips Gyroscan Intera scanner (Hoffman-LaRoche, Ltd., Best, The Netherlands) with a standard head coil. Foam padding was used to secure and limit the head motion of each participant within the coil. Twenty-eight slices were acquired using a single shot echo planar imaging sequence (time of repetition/echo time = 3 000/50 ms, flip angle 70&#x000b0;, field of view 210 mm, matrix 64 &#x000d7; 64, slice thickness 5 mm), and each functional run consisted of 85 images (including 5 dummies). Repetitive alternating phases of control and stimulation with serial reaction time task were performed as the stimulation task. Each &#x0201c;control and stimulation&#x0201d; task was repeated four times.</p><p>SPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) was used for analysis of all functional images. A slice timing correction and motion realignment were used for preprocessing of all images. Next, for multiple-subject comparisons, we performed spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute echo planar imaging template supplied with SPM8 software, and smoothing with an 8 mm the full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Differences in brain activation between the training and control groups were compared by a random effect group analysis (corrected <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Quantitative comparisons between the training and control groups were obtained in terms of the changes of blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in selected regions of interest, focusing on the hand area of the primary sensorimotor area, premotor area, supplementary motor area, posterior parietal lobes, and cerebellum. For blood oxygenation level-dependent signal analysis, spherical volumes of interest (5 mm radius) were defined using the Talairach coordinates of the highest t values in the regions of interest of individual data. Averaged map changes of blood oxygenation level-dependent signal intensities by group analysis were extracted for each volume of interest using the differences of signal changes between the activation and recall conditions of each functional MRI experiment.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An independent <italic>t</italic>-test was used for the comparison of differences between the training and control groups in terms of the baseline data for response time, percentile of correct response, and age. All data were evaluated through separate univariate analyses of variance, using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (groups: training group, control group) &#x000d7; 2 (test sessions: pre-training, post-training) on the two dependent variables of response time and correct response.
