Numerous non-surgical interventions have been proposed for this disorder, however there is limited evidence for their efficacy. Intra-articular injections of hyaluronan have shown beneficial effects in case-series and clinical trials for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. However, no study has evaluated the efficacy of this form of treatment using a randomised placebo controlled trial. This article describes the design of a randomised placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan (Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) to reduce pain and improve function in people with hallux limitus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>One hundred and fifty community-dwelling men and women aged 18 years and over with hallux limitus (who satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be recruited.</p><p>Participants will be randomised, using a computer-generated random number sequence, to receive a single intra-articular injection of up to 1 ml hyaluronan (Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or sterile saline (placebo) into the first MPJ. The injections will be performed by an interventional radiologist using fluoroscopy to ensure accurate deposition of the hyaluronan in the joint. Participants will be given the option of a second and final intra-articular injection (of Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in) either 1 or 3 months post-treatment if there is no improvement in pain and the participant has not experienced severe adverse effects after the first injection. The primary outcome measures will be the pain and function subscales of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire. The secondary outcome measures will be pain at the first MPJ (during walking and at rest), stiffness at the first MPJ, passive non-weightbearing dorsiflexion of the first MPJ, plantar flexion strength of the toe-flexors of the hallux, global satisfaction with the treatment, health-related quality of life (assessed using the Short-Form-36 version two questionnaire), magnitude of symptom change, use of pain-relieving medication and changes in dynamic plantar pressure distribution (maximum force and peak pressure) during walking. Data will be collected at baseline, then 1, 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

The terms <italic>hallux limitus </italic>and <italic>hallux rigidus </italic>have frequently been used interchangeably to describe differing severities of pain and limitation of motion associated with OA at the first MPJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Hallux limitus </italic>is a progressive osteoarthritic condition of the first MPJ that may advance to an end-stage presentation of <italic>hallux rigidus </italic>where the joint fuses and there is a complete restriction of motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. First MPJ OA is the second most common disorder affecting the foot after hallux valgus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of the condition increases with age, and it has been reported that radiographic changes in the first MPJ affect are evident in approximately 46% of women and 32% of men at 60 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Osteoarthritis at the first MPJ is characterised by the symptoms of pain and stiffness at the joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Secondary painful symptoms relate to compensations during gait that may occur due to the reduced motion of the first MPJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The presence of pain associated with first MPJ OA impacts on normal walking and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of hallux limitus involves conservative measures (such as physical therapy, foot orthoses, footwear modification, joint manipulation and injection with corticosteroid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], or surgical intervention (either joint-salvage or joint-destructive procedures) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Pharmacological treatment is also often undertaken as an adjunct for pain relief in the management of hallux limitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have been found to be effective in the management of various forms of OA, gastrointestinal complications remain a concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In light of these limitations with existing treatments, an alternative treatment termed 'viscosupplementation' &#x02013; the intra-articular injection of hyaluronan into arthritic joints with the aim of restoring the viscoelasticity of the synovial fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] &#x02013; has been proposed and has attracted considerable attention in the medical literature as a treatment for OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In particular, both the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommend hyaluronan in the management of OA of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although the results of systematic reviews investigating the effectiveness of this type of treatment for knee OA are controversial, the most recent update of the Cochrane systematic review evaluating viscosupplementation for the treatment of knee OA concluded that viscosupplementation was both safe and effective for the treatment of OA and was superior or equivalent to any form of systemic intervention or intra-articular corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite there being a large number of studies investigating the effectiveness of hyaluronan for knee OA, few studies have investigated the effects of this form of treatment for OA at the first MPJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In a case-series retrospective study, 14 patients with radiographically confirmed OA at the first MPJ that received up to 3 intra-articular injections of 1 ml hyaluronan (Ostenil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Mini) (sodium hyaluronate) reported a statistically significant reduction in pain (reported using a visual analogue scale) after 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The treatment was well tolerated, with 3/14 (21%) participants reporting mild adverse reactions at the injection site. In another study, Pons et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] compared a single intra-articular injection of 1 ml Ostenil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Mini (sodium hyaluronate) with 1 ml Trigon depot<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(triamcinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid) for the treatment of painful, grade 1 hallux limitus (Karasick and Wapner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] scale) in 37 participants (40 feet) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Both treatment groups showed statistically significant reductions in pain at rest or on palpation for up to 12 weeks post-injection. However, hyaluronan treatment resulted in a statistically significant greater reduction in pain during walking and greater improvement in the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux MPJ score compared to treatment with triamcinolone acetonide. The treatment with hyaluronan was well tolerated, with 2/20 (10%) participants reporting mild adverse reactions at the injection site.</p><p>Although both of these studies suggest that intra-articular hyaluronan is safe and effective for the treatment of hallux limitus, neither used a placebo control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This limitation is significant as a placebo effect can account for 79% of the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Further, both studies are limited in that neither of the studies used blinding of both the participants and assessors in their protocols. It is therefore possible that the positive effects of hyaluronan may have been overestimated. Accordingly, the aims of this project are to conduct a double blind randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of intra-articular hyaluronan (Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) on (i) foot pain and function; (ii) the range of motion of the first MPJ; (iii) the strength of the plantarflexor muscles of the first MPJ; (iv) the health related quality of life; and (v) the use of pain-relieving medications in people with hallux limitus. The study protocol is presented in this paper, consistent with the recommendations of Editorial Board of BioMed Central [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a parallel group, participant and assessor blinded, randomised controlled trial with a 6 month follow-up (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). It has been developed using the principles described by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Clinical Trials Task Force guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Participants will be randomised to receive a single intra-articular injection of up to 1 ml hyaluronan (Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or sterile saline (placebo) into the first MPJ. Allocation to either the Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or placebo groups will be achieved using a computer-generated random number sequence. The allocation sequence will be generated and held by an external person not directly involved in the trial. Concealment of the allocation sequence will be ensured as each participant's allocation will be contained in a sealed opaque envelope. Envelopes will be made opaque by using a sheet of aluminium foil inside the envelope. In addition, a system using carbon paper will be employed so the details (name and date of recruitment) are transferred from the outside of the envelope to the paper inside the envelope containing the allocation prior to opening the seal. Assessors and participants will be blinded to group allocation. Participants will be given the option of a second and final intra-articular injection (of Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in) on days 30 or 90 if there is no improvement in pain and the participant has not experienced severe adverse effects after the first injection).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Design of study</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1757-1146-2-2-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The Human Studies Ethics Committee at La Trobe University (Human Ethics Committee Application No. 07-45) and the Radiation Advisory Committee of the Victorian Department of Human Services have given approval for the study.

Each 2 ml ampoule of Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>contains 16 mg of hylan G-F 20 (cross-linked hylan polymers; hylan A and B), 17 mg sodium chloride, 0.32 mg disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.08 mg sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate. The hyaluronan is extracted from chicken combs and the purified material has an average molecular weight of 6,000 kDa.</p><p>The injections will be performed by the same experienced interventional radiologist (AEZ) using fluoroscopic imaging to ensure accurate deposition of the hyaluronan within the joint. As the Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is provided in ampoules that are labelled with the product name, it will not be possible to blind the injector, however this person is not involved in generation of the allocation order, recruitment, assessment or data analysis.

Either a dorso-lateral or dorso-medial approach for injection will be used at the discretion of the injector (depending on which approach provides minimum interference from the osteophytes at the first MPJ joint margins). No anaesthetic will be used. If the participant has bilateral painful first MPJs, only one side (the most painful side) will be treated and used for data collection.

The Short Form-36 (SF-36) has been extensively validated and is one of the most widely used instruments to measure health status. The SF-36 shows content, concurrent, criterion, construct, and predictive evidence of validity.

A difference of 14 points was determined to be a clinically significant difference worth detecting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and a standard deviation of 25 was derived from a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This calculation included a 5% drop-out rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, we will aim to recruit 150 participants (~75 participants per intervention group).

Two studies have previously investigated the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan for the treatment of first MPJ OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, neither of these studies used a placebo control group. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial using intra-articular hyaluronan for OA of the first MPJ.</p><p>The use of a placebo control group is essential for studies evaluating the effects of intra-articular therapies as there is likely to be a large placebo response related to the injection procedure and this may inflate the results in uncontrolled evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of hyaluronan for knee OA concluded that a placebo effect accounted for 79% of the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The study protocol and outcome measures have been developed in accordance of the recommendations of the OARSI Clinical Trials Task Force guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The outcome measures are pain and function subscales of the FHSQ, pain and stiffness at the first MPJ, range of motion (dorsiflexion) of the first MPJ, plantar flexion strength of muscles of the first MPJ, generic health related quality of life (SF-36), patient satisfaction with treatment, consumption of rescue medication as well as frequency and nature of adverse effects. These outcomes will be measured at baseline then at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. Previous research suggests that the effects of intra-articular hyaluronan persist for up to 12 months following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, the use of follow-up assessments at 6 month post-treatment will allow us to determine if the effects, if any, of intra-articular hyaluronan persist in the longer term.</p><p>Participants will be given the option of a second and final intra-articular injection (of Synvisc<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in) on days 30 or 90 if there is no improvement in their symptoms. Although this has the potential to complicate the interpretation of the results of the study, this protocol was included as it is likely to be more reflective of clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and this is in keeping with the pragmatic nature of this trial.</p><p>In summary, this project is the first randomised controlled trial to be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan for reducing pain and improving function in people with hallux limitus. The study protocol, including interventions, have been pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings are generaliseable to clinical practice. Recruitment for the study will commence in June 2008, and we expect final results to be available in mid-2010.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>HBM and KBL are Editor-in-Chief and Deputy Editor-in-Chief, respectively, of <italic>Journal of Foot and Ankle Research</italic>.
