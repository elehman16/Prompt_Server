The pain caused by the contractions of the uterus can be as severe as labor pain. The study was aimed to evaluate the effects of ice massage applied to the large intestine 4 (LI<sub>4</sub>) on postpartum pain during the active phase of labor.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial with three groups and carried out in two stages. The study sample comprised of 150 pregnant women, who were referred to a maternity hospital. In the experimental group, ice massage was applied to LI<sub>4</sub> during four contractions within the active phase of labor. In the placebo group, pressure was applied to LI<sub>4</sub> using silicone balloons and the third group was the control group. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and The McGill (Melzack) Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) were compared among the experimental, placebo, and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The mothers in the ice application group had the lowest mean VAS score. It was determined that ice massage applied to LI<sub>4</sub> during the active phase of labor did not lead to any statistical differences in mothers in the first 24 hours postpartum in terms of the characteristics of the pain with MPQ and VAS.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In the study, the perception of pain was tried to be minimized by applying pressure with ice balloons to LI<sub>4</sub>. However, although the application was determined to have made no difference in the pain intensity, the mothers&#x02019; statements in the ice application group suggested that they felt more comfortable than did the mothers in the other groups.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hegu</kwd><kwd>ice massage</kwd><kwd>large intestine meridian point 4</kwd><kwd>postpartum pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Usually, pain is a signal of a potential threat, which should be diminished or eliminated. Furthermore, childbirth pain differs from other types of pain with respect to its positive outgrowth; a child is born.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Pain in the immediate postpartum period arises from laceration and stretching of the perineum. The pain also arises from episiotomy, incision, postpartum uterine contractions, hemorrhoids, breast engorgement, and the stretching of the nipple.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The uterus continues to contract after childbirth. Pain caused by the contractions of the uterus can be as severe as labor pain. On account of oxytocin secretion, the pain becomes very severe in nursing mothers.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>On account of the properties and subjectivity of pain, the most reliable indicator used for the assessment of pain is the patient's description of it in her own words. Even as pain is assessed, the intensity, type, property, location and time, and factors reducing or increasing the pain must be known.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] On the other hand, there is no specific instrument designed to measure the contraction pain experienced during labor, but in several studies the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) has been used.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>There has been enormous growth in complementary alternative medicine (CAM) research in the past decade within the framework of traditional Chinese medicine. The stimulation of acupuncture points in this treatment is a method of initiating, controlling or accelerating body functions by stimulating the energy channels beneath the skin's surface and rebalancing the body's energy (Qi) to restore health.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Pressure on the acupuncture points can also be exerted with fingers, tennis balls, towels, and the like.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In this study, the Large Intestine 4 (LI<sub>4</sub>) (hegu) was used. As the upper portion of the uterus is encircled by the colon at full-term pregnancy, the location of LI<sub>4</sub> is a point where the energy flow of the meridian is closest to the skin and can be easily stimulated with pressure, needles or extreme cold.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The review of studies conducted on the applications to LI<sub>4</sub> revealed a pilot study, which was developed on the basis of Dr. Melzack's use of ice massage of LI<sub>4</sub>, to reduce dental pain after Aleda Erskine linked dental pain, child-birth pain, and myocardial infarction under the category of acute clinical pains.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The review also revealed that there were other studies conducted to evaluate the effect of ice massage on eliminating pain in young women with dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In a study conducted on relieving labor pain, the researcher performed ice massage of the energy meridian LI<sub>4</sub> during each contraction.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The database on VAS showed a mean reduction in pain of 25.15.

In the same study, the effectiveness of ice massage applied to the energy meridian points in order to reduce pain during labor contractions was evaluated as well.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Chung <italic>et al</italic>. (2003), performed a study to determine the effects of pressure applied to LI<sub>4</sub> and BL<sub>67</sub> on labor pain and uterine contractions and the differences between acupressure, effleurage, and control groups, and they observed that the relief of labor pain was higher in women in the acupressure group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Another study was designed to assess the effects of noninvasive electroacupuncture at LI<sub>4</sub> on labor pain and stress-hormone responses to that pain.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Furthermore, in order to reduce the perception of labor pain, ice massage was applied to LI<sub>4</sub> and no difference was determined between the groups, in terms of the pain level.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, according to the results of some studies, the pain decreased after ice massage application.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] According to Melzack's hypothesis, the efficacy of ice massage was due to engaging the gate control system of pain rather than eliminating the source of the pain.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>This present study was designed to evaluate, with MPQ, the effect of cold applied to LI<sub>4</sub> during the labor process on postpartum pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed as a randomized, clinical, controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>The study sample comprised of 150 pregnant women, who presented to a general maternity hospital in Izmir to deliver their babies and met the study criteria.

For the affective dimension, the mothers described their postpartum pain using expressions such as, &#x02018;<italic>exhausting</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>suffocating</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>terrifying</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>unbearable</italic>,&#x02019; and &#x02018;<italic>wretched</italic>&#x02019;.</p><p>The mothers described their postpartum pain as &#x02018;<italic>miserable</italic>&#x02019; for the evaluative dimension of the MPQ, and as &#x02018;<italic>penetrating</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>nuisance</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>shivering</italic>&#x02019;, and &#x02018;<italic>disturbing</italic>&#x02019; for the miscellaneous dimension of the MPQ.</p><p>In a study conducted to evaluate the sensory dimension of the MPQ during both stages of labor, the pain was described as &#x02018;<italic>cramping</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>pulling</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>stabbing,&#x02019;</italic> and &#x02018;<italic>cutting</italic>&#x02019;.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In another study conducted to investigate &#x02018;cultural differences regarding labor pain&#x02019;, the participants described pain as, &#x02018;<italic>burning</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>piercing</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>cramping</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>sharp</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>stabbing</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>severe</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>tiring</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>exhausting,&#x02019;</italic> and &#x02018;<italic>tense</italic>&#x02019;.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] In this study, no statistically significant difference was determined between the groups in terms of the sensory dimension of pain (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), which indicated that applying ice massage during the active phase of labor had no effect on reducing postpartum pain.</p><p>Acupressure is pressure with fingers or small beads on acupuncture points. It is used for labor pain. As acupressure can be done, with minimal instruction, by the woman's partner, it may be desired by some laboring women.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Comparison of mean pain intensity pre intervention with the mean pain intensity post intervention in the ice massage group showed a significant difference in the labor. A significant difference was also observed in the acupressure group between pain intensity half-an-hour post intervention.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] However, there are no published trials of its efficacy in relieving postpartum pain. Furthermore, randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate this further. Many non-pharmacological methods help reduce labor pain, but they are not widely used.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The mothers&#x02019; description of pain as &#x02018;<italic>steady</italic>&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>intermittent</italic>&#x02019;, and &#x02018;<italic>temporary</italic>&#x02019; indicates that the pain is temporary and manageable in nature. During the same interview, the mothers described their &#x02018;<italic>worst</italic>&#x02019; pain as &#x02018;<italic>severe</italic>&#x02019; and least pain as &#x02018;<italic>mild</italic>&#x02019;. This is similar to the result of the research literature.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>In Eisenach <italic>et al</italic>.'s study (2008), 66% of the patients reported that their pain interfered with one or more of their daily activities &#x02013; walking, mood, sleep, relations with others or ability to concentrate. The delivery mode was meaningfully related to acute pain after delivery. Based on this study, nearly 500,000 American women may experience severe acute pain after childbirth annually.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-7"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>In the study, pain suffered by mothers during labor and early postpartum period was assessed and it was attempted to minimize their perception of pain by applying pressure with ice balloons to LI<sub>4</sub>. However, although the application was determined to make no difference in pain intensity, the mothers&#x02019; statements in the ice application group suggested that they felt more comfortable than did the mothers in the other groups.</p><p>The characteristics of the pain the mothers had during the early postpartum period have been assessed with the MPQ. As the VAS is used in pain assessment more widely, studies conducted with the MPQ do not have much coverage in the literature. Even as pain was assessed with the MPQ during the early postpartum period, the mothers were given explanations and metaphors were used. Therefore, the scale was not practical to use.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Recommendation</title><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All pregnant women should be informed about labor pain and the pain assessment process during antenatal follow-ups and pain descriptors should be determined too.

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>During the data collection phase, 225 pregnant women were contacted, but the data evaluated were collected from 150 pregnant women.
