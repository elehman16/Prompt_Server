The treatment goals for T2DM patients are effective control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids (if elevated), and, ultimately, to avert the serious complications associated with sustained tissue exposure to excessively high glucose concentrations. T2DM is associated with micro- and macrovascular complications, including cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, diabetic neuropathy, amputations, renal failure, and blindness that result in increasing disability and reduced life expectancy [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With progression of T2DM over time, multiple drugs, including insulin, are usually required to achieve acceptable glycemic control. Therefore, there is a need for new potentially disease-modifying treatments.</p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that chronic subclinical inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Elevated concentrations of various inflammatory markers in the circulation have been reported in humans with insulin resistance (IR), e.g., interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR1, sTNFR2) [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and C-reactive protein (CRP) [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In patients with T2DM, adipose tissue contributes significantly to the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the circulation.</p><p>IL-18 is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines. In addition to its role in the inflammatory response to microbes, recent studies have elucidated a broad spectrum of effector functions that implicate IL-18 as an important factor in human autoimmune and metabolic diseases. Studies in humans demonstrate elevated IL-18 levels in serum, adipose tissue, and muscle in obese patients with IR and patients with T2DM or metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The correlation between IL-18 levels and IR in T2DM patients appears to be independent of TNF-&#x003b1;, CRP, and IL-6 levels. In contrast to TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, IL-18 levels also correlate with early signs of IR in nondiabetic &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; individuals [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The observation that obese/diabetic individuals exhibit elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines lends support to the hypothesis that obesity-induced IR is an inflammatory condition [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and that inflammation, IR, and aberrant lipid metabolism may be interlinked components of the metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The link between the action of cytokines, such as IL-18, and IR has a mechanistic basis involving the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1(JNK1)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) kinase pathway and phosphorylation of the serine/threonine IRS1 [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is required for efficient signalling of insulin through its cognate receptor. In addition, circulating levels of IL-18 appear to be associated with a number of microvascular [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and macrovascular [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] comorbidities of obesity and T2DM. Several lines of evidence implicate IL-18 in the direct induction of renal injury in diabetic nephropathy [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Patients with T2DM have not only a significantly higher serum but also higher urinary levels of IL-18 compared with healthy controls [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between IL-18 levels in diabetic patients and the development of urinary albumin excretion, with the highest IL-18 levels found in patients with microalbuminuria and clinical albuminuria [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These observations suggest that treatment strategies that reduce inflammatory cytokines such as anti-IL-18 could potentially be disease modifying in the treatment of diabetes.</p><p>GSK1070806 is a humanized IgG1 antibody that binds to human IL-18 with a high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 30.3 pM) and neutralizes its function. In the first time in human (FTIH) study [<xref rid="pone.0150018.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], single intravenous (i.v.) infusions of GSK1070806 at doses &#x02264;10 mg/kg in healthy patients and &#x02264;3 mg/kg in obese patients were well tolerated. The current study was designed to investigate the preliminary efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two i.v. doses of the anti-IL-18 monoclonal antibody, GSK1070806, in patients with T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>Obese male or female patients of nonchildbearing potential between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent and with a body mass index &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and &#x0003c;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with T2DM were eligible for inclusion in the study.

Since an estimation-based approach was used, no formal hypothesis was tested, and there were no formal calculations of power or sample size for this study. Expected 95% confidence interval widths for the mean difference in plasma glucose between treatment and placebo were calculated, assuming that 10 patients with evaluable data completed each active arm and the placebo group with an estimated (i.e., using internal GSK data) standard deviation for change from baseline in FPG and weighted mean glucose AUC(0&#x02013;4 hours) of 27.0 and 32.8, respectively. Based on these assumptions, and using a two-sided two-sample t test, this study was estimated to provide 80% power to detect a difference in change from baseline FPG of 35.8 mg/dl (1.99 mmol/l) and a difference in change from baseline weighted mean AUC(0&#x02013;4 hours) of 45.8 mg/dl (2.54 mmol/l). Although differences as low as 30 mg/dl (1.66 mmol/l) for both FPG and weighted mean AUC(0&#x02013;4 hours) may be of clinical significance, the study was not powered to detect changes of this magnitude.</p><p>Full details of the statistical analysis can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150018.s011">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Patient characteristics and trial flow</title><p>The trial was conducted between August 2012 and January 2014.

Published literature suggests that levels of IL-18 in obese patients are elevated compared with normal weight individuals; therefore, patient selection in this trial was optimized to select obese patients, as this patient group was considered to be most likely to benefit from treatment with GSK1070806.</p><p>While there were no statistically significant effects of GSK1070806 doses on FPG levels, or glucose, insulin, and C-peptide weighted mean AUC(0&#x02013;4 hours) over placebo, it should be noted that the trial was not formally powered to detect statistically significant differences in these measures between GSK1070806 and placebo, as the sample size was selected to allow preliminary characterization of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in obese patients with T2DM, and to investigate the effect on PD assessment and biomarkers.</p><p>One of the inclusion criteria was that patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin for 3 months prior to screening, and at a total daily dose of &#x02265;1,000 mg for at least 2 months prior to dosing. There was, however, a high placebo response rate in this study, with patients in both the placebo and treatment groups demonstrating decreases of &#x0003e;1% HbA1c by Day 57 of the study. This suggests that this patient group was generally noncompliant in taking metformin and only started to take it regularly on entry into the study. From information collected relating to concomitant medication usage, some patients had been on metformin for over 10 years at the time of entry into the study and may have stopped taking it as regularly as they should have done. In hindsight, this could have been limited by the inclusion of a run-in period so that patients entering the trial were known to be compliant with their medication. It was interesting that for some placebo-treated patients who demonstrated significant reductions in HbA1c (e.g., baseline: 8.8%; Day 57: 7.1%), notable decreases in other biomarkers (e.g., IP-10, fructosamine, NEFAs, s-ICAM) were also apparent. This suggests that metformin treatment alone also impacts many inflammatory markers, but unfortunately it also confounded the overall interpretation of any biomarker data from the study, as it was impossible to distinguish changes that were due to inhibition of GSK1070806 with those that were due to resumption or regular use of metformin monotherapy. Overall, biomarker levels were variable across patients, and the majority of parameters did not show any notable trends compared with the placebo group. Assessment of the mean change from baseline for hs-CRP and IL-6 indicates some evidence of a reduction in these inflammatory markers up to Day 85, with patients dosed with GSK1070806 5 mg/kg compared with placebo. The mean reduction in hs-CRP that was observed between Days 29 and 85 in this study ranged from 13.5% to 21.4% in the 5 mg/kg group; this is lower than has been previously reported for other effective T2DM therapies. A 12-week study that evaluated the effect of treatment with rosiglitazone or metformin on top of glimepiride on inflammatory biomarkers in patients with T2DM demonstrated a 40% reduction in serum CRP levels at Week 12; a similar magnitude of change was reported for IL-6 and resistin.</p><p>Both doses of GSK1070806 were well tolerated, with no drug-related serious AEs (SAEs) seen. The two SAEs that were reported during the course of the study were considered unrelated to study medication by the investigator: an AE of diverticulitis in one subject in the placebo group and an AE of VIIth nerve paralysis in one subject dosed with 5 mg/kg GSK1070806. Both SAEs had resolved by the end of the study.</p><p>Chronic inhibition of IL-18 has the potential to increase the risk of infections as well as affect viral and intracellular bacterial clearance by the host. However, as observed in the previous FTIH study, all AEs that described infection were mild or moderate, unremarkable, and considered unrelated to study treatment by the investigators. The lack of increase in the incidence rate of infections in GSK1070806 groups compared with placebo provides further reassurance that chronic dosing of GSK1070806 should have an acceptable safety profile.</p><p>Variations in the levels of serum IL-18 detectable at baseline were observed, as not all patients had measurable levels at baseline. Following dosing with GSK1070806 5 mg/kg, a decrease BLQ was observed in the patients with measurable serum-free IL-18 at baseline that persisted through the final time point (FU), demonstrating that prolonged inhibition of IL-18 had occurred in these patients. By contrast, serum-free IL-18 was detectable in four patients in the placebo arm at various time points. At baseline, serum drug-bound IL-18 was BLQ as expected, in all except two patients in the 0.25 mg/kg treatment group that appeared to have detectable levels of drug-bound IL-18. This was likely due to interference in the assay, as there cannot be any drug-bound IL-18 present predose.</p><p>After dosing, the mean serum drug-bound IL-18 levels increased from baseline in both groups treated with GSK1070806, demonstrating target engagement. This also confirmed that serum IL-18 was present, even in individuals that had levels BLQ when assessed using the free IL-18 assay. By contrast, in the placebo group, the serum drug-bound IL-18 levels for patients remained below the LLQ and unchanged over time.</p><p>Increased mean serum drug-bound IL-18 levels observed in the GSK1070806 treatment groups were sustained for a prolonged period of time, indicating sustained target engagement. There was no dose-dependent increase in the mean serum drug-bound IL-18 profiles, indicating that saturation of the target was achieved in the systemic compartment at both doses. Mean serum drug-bound IL-18 levels at the last measurement time point remained above the baseline value in all active dose groups. Overall, the serum drug-bound IL-18 results were consistent with what was observed in the FTIH study with GSK1070806.</p><p>Observed PK profiles in this study were overall similar to the PK profiles observed in the FTIH at equivalent doses. The observed geometric mean half-life in the 5 mg/kg dose group was lower (30 days) than in the FTIH study (37&#x02013;38 days) at approximately equivalent dose and more aligned with the expectation for a monoclonal antibody. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but it will be monitored in future clinical studies.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that two repeat doses of GSK1070806 administered 28 days apart were well tolerated in patients with T2DM, but no significant reductions in the primary efficacy end-points for the study were observed. There was some evidence of a reduction in HbA1c percent up to Day 85 with patients dosed with GSK1070806 5 mg/kg compared with placebo, but the data were highly variable across all treatment groups. This study demonstrated that inhibiting IL-18 does not appear to have a major impact on blood glucose control; however, given the limited power of the study, the improvements noted in the placebo arm, and the trend toward reduction in HbA1c percent with patients dosed with GSK1070806 5 mg/kg, smaller potentially clinically meaningful effects of IL-18 inhibition cannot be excluded. It is also possible that the effects of chronic inflammation via IL-18 on IR may take longer to reverse than the time period evaluated in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150018.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150018.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150018.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Trial Schematic.</title><p>FU, follow-up; MMT, mixed meal test.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150018.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150018.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Individual Subject Plot for Body Mass Index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150018.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150018.s004"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Individual Subject Plot for Waist Circumference.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150018.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150018.s005"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Mean Serum Drug-Bound and Serum-Free IL-18.</title><p>Panel a shows the mean serum drug-bound IL-18 and 95% CI in the per protocol population.
