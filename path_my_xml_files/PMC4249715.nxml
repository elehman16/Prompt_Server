Since approximately 36% of adolescents are overweight or obese, and up to 80% will likely become overweight adults, it is essential to focus on young people to prevent this epidemic from perpetuating into future generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although the etiology of obesity is multifactorial, several behavioral and environmental factors have been implicated. Of particular interest is the increasingly common dietary habit of breakfast skipping, which has closely mirrored the rise in obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Specifically, reduced breakfast frequency (i.e., breakfast skipping) is inversely associated with increased BMI, weight gain, and obesity in young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, due to the lack of long-term randomized controlled trials, a causal link between breakfast skipping and obesity has not been substantially identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>We previously found that skipping the morning meal leads to increased perceived hunger and reduced perceived fullness (satiety), and greater energy intake at subsequent eating occasions compared to eating breakfast, particularly one rich in dietary protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Potential mechanisms of action include the marked elevations in the hunger-hormone ghrelin and lower concentrations of the satiety hormone PYY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since most Americans eat (or stop eating) for reasons other than &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; hunger or fullness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it is critical to extend these findings to explore the signals controlling food cravings and food reward.</p><p>Dopamine is a powerful neural signal implicated in the regulation of food intake by stimulating reward-driven eating behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A negative correlation has been reported between dopamine and BMI with obese individuals displaying a blunted dopamine response in proportion to BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In obese animal models, central dopamine activity is reduced and is accompanied by elevated preference for highly palatable, energy dense foods compared to normal weight controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, treatment with dopamine agonists reverses the excess body weight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, these data suggest that strategies to stimulate dopamine activity may lead to significant improvements in obesity.</p><p>In general, dopamine is secreted in response to tasting highly palatable foods and evokes feelings of enhanced food reward, pleasure, and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although much of the literature has focused on dietary fat and sugar as key stimulants of food reward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], dietary protein has also been speculated to elicit similar reward responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Data from our lab and others support the benefits of increased protein consumption for improved appetite control, satiety, and body weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We would like to extend these findings to examine the role of increased dietary protein at breakfast on signals controlling food reward.</p><p>However, since central dopamine is unable to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], it is challenging to appropriately measure its activity. One alternative is to measure dopamine metabolites in body fluids, particularly plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The most predominant metabolite is plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] which is strongly correlated with central dopaminergic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and has been suggested to be the most appropriate indicator of central dopamine activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to assess whether the daily addition of a normal vs. protein-rich breakfast alters food cravings and HVA responses throughout the morning in overweight/obese &#x02018;breakfast skipping&#x02019; late-adolescent young women. In addition, the relationship between HVA and dietary protein and food cravings were also identified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>This study was part of a larger study designed to examine the beneficial effects of a higher-protein breakfast on the appetitive, hormonal, and neural signals controlling energy intake regulation in overweight/obese, &#x0201c;breakfast-skipping&#x0201d;, late-adolescent girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Sixteen overweight and obese &#x02018;breakfast skipping&#x02019; late-adolescent young women participated in the following randomized crossover-design breakfast study.

When examining the 4&#x000a0;h AUC responses, the consumption of both breakfast meals led to reductions in 4-h cravings of savory foods (NP: -93&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;766&#x000a0;mm*240&#x000a0;min; HP: -3185&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;867&#x000a0;mm*240&#x000a0;min) vs. BS (2550&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;954&#x000a0;mm*240&#x000a0;min, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07 and p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, respectively).

Although the 4-h HVA-AUC was not different between breakfast meals, the HP meal tended to elicit greater pre-lunch (i.e. +240&#x000a0;min) HVA concentrations vs. NP (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09).</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Pearson&#x02019;s correlational analyses</title><p>Pearson&#x02019;s correlational analyses revealed that 4-h HVA AUC was associated with total protein content (r: 0.340; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.03) and tyrosine content of the meal (r: 0.344; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.03).

Collectively, these data suggest that the daily addition of breakfast, particularly one rich in protein, might serve as a beneficial strategy to reduce food cravings and modulate food reward in overweight/obese young people.</p><p>Much of the animal and human work concerning the dietary components that stimulate food reward, food cravings, and/or drive food preferences have centered around highly palatable foods which typically consist of high fat and high sugar foods. These energy dense, yet nutrient-void foods can lead to increased appetite, overeating, and weight gain over the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Thus, identifying equally palatable, but nutrient-rich, healthier replacements might reduce some of these negative effects.</p><p>Dietary protein has been well documented to improve appetite control and food intake regulation through physiological increases in satiety and subsequent reductions in intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although dietary fats and sugars are generally thought to be more rewarding and craved compared to other foods, similar cravings have been shown for protein-rich foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Further, as discussed in the review by Journel, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], dietary protein has also been proposed to modulate food hedonics. However, the mechanism of action by which the consumption of dietary protein elicits these responses remains unclear but has been postulated to be involved with dopamine production. Specifically, the rate of dopamine synthesis is sensitive to local substrate concentrations, primarily the amino acid tyrosine, which is influenced by the protein content of a single meal as well as within the overall diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Since tyrosine is the substrate required in the rate-limiting step of dopamine synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], the consumption of higher protein meals containing increased tyrosine potentially leads to increases in dopamine synthesis. This has been demonstrated in an animal study in which rats fed a higher protein diet exhibited a substantial increase in central tyrosine which was accompanied by an increase in dopamine synthesis compared to rats fed lower protein diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In the current study, we showed that HVA concentrations were higher following the higher protein meal and were related to protein content and tyrosine content of the breakfast meal. Together, these data further support that dietary protein might be an important regulator of both physiological and hedonic food intake.</p><p>Another dietary factor which has significant effects on both aspects of food intake regulation is the common practice of skipping breakfast. In a pilot study from our lab, we showed that breakfast skipping adolescents exhibit greater appetite and reduced satiety throughout the morning, leading to increased energy intake; however, the addition of breakfast, particularly breakfast meals containing increased dietary protein, reversed these outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a subsequent pilot study, we incorporated functional MRI to identify the neural responses to visual food stimuli prior to lunch in overweight/obese &#x02018;breakfast skipping&#x02019; teen girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We found that breakfast skipping led to increased neural activation in brain regions controlling food motivation and food reward (i.e., hippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate, and parahippocampus) prior to lunch; however, the addition of a protein-rich breakfast led to reduced activation in these regions. The current study extended our previous fMRI findings to include HVA concentrations which serve as another marker of central food motivation and reward. We found that the addition of breakfast led to increased HVA concentrations throughout the morning with a trend for greater increases in HVA following the high protein breakfast vs. normal protein version. These data, along with the positive correlation between HVA concentrations and breakfast protein quantity, suggest that the consumption of increased dietary protein potentially stimulates the formation, secretion, and/or utilization of dopamine. The increased HVA concentrations throughout the morning were also accompanied by reduced food cravings, further supporting the role of dopamine on food reward.</p><p>Although central dopamine regulates a number of pathways in the body that impact cognition, motor control, mood, pain perception, and sexual behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], it has also been shown to mediate food motivation and reward through a variety of learning and motivational pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. See Meye &#x00026; Adan review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Although dopamine is typically secreted in response to high fat foods, chronic exposure to these foods, particularly in obese individuals, leads to neural adaptations including reductions in dopamine receptor expression and decreased dopamine secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In diet-induced obese rodents, this reduced dopamine response leads to an overcompensation of foods high in fat to potentially re-establish normal dopamine concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, unlike dietary fat, the chronic consumption of protein-rich foods appears to elicit a more balanced, sustain influence on food reward as illustrated by the reductions in high fat and high sugar, evening snacking following the chronic (i.e., 7-d) consumption of high protein vs. normal protein breakfast meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In humans, psychostimulant drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine increase dopamine secretions and are known to have anorexigenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Further, the administration of dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine and methylphenidate have been shown to significantly reduce body fat and body weight in obese humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Although the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon have not been determined, these studies report reduced daily energy intake with the administrations of these agonists. Taken together, these data suggest that dopamine appears to play a critical role in modulating the reinforcing value and reward of food. Further, the dopamine pathway is blunted in obesity due to chronic exposure to highly palatable foods but can be re-established with pharmaceutical agents and potentially dietary factors including breakfast and increased dietary protein.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study was likely to have been limited by the small sample size (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16). Although this sample size was adequate to detect differences between skipping breakfast vs. breakfast, a larger sample may have led to an increased ability to detect differences, particularly in HVA concentrations, between breakfast meals. However, further research, involving increased sample sizes, longer testing durations, and assessments of subsequent food intake are key in assessing the role of increased dietary protein at breakfast on dopamine, food motivation, and reward in overweight/obese teens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the addition of breakfast led to reductions in food cravings and increases in homovanillic acid, an index of central dopamine production, with the high protein breakfast eliciting greater responses. These data suggest that the daily addition of a breakfast, particularly one rich in protein, might be an important dietary strategy to reduce food cravings and potentially modulate the underlying substrates that control food hedonics/reward in overweight/obese young people.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>None of the authors have any conflicts of interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>HAH and HJL designed the research, conducted the research, and analyzed the data.
