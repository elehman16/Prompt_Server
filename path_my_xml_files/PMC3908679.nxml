Physical activity level is the primary determinant of cardiorespiratory fitness in adults. However, knowledge on how to motivate people to engage in physical activity and maintain an active lifestyle is lacking. This study aims to investigate whether a motivational, individual, and locally anchored exercise intervention, in primary care, can improve cardiorespiratory fitness in 30 to 49 year olds with a low or very low cardiorespiratory fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Two-armed randomised controlled trial with 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome is cardiorespiratory fitness estimated via a maximal incremental exercise test. Secondary outcomes include physical activity level and sedentary behavior (objectively measured), self-reported physical activity, biochemical parameters (HbA<sub>1C</sub>, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride), anthropometric parameters and health-related quality of life. A total of 236 participants with low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness classified at a local health check programme will be randomised. The intervention consists of four motivational interviews, a six months membership to a sport club, and a global positioning watch to upload training activity to Endomondo.com. The comparison group will receive standard care: a one hour motivational interview followed by another interview if requested. Effects will be estimated by evaluating the differences in mean changes in cardiorespiratory fitness between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In new and innovative ways the focus of this study will be to improve cardiorespiratory fitness among a 30&#x02013;49 year-old at-risk group using social media, Global Positioning System-technology, on-going personal support and individually tailored physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov (no.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01801956?term=the+mile+study&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01801956</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Maximum oxygen uptake</kwd><kwd>Cardiorespiratory fitness</kwd><kwd>Accelerometry</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Motivation</kwd><kwd>Social media</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>It is well known that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with a high risk of noncommunicable diseases and all cause mortality, and that improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness decreases this risk especially among the least fit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although cardiorespiratory fitness has a genetic contribution, physical activity habits are the primary determinant of cardiorespiratory fitness in adults, and changes in physical activity levels result in changes in cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus the World Health Organization recommends adults aged between 18&#x02013;64 to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity weekly or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. In Denmark only an estimated 32% fullfill these recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and improving physical activity among this group of people is of great importance to public health.</p><p>In primary care several simple- and multicomponent physical activity interventions have been conducted in order to increase physical activity. However, the results of these interventions remain inconsistent. In addition, the content of the interventions is often unclearly described, particularly in relation to intensity and fidelity of the intervention delivery and reviews reveal how most of the studies use self-reported measures of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These issues warrant well-described intervention studies using objectively measures of physical activity and specifically designed for, and evaluated in primary care settings.</p><p>In Denmark, the &#x0201c;Check your health&#x0201d; programme is aimed at screening all individuals (n&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;26,500) in the municipality of Randers aged between 30&#x02013;49 years for cardiovascular disease during a 5-year period. Identifying people that are insufficiently active and people with a low cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the central objectives of the programme and this is done by self-reported and objective measures of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness.</p><p>To perform a successful intervention, strategies and techniques to motivate and guide people to adopt healthy choices need to be identified. Some of this may be accomplished by close supervision and personal instruction with healthcare professionals applying communication skills such as motivational interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which has been found to be an effective approach to changing behaviour. This method specifically offers promise in improvement of cardiovascular health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, a key issue will be to adopt modern technology and social media into the interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A Danish report supports this idea and concludes that particularly the 30&#x02013;50 year olds, an age-group that does not always give high priority to regular physical activity due to lack of time and commitments such as job/further education and establishment of a family, are motivated by the social media and technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Finally, it is also suggested that physical activity interventions should be integrated into the structure of a broader range of community-based organisations e.g. sport clubs in order to offer a wide range of activities, and thereby individualise and anchor the physical activity locally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Using the combination of motivational interviewning, social media, technology and the community organisations may build individual capability and organisational capacity for behaviour change, create new social norms, and promote policy and environmental changes that support higher levels of physical activity across the population in the long-term.</p><p>We therefore hypothesise that a locally anchored &#x0201c;primary care package&#x0201d; containing social media and technology, ongoing personal support and individually tailored flexible physical activity will improve cardiorespiratory fitness among 30&#x02013;49 year-olds with a low cardiorespiratory fitness.</p><p>Thus the aims of this paper were to describe:</p><p>1. The design of a study evaluating the efficacy of a motivational, individual and locally anchored exercise intervention in primary care aiming to improve cardiorespiratory fitness among 30 to 49 year olds with low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness.</p><p>2.

To our knowledge however, this will be the first study in primary care that includes both social media, GPS-technology, ongoing personal support and individually tailored physical activity.</p><p>In our study, the intervention will be a &#x0201c;primary care package&#x0201d; delivered under as optimal conditions as possible, because we aspire for results that contribute to the understanding of the effect of the intervention under the most ideal circumstances possible. We will use strict inclusion criteria, reproducible intervention components, outcomes that require specific testing, experienced practitioners (trained instructors and a certified coach) to perform both the intervention and the comparison intervention, monitoring of both the participants and the practitioners and follow-up after 6 and 12 months. However, despite this explanatory attitude the &#x0201c;primary care package&#x0201d; will be delivered in a real life setting which may raise some challenges with regard to controlling the intervention, since it will not be possible to control e.g. the timelines and the content of the motivational interviews.</p><p>Using strict inclusion criteria is part of the explanatory attitude and a conscious choice. Thus we may include only a selected group of people which may lead to less generalisable results. In addition the participants may be a very motivated group of people which also may be affected by the study activities itself, e.g. the introduction to the study. This may lead to effect dilution due to increased physical activity in any comparison participants.</p><p>However, the reproducible intervention makes the intervention implementable in other primary care settings where practitioners can easily be educated as in this study. Using objective measures of the outcomes make the results higly reliable and the nesting in the 5-year programme, will make it possible to monitor a long-term effect of the intervention.</p><p>Thus, we find that this study is designed and reported in a way that users of the results can make meaningful judgments about the applicability to their own context. If found to be effective, we therefore believe that the intervention has the potential to be repeated in a more pragmatic design and afterwords sustained and embedded within real world primary care to the benefit of both society and the individual.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>GPS: Global positioning system.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KHO, KO and HTM tailored the intervention and designed the study.
