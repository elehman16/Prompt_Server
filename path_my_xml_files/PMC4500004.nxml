training and task-oriented training on balance performance in stroke patients. [Subjects
and Methods] The subjects were randomly allocated to 2 groups: virtual reality-based
training group (n = 12) and task-oriented training group (n = 12). The patients in the
virtual reality-based training group used the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus, which provided visual
and auditory feedback as well as the movements that enabled shifting of weight to the
right and left sides, for 30&#x02005;min/day, 3 times/week for 6 weeks. The patients in the
task-oriented training group practiced additional task-oriented programs for 30&#x02005;min/day, 3
times/week for 6 weeks. Patients in both groups also underwent conventional physical
therapy for 60&#x02005;min/day, 5 times/week for 6 weeks. [Results] Balance and functional reach
test outcomes were examined in both groups. The results showed that the static balance and
functional reach test outcomes were significantly higher in the virtual reality-based
training group than in the task-oriented training group. [Conclusion] This study suggested
that virtual reality-based training might be a more feasible and suitable therapeutic
intervention for dynamic balance in stroke patients compared to task-oriented
training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Task orientation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke, along with cancer and cardiac disorders, is one of the leading causes of death in
Korea. Every year, 50.7 individuals (males 48.6, females 52.8) per 100,000 population die of
this condition<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The clinical features of
stroke include sensory and motor disturbances as well as perceptual and language
disorders<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. More than 85% of these
patients experience hemiplegia immediately after stroke<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance disorders in patients with stroke cause restrictions in
daily living activities, which in turn decreases their independence and their level of
participation in the community<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both virtual reality-based training and task-oriented training have been used clinically in
stroke rehabilitation as therapeutic interventions for functional recovery<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Task-oriented training is based on Carr and
Shepherd&#x02019;s motor learning theory<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a
previous study, task-oriented training was used in a program that focused on special
functional tasks requiring a combined use of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and found that the training improved daily
living functions in the elderly with disabilities and in patients with traumatic brain
injuries<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality-based
training provides a variety of environments that can be selected, based on the patient&#x02019;s
requirements, for recovery of motor skills<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and with the recent developments in scientific computer technology
and programs, it has been applied in a wide range of patients. Previous studies have
reported that physical activities using virtual reality programs are helpful for functional
improvement in patients with neurologic disorders<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and more specifically, rehabilitation through games has the
advantages of being interesting and inexpensive<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. You et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that virtual reality-based training in patients with stroke showed significant
improvement in motor recovery and brain reorganization, which played an important role in
the recovery of functional movement. In addition, some studies involving senior citizens
have reported significant effects on muscular strength and balance in the lower limbs<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have reported that task-oriented training and virtual reality-based
training improve motor function in patients with stroke. However, there are no studies on
the comparison of these 2 types of therapeutic intervention in the clinical setting. This
study therefore aimed to examine the effects of virtual reality-based training and
task-oriented training on balance in patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-four patients with stroke, who were hospitalized at the K Hospital in Seoul, were

still. The degree of the sway is influenced by the width of the base of support and foot
position. The range and direction of postural sway can be measured by calculating the COG on
the bearing surface<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the COP
path length and velocity were measured to examine the static balance ability with the
eyes-open base, eyes-closed base, wide base, and narrow base. A comparison of these revealed
that the COP path length and velocity with the eyes-closed base were greater than those with
the eyes-open base; this indicates that balance ability is sensitive to visual
information<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Relearning of postural
control using visual and auditory feedback is known to be effective for balance
improvement<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study
targeting patients with chronic stroke found that training in weight shifting with visual
feedback is significantly effective for postural control and weight bearing on the
contralateral side<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lai, Peng, Chen,
Huang, Hsiao, and Chen<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
balance training using visual and auditory feedback showed a significant reduction in the
COP path length and velocity in a balance study involving use of video games. Similarly, the
virtual reality-based training group in this study showed a significant increase in the
group due to a reduction in path length and velocity of all the pressure points in the EOWB,
ECWB, EONB, and ECNB conditions. The task-oriented training group did not have a significant
difference in path length and velocity compared to the pre-test status in any of the
conditions except the EOWB. In the virtual reality-based training group, all the variables
showed a significant increase, but there were no differences in the changes between the 2
groups. This was thought to be due to the standard deviations in the results. It is thought
that the virtual reality-based training task that improved the patients&#x02019; static balance
ability, during which the subject was seated in a chair, maintained the red center point of
gravity in the yellow circle on the monitor with visual and auditory feedback.</p><p>Ragnarsd&#x000f3;ttir<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> defined static balance
as the ability to stand on a fixed weight-bearing surface without swaying and dynamic
balance as the ability to maintain that posture when the surface shifted due to external
stimuli or movement caused by the subjects. It is generally assumed that lesser movement of
the COP is associated with better balance ability. In addition, previous studies have also
shown a tendency for the balance ability to decrease when the COP movement increases due to
disease or aging<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the COP&#x02019;s
path length was shown to decrease in those with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the
COP path length in dancers with good balance tends to increase in the static standing
posture<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. The FRT was used to examine
improvement in dynamic balance. This method can be used to measure dynamic balance in
clinical settings without special equipment<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The average FRT scores in males and females, 41&#x02013;69&#x02005;years old, are
37.8&#x02005;cm and 35.1&#x02005;cm, respectively. Dean and Shepherd<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>, in their study, conducted the reach test in the sitting position
after the patients had participated in task orientation training and found that the score
had increased by 0.9&#x02005;cm (pretest: 11.2&#x02005;cm, posttest: 12.1&#x02005;cm). The present study evaluated
the reach in 3 directions: front, the contralateral side, and the affected side, and
differences between the virtual reality-based training and task-oriented training groups
were noted. It is thought that both the training programs were more effective in the
improvement of dynamic balance, as their focus was on dynamic movements rather than static
movements.</p><p>Normal adults utilize 3 postural control strategies, namely the ankle, hip, and stepping
strategies for maintenance of anteroposterior stability. The ankle strategy is most commonly
used in situations that require balancing small collapses. The hip strategy is used to
recover balance that has been affected by a sway; it is larger and occurs faster than the
ankle strategy. In the stepping strategy, the individual bending people&#x02019;s steps to create
the new base of support by responding to the phenomena that the center moves outside it when
the ankle strategy and the hip strategy are not enough<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. The rolling marble board and Balance Wii in the virtual reality
program were more suitable for utilizing the hip strategy required for larger movements than
the ankle strategy required for minute movements. We think that the left and right weight
shift to prevent falling on ice in the penguin teeter-totter seesaw task affected the
mediolateral stability. It is thought that compared to task orientation programs, the
virtual reality-based program provided a greater variety of concrete environments to improve
dynamic balance, and this indicates that there would be significant differences in dynamic
balance between the groups. The task-oriented training group also showed a significant
improvement in dynamic balance. This is thought to be due to the effect of balance training
on an unstable bearing surface. Previous studies have reported a significant improvement in
dynamic balance with the balance exercise on an unstable bearing surface<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study found both the virtual reality-based program and task-oriented program to be
effective therapeutic interventions for functional improvement in stroke patients. This
study had the following limitations. The sample size used in this study was small, and the
study duration was short, with an insufficient long-term follow-up survey after the
training. It is therefore difficult to generalize the results of our study. Future studies
with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up are warranted. Additionally, the training
involved should include muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and coordination
training.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Statistics Korea: Statistics
