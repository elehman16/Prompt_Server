There is little evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for functional neck/shoulder stiffness. Research using two different placebos may allow an efficient method to tease apart the components of real acupuncture from various kinds of &#x02018;non-specific&#x02019; effects such as ritual with touch or ritual alone. Herein, we describe a protocol of an ongoing, single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial which aims to assess whether, in functional neck/shoulder stiffness, acupuncture treatment with skin piercing has a specific effect over two types of placebo: skin-touching plus ritual or ritual alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Six acupuncturists and 400 patients with functional neck/shoulder stiffness are randomly assigned to four treatment groups: genuine acupuncture penetrating the skin, skin-touch placebo or no-touch placebo needles in a double-blind manner (practitioner-patient blinding) or no-treatment control group. Each acupuncturist applies a needle to each of four acupoints (Bladder10, Small Intestine14, Gallbladder21 and Bladder42) in the neck/shoulder to 50 patients. Before, immediately after and 24&#x000a0;hours after the treatment, patients are asked about the intensity of their neck/shoulder stiffness. After the treatment, practitioners and patients are asked to guess whether the treatment is &#x0201c;penetrating&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;skin-touch&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no-touch&#x0201d; or to record &#x0201c;cannot identify the treatment&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In addition to intention-to-treat analysis, we will conduct subgroup analysis based on practitioners&#x02019; or patients&#x02019; guesses to discuss the efficacy and effectiveness of treatments with skin piercing and various placebo controls.

We believe this study will further distinguish the role of different components of acupuncture.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trial <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN76896018">ISRCTN76896018</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Placebo</kwd><kwd>Neck stiffness, Shoulder stiffness</kwd><kwd>Double-blind</kwd><kwd>Randomised, placebo-controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Functional neck/shoulder stiffness is the second most frequent subjective symptom next to lumbago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and one of the most well-known indications for acupuncture treatment in Japan. Functional neck/shoulder stiffness refers to discomfort, tightness or rigidity in the muscles supporting the neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], without any specific diseases that cause such complaints. In routine clinical care with acupuncture, patients well experience that needle penetration at acupoints effectively reduces tension and discomfort in the neck and shoulder. The mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of acupuncture for functional neck/shoulder stiffness are unclear. Stiffness and its resultant discomfort in the muscles might be mitigated through neuronal circuits that are similar to those to modulate pain and its resultant unpleasantness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], through the improvement of regional blood circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] or through the suppression of moto-neuron activity that innervates the stiff muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Some have argued that acupuncture is primarily a placebo effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There is little evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for functional neck/shoulder stiffness, and no randomised, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) investigating acupuncture under double-blind (practitioner-patient) conditions has been reported.</p><p>Single-blind RCTs using single-blind acupuncture placebo/sham devices have been considered the most rigorous method for investigating the efficacy of acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, single-blind design has the potential to produce biases from unmasked practitioners, and evidence obtained under single-blind conditions is arguably insufficiently rigorous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Practitioner blinding has been absent in acupuncture research and it may be crucial in acupuncture research to meet the gold standard of double-blind RCTs whereby the specific effects of interventions can be distinguished under double-blinding conditions from non-specific effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In acupuncture research, however, the gold standard was considered almost impossible to achieve because blinding an acupuncturist is very difficult due to the nature of the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To solve this methodological difficulty, we designed two types of non-penetrating placebo needles: one where the tip touches the skin (skin-touch placebo needles), and another where the needle tip does not reach the skin (no-touch placebo needles). We also designed a matched genuine penetrating acupuncture needle. We have evaluated them for use in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In this study beside genuine penetrating acupuncture we will have two placebo acupuncture controls and an additional no-treatment control. Our two placebos will allow disentanglement to what extent skin-touching plus ritual or ritual alone contributes to the non-specific effects of placebo acupuncture and allow for a precise estimate of the mechanism whereby acupuncture may work in clinical practice.</p><p>In this study, we enrol patients who had functional neck/shoulder stiffness not due to any specific disease. To determine the efficacy of acupuncture for neck/shoulder stiffness, we use the three types of aforementioned needles to perform a randomised, double-blind (practitioner-patient), placebo-controlled study. The primary aims of the present study are to assess whether acupuncture treatment with skin piercing is superior to two different placebo treatments one with skin-touching plus ritual and one with ritual alone under double-blind conditions. The two placebo controls will allow for a more precise estimate of the components of acupuncture treatment, what might be a superior placebo. The no-treatment control will allow a determination as to whether any of the treatments are superior to natural progression, spontaneous remission or regression to the mean.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This ongoing study started from January 2011 and will complete in March 2015.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><sec><title>The acupuncture needles</title><p>We use three types of needles sterilized with gaseous ethylene oxide for a double-blind study design: 1) penetrating needles that can pierce the skin; 2) skin-touch placebo needles, the tip of which can touch against the skin but cannot penetrate it; 3) no-touch placebo needles, the tip of which cannot reach the skin. The appearances of these three types of needles are indistinguishable. The diameter of the needles is 0.18&#x000a0;mm. The insertion depth of the penetrating needle is 5&#x000a0;mm. A pedestal is used for the needles. These needles developed for the research employing Japanese style acupuncture have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This is a randomised, double-blind (practitioner-patient blinding), placebo-controlled study performed in a single centre including four arms: treatment with penetrating needles (penetrating treatment), treatment with skin-touch placebo needles (skin-touch placebo treatment), treatment with no-touch placebo needles (no-touch placebo treatment) and control with no treatment (no-treatment control) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The study is conducting at Japan School of Acupuncture, Moxibustion and Physiotherapy, and Tokyo Ariake University of Medical and Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.</p><p>We employ six (three males, three females) experienced and licensed acupuncturists, and recruit 400 volunteers with functional neck/shoulder stiffness who are students, teachers and staff at the Japan School of Acupuncture, Moxibustion and Physiotherapy or Tokyo Ariake University of Medical and Health Sciences.

The 400 bags for sterilisation numbered from 1 to 400 were randomly assigned to the penetrating, skin-touch placebo, no-touch placebo, or no-treatment control arm using a table of random numbers that was generated by the RAND function (Microsoft Excel 2003). Four penetrating needles, four skin-touch placebo needles or four no-touch placebo needles were put in a numbered bag corresponding to the assigned treatment type and sealed by the study controller; then they were sterilised with ethylene oxide gas.</p><p>The first to the last patient in order are each assigned one of the 400 numbered bags. As a result, 400 patients are randomly assigned to penetrating, skin-touch placebo, no-touch placebo treatment or no-treatment control. Each of the six acupuncturists treats 50 patients consecutively and in order.</p></sec><sec><title>Explanation to patients</title><p>At the beginning of the study, each patient is informed the following: &#x0201c;You are going to be randomly assigned to one of the four groups: acupuncture with needles that penetrate the skin, acupuncture with needles that touch the skin but cannot penetrate the skin, acupuncture with needles that cannot reach the skin, or no-treatment control sitting in a massage chair without acupuncture treatment. In case you are assigned to the no-treatment control group, we will treat your stiffness in the neck/shoulder using real needles after completion of the trial if you desire. You have a one-fourth chance of being assigned to the no-treatment control group. The needles are designed to be less painful, so you may not feel pain from treatment&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients&#x02019; evaluation of neck/shoulder stiffness before treatment</title><p>Before patients&#x02019; evaluation, the assistant makes sure the patients fully understand and that they evaluate the amount of neck/shoulder stiffness only on the right or left side whichever the patients feel is more severe.</p><p>The patients record where the strongest stiffness is on the figure in which neck and shoulder is drawn and its duration they have (less than 2&#x000a0;weeks, 2&#x000a0;weeks to 3&#x000a0;months, more than 3&#x000a0;months). The patients rate the intensity of neck/shoulder stiffness by a verbal rating scale (VRS: none, weak, moderate, strong, very strong) and on a 100&#x000a0;mm visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no neck/shoulder stiffness) to 100 (the most severe neck/shoulder stiffness imaginable). The unilateral neck/shoulder in which the patients have stiffness or feel more stiffness than the other side is decided to treat before treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Needle application and acupoints</title><p>Then, the assistant asks the patients to sit on a massage chair, to relax and not to touch or press their own body, especially the neck and shoulder. The patients are asked to indicate the place with the most severe stiffness in the neck/shoulder without touching when the acupuncturist asks them about it.</p><p>The assistant tells the acupuncturist that a patient is ready to receive treatment. The acupuncturist enters a treatment booth after an assistant&#x02019;s signal and she says the following: &#x0201c;Hello, I am going to treat your neck/shoulder stiffness from now on. Please point to where you have the strongest stiffness in the neck or shoulder&#x0201d;. The acupuncturist confirms it and marks the point where the patient indicates. Excluding one of the acupoints BL(Bladder)10, GB(Gallbladder)21, SI(Small Intestine)14 and BL42 in the neck or shoulder (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], whichever is nearest to the most severe stiffness, the other three acupoints are located and marked to apply needles with a light touch. These acupoints are where many patients with neck/shoulder stiffness complain and commonly used for the treatment of neck/shoulder stiffness.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Acupoints for treatment used in this trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6882-14-246-2"/></fig><p>The acupuncturist says &#x0201c;I am going to start acupuncture treatment and sterilise the skin with alcohol at and around the acupoints&#x0201d; and sterilises the skin on which the acupoint is located.The assistant prepares a set of four needles, spirits-of-wine cotton and fingerstall, and sets each needle assembly into an extra guide tube (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The assistant says &#x0201c;Please refrain from moving the neck, shoulder or hand. If you feel unbearable pain or something uncomfortable, please let me know. Please relax and do not force yourself to stay awake&#x0201d;.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the acupuncturist comes into the treatment booth and says &#x0201c;I am going to remove the needles now&#x0201d;. The acupuncturist returns the needle handle to its initial position by the alternating twirling technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], removes the entire needle assembly from the skin, and then puts it into an opaque envelope held by the assistant. After removal of each needle, the acupuncturist massages just like pre-massage the place where the needle is applied with three small strokes using the pulp of the index finger with fingerstall to prevent infection with bleeding (post-massage), and then sterilises that area. If there is bleeding, the acupuncturist presses sterilised cotton between the finger and the patient&#x02019;s skin, and reports the incidence in a questionnaire for practitioners. The needles are removed in the same order in which they are applied.</p><p>After treatment is completed, the acupuncturist tells the patient &#x0201c;The acupuncture treatment is done&#x0201d;. Then, the acupuncturist leaves the treatment booth and answers a questionnaire for practitioners.</p><p>The assistant observes whether needling have any untoward effects, then asks the patient to dress. In the rare circumstance of slight external bleeding from a point of needle removal the assistant will apply pressure with sterilised cotton to stop bleeding.

This study is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in treating functional neck/shoulder stiffness. Besides genuine acupuncture (which includes both genuine needle penetration and accompanying ritual of acupuncture), the study utilizes two types of double-blind placebos: skin-touch placebo (which includes the ritual) and no-touch placebo needles (the ritual of acupuncture alone). To clarify the relationship between the cause and the result with minimum bias as possible, we will evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture immediately and 24&#x000a0;hours after treatment. The results will provide high-quality evidence of the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for functional neck/shoulder stiffness with few confounding factors.</p><p>Furthermore, we will conduct subgroup analyses on practitioners&#x02019; or patients&#x02019; guesses in addition to intention-to-treat analysis to understand and discuss the efficacy of needle application, the efficacy of recognition of treatment type, and the relationship between the efficacy of needle application and the efficacy of treatment recognition, by which the efficacy and effectiveness of acupuncture treatment <italic>per se</italic> can be determined. These analyses could provide information on the crucial component of acupuncture such as skin penetration, skin pressure, performance of acupuncture ritual itself as well as the influence of psychological factors between mind of patients and practitioner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Further we will discuss importance of de-qi to produce effect of acupuncture treatment. Thus, the value of acupuncture treatment will be discussed from multiple perspectives and give us new insight that will enable us to implement acupuncture in clinical practice. In addition to improving neck/shoulder stiffness, a critical discussion will be given regarding practitioner and patient blinding and the limitations of the study which is to see short term effect, not a long term follow up.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>NT and the Educational Foundation of Hanada Gakuen possess a U.S. patent 6575992B1, a Canadian patent CA 2339223, a Korean patent 0478177, a Taiwan patent 150135, a Chinese patent ZL00800894.9 (Title: Safe needle, placebo needle and needle set for double blind) and two Japanese patents 4061397 (Title: Placebo needle, and needle set for double-blinding) and 4315353 (Title: Safe needle) on the needles described in this manuscript.
