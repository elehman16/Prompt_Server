The elderly population has grown proportionally faster than other age group in many countries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In Iran, although the elderly population (60 years and over) has small percentage of total population, it is rising rapidly compared to other age groups in recent decades.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] As the population ages, a trend of health problems like chronic diseases and disabilities increases. About 84% of those aged 65 and older suffer from at least one chronic condition, compared to 38% of those aged 20 through 44.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The aging process is associated with an increased prevalence and number of both mental and physical health concerns and disabilities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] One of the consequences of chronic diseases is the dramatic increase in the old-age dependency ratio; therefore, these people cannot do their daily activities as they used to do. Some of them become dependent and incapable, which cause various problems such as mental disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Mental health problems particularly depression and dementia are common in later life. For example, depression affects 3&#x02013;5% of the over 65 s at any point in time, with milder forms of mood disorder being present in another 10&#x02013;15%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Studies on successful aging suggest that lifestyle habits like having physical activity has influence on physical and mental health in older people. Moreover the importance of physical activity in maintaining an independent living status in the elderly has been widely documented in several studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Doing regular exercises can increase the person's ability to perform daily chores without dependency. Additionally, these activities influence on different aspects of quality of life, such as reducing physical pain, general health, happiness, social and emotional function and mental health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Despite this information, older adults remain mostly inactive and 65% of adults aged 75 and older report no leisure physical activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] While a large number of studies have examined the effects of physical activity on mental health in adults, only a few interventions have been conducted in older people. In this study we investigated the effect of regular physical activities on mental health in the elderly in an Iranian setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Four hundred men and women aged 60 and over were recruited in this field trial study. The study was conducted in Shahrekord, which is a city in southwest of Iran. Participants were selected randomly from the list of population of 10 urban health centers, which were randomly selected from 35 centers. Then, subjects in the selected centers were stratified into two groups, intervention and control. Exclusion criteria were subjects with history of cardiovascular or respiratory diseases or any medical conditions that prevented them to exercise (before or during the study) and absentee in more than three consecutive sessions were excluded. All participants signed the informed consent forms.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group. Randomization took place at an individual level at the time of the first measurement. We used balanced block randomization. Participants agreed to take part before randomization without being informed about which group they were allocated to. The researchers and the participants had knowledge of participants&#x02019; group assignment after the randomization.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>The participants in the intervention group were visited by a general practitioner to rule out exclusion criteria. Then they took part in 45-minute-sessions, two times a week for 8 consecutive weeks. In each session an exercise instructor delivered a low intensity exercise program, adapted from a guideline provided by Iranian Ministry of Health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The program consisted of the following parts: warming up in 20% of the session time, the main part that contained exercises for the upper body, lower body and movements for the whole body and cooling down phase, which took 10% of the session time. The exercises could be performed in sitting, as well as standing position. At the beginning of the session, the exercise instructor explained all the process. Moreover all participants were given a pamphlet explaining details of each session which also could be used for exercising at home. After finishing the exercise, the instructor explained the advantages of physical activity in later life.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Control Condition</title><p>Participants in the control group also received all the pamphlets[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] about exercise programs during 16 sessions when an exercise instructor explained about those pamphlets and also benefits of physical activity for elderly people in a two-hour session.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Data Collection</title><p>Since the percentage of illiteracy in Iranian elderly is high (about 71.6%),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] self-response questionnaire could not be an appropriate way to collect information. Therefore, we all participants were interviewed. All interviewers were trained by the researchers. They were also handed in interview guidelines. The interviews were conducted three times: Before the intervention, just after and 3 months after the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Measures</title><p>In this study to measure the mental health we used the GHQ, which was designed by Goldberg and colleagues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] This instrument is widely used in the general population to measure mental health and screening in primary care. The main version of the questionnaire contains 60 questions; shorter versions are derived from the main one, GHQ-12 and GHQ-28. 28-Items that include a total score and four 7-item scales Somatization, Anxiety, Social dysfunction and Depression. The participants evaluate changes in his/her behaviors, mood and feelings in the recent four weeks. It has 4-point response scale. According to the standard scoring method, recommended by Goldberg, scores for the first two types of answers are &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; (positive) and for the two others &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; (negative).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] This questionnaire was translated into the official language of Iran (Persian), which is comprehensible to almost every Iranian, and its validity and reliability were approved in an independent study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Reliability and validity of this questionnaire is also indicated for the Iranians elderly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The best cutoff point for this questionnaire was 6: i.e., those scoring 6 and above were designated as possible cases of mental disorder. Sensitivity, specificity and overall misclassification rate for a GHQ-28 cut-off score of 6 were 84.7%, 93.8% and 8.2%, respectively. The estimated intra-class correlation between the test&#x02013;retest for assessing reliability of the GHQ &#x02013; 28 was 0.85.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Another questionnaire was used to measure demographic variables (age, gender, education, marital status, living arrangement, participate in social activity and doing exercises) and included 10 questions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data relating to the survey were analyzed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 11.5 for Windows. We use Chi-square to compare the background variables and dependent variable in the control and intervention group before intervention. Paired-t test was used to compare the mental status before and after intervention. Independent-t test was used to identify significant variables. Sex, age, marital status, living with family and having social activity were considered as background variables. The mental health score measured as dependent variable and physical activity was an independent variable.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>During the study, 19 persons in the case group were absent in more than three consecutive sessions and were excluded accordingly. In the control group, nine subjects were excluded due to lack of access (one person died and eight participants changed their place of living). Therefore, 372 participants (181 in the intervention group and 191 controls) finished the study (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). There were 139 men (37.4%) and 233 women (62.6%). Their mean age was 71.71 &#x000b1; 8.22 years. One hundred and seventy four subjects (46.8%) were married, 108 persons (29%) were living alone, 249 participants (66.9%) were illiterate and 48 participants (12.9%) had participated in social activities.

Mousavi Gilani and his colleagues in the study showed, there are significant differences ListRead phonetically between athletes and non-athletes in somatization scores.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] This finding is supported by Ahmadi <italic>et al</italic>. study, which indicates a positive impact of exercise in this subscale of mental health,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] while Hosseini <italic>et al</italic>. in their study showed the difference between athletes and non-athlete group was not significant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>The results suggest that the efficacy of physical activity in reducing anxiety symptoms.

Herring <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] and Monika Guszkowska[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] studies also confirm this results. Palleschi demonstrated that physical activity for 3 months has a greater role in reducing anxiety score in the elderly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>Since social dysfunction score was different between two groups before intervention,we used difference in mean score before and after the study to evaluate the effect of our intervention.

First of all, selection bias and information bias might have influenced our findings. Selection bias might occur because our participants were willing to take part and we missed those who were not eager to follow the program. In the present study, interviewers were not blinded to participants&#x02019; allocation in the two groups, which might be a source of information bias. However, we tried to minimize this problem by working with trained interviewers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>According to findings of this study, doing physical activity 2 times a week for 2 months has a positive impact on mental health in general and on the four subscales somatization, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression in elder people.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was funded by Tehran University of Medical Sciences under the project number 88-02-27-8996.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Drewnowski</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Quality of Life in Older Adults: Summary</article-title><source>J Gerontol</source><year>2001</year><volume>56</volume><fpage>89</fpage><lpage>94</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bastone</surname><given-names>AdC</given-names></name><name><surname>Filho</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of an exercise program on functional performance of institutionalized elderly</article-title><source>J Rehabil Res Dev</source><year>2004</year><volume>41</volume><fpage>659</fpage><lpage>68</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15558395</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mirzai</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Shams</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Demograghy of elder population in Iran over the period 1956 to 2006</article-title><source>Iran J Aging Res</source><year>2007</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>226</fpage><lpage>31</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Center for Health Workforce Studies School of Public Health.
