A trial of job retention vocational rehabilitation (VR) in the United States identified this helped people keep working. The effectiveness of this VR in countries with different socioeconomic policies and conditions, and its impact on absenteeism, presenteeism and health, are unknown. This feasibility study tested the acceptability of this VR, modified for the United Kingdom, compared to written advice about managing work problems. To help plan a randomized controlled trial, we tested screening, recruitment, intervention delivery, response rates, applicability of the control intervention and identified the relevant primary outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A feasibility randomized controlled trial with rheumatoid, psoriatic or inflammatory arthritis patients randomized to receive either job retention VR or written information only (the WORK-IA trial). Following three days VR training, rheumatology occupational therapists provided individualised VR on a one to one basis. VR included work assessment, activity diaries and action planning, and (as applicable) arthritis self-management in the workplace, ergonomics, fatigue and stress management, orthoses, employment rights and support services, assistive technology, work modifications, psychological and disclosure support, workplace visits and employer liaison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Fifty five (10%) people were recruited from 539 screened.

A third of employed people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) stop working within three years of diagnosis due to arthritis (i.e. become work disabled) and 50% within 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Before this, people experience work instability, i.e. a mismatch between abilities and job demands which threatens employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is associated with increased: absenteeism, as employed people with RA average 40&#x000a0;days sick leave per year compared to the 6.5&#x000a0;days United Kingdom (UK) average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; and presenteeism (i.e. reduced at-work productivity), with 24% of working time lost due to health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Once unemployed, people with RA are unlikely to return to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many factors influence work instability and disability including: greater pain, hand pain and fatigue; unadapted work environments and equipment; physically demanding jobs; poor work self-efficacy; job strain; and limited use of self-management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Job retention vocational rehabilitation (VR) has the potential to prevent or postpone work disability through modifying such factors. For example, those with workplace ergonomic modifications are 2.5 times less likely to stop work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. VR should be provided early, when work instability develops. However, many with arthritis lack access to VR.</p><p id="Par26">A recent systematic review identified only two successful randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of job retention VR in arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These demonstrated: at 4.5&#x000a0;years, significant reductions in job loss (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;242) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; and at six months, improvements in work instability, work satisfaction, pain and self-perceived ability to manage work (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;32) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Allaire et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] evaluated a brief (three hour) intervention delivered by rehabilitation counsellors in the United States of America (USA), including work assessment and problem-solving participants&#x02019; priority difficulties. It is unclear if similar results would occur in the UK, with a different social security system, employment law and rehabilitation services. Macedo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], in a UK study, evaluated a comprehensive functional, work and psychosocial assessment, followed by six to eight sessions (30&#x02013;120&#x000a0;min each) of individualised VR and comprehensive occupational therapy, including a group patient education programme. The drive for efficiency in the UK National Health Service (NHS) means many therapy services now provide brief interventions and group education provision is patchy. Thus a longer intervention may not be feasible. Neither study measured effects on absenteeism or presenteeism. These findings suggest brief job retention VR, based on that developed in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], delivered by occupational therapists with job retention VR training as part of Rheumatology NHS services, could be effective in the UK.</p><p id="Par27">The aims of this study were to determine the feasibility of conducting a full RCT of job retention VR for employed people with inflammatory arthritis, specifically RA, undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis (IA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), as these are common conditions seen in Rheumatology departments. We investigated: screening and recruitment processes, study uptake, barriers to participation and retention rates; treatment fidelity; feasibility of assessment methods (proportion of missing data); the most feasible primary work outcome measure (time to job loss; employment status; absenteeism; or presenteeism); estimate a sample size for a definitive RCT; proof of principle by describing any changes in work and health outcomes; and the feasibility of Rheumatology occupational therapists delivering the VR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and setting</title><p id="Par28">We conducted a feasibility RCT comparing job retention VR (plus work self-help information) with work self-help information only in six Rheumatology occupational therapy services in England from November 2011 to July 2013. The trial was managed by Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). Ethics approval was granted by the National Research Ethics Committee East Midlands (Nottingham 1:11/EM/0103) and University of Salford Ethics Panel.</p><p id="Par29">This was a three-year study. The recruitment period was seven to ten months (i.e. varying between sites). This was reduced from 12&#x000a0;months because of delays in study approvals and restricted availability of research facilitators (i.e. research nurses and others employed by National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Networks (CRN) and NHS Trust Research and Development departments to support study recruitment in the NHS. They are not part of the research project team and thus not supervised by the trial manager). As a result, the funder (Arthritis Research UK) recommended that the follow-up period was reduced from 12 to nine months, in order to maximise the recruitment time available. The protocol was accordingly amended to conduct follow-up at nine months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par30">Participants were eligible if they were: 18&#x000a0;years of age or over; diagnosed with RA, PsA or undifferentiated IA (i.e. persistent symmetrical synovitis without any other known cause, but the person does not yet meet diagnostic criteria for RA); in paid work (full- or part-time); able to read, write and understand English; and willing to receive VR. We also tested which criterion best established need for VR: scoring &#x02265;10 on the RA-Work Instability Scale (RA-WIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], (i.e. a score indicating medium to high risk of work instability and need for VR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]) or stating &#x0201c;Yes&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Do you have any concerns about your health affecting your ability to work over the next few years?&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Exclusion criteria were: on extended sick leave (i.e. &#x0003e;three months) or unemployed (including not normally in paid employment or student); within the next 12&#x000a0;months, either planning to retire or take early retirement (through choice or ill health), move out of area or expecting joint replacement surgery; or already receiving or awaiting VR services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p id="Par32">NIHR CRN support for screening and recruitment was agreed prior to trial start. Screening was planned to be conducted by research facilitators in at least two Rheumatology out-patient clinic sessions per week at each site. If possible, a week before clinics, the healthcare team identified working age patients with RA, PsA or IA on clinic lists and research facilitators mailed out study information packs. If not, the health care team identified patients during clinic appointments and introduced them to the research facilitator. Research facilitators then screened patients in clinic. For those eligible and willing, research facilitators explained the study, obtained written consent, recorded baseline demographic data and the participant either completed the baseline questionnaire in clinic or later at home and mailed it back to the research facilitator. Research facilitators also explained how to complete a monthly calendar reporting work status and sickness absence (see Outcome Measures: absenteeism). For those receiving study information in advance, research facilitators consented patients that day in clinic. For those referred in clinic, eligible patients were allowed at least 48&#x000a0;h to consider participation. These patients were then telephoned by research facilitators to complete consent via telephone and mail and to remind about baseline questionnaire return.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p id="Par33">Following baseline questionnaire return, research facilitators randomized participants using a web-based randomisation system to receive either work self-help information only (control group) or VR plus work self-help information (intervention group). The randomization sequence was created using Stata 9.09.2 (Ralloc function by Philip Ryan v3.3.2) statistical software and was stratified by site, to ensure even occupational therapists&#x02019; workloads, with a 1:1 allocation using permuted blocks of randomly varying sizes. Treatment assignment was by the web-based randomisation system managed by Nottingham CTU. Following randomisation, research facilitators mailed the participant&#x02019;s screening checklist, demographic record and baseline questionnaire to the trial manager, who then mailed the participant the work self-help information. Intervention group participants&#x02019; contact details were sent to the treating occupational therapist by an automatically generated e-mail from the randomization system. The research facilitator, trial manager, and research staff collecting, entering and analysing data were blinded to group allocation. Blinding of participants and therapists to trial arm was not possible. Occupational therapists were asked to continue with their usual VR practice with non-trial participants (see below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Control group</title><p id="Par34">NHS &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; for work problems for most people with RA, PsA or IA is limited. Referral to occupational therapy for VR is often patchy or non-existent. VR (when provided) consists of, on average 45 [IQR 30&#x02013;90] minutes work advice (without a structured work assessment), provision of work advice booklets and signposting to other services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Control participants therefore received written self-help work information only, i.e. a similar control to that used by Allaire et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This consisted of a cover letter, self-help flowchart and two work advice booklets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]: see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Participants continued to receive usual Rheumatology care (i.e. regular out-patient appointments, prescribed medication, and referral by Consultants to therapy services as necessary).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention group</title><p id="Par35">Intervention group participants also received written work self-help information and usual care. Treating occupational therapists received three days VR training [12]. Participants were seen within four weeks of referral. Direct VR consisted of up to 4.5&#x000a0;h of 1:1 meetings, starting with a structured work interview and ending with a telephone review. Up to 1.5&#x000a0;h extra contact was also possible. We planned VR to be longer than in Allaire et al.&#x02019;s trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] as: therapists were providing this VR for the first time; Allaire et al. had recommended extra time for complex cases and a telephone review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; and we included optional work site visits. We paid for up to 10&#x000a0;h occupational therapy time (plus mileage costs for any visits) per VR group participant. This included both direct and indirect VR (i.e. non-contact time when therapists: completed treatment notes; identified solutions for work problems; liaised with team members, other agencies and employers; and travel time).</p><p id="Par36">Meetings were at mutually agreed times (often early or late in the day to fit around participants&#x02019; work commitments) and locations (the occupational therapy department, participant&#x02019;s home or workplace) spread over two to four months. The intervention started with a structured work interview and job discussion (i.e. an assessment of the person&#x02019;s job, roles and responsibilities in relation to their condition, disease severity and activity limitations) and detailed assessment of work barriers. This was conducted using the UK Work Experience Survey-Rheumatic Conditions (WES-RC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This was followed by mutually agreeing priority work problems, action planning, and then a tailored, individualised programme including self-management at work, job accommodations, employment rights information and other strategies as relevant. Participants were offered a work site visit, if this was identified as relevant to their needs. VR also emphasised participants&#x02019; responsibilities in liaising with employers and included role play, as necessary, to enhance confidence requesting job accommodations (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Treatment fidelity</title><p id="Par37">The WORK-IA VR Resource Manual was provided to support VR delivery. (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Monitoring visits assessed treatment fidelity conducting the WES-RC, problem identification and treatment planning. Additionally, a random six WES-RCs and treatment notes were reviewed for problem identification and matching treatment to problems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par38">Follow-up data was collected using a questionnaire booklet at six and nine months, mailed by the trial manager.

The following work outcomes were derived from the monthly calendar:</p><p id="Par53">Time to temporary or permanent job loss (days): recording on which date their contract ended, if they stopped working and, if a new job was obtained, their contract started.</p><p id="Par54">Absenteeism: over nine months, the number of days sickness absence attributable to either arthritis or other causes (e.g. common ailments), not including days not normally worked.</p><p id="Par55">Participants were not telephoned to obtain missing data from returned questionnaires or minimal datasets from non-responders, apart from for the absenteeism measure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>VR provision</title><p id="Par56">Therapists completed a VR Treatment Record of: duration of treatment contact for direct VR (i.e. with participant) and indirect VR (e.g. administration, making referrals, sourcing information, treatment planning, travel time for home/ work visits); treatment location; and travel mileage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par57">A statistically based sample size estimate was inapplicable for this feasibility study.

Recruitment and retention rates were summarised descriptively.

Where, applicable, change from baseline was also summarised and effect sizes were calculated) as mean change/standard deviation at baseline) to compare the internal responsiveness of outcomes. An effect size of 0.2 is interpreted as small, 0.5 medium and 0.8 large effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. All analyses were according to randomisation allocation. Quality of Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were calculated using EQ5D.

Sites recruited varyingly between November 2011 and September 2012 and actively recruited for 6.5&#x000a0;months (1QR 5&#x02013;7) (i.e. 54% of the original 12&#x000a0;months planned time). This was because Local NHS Trust Research and Development department (R&#x00026;D) approvals were delayed and took until month 14 at five sites and month 17 at one site. Five sites were re-scheduled to open for ten and one for seven months. Average time to recruit the first patient was 14&#x000a0;weeks (IQR 10.5&#x02013;17.25) as, for the first three to four months, there was little or no research facilitator availability at four sites. At six months, two sites closed: research facilitator support was withdrawn at one and the only occupational therapist went on long-term sick leave at the other.</p><p id="Par60">The flow of participants is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Of the 539 screened, 37% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;199) were eligible. Of these, 28% of those eligible (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;55; 10% overall) consented. At screening, most had RA-WIS scores &#x02265;10 (i.e. moderate to high risk of work disability). Only six (11%) had scores &#x0003c;10 but answered &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to concerns about continuing working with arthritis. Their average RA-WIS score at screening was 5.5 (SD 2.7) but rose to 7.8 (SD3.7) at baseline, as three now reported RA-WIS scores &#x02265;10. The two intervention group participants with scores &#x0003c;10 at screening, had multiple problems identified in the WES-RC, indicating VR was applicable. Given most people with concerns had RA-WIS scores &#x02265;10, and those scoring &#x0003c;10 at screening had scores close to or &#x02265;10 at baseline, using the concerns criterion is applicable for a future trial. Most participants completed baseline questionnaires at home, with only 10 choosing to do so in clinic. Within the two groups, 1/26 in the control group was incorrectly referred to occupational therapy by the CTU and received VR; and 4/29 in the intervention group did not complete VR (one was not referred by the CTU; one had already retired early; one did not want VR; and one could not be contacted). By six months, one person in the intervention group withdrew.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2017_1671_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The findings indicate VR may reduce risk of job loss and improve productivity, confidence managing arthritis at work, physical ability, pain and perceived health. The control group remained largely unchanged. Results should be interpreted with caution as this was a feasibility trial, with small numbers and we did not therefore conduct inferential testing.</p><p id="Par71">We also conducted interviews with participants and the occupational therapists to investigate their views of VR and the work advice provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Intervention group participants valued the VR, particularly the training in work-based pain and fatigue self-management, joint protection, pacing, ergonomic and job adaptations/ accommodations advice. They reported: relief from discussing work problems with the occupational therapists; making behavioural adaptations at work; and improved coping skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In contrast, the control group discussed the continuing negative impact of arthritis on their work and feeling anxious about continuing working in future. Most participants in both groups had either not read the self-help work information or considered it had little impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The occupational therapists considered: the VR was beneficial for patients; and they could now provide a more comprehensive and individualised VR service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">The positive quantitative and qualitative findings suggest this VR intervention is promising. Healthy work has positive health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. People with health conditions who lose their job can struggle to get back to work, have financial difficulties, reduced retirement pensions, loss of positive psychological and social support from working, reduced wellbeing and worse health. Employers lose valuable skills and health services bear additional costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Forced retirement at 65&#x000a0;years of age no longer exists, the UK state pension age is rising and many people will need to work for longer. Initiatives supporting helping people with arthritis stay in work for longer are of benefit to both employees and employers. Direct VR averaged under four hours and the total cost was &#x000a3;135/ participant (including indirect VR). If job retention VR is proven effective in an RCT, this is a relatively low cost for a potentially large saving to people with arthritis, the NHS, employers and society. In future, employer insurance could potentially pay for such services from the NHS.</p><p id="Par73">The study built on previous successful job retention VR research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], whilst making VR pragmatic and deliverable in a UK NHS setting. The intervention was individualised, flexible and spread over several months to allow participants time to make changes between sessions and reduce the impact of taking time out of work. The resource use questionnaire identified how frequently many patients have to attend other appointments, highlighting the need for flexible VR and minimising disruption to patients&#x02019; work schedules.</p><p id="Par74">Whilst workplace visits are beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we decided to make them optional as these can only be undertaken if the person has disclosed their condition to their employer and agrees to them. Accordingly, the benefits of disclosure, employer liaison and workplace visits were discussed during VR, as relevant. Only three work visits were undertaken. Most participants either did not want a workplace visit, or felt confident to address job accommodation needs with employers and a visit was not essential, which also helped reduce costs. Relatively few participants agreed to employer contact for interviews. We had anticipated higher levels of workplace engagement as national guidelines recommend a workplace component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The occupational therapists delivered VR in less than the planned time and budget, with results indicating improvements in outcomes. Accordingly, providing job retention VR in these Rheumatology occupational therapy services was feasible. The control group only received written advice (reflective of that provided to many with arthritis). As no or only small effects were seen in work and health outcomes in the control group, written advice was an appropriate control intervention.</p><p id="Par75">Of the candidate primary outcome measures, the absenteeism measure (monthly calendar) provided detailed data but completion rates were lower than for presenteeism and had too high a responder burden. Three monthly self-report of sick leave days (with average number of days normally worked per week) would be less onerous and could lead to better response rates. The WLQ and RA-WIS presenteeism measures are considered the best options. The Outcome Measurement in RA Clinical Trials (OMERACT) Work Group previously had identified the WLQ, WALS and RA-WIS as presenteeism measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, subsequently they determined the RA-WIS is not a presenteeism measure, although still important as a prognostic measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], as scores &#x0003e;11 are predictive of future reduction in work hours and &#x0003e;13 of disability leave of absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Accordingly, the WLQ is the most applicable primary outcome for an RCT. Presenteeism has the greatest impact on costs for people with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], confirming the relevance of this. Sample sizes of 120 to 140 would be required for a definitive RCT with 90% power, two-sided 5% significance level and allowing for a 20% loss to follow-up, using published data on minimum clinically important differences for these presenteeism outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and using the standard deviations observed in this feasibility trial.</p><p id="Par76">Only 20% of people with RA consider they receive sufficient information and practical support about employment issues from their Rheumatology service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many employees with arthritis are unaware of job retention VR services available and provision of these is patchy in the UK. VR is currently available from: occupational health departments, usually only available in larger organisations, but 60% of employees work for small to medium sized enterprises; the &#x0201c;Fit for Work Service,&#x0201d; although referral to an occupational health professional is made only when an employee has been off sick for four weeks or more&#x000a0;(before then self-help internet advice and telephone support are available) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]; the Access to Work scheme, which the person applies for themselves, can provide grants for job accommodations (e.g. transport, equipment at work) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]; and Job Centre Disability Employment Advisors, although services are primarily for the unemployed. NHS occupational therapists, with additional VR training, are well-placed to provide early job retention VR. Occupational analysis and therapeutic interventions in the workplace are a core part of occupational therapy practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Employed people with inflammatory arthritis experiencing work problems, can be readily identified when patients attend Rheumatology out-patients and referrals made to occupational therapy. NHS-based VR means it is also available to those who have not disclosed or do not want employer contact. This job retention VR could also be applicable for a wider range of rheumatological conditions.</p><p id="Par77">During the study, some research facilitators highlighted patients, particularly in areas with higher social deprivation and in precarious employment, expressed concerns about taking time out of work and/ or did not want VR, influencing their non-participation. The British Society of Rheumatology is now supporting training for Rheumatology teams to have &#x0201c;work conversations&#x0201d; with patients to promote the importance of staying working and obtaining work advice. In a future trial, ensuring teams have training in, and implement work conversations, could prime patients to perceive VR as important to receive.</p><p id="Par78">There were limitations in this study. The two groups differed in occupational groupings and, in a definitive RCT, trial stratification by occupational group (levels 1 to 4) would reduce this disparity. The recruitment time was nearly half that planned, partly due to the time obtaining R&#x00026;D approvals. The NHS Health Research Authority has since streamlined approvals processes, with targets for completions and recruitment. Our recruitment strategy was screening in two Rheumatology clinics per week. However, limited research facilitator availability caused delays in sites starting, periods of no screening and early site closure. Only 10% of patients screened were randomised into the study. This was however, consistent with pre-trial predictions. A two-week audit before the trial at one site identified 25% of Rheumatology out-patients were employed people with RA, PsA or IA. Studies evaluating RA-WIS scores in employed people with RA identified 34 to 69% had scores &#x02265;10%, i.e. moderate to high risk of work disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We estimated nine to 18% of Rheumatology out-patients could meet key eligibility criteria, but that the other criteria and unwillingness to participate would reduce recruitment to 10% or less of out-patients.</p><p id="Par79">Research facilitators had problems contacting up to 20% of those identified to complete screening or consent. Research facilitators worked only during the day and often only had patients&#x02019; home landline telephone numbers and not work/ mobile telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. This prevented contacting employed patients in the evenings. It is clearly important to ensure a range of contact details are obtained at the point of first contact with potential participants. In consequence, in a future trial, employing a research fellow, working flexibly into some evenings, would assist contacting patients outside normal work hours. The research fellow can then complete screening and consent by telephone with patients, ensure baseline questionnaires are sent out/returned and patients randomised (subject to patients&#x02019; permission for contact details to be forwarded). When research facilitators are unavailable to complete screening and recruitment, a research fellow can also complete study procedures. To increase numbers of people with RA, PsA or IA referred for screening, working age/ employed patients could be identified by healthcare team members/ research facilitators from department databases, medical and therapy notes and in therapy departments. Such patients could be mailed invitation packs by research facilitators, with interested patients returning a reply form to the research fellow who completes study procedures.</p><p id="Par80">Whilst an 80% retention rate is suggested as near the limit of validity for RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], our 20% attrition was similar to other job retention VR trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and other RA rehabilitation trials e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This retention rate may reflect the more adherent, motivated group of people choosing to participate and willing to commit the time, which arguably reflects the situation in every trial. The trial manager contacted participants by telephone in the evenings to give questionnaire reminders to promote retention. A research fellow could also contact participants, day and evenings, to assist questionnaire completion and obtain a minimal data set, when necessary. Additional retention strategies could be considered, such as advance postcards and text reminders indicating questionnaires will be sent shortly, a second questionnaire reminder and using financial rewards or incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. We had many measures in the questionnaire, as an aim was to identify the most applicable primary work outcome measure. Accordingly, responder burden would be reduced in a definitive trial, which may encourage better completion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par81">The findings from this study suggest job retention VR provided by NHS occupational therapists with VR training is credible, acceptable, deliverable and promising for employed people with arthritis with concerns about continuing to work in future because of their condition. The finding regarding screening and recruitment suggest recruitment could be challenging and requires additional research fellow support. Consideration needs to be given to the number needing to be screened (around 1350) to achieve the recruitment target, the number of sites and length of recruitment period required to achieve the target. There is a need for a definitive trial of this brief job retention VR in the UK, with the caveat of ensuring sufficient funding for out-of-hours and remote screening, recruitment and retention support to ensure timely recruitment and maximised response rates.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par88">
