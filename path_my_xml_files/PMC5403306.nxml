In total, 120 breast cancer patients who were hospitalized in the Departments of Breast Disease and Medical Oncology served as the subjects of this study. The subjects were diagnosed with breast cancer phase II to phase IIIA, as confirmed by aspiration biopsy and iconography. The patients were divided into two groups in a randomized control manner, with 60 patients in each group. The experimental group was administered the taxotere + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide (TEC) plan for 3&#x02013;4 cycles of chemotherapy before the modified radical operation of breast cancer. In the control group, no TEC chemotherapy was carried out prior to operation. Instead, the breast lesion was removed directly by operation. After the operation, the IHC method was used to stain the ER&#x003b2; protein in the lesion tissue. The patients were classified according to whether the basement membrane was broken through; 5 cases had non-infiltrative carcinoma and 115 cases had infiltrative carcinoma. According to the pathology of the lesion, 114 cases had breast ductal carcinoma, 2 cases had mucinous breast carcinoma (of which there were 2 cases combined with ductal carcinoma), and 4 cases had breast lobular carcinoma. The <italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2; gene was found to be expressed in normal and breast cancer tissues. When <italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2; gene expression was compared before and after the chemotherapy, its expression was significantly increased in breast cancer tissues, which shows a significant statistical difference (P&#x0003c;0.05). In the experimental group, the expression of <italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2; gene in carcinoma tissue was significantly lower than that in the control group, and differences were statistically significant (P&#x0003c;0.05). Therefore, expression of the <italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2; gene in breast carcinoma tissues was high. The application of adjuvant chemotherapy before the modified radical operation for breast carcinoma can significantly lower the level of ER&#x003b2; expression. The expression levels of ER&#x003b2; gene in the carcinoma tissue of the patients can be treated as the evaluation index for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Regarding targeted therapy and corresponding drug development for breast carcinoma, ER&#x003b2; can act as one of the specific drug targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>breast carcinoma</kwd><kwd>neoadjuvant chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor &#x003b2; gene</kwd><kwd>targeted therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast carcinoma refers to the malignant tumor of breast epithelial cells and accounts for over 20% of all malignant tumors diagnosed in women. Thus, it is a major cause of mortality that threatens the health of women (<xref rid="b1-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). To improve the quality of life of breast carcinoma patients, various studies have been carried out combining surgical operation and post-operation adjuvant therapy (<xref rid="b2-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The etiological agents that lead to breast carcinoma and the mechanisms behind these causative agents are relatively complicated. Factors that increase the likelihood of breast cancer include family history, contact with radioactive rays, certain chemical substances, proto-oncogene activation and stimulation of biotic factors, which can all lead to the malignant proliferation or oncogenic mutation of breast epithelial tissue (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The formation of an adjuvant therapeutic schedule for breast carcinoma patients requires judgment which takes into account the combination of clinical classification and stage of the patients. Currently, we administer post-operation chemotherapy to treat breast carcinoma patients, the purpose of which is to reduce the postoperative recurrence as much as possible and prolong the disease-free survival and five-year survival rate. In terms of chemotherapy cocktails, we primarily administer taxotere + adriamycin + cyclophosphamide (TAC) and the taxotere + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide (TEC) plans (<xref rid="b4-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), adriamycin amycin + cyclophosphamide + paclitaxel (AC-P) plan, adriamycin amycin + cyclophosphamide + taxol (AC-T) plan and adriamycin amycin + cyclophosphamide (AC) plan. The mechanism of action of chemotherapy drugs is to curb DNA proliferation, mitosis or other biological processes through interference into the different phases of the cell cycle. Therefore, in most cases, these drugs lack specificity and damage normal tissues and cells of the human body (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Previous findings showed that the combination of chemotherapy drugs and targeted therapeutic drugs can lead to good outcome for the treatment of breast carcinoma (<xref rid="b4-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Estrogen receptor &#x003b2; (<italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2;) gene encodes estrogen receptor &#x003b2;. Estrogen is of great significance in normal physiology, aging and the treatment of many diseases (<xref rid="b9-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The main function of the estrogen nuclear receptor is the transcription factor for the activation of ligand, which can mediate the genetic transcription of tissues and organs regulated and controlled by this hormone (<xref rid="b10-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Since Mufudza <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) cloned the gene of estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;), there have been numerous studies conducted on this estrogen receptor showing that, in normal breast tissue, there is only 7&#x02013;10% of ER&#x003b1; expression and it is present mostly in the breast cells that are in their non-proliferation phase (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, the expression levels of ER&#x003b1; vary based on the menstrual cycle. Clinical studies have shown that the expression levels of ER&#x003b1; are closely associated with the degree of differentiation and grade of malignancy and location of the transfer of breast cancer cells (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, some scholars consider that ER&#x003b1; can be treated as one of the factors in the evaluation of prognosis of breast carcinoma. However, due to the fact that ER&#x003b1; is only expressed in a small quantity of breast epithelial cells, the sensitivity and specificity of determining the prognosis of breast carcinoma by ER&#x003b1; is poor. ER&#x003b2; is the new member of the super family of steroid hormone receptors. It has six functional zones: A-F (<xref rid="b5-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Leygue <italic>et al</italic> found ER&#x003b2; mRNA expression in breast (<xref rid="b16-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Additionally, the ER&#x003b2; mRNA was detected in breast carcinoma samples and the mammary epithelial cells of several types of individuals. The study by Lanfranchi and Brind showed that the ratio of ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; in breast carcinoma patients varies as breast carcinoma develops (<xref rid="b17-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, whether ER&#x003b2; can be treated as the evaluation index for breast carcinoma treatment and prognosis remains to be determined.</p><p>Clinical data and pathological samples of 120 breast carcinoma patients were collected to study the expression levels of the <italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2; gene in breast carcinoma and to examine its clinical relevance in neoadjuvant therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Sample selection</title><p>In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 120 female patients with breast carcinoma who were hospitalized at the Department of Breast Surgery of the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences.

According to the clinical performance, imagological examination, and pathological examination of patients, we classified and identified the stages of the breast carcinoma in patients and performed corresponding neoadjuvant chemotherapy TEC plans as well as an operation plan.

In terms of the treatment of breast carcinoma, in the past, surgical operation combined with post-operation chemotherapy were often applied to curb the growth and proliferation of cancer cells to the most optimal degree. However, the medical field is constantly evolving and has new opinions regarding current treatment methods about breast carcinoma. Investigators are examining whether it is possible to apply targeted chemotherapy prior to surgery to markedly decrease the size of the tumor to avoid physical and mental damage to the women. In addition, targeted treatment based on targeted gene specificity can significantly improve prognosis and survival of the patients. Targeted drugs that were used in the past are mainly from the HERB (<xref rid="b12-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) receptor family at the surface of cancer cells. However, as the disease develops, the drug resistance of the targeted therapy drugs increase, which is one of the major challenges in the clinical treatment of breast carcinoma. Based on this, we designed and carried out the present study. For breast carcinoma patients who have a definite diagnosis, we arranged for three to four cycles of pre-operation &#x02018;adjuvant chemotherapy&#x02019; (TEC plan) (<xref rid="b13-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) before the surgery. Additionally, we measured the expression levels of <italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2; gene before and after the operation to provide a theoretical basis for the development of new types of targeted drugs for treatment.</p><p>In the present study, we found that, among the 120 breast carcinoma patients, there were different degrees of expression of the <italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2; gene when looking at the healthy and breast carcinoma tissues of the patients. However, the expression in the breast carcinoma tissues significantly increases, showing significant statistical difference (P&#x0003c;0.05). The high expression of ER&#x003b2; also indicates that the cell proliferation conditions are exuberant in the body of breast carcinoma patients (<xref rid="b15-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Past studies, such as that conducted by Leygue <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b16-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), found the expression of ER&#x003b2; mRNA in the breast carcinoma tumor samples and the mammary epithelial cells of several types of people. In addition, Leygue <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b16-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) showed that the ratio of ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; in the breast carcinoma patients varies as breast cancer develops. Compared to surrounding normal breast tissues, the ER&#x003b1; mRNA/ER&#x003b2; mRNA ratio in ER&#x003b1;-positive breast carcinoma tissues significantly increases. This discovery indicates that ER&#x003b2; may play a part in the occurrence and development of the breast carcinoma (<xref rid="b17-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, the ability to discern the occurrence and development of breast carcinoma and prognosis by analyzing the expression of ER&#x003b2; is still not thoroughly researched and lacks the absolute specificity of the cells in the tissue (<xref rid="b20-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Whether the expression levels of ER&#x003b2; are related to the differentiation level of cells in tissue requires further research and verification (<xref rid="b21-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Even so, this study has provided reasonable theoretical support for the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis evaluation, recurrence, transfer and other adverse events of breast carcinoma. It has also suggested a reasonable research direction for the development of targeted treatment drugs. To establish ER&#x003b2; as a biomarker, the ability to check ER&#x003b2; expression level by serology can significantly increase the detection rate of ER&#x003b2;. This allows physicians to reasonably evaluate the regression and prognosis of tumors in clinical application according to the specific expression levels.</p><p>In the present study, we designed the pre-operation neoadjuvant chemotherapy (TEC plan) for 3&#x02013;4 cycles to test the expression levels of <italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2; gene in cancer tissues of patients and identified a correlation between the ER&#x003b2; level and the clinical stages of breast carcinoma and lymphatic metastasis, and the results were statistically significant (P&#x0003c;0.05). We hypothesized that among patients who have lymphatic metastasis and poor pathological analysis, the number of cancer cells of executant proliferation greatly increase. If we reverse this process, we can come to the conclusion that the higher the ER&#x003b2; level is, the higher the stage of cancer is; however, we lack experimental proof. Our results indicate that the expression levels of ER&#x003b2; are not related to the pathological classification of breast carcinoma. After the patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the expression levels of the ER&#x003b2; gene significantly decrease compared to levels before the neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the results were statistically significant (P&#x0003c;0.05). This indicates that there may be some value of using ER&#x003b2; levels for clinical reference in evaluating the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, we only focused on the <italic>in vitro</italic> study of ER&#x003b2; in clinical breast carcinoma patients. There is no support of our findings in animal experiments. The related targeted therapeutic drugs remain to be developed. Theoretical support is necessary for issues concerning whether the targeted therapeutic drugs can improve the survival rate and disease-free survival period in animal models of breast carcinoma.</p><p>Additionally, our results did not show any correlation between the size of cancer and ER&#x003b2; expression levels. This is different from the results of past studies. Zu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b19-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) studied this issue and suggested that in gastric adenocarcinoma, there is a correlation between the size and prognosis of the cancer and the expression of tumor markers. However, Yang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b20-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) indicated that there was no significant correlation between the size of the tumor and the proliferation and metabolism degree of the cancer cells. Combined with our study results, we think that, in breast carcinoma, the size of tumor in the breasts do not have significant correlation with the metabolism of the tumor. In malignant breast tumors, there are differences in differentiation degree of cancer cells. We found that, in the undifferentiated or low-differentiated carcinoma patients, often, the size of the tumor is not large and in most cases, there have already had distant metastasis or lymphatic metastasis as previously reported (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-5659" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Through the collection and study of the samples before and after the operation, we recognize the limitations of our study. For example, in our early studies, we found that the expression of ER&#x003b2; gene varies according to the dynamic change and the meaning of such changes during the treatment process of patients. However, further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments are needed for verification. Furthermore, during the occurrence and development of breast carcinoma, the function of the ER&#x003b2; gene, i.e., the working mechanism, still remains to be explored. Even though there has been no theoretical support for these study results in the study of breast carcinoma, it has provided good insights for our future study.</p><p>In conclusion, the <italic>ER</italic>&#x003b2; gene is of important clinical value for the evaluation of recurrence, transfer and death of breast carcinoma patients. We can treat ER&#x003b2; as the evaluation index for the neoadjuvant chemotherapy when observing its clinical effects. In the targeted therapy and corresponding drug development for breast carcinoma, ER&#x003b2; can act as one of the specific drug targets.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
