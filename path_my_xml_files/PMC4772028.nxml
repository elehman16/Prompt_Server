Moreover, higher energy content of food has been shown to lead to higher satiety. Up to now, it has not been studied systematically how oral exposure duration and gastric energy content interact in satiety regulation. Thirty-seven men (22 &#x000b1; 4 years, 22 &#x000b1; 2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in a randomized cross-over trial, in which we independently manipulated: (1) oral exposure duration by modified sham feeding (MSF) for 1 or 8 min; and (2) energy content of gastric load (GL) by a nasogastric tube: 100 kcal/500 mL or 700 kcal/500 mL. Outcome measures were appetite ratings and subsequent energy intake from an <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal. Energy intake was 35% lower after the GLs with 700 kcal than with 100kcal (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). All appetite ratings were lower in the 700 kcal than in the 100 kcal treatments (area under the curve (AUC); <italic>p</italic>-values &#x02264; 0.002); fullness was higher and prospective consumption was lower in the 8 min than in the 1 min MSF treatments (AUC; <italic>p</italic>-values &#x02264; 0.02). In conclusion, the current showed that a GL of 700 kcal/500 mL <italic>vs.</italic> 100 kcal/500 mL increased satiety and lowered energy intake. No additional effects of oral exposure duration could be observed, presumably due to the high contrast in energy between the manipulations. Future research should also focus on the role of oral exposure as such and not only the duration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>satiety</kwd><kwd>appetite</kwd><kwd>energy intake</kwd><kwd>oral exposure</kwd><kwd>gastric energy content</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-08-00064"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Food intake is an episodic activity, that is, people eat in short time-moments with intervals of no eating during which people feel satiated and hunger feelings are suppressed [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A cascade of different psychological and physiological processes is elicited during and after food consumption [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Stomach filling and presence of nutrients in the duodenum have shown to affect meal size [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Important factors in these early digestive processes are the volume, nutrient composition, and energy density of the foods in the stomach.</p><p>For satiation&#x02014;the process that brings people to end their meal&#x02014;it has been shown that oro-sensory properties of a food, such as the palatability, structure, and taste, are key players. The last decade it has become clear that that especially the time during which the food is present in the oral cavity has an important role in satiation [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example prolonging oral exposure by altering the physico-chemical structure of a food [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], lowering the rate of eating [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], for example by changing bite or sip size [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and mode of consumption [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], have shown to lead to earlier satiation. </p><p>Cecil and colleagues have hypothesized, based on a series of studies, that oro-sensory signals are especially important for the magnitude of physiological feed-back in order to have optimal satiation and digestion [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This has been illustrated by studies in which food was infused directly in the stomach by a nasogastric-tube. For example, Cecil has shown that consumption of soup resulted in earlier satiation compared to intra-gastric infusion of the same soup [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A recent study of Spetter <italic>et al.</italic> showed that intra-gastric infusion of chocolate custard lead to delayed and higher responses in insulin and GLP-1 compared to normal consumption [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These observations suggest that oro-sensory signals are important in preparing the body for optimal digestion.</p><p>However, the effect of oro-sensory exposure in combination with gastric filling on food intake is barely investigated. Cecil <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] investigated this indirectly; they observed differences in energy compensation after ingestion of carbohydrates compared to fat when ingested orally, whereas in their second experiment, no such effects were found after intra-gastric infusion [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]&#x02014;suggesting that oral exposure, in other words identification of the food, is essential for optimal energy compensation. Previously, we performed a study in which we investigated the effect of oral exposure duration&#x02014;by means of a modified sham feeding paradigm (MSF)&#x02014;and different iso-caloric volumes of gastric filling on energy intake. We found that with longer oral exposure duration (8 min MSF) subjects ate on average 17% less energy in their subsequent meal, whereas in the short conditions (1 min MSF) non-statistically significant reductions were found [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This shows that oro-sensory exposure duration can affect subsequent satiety&#x02014;the suppression of hunger and the urge to eat in the time after consumption. </p><p>Recently, we conducted a study with a similar protocol in which we again manipulated oral exposure duration by MSF&#x02014;1 or 8 min&#x02014;in combination with isovolumetric loads with different energy content&#x02014;100 or 700 kcal&#x02014;by means of intra-gastric infusion [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We observed a clear inhibition of gastric emptying after the high energy load, but oral exposure duration did not modify this effect. Despite that, we did not see an effect of oro-exposure duration on gastric emptying in our previous study, we cannot rule out that other physiological factors, like satiety related peptides, might affect food intake after 30 min. In the previous study, we did not have the opportunity to include a test-meal, as this would have affected our primary outcome, gastric emptying. We, therefore, conducted the current study. We now hypothesized that a longer oral exposure duration combined with a high energy gastric load (GL) would lower energy intake at a subsequent meal. In addition, we expected satiety ratings to be higher after the longer oral exposure duration and the high energy GL.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-08-00064"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-nutrients-08-00064"><title>2.1. Subjects</title><p>Healthy young men were recruited from Wageningen and surroundings. Men had to be between 18 and 40 years old with a normal BMI (&#x02265;18.5 to &#x02264; 25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). They needed to have a good&#x02014;self-reported- mental and physical health and a stable body weight (defined as: a maximum body weight change in the last 2 months of 5 kg). Exclusion criteria were: restrained eating behavior (score &#x02265; 2.26, as determined using the Dutch Eating Beahviour Questionnaire (DEBQ [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), smoking, gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes, thyroid diseases or any other endocrine disorders, lack of appetite, hypersensitivity or food allergy for products used in the study, or medication or drug use (mild pain relievers available over the counter, such as paracetamol, were allowed).</p><p>In total, 86 men completed the screening questionnaire, of which 56 seemed eligible and were invited for an additional screening and information meeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00064-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of interested males were studying at Wageningen University. Forty-six of them met all inclusion criteria. These men then had to successfully complete a training session with all study procedures of treatment 8 min/700 kcal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-08-00064-t001">Table 1</xref>) to be further enrolled in the study. Three men stopped after the training session because they found the tube intubation too invasive, and one man was excluded because he had a recovery rate of 83% during MSF (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4dot1-nutrients-08-00064">Section 2.4.1</xref>). The remaining 42 men were enrolled in the study.

Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we investigated the effect of -independently manipulated- oral exposure duration and gastric energy content on satiety ratings and energy intake. We found that a gastric load of 700 kcal led to higher satiety and lower energy intake in the next meal compared to an iso-volumetric gastric load of 100 kcal. We found no modifying effect of oral exposure duration&#x02014;1 min MSF <italic>vs.</italic> 8 min&#x02014;on energy intake in the next meal. Oral exposure duration by MFS affected some of the satiety ratings: larger AUCs for fullness and lower AUCs for prospective consumption were observed after 8 min MSF compared to 1 min MSF.</p><p>We observed a 35% (348 kcal) lower energy intake after the high energy GLs than after iso-volumetric low energy GLs. We made our difference larger than Rolls and Roe, who did not observe an effect as their difference between infusions was much smaller; 0.5 <italic>vs.</italic> 1.0 kcal/mL. In our former study, we showed the contrast in energy density&#x02014;0.2 <italic>vs.</italic> 1.4 kcal/mL was large enough to observe a physiological difference, that is a difference in gastric emptying rate [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Besides energy content, the GL was also slightly different in viscosity. This might have been a confounding factor, however, the liquids were infused at the same rate, and the viscosity difference was only small as both liquids were easily infused by the nasogastric tube. Taking the findings of our studies together suggests that lower energy intake of the second meal occurred (partly) as a result of a pre-absorptive physiological effect, that is via a slower gastric empting of the stomach content in to the intestine.</p><p>Satiety ratings were also higher after the high energy loads and&#x02014;but to a lesser extent&#x02014;after the long oral exposure duration, <italic>i.e.</italic>, hunger was lower and fullness was higher after the oral exposure duration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00064-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows that, in general, these effects were visible directly after the infusion, but that they only persisted for the treatments with a high energy GL. In other words, the effect of oral exposure duration on hunger and fullness is only short lived (&#x0003c;30 min) unless it is accompanied by a high energy dense gastric load. This finding is in line with our other study in which we investigated the effects of different volumes of a low caloric (100 kcal) gastric load [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] on appetite ratings; in this study the effects of a short or long oral sensory exposure on satiety were also short lived and disappeared after 30 min. In the other study [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we also saw that oral exposure duration only had a small effect, which was very short lived, and that the effect of energy content persisted up to 90 min. These findings suggest that the effect of oral exposure duration is only important during and shortly after the meal and that later in time, gastric factors are more important.</p><p>The absence of a large effect of oral exposure on energy intake might be due to methodological limitations of our study. Although we have a very well controlled design, one might argue whether knowledge of the subjects might have influenced the results. We told them that the study was about a possible effect of chewing in combination with wearing a nasogastric tube on appetite. Although the subjects did not know the content of the gastric loads nor did they know that their food intake was measured, they were filling out appetite questionnaires and they knew that there was a difference in oral exposure duration. It has been shown that knowledge and merely thinking of food can already have an impact on certain physiological responses, such as gastro-intestinal motility, gastric secretion, and appetite measures [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The study of Cassady [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] illustrates this very well; subjects that were told that a liquid would become solid in their stomach showed slower gastric emptying rates and lower oro-cecal transit times, as well as higher satiety responses and lower test meal intake, compared to conditions in which they were told that the liquid remained liquid in their stomach . Endocrine responses, that is insulin, GLP-1 and ghrelin, were not as much affected by this information, and might be more difficult to influence by cognition.</p><p>In the treatments with the high energy GLs the cumulative energy intake&#x02014;GLs plus test meal&#x02014;was very high: <italic>i.e.</italic>, 1392 kcal in treatment 1 min/700 kcal and 1287 kcal in treatment 8 min/700 kcal. This corresponds to approximately 40%&#x02013;50% of the daily energy needs of young healthy men. In the low energy treatments, this was much lower. Part of this large intake might be caused by the instruction that subjects had to stay seated for 30 min. In addition, subjects had no cues of the type or amount of food that was infused. It has also been shown previously by Wansink <italic>et al.</italic> that absence of visual cues of portion size can increase energy intake by 73% [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. So it is likely that our high energy infusion presumably led to passive overeating. None of the subjects showed high responses on the side effects, which shows that the subjects were still pleasantly satiated.</p><p>In the current study, we choose sponge cake for the current study as this is easy to dissolve in a gastric load and convenient to use with the MSF paradigm. This sponge cake was high in fat and carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-08-00064-t002">Table 2</xref>); <italic>i.e.</italic>, 50% of the energy was derived from fat and 44% from carbohydrates. It has been shown that the nutrient composition of the food which is used for MSF affects cephalic phase responses [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, MSF of bananas (high carbohydrate) led to lower pancreatic polypeptide responses than codfish (high protein) or walnuts (high fat) [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Next, Zhu showed that MSF of nuts, cheese, and cereals also led to differential responses in insulin and ghrelin responses [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It might therefore very well be that our findings are only limited to the effects of oro-sensory exposure to sponge cake, and would be different if other foods were used.</p><p>Food intake is the result of a complex cascade of different psychological and physiological procesess [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sensory and pre-absorptive signals affect satiation and satiety. Our study was not able to show an effect of oro-sensory duration on subsequent energy intake. This is not what we expected, considering the large number of studies that have shown that sensory cues are pre-absorptive signals that prepare the body for optimal digestion [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, we also acknowledge that our experiment investigated included a very high energy dense gastric filling of 140 kcal/100 g. We speculate that any possible differences in cephalic phase responses might have been overshadowed by the strong gastric effects of the high energy dense gastric load. It might very well be that there would be difference in food intake if there was no oro-sensory exposure at all, like in the studies of Spetter [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Cecil [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] where a clear effect of oro-sensory exposure was found. The difference between no exposure and exposure might be more effective than the difference between 1 and 8 min of oral exposure. Adding a &#x0201c;no-oral exposure&#x0201d; condition is highly recommended in new studies. In addition, it might be that oro-sensory exposure has a small (but biologically relevant) effect, which is more relevant if gastric responses are smaller, like in our previous study were we had an energy density of 10 kcal/100 g [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Although our experiment was very well controlled, the current paradigm is far from normal eating. During normal food consumption, the digestion of the food already starts in the oral cavity upon contact with saliva, <italic>i.e.</italic>, amylases and lipases, start to break down starches and fat respectively. Next, foods are being swallowed and enter the stomach in boli and not in a continuous flow. Moreover, in our experiment, subjects spat out the sponge cake and wore a nasogastric tube. Although we only selected subjects that tolerated the nasogastric tube, we cannot discard effects of the nasogastric tube on appetite or physiological responses. Therefore, generalization of our observations to normal food consumption should be done with caution.</p><p>To conclude, our study shows that a gastric infusion of 700 kcal increases satiety and lowers subsequent food intake by 35% compared to an iso-volumetric gastric infusion of 100 kcal. An eight-fold longer oro-sensory exposure by means of MFS did not have an additional on food intake. Although we could not show the importance of oro-sensory exposure in the current experiment, with these manipulations, we still do think that oro-sensory exposure is important in food intake regulation as this has been shown by numerous other researchers.</p><p>For future research, we suggest not only investigating the effects on physiological markers of cephalic phase responses, such as insulin, ghrelin, and pancreatic polypeptide, but also to investigate the effect of different sensory stimuli and nutrients. In addition, it would be very interesting to investigate not only the duration of oro-sensory exposure, but also to add a condition with no oro-sensory exposure, as previous studies with either normal or non-sensory exposure have shown very convincing results [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It might be that simply having oro-sensory exposure, regardless the duration, already elicits a number of cephalic phase responses.</p><p>In a recent review of Mc<bold>C</bold>rickerd and Forde, it is postulated that in future research we should go beyond liking with sensory science and that sensory properties of foods have an important role in optimizing the satiating and rewarding value of foods [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-08-00064" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Research in this direction will not only increase the fundamental understanding of oral stimulation in relation to satiety and food intake, but also the development of novel satiation foods which we think are essential in the scope of the current obesity epidemic and the high availability of fast eaten foods with only little sensory exposure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all participants, the nurses, the research assistants, and the dieticians for help in carrying out the study.
