It both provides adequate anesthesia as well as lower drug toxicity. The first published report on opioids for intrathecal anesthesia belongs to a Romanian surgeon, Racoviceanu-Pitesti, who presented his experience at Paris in 1901.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is more than a century now, and use of opioids intrathecally is extensive nowadays. It has been well documented that the combination of opiates and local anesthetics administered intrathecally has a synergistic analgesic effect.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The addition of opioids has a more extensive role in a scenario where minimization of adverse effects of subarachnoid block is needed as in elderly and patients with coexisting comorbid conditions. Neuraxial administration of opioids in conjunction with local anesthetics improves the quality of intraoperative analgesia and prolongs the duration of postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Bupivacaine is the most commonly used drug for subarachnoid block due to its lesser side effects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Various studies have shown that low-dose diluted bupivacaine with fentanyl can provide sufficient anesthesia with rapid recovery in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery or minor urological surgeries.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Fentanyl in combination with local anesthetics prolongs sensory anesthesia without prolonging recovery of motor function or time to micturition.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Butorphanol is a lipophilic opioid, has been used for epidural analgesia as well as intrathecal administration.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In a study by Singh <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that butorphanol is better than fentanyl-bupivacaine combination in respect to the duration of sensory blockade and requirement of rescue analgesia without any significant increase in adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Dose used was bupivacaine 12.5 mg in both groups in the study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In a similar study by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. concluded bupivacaine and butorphanol combination superior in terms of duration and analgesia in comparison to bupivacaine and fentanyl combination with dosing of bupivacaine 12.5 mg in both the groups.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The present study was conducted to decrease the overall dose of local anesthetics with the opioid combination for the urological procedure with respect to quality of anesthesia and recovery with patient's satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted in Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna after approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients after explaining the procedure. Sixty patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade I and II between 18 and 65 years of age of either sex, scheduled for the elective urological procedure was included in this study.</p><p>The preanesthetic check-up included a detailed medical and surgical history, and any previous anesthetic exposure with its outcome. General examination includes general condition, built, weight, pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and presence of cyanosis, anemia, clubbing, jaundice or edema. A careful thorough systemic examination was done to rule out any cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological or any other systemic illness. Routine biochemistry investigation included hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count, blood sugar, blood urea, and serum creatinine, was done in all patients. Echocardiogram (ECG) and X-ray chest was done in patients where indicated and in those over 40 years of age along with other relevant investigation.</p><p>Patients with hemorrhagic diathesis, peripheral neuropathy, psychiatric disorders, allergy to local anesthetics and patients on opioid therapy/analgesics were excluded from the study.</p><p>Standard monitoring was used, including noninvasive arterial blood pressure, ECG, heart rate (HR), and pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>The study population was randomly allocated by computer generated table into two groups; Group A: 5 mg 0.5% bupivacaine + 25 mcg fentanyl and Group B: 5 mg 0.5% bupivacaine + 25 mg butorphanol.</p><p>On arrival to operation theater, routine monitoring was started and baseline vital parameters of HR, systemic arterial pressure including systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, arterial SpO<sub>2</sub>, and ECG were recorded. An intravenous (IV) line was secured, and Ringer lactate was given at a rate of 6&#x02013;8 ml/kg. All patients received premedication of IV injection midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) and injection glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg). The solution was made to 2 ml by addition of normal saline to make the two groups comparable. Under all aseptic and antiseptic precautions lumbar puncture was performed in sitting position in L3&#x02013;L4 space by an anesthesiologist blinded to the study. The anesthesiologist performing block recorded baseline vitals, every 3 min for first 15 min, and then every 5 min intraoperative until patient discharged from post anaesthesia care unit (PACU).</p><p>Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure of &#x0003c;90 mm of Hg or a decrease of more than 30% from baseline mean arterial pressure, injection Mephentermine 6 mg IV in incremental dose if required. Bradycardia (HR &#x0003c; 60 bpm) was treated with IV atropine.</p><p>Sensory dermatome level was assessed by pinprick and recorded with respect to onset, level, duration, and recovery. Motor level was assessed by using modified bromage score in terms of onset, level, duration, and recovery. Injection fentanyl and injection propofol was used for rescue analgesia in inadequate block, regarded as failure.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Modified bromage scale</title><p>0: No paresis &#x02013; full movements of lower limbs</p><p>Partial paresis &#x02013; flex knees and ankles</p><p>2: Partial paresis &#x02013; flex ankles</p><p>3: Partial paresis &#x02013; flex toes only</p><p>4: Full paresis &#x02013; no movement.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Ramsay sedation score</title><p>
