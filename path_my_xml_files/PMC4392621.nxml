Most older adults prefer to grow old in the community within a familiar environment instead of moving to a nursing home. Preventive home visits based on multidimensional geriatric assessment can be one measure to support this preference and might additionally reduce health care costs, due to the avoidance of costly nursing home admissions. However, compared to single interventions in community-dwelling populations like fall prevention programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the effectiveness of preventive home visits remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In their systematic review Huss et al. concluded that multidimensional preventive home visits have the potential to reduce disability burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, effects on nursing home admissions were heterogeneous. Huss et al. explained these variations between studies by means of four major factors: intervention program characteristics, population characteristics, adherence to recommendations made by the program and the specific setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Besides the vast literature on the effectiveness, there are only a few studies on the cost-effectiveness of preventive home visits, using different outcome measures like active life-years gained or successful treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but neglecting the effects on health-related quality of life. Furthermore, to our knowledge no study has assessed resource use associated with informal care which - from a societal perspective &#x02013; is a major cost category in populations of older aduts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>To measure the impact of preventive home visits on health-related quality of life and to enable comparison with other (preventive) interventions for other conditions, cost-utility analyses can be conducted. Internationally, only one cost-utility analysis of preventive home visits in Sweden has been conducted so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, health-related quality of life was only measured post hoc.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis of preventive home visits from a societal perspective in Germany.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample</title><p>This study is part of a 18-month multi-centre, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial focusing on the effectiveness of preventive home visits in terms of reduction of nursing home admissions (primary endpoint) (Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT00644826). The methods have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In brief, study participants were recruited in two regions of Eastern Germany (Halle and Leipzig) via GP practices (in both regions), hospitals and the registration offices (only in Halle). Individuals were recruited between August 2007 and July 2008. Participants had to be older than 80&#x000a0;years, residents of Leipzig or Halle, and had to live at home or &#x02013; in case of hospital patients &#x02013; discharge to home had to be planned already. Individuals were excluded if they had insufficient German language skills, suffered from cognitive impairment, were not able to give informed consent or had a care level &#x0003e;1 (according to German long term care insurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). This means that patients were excluded if they needed assistance in more than two activities of basic nursing (e.g. personal hygiene, feeding, mobility) more than once a day. To be eligible for care level 1 the maximum amount of care must not exceed 3&#x000a0;hours a day.</p><p>Participants were randomised to intervention and control group using a balanced block-wise randomisation stratified by region. The sample size required to detect a reduction of nursing home admissions from 20% to 7% with 80% power at a significance level of 5% assuming a drop-out rate of 30% was calculated to be n&#x02009;=&#x02009;320 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In total n&#x02009;=&#x02009;336 adults older than 80&#x000a0;years gave informed consent to participate in the study and were screened for eligibility. 31 participants were not eligible. 305 older adults were randomised. N&#x02009;=&#x02009;150 received the intervention and n&#x02009;=&#x02009;155 received usual care. One further patient of the IG was excluded from the analysis ex post. This patient was not part of the target population of the intervention as he received 24&#x000a0;hour professional care at home and was unable to live independent in his or her own home. Finally, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;304 patients were part of this analysis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Furthermore social activities, housing conditions, economic conditions, polypharmacy and the cognitive status were determined.</p><p>A case conference was conducted by a multi-professional team (nursing scientist, psychologist, geronto-psychiatrist, nutritionist, social worker) within three weeks after the geriatric assessment to work out individualized recommendations based on an analysis of identified self-care deficits and risk factors for institutionalization.</p><p>After the case conference the participants of the IG were visited again for the second preventive home visit by the personnel who performed the first visit. The visitor reported to the participant on identified self-care deficits and risk factors and presented the results and recommendations of the case conference.</p><p>Four weeks after the second visit the third preventive home visit was arranged. In this visit, also called booster session, the adherence to the recommendations was evaluated. Furthermore, obstacles and facilitators of adherence were identified, the recommendations were reviewed, and further support was offered.

Responses in each dimension are divided into three ordinal levels coded: 1, no problems; 2, moderate problems; 3, extreme problems. Theoretically, 3<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;243 different health states can be defined by the EQ&#x02013;5D descriptive system.</p><p>The EQ&#x02013;5D also includes a visual analogue scale (EQ&#x02013;VAS), similar to a thermometer, ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) which records the respondent&#x02019;s self-rated valuation of health state (EQ&#x02013;VAS score).</p><p>The EQ-5D has been used successfully in the populations of older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, according to a particular set of societal preference values derived from surveys of the general population, an index score (EQ&#x02013;5D index) for each of the 243 EQ&#x02013;5D health states is available for various countries, with the best state (perfect health) and &#x02018;death&#x02019; being assigned values of one and zero, respectively. In the present study EQ&#x02013;5D index scores from the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] were used that were derived from a large general population sample (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,997).

The questionnaire was based on service use questionnaires used in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which were adapted to the purposes of the present study, and the German adaptation of the Resource Utilisation in Dementia (RUD) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to assess informal care. Informal care was assessed by two questions focussing on time spent on assistance in basic activities of daily living (e.g. toilet use, dressing, bathing) and in instrumental activities of daily living (e.g. cooking, support in financial issues, shopping, housekeeping).</p><p>To minimize recall bias resource utilisation was assessed retrospectively over different time periods. Formal and informal nursing care, outpatient physician services, pharmaceuticals, use of outpatient non-physician services (e.g. occupational therapy, physiotherapy, logopedics, sports therapy) medical supply and dentures as well as transportation to and from medical treatments were assessed over 3&#x000a0;months. Inpatient services were recorded during the last 12&#x000a0;months and costs for in-home modifications during the past 18&#x000a0;months. Depending on the service, quantity of use or duration was recorded (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To further account for recall bias, lists of possible services were presented (e.g., every outpatient service was addressed specifically in the questionnaire). Indirect costs due to productivity losses with respect to paid and unpaid work and reduced productivity were not included, since they are of minor importance in this older population.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The results of our analysis showed that this preventive home visit programme is unlikely to be cost-effective. The probability of cost-effectiveness increased with higher WTP but remained low (39% at a threshold of 250,000 EUR per QALY). There was only a 7% chance that the preventive home visit programme is dominant (i.e. less costly and more effective) as indicated by the probability of cost-effectiveness at a WTP of 0 EUR per QALY. The sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to the way (German EQ-5D index, EQ VAS) QALY were calculated. The probability of cost-effectiveness never exceeded a probability of 40%.</p><p>Our interpretation of the results is based on the results of the CEAC. The common approach is the use of the ICER to interpret results. Yet, this approach is prone to bias. The ICER does not control for baseline differences between intervention and control group. Although in our study differences between groups at baseline were not statistically significant, even small difference may have huge impact on the point estimate of the ICER since costs and, in particular, QALY were very similar in both groups during follow-up.</p><p>After adjustment for baseline differences in potential prognostic variables, total costs during follow-up tended to be higher in the IG than in the CG, with costs for informal care and outpatient physician services being significantly increased. It is possible that the preventive home visits program has induced the participants&#x02019; demand for physician services and care provided by relatives and friends since the intervention explicitly aimed at identifying care deficits and motivating participants to seek solutions. Despite increased service use, the number of QALY was only marginally higher in the IG, resulting in low probability for cost-effectiveness.</p><p>There is one other cost-effectiveness analysis of preventive home visits in the literature which also used QALY as measure of health effects. Sahlen et al. reported that preventive home visits were cost saving or cost-effective dependent on the time horizon of the analysis and on the inclusion or exclusion of future health care costs in life years gained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Two differences between our study and the study of Sahlen et al. should be considered. The first difference is the implementation of the intervention. Sahlen et al. performed two home visits per year over two years. In our study three visits in seven weeks were performed. It is possible that frequent visits over a longer time period are economically superior to a short term approach trying to give a stimulus for changes in behaviour and living environment. However, a study by Melis et al. showed that this is not necessarily the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This research group analysed a preventive home visit programme which performed a maximum of six visits over three months. The intervention was cost effective in terms of cost per successful treatment (prevented functional decline accompanied by improved mental well-being). The second difference is the age of the population and associated with this the choice of the effect measure. The sample of the study by Sahlen et al. had a mean age of 79.8&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] whereas the mean age in our sample was 84.8&#x000a0;years. We observed a decrease in quality of life between the baseline and the follow-up assessment in both groups which seems to be an age-related phenomenon. In the study by Sahlen et al. the HRQL measured with the EQ-5D index was higher (0.7) and assumed as stable over time.</p><p>There was only one statistically significant effect in our study. The number of deceased patients was lower in the IG than in the CG. In another analysis of their data, Sahlen et al. reported similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. They found that the risk of death decreased to 2.7% in the intervention group as compared to 4.8% in the control group. In our case the difference was larger (IG: 9% risk; CG: 18% risk) but this can be explained by the higher age of the population. Whether this effect is caused by the intervention should be evaluated by further research employing a longer time horizon and including more patients.</p><p>The main limiting factor of our study is the fact that there was only a non-significant reduction of nursing home admissions. Therefore the primary analysis failed to show effectiveness of the intervention. The reason for this is that a higher number of nursing home admissions was expected when planning the study. Eventually, a risk reduction of 45% was identified which was not statistically significant though. It is reasonable to assume that there is a chance to reach statistical significance for this relevant difference with a larger sample size. The added value of the present analysis is that we used a standard health economic measure of effectiveness (QALY) for which we found only a very small difference. By increasing the sample size to possibly reach statistical significance for the primary outcome the interpretation of the findings of our economic evaluation would probably not change substantially. The intervention would still be likely to have a pronounced and negative net-monetary benefit resulting from notable incremental costs and very small incremental QALY. This means that even if the intervention turned out to be effective based on the primary outcome it would not be likely to be cost-effective.</p><p>The following limitations should be considered in interpreting our findings. First of all, our sample may not be representative of the older population at high risk for admission to a nursing home in the two regions. We used a non-random sampling approach recruiting patients at baseline consecutively from GP practices, hospitals and the registration office in the two centres. However, 93% of people aged 70+ are regularly seen by a GP, which supports the representativeness of our population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. All consecutive patients were asked to participate in the study. However, some selection bias towards patients more willing and able to participate cannot be ruled out completely. Secondly, sample size might have been not sufficient enough to detect differences in outcomes. Sample size calculations were based on the number of prevented nursing home admissions, the primary outcome of the effectiveness study. Thirdly, we only observed our variables at baseline and one follow-up, reducing the ability to track more precisely health-related quality of life and costs over time. Therefore estimates in health status and costs more reflect the situation at 18&#x000a0;months rather than the health status and services used shortly after the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The evaluated preventive home visits program is unlikely to be cost-effective.
