Around half of HF patients have HFpEF. Although these patients have a better outcome than those with reduced EF, the morbidity and mortality associated with HFpEF is considerable.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>In contrast to systolic HF, evidence base for the treatment of HFpEF is weaker. The current management of patients with HFpEF is directed to symptomatic relief of congestion with diuretics and risk factor modification.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] According to the American College of Cardiology American Heart Association 2013 guidelines for the management of HF in adults, Class I recommendations for pharmacological treatment of HFpEF include control of systolic and diastolic hypertension (HTN) (level of evidence B) and use of diuretics for relief of volume overload symptoms (level of evidence C). Other recommendations include the use of beta-blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients having HTN with HFpEF, control of ventricular rate in patients with HFpEF and atrial fibrillation, and restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (Class IIa, level of evidence C).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] As most of the recommendations are based on expert opinion (level of evidence C), there is a need to generate data in this field.</p><p>Various therapies with established role in systolic HF have been tested in HFpEF. These include ARBs such as candesartan (the CHARM-PRESERVED trial),[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] irbesartan (the I-PRESERVED [Irbesartan in HFpEF Study]),[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and valsartan (the VALsartan in Diastolic Dysfunction study);[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] ACE inhibitors such as perindopril (Perindopril for Elderly People With Chronic HF trial);[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] digoxin (Digitalis Intervention Group-Preserved EF);[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function HF with an Aldosterone Antagonist[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Effect of Spironolactone on Diastolic Function and Exercise Capacity in Patients with HFpEF [ALDO-DHF])[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and eplerenone (Randomized Aldosterone Antagonism in HFpEF;[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and sildenafil (Effect of Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibition on Exercise Capacity and Clinical Status in HFpEF trial).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, none succeeded to provide survival benefit compared to placebo.</p><p>The hallmark of HFpEF is increased sympathetic activity and LVH.

Patients with HFPEF visiting the Cardiology Outpatient Department and HTN clinic of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India, were screened for inclusion in the study. They were included, if they were 18 years and above, had New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class II&#x02013;III of at least 4 weeks' duration, LVEF &#x02265;50% in a nondilated LV (LV end-diastolic volume &#x0003c; 97 ml/m<sup>2</sup> measured by echocardiography), echocardiographic evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction, and were willing to give written informed consent. They were excluded if: (1) Clinically unstable as defined by any change in diuretic dose in the month before enrollment, (2) significant valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy, (3) unstable angina or MI within past 4 weeks, (4) any previous LVEF below 40%, (5) any contraindication to metoprolol use, (6) patients already on beta blockers which cannot be withdrawn, (7) current participation (including prior 30 days) in any other therapeutic trial, and (8) any condition that, in the opinion of investigator, may prevent the participant from adhering to the trial protocol.</p><p>A single-blind placebo run in the period of 2 weeks was given for all eligible participants during which beta blockers were withdrawn, if a patient was receiving them but coexisting therapies were continued. After the run-in period, the participants were block randomized (constant block length of 4 throughout the study) in a 1:1 ratio to metoprolol succinate 25 mg or placebo. Randomization and allocation sequence generation were done by investigators not directly involved in the evaluation of outcomes. The randomization code was revealed to the investigators once recruitment, data collection, and analyses were complete. During the study, follow-up was done every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. A dose upward titration protocol with monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate (target blood pressure and heart rate as 120/80 mm Hg and 60 beats/min, respectively) was implemented for dose increments up to a maximum dose of 100 mg once daily. For patients not tolerating increased titration of drug, temporary reduction in dosage was done and decision on further escalation made on individual basis by the treating cardiologist. Clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic parameters were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Compliance was assessed by pill counting and questionnaire.</p><p>The primary outcome was proportion of patients showing improvement of &#x02265;1 in NYHA class at 12 weeks with metoprolol succinate compared to placebo. The secondary outcomes included alteration in exercise capacity using exercise stress testing (treadmill test using Bruce protocol), change in tissue Doppler indices of diastolic dysfunction, change in LV wall thickness and LV mass on echocardiography, change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and propeptide of procollagen type I (PICP) levels (estimated by ELISA), and alteration in quality of life (QoL) using SF-36 questionnaire. The safety end point included the incidence and type of adverse events and a number of study drug withdrawals. To avoid interobserver variability, all the echocardiographic parameters were evaluated by a single cardiologist who was blinded to study medication and the order of assessment.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee, and all the participants signed a written informed consent before enrollment to the study.

Although metoprolol was not significantly better than placebo with respect to improvement in functional NYHA class, its use led to a significant decline in LVESV. A favorable trend toward increase in exercise capacity was also observed in metoprolol group. The study also showed that more than 50% patients in both treatment arms showed improvement in functional NYHA class after 12 weeks. A significant increase in NT-proBNP levels and a trend toward reduction in serum procollagen propeptide levels was also seen in the metoprolol group. There also was a significant improvement in general health and role limitations due to emotional problems subscales of SF-36 score with metoprolol. There were no serious adverse events and treatment discontinuations among any study participant.</p><p>For the assessment of efficacy of a medicinal product in HF, clinical symptoms comprising alteration in NYHA class are recommended as a primary end point.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Hence, we used change in NYHA class as primary end point. There was a significant improvement in NYHA class in both the groups and thus between group differences were attenuated. This could be due to several reasons. The reporting of NYHA class is somewhat subjective. Although the subjectivity was taken care of by blinding, the fact remains that patients were receiving some treatment. Therefore, we suspect a large placebo effect complexed with the fact that patients in a clinical trial receive extra care, the well-known Hawthorne effect, which led to a situation where there was improvement in both the groups. Another possibility is that the favorable effect of beta blockers may take some time to peak later than 12 weeks and prolonging of trial can lead to greater effects.</p><p>We also assessed exercise capacity, another efficacy end point in HF trials.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The advantage of exercise testing over NYHA class is its nonsubjective nature and hence freedom from assessment bias. An improvement in exercise capacity was noted in both the groups and correlated with improvement in NYHA class. The reasons for lack of statistical significance in intergroup comparisons are similar as with NYHA class because both are symptom-based parameters.</p><p>Tissue Doppler imaging is the most sensitive and widely available echocardiographic technique for the assessment of LV diastolic function,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and it is used to measure the ratio of early mitral valve flow velocity (E) to early diastolic lengthening velocity (E'). In LV diastolic dysfunction, there is a continuous decline in tissue Doppler-derived intramyocardial velocities. As a consequence, E' decreases and the E/E' ratio continuously increases with advanced LV diastolic dysfunction. A small increase in E/E' ratio was observed in metoprolol group not significantly different from placebo arm. There was a significant decline in LVESV in metoprolol group accompanied by an increase in stroke volume. These findings are encouraging and merit further exploration in larger, longer duration trials.</p><p>NT-proBNP has been characterized as a surrogate marker of LV dysfunction, NYHA class, and prognosis.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In our study, rise in NT-proBNP levels in the metoprolol group contrary to improvements in other parameters was observed. This could partially be explained by wide variability in the levels of NT-proBNP, varied spectra of disease presentation and influence of other comorbidities. Furthermore, findings in a previous study[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] concluding the nonbeneficial role of NT-proBNP-guided therapy in HFPEF in contrast to HF with reduced EF, raise possible speculations on the confirmatory prognostic role of this biomarker in HFPEF per se circulating levels of the carboxy-terminal PICP, an index of collagen type I synthesis, correlate with the extent of myocardial fibrosis. A linear relationship between PICP levels and indices of diastolic function and filling pressure has been proposed.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In our study, there was a reduction in serum procollagen propeptide levels at 12 weeks as compared to the baseline levels in metoprolol group, possibly reflecting the partial reversal of myocardial fibrosis although statistical significance can be expected only with longer follow-up.</p><p>There are a few limitations in the present study. This is a pilot study conducted in a smaller population as against the calculated larger sample. The duration of follow-up was 12 weeks while a longer duration would have been more informative owing to the observed trends seen in exercise capacity and echocardiographic parameters in the metoprolol group. Hence, considering these results, we have prolonged the duration of follow-up to 6 months instead of 3 months in our further ongoing complete trial. Besides, the observed improvement in QoL scores in both the groups can be explained by the presence of a large placebo effect and needs to be tested in real life setting outside a clinical trial. Despite the limitations, the study provides important insights into the efficacy of metoprolol in HFpEF and provides background information for multicentric clinical trial using hard end points.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study demonstrated efficacy and safety of metoprolol succinate in HFpEF using soft end points.
