The athletes were randomly divided into four groups: kinesio taping (shoulder and scapular region) was applied to Kinesio Taping Group (KB), rigid taping (shoulder and scapular region) was applied to Rigid Taping Group (RB), placebo kinesio taping was applied to Placebo Taping Group (PB). Control group received no tape. Demographic data of overhead athletes, anthropometric characteristics, pain severity and injury background were evaluated before taping. Pectoralis minor shortness (Pectoralis Minor Index) and scapular dyskinesis (Scapular Dyskinesis Test) were evaluated before taping, immediately after (30-minutes) taping and after 48 hours of use within 12-24 hours. Control group was evaluated at the same periods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Before taping; demographic, anthropometric and sports-related characteristics were similar in groups and there was no statistically difference (p&#x0003e;0.05). It was determined that Pectoralis Minor Index (PMI) and scapular dyskinesis improved immediately after taping and after 48 hours of use in KB and RB (p&#x0003c;0.05). There were no significant differences after taping for PMI among groups (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Kinesio taping and rigid taping seems to have positive effects on scapular dyskinesis and pectoralis minor shortness in overhead athletes. Future studies on larger sample size are needed to verify the differences of the effects of these taping techniques between placebo or controls.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Overhead athletes</kwd><kwd>scapular dyskinesis</kwd><kwd>scapular taping</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
