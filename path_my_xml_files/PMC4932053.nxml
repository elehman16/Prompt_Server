peripheral vision fields on postural control. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects
consisted of 40 young adult volunteers (15 males, 25 females) who had been informed of the
study purpose and procedure. The subjects were randomly divided into four groups of
differing visual stimulus. Each group was given visual intervention in a standing position
for 3 minutes. Postural control was evaluated before and after visual intervention.
[Results] The results of the functional reach test and body sway test showed significant
differences among the four groups. [Conclusion] The two-way peripheral vision-field group
showed significantly more body sway after visual intervention than the other three groups.
This finding may suggest two-way peripheral vision field is a more effective visual
stimulus for training postural control and balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Central vision field</kwd><kwd>Peripheral vision field</kwd><kwd>Postural control</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Postural instability is associated with insufficient movement<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> as well as falling<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. To address these problems, it is necessary to improve postural
control. Postural control is a complex task based on the integration of visual, vestibular
and proprioceptive information<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Visual
information of afferent information plays an important role in postural control. This
contributes to anticipatory postural control, providing information about the difficulty of
an activity as well as the body position<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Although postural control can be influenced by any of the three sensory systems, the visual
system can reduce postural disturbance by as much as 50%<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Human vision can be divided into the central vision field (CVF) and peripheral vision field
(PVF)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. CVF refers to the central point
at which the pupils are directed, whereas PVF is a visual field formed outside of CVF.
Vection is the visually-induced illusion of self-motion while actually stationary, and it is
often triggered by movement of a large part of the visual field<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vection can be triggered by stimulation within the CVF and
PVF, both of which affect postural control. Although various training programs have been
conducted for postural control in the clinical field, few studies have investigated the
effects of postural control training using CVF and PVF stimulation. Therefore, this study
investigated the effects of CVF and PVF visual stimuli on postural control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 40 young adult volunteers (15 males, 25 females) who were informed
of the study purpose and procedure. The average age, height, weight and BMI of the subjects
were 21.53 &#x000b1; 2.34&#x02005;years, 166.25 &#x000b1; 7.30&#x02005;cm, 58.83 &#x000b1; 11.37&#x02005;kg, 21.21 &#x000b1; 3.33&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>,
respectively. The participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups (CVF1, CVF2,
PVF1, PVF2). The CVF1 and CVF2 groups were respectively presented with one-way and two-way
vertical straight patterns as CVF stimulus. The PVF1 and PVF2 groups were respectively
presented with one-way and two-way vertical straight patterns as PVF stimulus. This study
excluded individuals with diseases related to visual disorder or problems of postural
control, and those taking medicine for balance adjustment. The approval of the Ethics
Committee of Kaya University was obtained prior to beginning data collection.</p><p>In this study, visual intervention consisted of a vertical straight pattern, based on the
results of a previous study<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> in which the
vertical straight pattern was reported to be more effective for balance training than the
other patterns. Additionally, the present study employed one- and two-way patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Visual interventions using the central and peripheral vision field</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-1769-g001"/></fig>). For intervention consistency, the subjects were instructed to look at the central
point of an image<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The visual
intervention lasted 3 minutes.</p><p>To examine the effects of the visual intervention on postural control, the subjects
performed the one leg standing test (OLST), functional reach test (FRT) and body sway test
(BST) before and after the intervention. OLST was performed with closed eyes on the dominant
leg. The maximum duration of OLST was 30 seconds. After all subjects had one practice
attempt, FRT was performed to identify dynamic balance ability. Body sway was measured using
a BIORescue device (RM Ing&#x000e9;nierie, Rodez, France). Evaluations were performed before and
after the visual intervention.</p><p>ANOVA was conducted to examine the effect of visual stimulus, CVF and PVF, on postural
control. Tukey&#x02019;s multiple comparison test was used for post hoc analysis. SPSS (version 18.0
for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis, with a significance level
of &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences in the general characteristics among the four groups.

significant differences between CVF1 and CVF2, and CVF1 and PVF2. BST was significantly

play a key role in PVF<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study
reported that PVF plays a more dominant role in self-motion cognition than CVF<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the results of FRT showed
significant differences between CVF1 and CVF2, and between CVF1 and PVF2. This is
attributable to the influence of two-way visual stimulus. In a previous study<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, subjects only received one-way stimulus,
whereas the present study utilized one-way or two-way visual stimuli. In the present study,
FRT was more greatly influenced by the two-way stimulus than by the one-way visual
stimulus.</p><p>The BST results differed significantly between CVF1 and PVF1. This supports the findings of
previous studies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, which showed that PVF plays a dominant role in self-motion
cognition and has a greater influence than CVF on postural control.</p><p>Additionally, PVF2 was found to generate significantly more body sway after visual
intervention than the stimuli of the other groups. This finding may suggest that PVF with a
two-way pattern (PVF2) is a more effective visual stimulus for postural control and balance
training. Previous studies have reported that visual training may be effective for postural
and balance training of people with stroke<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, PVF with a two-way pattern
(PVF2) would be appropriate for neurological patients, as well as athletes who require
highly developed balance. The present study focused on identifying the immediate effects of
visual intervention. In future studies, it will be necessary to verify the long-term effects
of PVF with a two-way pattern (PVF2) on the postural control of neurological patients and
athletes.</p><p>In Korea, many neurological rehabilitation environments include the use of mirrors.
However, PVF stimulus via surrounding mirrors can frustrate attempts to correct patients&#x02019;
balance problems. Future research is necessary to examine the effects of using mirrors in
postural control programs to correct the balance problems of neurological patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Isaacs</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Clinical and laboratory studies of falls in old people.
