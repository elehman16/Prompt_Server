The hemodynamic consequences of sepsis are complex and several pathophysiological characteristics serve as rationale for fluid administration including dehydration, increased vascular permeability leading to decreased intravascular fluid volume [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and decreased vascular tone [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, fluid administration also has potential adverse effects including increasing tissue edema [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and electrolyte derangements [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155767.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The optimal volume of fluid and indications for fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis are not established. Fluid resuscitation guided by central venous pressure in the first six hours of septic shock was a part of the protocol in the landmark trial of Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) in sepsis by Rivers et al that showed significantly increased survival with EGDT [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since then, three large-scale multicentre trials have reported no benefit of EGDT vs. standard care [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but the use of resources was increased with EGDT [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Beyond the first six hours the international guidelines for fluid resuscitation are vague and ungraded due to lack of evidence; the 2012 recommendation for continued fluid therapy from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign states: &#x0201c;Fluid challenge technique be applied wherein fluid administration is continued as long as there is hemodynamic improvement either based on dynamic (e.g. change in pulse pressure, stroke volume variation) or static (e.g. arterial pressure, heart rate) variables&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The lack of firm evidence and vague recommendations may infer differences in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hospital characteristics adjusted for patient baseline characteristics were associated with differences in fluid resuscitation volumes in a multicentre randomised clinical trial in patients with severe sepsis needing fluid resuscitation. Furthermore, we aimed to describe patient baseline characteristics&#x02019; association with fluid resuscitation volumes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective analysis of data from the Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock (6S) trial. In the 6S trial adult patients with severe sepsis and need of fluid resuscitation were randomised to resuscitation with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.42 (Tetraspan, B Braun Medical AG, Melsungen, Germany) or Ringer&#x02019;s acetate (Sterofundin, B Braun Medical). Patients were randomised in 26 ICUs in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland between December 2009 and November 2011. All non-Danish hospitals were university hospitals and all ICUs were located at different hospitals. Exclusion criteria were: Age &#x0003c; 18 years, treatment with &#x0003e; 1000 ml of any synthetic colloid within the last 24 h prior to randomisation; any form of renal replacement therapy (RRT), severe hyperkalaemia (p-K &#x0003e; 6 mmol/l) within the last 6 h and acute burn injury &#x0003e; 10% of body surface area, previously randomised in the 6S trial, allergy towards HES or malic acid, liver or kidney transplantation during that hospitalization, intracranial bleeding within that hospitalization, enrolment into another ICU trial of drugs with potential action on circulation, renal function or coagulation, and withdrawal of active therapy. Appropriate approvals and written consent from patients and/or legal substitutes were obtained according to national laws. The 6S trial was approved by the Danish Committee on Health Research Ethics. Patient information in the 6S trial database was anonymized and de-identified. No additional patient data were obtained for the present study and an ethics approval for the present study was not required according to Danish law. The protocol and the outcomes have been published [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we included all patients randomised into the 6S trial who had available fluid data from 24 hours before randomisation until day 3 post-randomisation, i.e. patients that had not died, had not been discharged and had no missing daily fluid data until day 3 after randomisation. As this was a post hoc study, a convenience sample was used and a sample size calculation was not performed.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was fluid resuscitation volume and the secondary outcome measure was total fluid input. Fluid resuscitation volume was defined as all masked and open-label trial fluids given in the first 3 days after randomisation in the 6S trial combined with crystalloids (not including fluids with medication) and colloids given from 24 hours before randomisation (day 0). Open label trial fluid (Ringer&#x02019;s acetate) was administered in case of the maximum dose of 33 ml/kg/24h masked trial fluid was exceeded. If a patient was withdrawn from the trial intervention, then all crystalloids (not including fluids with medication) and colloids given from time of withdrawal to the end of day 3 after randomisation were regarded as fluid resuscitation. Reasons for withdrawal were described in the published protocol [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Fluid data were registered daily in the 6S trial database with differentiation between trial fluids, crystalloids, colloids, glucose solutions, fluids with medication, nutrition, and blood products. Total fluid input was defined as the sum of all fluids, including the fluid resuscitation volume.</p><p>We decided <italic>a priori</italic> to include the following patient baseline characteristics in the multivariate analyses: Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], age, weight, highest lactate +/- 2 hours from randomisation, surgery performed prior to randomisation, allocation group (HES or Ringer&#x02019;s acetate) and individual Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) subscores (cardiovascular, renal, liver, coagulation and respiratory) [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The CNS SOFA subscore was not registered in the 6S trial and was not included in the present study. The included hospital characteristics were Danish hospital (yes/no), university hospital (yes/no) and individual hospitals with at least 25 patients randomised in the 6S trial. The manuscript was prepared according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We performed analyses using a generalised linear model with fluid volumes as outcome. The following model builds were used:</p><p>Model 1. Hospital characteristics:</p><p>Fluid volumes ~ Danish hospital (yes/no) + University hospital (yes/no) + patient baseline characteristics (in order to perform adjustment by trial site, trial sites with less than 25 randomised patients were combined into one site).</p><p>Model 2. Individual trial site (only trial sites with at least 25 randomised patients were included):</p><p>Fluid volumes ~ Trial site (as a factor) + patient baseline characteristics</p><p>Model 3. Patient baseline characteristics:</p><p>Fluid volumes ~ Patient baseline characteristics + Trial site (as factor where trial sites with less than 25 randomised patients were combined into one site in order to perform adjustment).</p><p>The patterns of residuals were evaluated for each analysis to ensure adequate goodness of fit. If &#x0003e; 5% of baseline values were missing, multiple imputations of the missing values were performed, which has been reported to reduce risk of bias [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For each missing baseline value 10 imputations were performed where the missing value was imputed from SAPS II, age, weight, highest lactate, surgery performed prior to randomisation, allocation (HES or Ringer&#x02019;s acetate) and individual SOFA component subscores, Danish hospital, university hospital, mortality within 90 days of randomisation and any use of RRT within 90 days of randomization. Complete case analyses were also performed.</p><p>Fluids given in the 24 hours prior to randomisation might include fluids given in the general ward where fluid registration was not as meticulous as in the ICU. Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding fluids given prior to randomisation, and another sensitivity analysis including the patients who had been discharged or had died within the first 3 days of randomisation. To investigate the impact of patients who were withdrawn from the intervention during the first 3 days after randomisation, we performed sensitivity analyses excluding these patients. We chose <italic>a priori</italic> to include trial site as a fixed-effect variable. To investigate the impact of this choice, we performed mixed model analyses with trial site analysed as a random-effects variable.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Two-sided P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><p>Of the trial cohort of 798 patients, we included the 654 (82%) patients who had fluid volumes registered from day 0 to 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155767.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Geographical differences in choice of fluid type have previously been reported [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the findings of the present study indicate differences in clinical practice not explained by patient characteristics and support our hypothesis that the vague recommendations on continued fluid therapy in sepsis result in differences in fluid therapy.</p><p>Patient baseline characteristics were associated with differences in fluid resuscitation volume. The association with fluid resuscitation volume differed between SOFA subscores. Thus, the association between combined SOFA score and fluid resuscitation volume may depend on the constitution of the SOFA subscores. In line with this, we found the SAPS II not to be statistically significantly associated with increased fluid resuscitation volume in either the adjusted or the unadjusted analysis. The SOFA score and the SAPS II are frequently used in multivariate analyses when adjusting for &#x02018;illness severity&#x02019;, but our data indicate that results must be interpreted with caution considering fluid volumes in sepsis. We unexpectedly found patient weight not to be statistically significantly associated with fluid resuscitation volume in either the multivariate or the univariate analysis, and the observed point estimate of 15 ml/kg difference was lower than expected. Recommendations for the initial fluid resuscitation are based on the baseline weight of the patient [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and although the recommendations for continued fluid therapy do not explicitly mention weight, we had expected higher baseline weight to be associated with increased fluid resuscitation volume. From a physiological point of view it seems rational to increase fluid resuscitation volume with higher baseline weight due to the increased volume of distribution. Baseline weight, however, was associated with increased total fluid input.</p><p>Our finding that increased respiratory SOFA subscore was associated with less fluid resuscitation volume was in accordance with the results of the FACCT trial suggesting benefit of a conservative fluid strategy in patients with acute lung injury [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our findings are also consistent with recent studies that found low blood pressure and increasing vasopressor dose (determinants of the cardiovascular SOFA subscore) to be the most frequent indications for fluid bolus in severe sepsis [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155767.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; oliguria (one of the determinants of renal SOFA subscore) was also a frequently used indication for fluid bolus in both studies. Of note, in the sensitivity analysis excluding fluids given prior to randomisation the cardiovascular SOFA subscore at baseline was not independently associated with increased fluid resuscitation volumes. Although these indications for fluid administration are frequent, it is still not established whether patients with severe sepsis and septic shock will benefit from receiving additional fluids. Alternative actions include continued/increased vasopressors or permitting wider physiological derangements [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ability of treating clinicians to evaluate the balance between potential benefits and potential harms of fluid administration is impeded by the not yet fully understood hemodynamic consequences of giving fluids; a recent study found the relationship between cardiac output and mean arterial pressure in response to a fluid bolus to be unpredictable and inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0155767.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>There was a marked difference in the results between resuscitation fluid volume and total fluid input for Danish hospitals vs. non-Danish, where Danish hospitals had higher total fluid input, but no difference in fluid resuscitation volume. This result may indicate regional difference in use of other fluids (e.g. fluids with medication and nutrition) in addition to the differences in fluid resuscitation volumes already described. Excluding fluids given prior to randomisation noticeably changed the results for the cardiovascular SOFA subscore and surgery. These findings indicate that these patient baseline characteristics primarily affected the fluid resuscitation administered in the early phase of septic shock, whereas the strong association between higher lactate at baseline and increased fluid resuscitation volume persisted when excluding fluids given prior to randomisation.</p><p>The present study had several strengths. First, the 6S trial had relatively detailed daily registration of fluid input, which enabled us to differentiate between types of administered fluids. Fluids given with nutrition and medication constitute a large proportion of the fluid input during the first days of severe sepsis, and we were able to exclude these non-resuscitation fluids in our analyses. Second, the 6S trial randomised patients in different types of hospitals in four countries and thus increasing the external validity of our results. Third, the meticulous registration of fluid data resulted in only 0.4% of patients eligible for this study had missing fluid data.</p><p>There were also limitations. First, patients who had died or had been discharged were not included in the present analyses, which decrease the generalizability of the results. However, the sensitivity analysis including these patients did not change the results noticeably. Second, it is possible that hospitals participating in a randomised clinical trial of fluid therapy (in this case type of fluid) may have a different clinical practice as compared to non-participating hospitals in Scandinavia, thus introducing a potential selection bias. Third, all non-Danish hospitals were university hospitals which makes analyses of potential interaction unfeasible. Fourth, although the statistical assessments of model fits were adequate, there may be clinical considerations when interpreting the results. Especially the renal SOFA subscore should be interpreted with caution as extreme values (e.g. established anuria) might have led the clinicians to withhold further fluid resuscitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hospital characteristics adjusted for patient baseline values were associated with differences in the administered fluid resuscitation volumes within the first 3 days of severe sepsis. Increased cardiovascular and renal SOFA subscores and decreased respiratory SOFA subscore at baseline were associated with increased fluid resuscitation volumes. Our data indicate variations in clinical practice not explained by patient characteristics emphasizing the need for RCTs of fluid resuscitation volumes in patients with severe sepsis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155767.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Supplemental tables and analyses.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155767.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155767.s002"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Dataset with multiple imputations.</title><p>(SAS7BDAT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155767.s002.sas7bdat"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We warmly thank the 6S-trial investigators, the staff at participating ICUs and patients and relatives for their consent to participate in the 6S trial.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0155767.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Slutsky</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Sepsis and endothelial permeability</article-title>. <source>N Engl J Med</source>. <year>2010</year>;<volume>363</volume>(<issue>7</issue>):<fpage>689</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>91</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMcibr1007320">10.1056/NEJMcibr1007320</ext-link></comment>
