The prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment has been reported to be 20&#x02013;80&#x000a0;% in patients with different nationality and races according to different diagnostic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately 23&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% of patients with stroke will develop MCI or dementia within 4&#x000a0;years after the stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Management of post-stroke cognitive impairment has not been standardized. Previous clinical trials have shown that drugs that are usually used to treat Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, such as the cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine, and the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine, were associated with neurological benefits in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, because of uncertain effect of the drugs on global and daily function, none of the drugs has achieved regulatory approval for the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Nimodipine, which is a 1,4-dihydropyridine-derivative calcium channel blocker, can reduce the severity of arterial spasm-induced ischemic neurologic deficits when it is administered within 96&#x000a0;h of the onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recent clinical studies further support its beneficial effects on neurological outcomes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a systematic review of double-blinded randomized trials, nimodipine was found to have short-term benefit in terms of clinical global impression and cognitive function but not of activities of daily living in patients with VCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although the efficacy of nimodipine in dementia, such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and VCI, is still uncertain, it is currently commonly used for VCI and dementia in China and several continental European countries.</p><p>In addition to the pharmacological therapies, acupuncture has also been explored to treat VCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A recent systematic meta-analysis including 691 participants pooled from 12 randomized controlled trials has shown that combination therapy of acupuncture plus other conventional therapy improved mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score significantly in patients with vascular MCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, all the included clinical trials appear to have low quality in methodology and high risk of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Here, this study aims to conduct a randomized trial including 126 patients with post-stroke MCI to compare the efficacy of combination therapy of acupuncture plus nimodipine versus acupuncture alone and nimodipine alone. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scoring system was used to evaluate the patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This single center randomized controlled trial with 1:1:1 allocation was conducted in the First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from April 2013 to June 2014.

The patient allocation sequence was generated using a complete randomization procedure. The random number and the associated allocated treatment were kept in sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. The person that generated the randomization sequence was not a participating investigator and not involved in patient enrollment and assessment. In this trial, patients were not blinded for the treatment allocation. Physicians that prescribed the study medication and acupuncture therapy were not blinded for the treatment allocation. Both the trained assessor, who evaluated patient MoCA score, and the statistician, who conducted the data analysis, were blinded to the treatment allocation. The treatment allocation was exposed to the participating investigators after the completion of data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interventions</title><p>During the study, eligible patients were permitted to continue their existing medications, including drugs to inhibit platelet aggregation, lipid-lowering drugs, anti-hypertensive drugs, and hypoglycemic agents. Patients were required to document the medication use in details. Eligible patients were treated with one of the following 3 therapies: nimodipine tablet (Bayer healthcare company, H20003010, 30&#x000a0;mg per tablet) alone, acupuncture alone, and nimodipine&#x02009;+&#x02009;acupuncture. The dosage of the nimodipine therapy was one tablet per time and 3 times daily for 3&#x000a0;months. The dosage of acupuncture therapy was one 30-min acupuncture section daily 6&#x000a0;days per week from Monday to Saturday for 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Disposable sterile acupuncture needles (Brand name: Hua Tuo, size: 0.25 &#x000d7; 40&#x000a0;mm, Suzhou Medical instruments Co., Ltd, China) were used. A total of 12 acupoints were treated in the acupuncture therapy, including Baihui (DU20), Sishencong (EX-HN1), Sibai (ST2), Fengchi (GB20), Wangu (GB12), Tianzhu (BL10), Renzhong (DU26), Shenmen (HT7), Neiguan (PC6), Fenglong (ST40), Sanyinjiao (SP6), and Taichong (LR3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The skin areas of the acupoints were sterilized by a wipe with 75&#x000a0;% ethanol.</p><p>Distinct acupuncture needling technique was applied on different acupoints. Horizontal insertion with one Chinese cun (approximately 3.3&#x000a0;cm) in depth was applied on Baihui (DU20) and Sishencong (EX-HN1). Oblique insertion was used for the acupoint Sibai (ST2) and the needled was inserted 0.5 cun (approximately 1.65&#x000a0;cm) in depth. The needles in the 3 acupoints were twirled gently for 30&#x000a0;s. At the acupoints Fengchi (GB20), Wangu (GB12), and Tianzhu (BL10), vertical insertion with a 1 to 1.5 cun (3.3 to 4.95&#x000a0;cm) in depth was used and the needles were also twirled gently for 30&#x000a0;s. A needle was inserted obliquely with 0.3 to 0.5 cun in depth toward the nasal septum at Renzhong (DU26), and heavy bird-pecking needling was applied until tear formation was observed in patients&#x02019; eyes. Vertical insertion with a depth of 0.5 to 1 cun was applied at Neiguan (PC6), and the needle was twirled, lifted, and thrust gently for one minute. At Shenmen (HT7) and Sanyinjiao (SP6), needles were inserted vertically with a depth of 0.2&#x02013;0.5 cun and 0.5&#x02013;1.0 cun, respectively. The needles were twirled gently 30&#x000a0;s. Needles were inserted vertically with a depth of 1.0 to 1.5 cun at Fenglong (ST40) and Taichong (LR3), and the needles were twirled, lifted, and thrust gently for one minute.

Notable, compared with the monotherapies, the combination therapy was associated the best cognitive improvement, suggesting that nimodipine and acupuncture may result in additive neurological benefit in patients with post-cerebral infarction MCI.</p><p>These findings are consistent with the results from previous trials assessing the therapeutic value of acupuncture in cognitive impairment. Our previous clinical trial showed that MoCA score improvement after 3-month combination therapy of nimodipine plus acupuncture was 1.88 folds of that after nimodipine monotherapy group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, this current study found that the MoCA score improvement in the combination therapy group was 1.66 folds of that in the nimodipine monotherapy group at the end of the treatment and further increased to 1.77 folds at post-treatment 3-month follow-up. Different types of acupuncture, such as electroacupuncture and body acupuncture, different types of conventional therapy, including nimodipine, donepezil, and cognitive function training, and various efficacy evaluation system, such as MoCA, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Modified Barthel Index, and Wechsler Memory Scale have been used in clinical trials to compare the efficacy of combination of acupuncture plus conventional therapy versus conventional therapy alone in patients with vascular MCI. Cao et al. conducted a meta-analysis on 12 randomized controlled trials and found that combination therapy consistently showed superior efficacy on cognitive improvement to conventional therapies regardless of the types of acupuncture therapy, conventional therapy, and efficacy evaluation system that were used in the trials although most of the included studies suffered poor quality in methodology and high risk of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This conclusion is further supported by a more recent meta-analysis that compared the efficacy of combination of acupuncture plus conventional therapy versus conventional therapy alone in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In this current study, the improvement in MoCA score after acupuncture monotherapy was higher than that after nimodipine monotherapy although the difference was not statistically significant. However, significantly higher proportion of patients achieved &#x02265;12&#x000a0;% increase in MoCA score after acupuncture monotherapy than after nimodipine monotherapy. These findings suggest that acupuncture may be more effective than nimodipine in patients with post-cerebral infarction MCI. Similarly, previous studies have demonstrated that both electroacupuncture and body acupuncture monotherapy improved MMSE score or MoCA score at significantly higher extent than nimodipine alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The molecular and cellular mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of acupuncture on neurological outcome has been investigated in animal models. Lee et al. used scopolamine to induce cognitive impairment in rats and found that acupuncture stimulation at Baihui (DU20) acupoint improved rat memory significantly and restored the mRNA expression of molecules that are involved in memory function in hippocampus such as cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Similarly, Li et al. also found that acupuncture increased the expression of CREB and phosphorylated CREB and improved memory function in rats with vascular dementia induced by homologous blood clot emboli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, acupuncture has been shown to significantly increase the number of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area of rats with vascular dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that acupuncture activated neurons in cognitive-related cortical area in patients with MCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These preclinical and clinical studies indicate that acupuncture may improve cognitive function by activating neurons, reversing brain damage-associated alteration of molecules, such as the CREB pathway, and increasing the number of neurons in hippocampus.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. Only MoCA scale was used to assess the cognitive function in this current study. Although compared with comprehensive neuropsychological battery, MoCA is short and has good sensitive and specificity to MCI, additional evaluation test such as Addenbrooke&#x02019;s Cognitive Examination&#x02013;Revised would improve the evaluation accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The duration of acupuncture therapy and follow-up time in this current study was only 3&#x000a0;months, respectively. Long-term effect of acupuncture on vascular MCI remains unknown. Moreover, patients in the acupuncture alone and the combination therapy groups were significantly older than patients in the nimodipine alone group. This non-uniform age distribution may be associated with the small sample size and single center nature of this current study. Thus, multi-center large-scale studies with better randomization scheme and comprehensive efficacy evaluation method are required to further verify the conclusion. Furthermore, the improvements across the therapies in the current study could be partially attributable to a spontaneous recovery. A placebo control group, in which patients received no treatments, would be necessary to investigate the spontaneous recovery. However, because the participating patients were likely in a critical therapeutic window (0.5 to 6&#x000a0;months post-infarction) for effective interventions to attenuate the MCI and the potential risk of a deterioration of the MCI if left untreated may be high, inclusion of a placebo control group in the current prospective randomized controlled trial may highly likely be disapproved by the Institutional Review Board. In addition, even if a spontaneous recovery existed, it would theoretically affect the three patient group equally because of the randomized design in the current study. Thus, we did not include such placebo control. Certainly, the current study cannot exclude the possibility that some patients with post-cerebral infarction MCI may recover spontaneously. Spontaneous recovery from post-stroke cognitive impairment has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Rasquin et al. followed up 118 patients with a first ever cerebral stroke for 2&#x000a0;years, and they found that 20.3&#x000a0;% of the patients had reversible MCI and most of the recovery occurred between one-month and 6-month post-stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. They also discovered that higher baseline MMSE scores, which was determined at post-stroke one month, and female sex were independent predictors of the recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this current study suggest that acupuncture may be used as an additional therapy to conventional pharmacological treatment to further improve the clinical outcomes of patients with post-cerebral infarction MCI. Long-term and large scaled studies with more comprehensive efficacy evaluation system are still required to further verify the conclusion.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12906_2016_1337_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>MoCA test in Chinese.
