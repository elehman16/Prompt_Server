These women set a total of 197 dietary goals and 65 exercise goals. In the first month, over 80&#x000a0;% of dietary goals that targeted grains, dairy and overall diet were achieved, but only 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% of goals about vegetables, and foods high in fat, sugar and/or salt were achieved.

Due to the increasing rates of maternal obesity and type two diabetes mellitus and the trend towards older maternal age, the prevalence of GDM is increasing worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>GDM is associated with a range of adverse health outcomes for both the mothers and their babies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) has been recommended as the primary therapeutic strategy for managing pregnancy hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Printed lifestyle intervention tools have been frequently used for providing interventions and facilitating behavioural modifications in women with GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, there are few reports about the usefulness of these strategies for women with pregnancy hyperglycaemia.</p><p>This descriptive study was nested within a multicentre, randomised controlled trial that commenced in 2008, investigating the effect of dietary and lifestyle advice for women with borderline gestational diabetes [defined as a positive 50&#x000a0;g oral glucose challenge test (OGCT) (1&#x000a0;h venous plasma glucose &#x02265;7.8&#x000a0;mmol/L) followed by a normal 75&#x000a0;g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (fasting venous plasma glucose &#x0003c;5.5&#x000a0;mmol/L and a 2&#x000a0;h glucose &#x0003c;7.8&#x000a0;mmol/L)] (the IDEAL Study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As outlined in the published study protocol, women between 24<sup>0</sup> and 34<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation with a singleton pregnancy, classified as having borderline GDM were eligible for the IDEAL Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Those in the Intervention Group had a lifestyle discussion with a dietitian as soon as they enrolled in the study and were given the pregnancy record booklets as part of the study intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Women in the Routine Care Group received standard antenatal care with no lifestyle discussion or pregnancy record booklet provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The present study aimed to assess women&#x02019;s use of pregnancy record booklets provided to assist their dietary and lifestyle changes; to describe the woman&#x02019;s diet and exercise goals set during the initial lifestyle discussion; and to describe goals achieved after 1&#x000a0;month.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and procedure</title><p>Women in the IDEAL study Intervention Group who received pregnancy record booklets during their initial lifestyle discussions with a dietitian, were invited to return their pregnancy record booklet after their babies were born. To facilitate booklet return via post, a reply paid envelope was attached to the pregnancy record booklet and women were made aware of it at the initial lifestyle discussion. Women were advised to bring their pregnancy record booklet when attending antenatal appointments and when admitted for childbirth. Women who returned and used their booklets at least once were included in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The pregnancy record booklet</title><p>The pregnancy record booklet was designed for women to record their existing diet and exercise patterns and to set diet and exercise goals for the coming month (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for sample pages), based on published recommendations and the best available evidence at that time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. During the initial lifestyle discussion, the woman&#x02019;s diet and exercise were reviewed and diet and exercise goals aiming for adequate nutrient intake and optimal glycaemic control were set for the next month. Factors including the woman&#x02019;s age, pre-pregnancy weight, activity level, current dietary intake and weight gain for the current and any previous pregnancies were considered when advising women about their diet and exercise goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Individualised dietary and lifestyle goals focused on the quantity and quality of food consumption. Diet quantity was prespecified in the pregnancy record booklet as daily intakes of food from the categories of bread/cereal (grains), vegetable, fruit, dairy, meat and protein-rich food and foods high in fat, sugar and/or salt. Diet quality included choosing low glycaemic index foods, low fat dairy, higher fibre food varieties, lean meat, and using unsaturated oils and limiting fats and oils. Women&#x02019;s exercise goals focused on the type, duration, frequency and intensity of the physical activity, which were tabulated in the pregnancy record booklet.</p><p>One month after the initial lifestyle discussion, by using the pregnancy record booklet, women reviewed their dietary and exercise habits, set and documented new goals for the next month. Women were requested to review and reset their diet and exercise goals each month during pregnancy. If women had any concerns and/or questions around their diet and exercise after the initial lifestyle discussion, they were encouraged to talk with their attending midwives or obstetricians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analysis</title><p>Information recorded in the woman&#x02019;s pregnancy booklet was entered into the study database. Dietary data about quantity and quality of food consumed were transcribed, coded and categorized into seven categories as prespecified in the pregnancy record booklet including bread/cereal (grains), vegetable, fruit, dairy, meat and protein rich food, foods high in fat, sugar and/or salt and overall dietary goal. Exercise data were transcribed and coded, and analysed thematically by systematic comparisons based on grounded theory methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

While women&#x02019;s daily intakes for meat and alternatives, and food from the extra food group category were more likely to be more than the recommendation, with most goals set to reduce daily intakes. Our findings were consist with the results from large observational studies, where Australian pregnant women reported lower consumption of all food groups, except for meat (and alternatives) and discretionary foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Only a small proportion of women in our study seemed able to set and achieve a goal to meet the dietary recommendations by increasing their grain intakes or decreasing meat intakes.</p><p>For exercise goals, women who were already active and aimed to maintain their existing exercise pattern were more likely to be successful. Other exercise goals proposed by women, including increasing walking, increasing recreational exercise, adjusting exercise intensity and improving level of fitness all had a relatively low achievement rate after 1&#x000a0;month.</p><p>Few studies have reported on the use of a printed lifestyle tool to assist women with pregnancy hyperglycaemia in making changes to their dietary and exercise habits. Our findings help to provide in-depth understanding of the use by women of a printed lifestyle tool, their ability to assess their current diet and exercise patterns and their willingness to set lifestyle goals. This information may help to design behavioural intervention tools in the future and providing tailored care for women needing such advice.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that women were invited, but not required, to return booklets, and only a minority of women did so; in addition, the majority of women (94.6&#x000a0;%) who returned their booklets were from two geographical areas (Adelaide, South Australia and Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), which may limit generalisability of the study findings. In our study, information from the pregnancy record booklet about women&#x02019;s diet and exercise changes was self-reported, so there may be differences between what women reported and what their diet and exercise patterns actually were. We were unable to assess whether goals achieved within the first month were sustained beyond this time. Longer term follow-up to assess the goals women set and whether able to be achieved over a longer period will be worth considering in any future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This descriptive study suggests that most dietary and exercise goals are achieved by women with borderline GDM who used a printed pregnancy record booklet. Women&#x02019;s dietary goals targeting grains, fruits, dairy foods and overall dietary pattern are more likely to be achieved while dietary goals for improving vegetable and foods high in fat, sugar and/or salt and those do not belong to any of the five main food groups were less often achieved. Maintaining women&#x02019;s existing active lifestyle is feasible during pregnancy although goals to increase physical activities are not as likely to be reached.</p><p>Providing a printed pregnancy record booklet may be beneficial in encouraging and assisting behavioural changes during pregnancy, although further assessment in different populations with longer term follow-up is warranted.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>Human research ethics approval was obtained from the Children, Youth and Women's Health Service (CYWHS) Human Research Ethics Committee (REC 1860/8/12) for the IDEAL Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].
