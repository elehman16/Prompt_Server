OFS therapy with a luteinizing hormone&#x02013;releasing hormone (LH&#x02013;RH) agonist, in combination with adjuvant tamoxifen or chemotherapy is widely used for postoperative premenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the optimal treatment duration of postoperative adjuvant endocrine therapy with an LH&#x02013;RH agonist alone or in combination with tamoxifen is still controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients have a relatively good prognosis, the risk of recurrence remains at 5&#x000a0;years or longer after surgery, suggesting the importance of long-term endocrine therapy for 5&#x000a0;years or longer for the treatment of patients at high risk for recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Leuprorelin acetate (leuprorelin), an LH&#x02013;RH agonist is commonly used for the treatment of patients with hormone-responsive prostate cancer and premenopausal breast cancer worldwide. It is available in 1- and 3-month depot formulations for both cancers, and a 6-month depot formulation for prostate cancer.</p><p>A 6-month depot formulation, TAP-144-SR (6M), was initially developed for prostate cancer in Japan and a phase II study was conducted in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve prostate cancer patients. The results showed that the optimal clinical dosage of TAP-144-SR (6M) in Japan is 22.5&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In parallel with the phase III study in prostate cancer, this phase III study was also conducted in Japan for the first time to assess the non-inferiority of TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5&#x000a0;mg to TAP-144-SR (3M) 11.25&#x000a0;mg regarding its suppressive effect on serum estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>), and to evaluate its efficacy and safety in postoperative, premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A phase III, randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparative study of TAP-144-SR (6M) to TAP-144-SR (3M) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of the 2 formulations and hormone levels in postoperative, premenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. Following a 4-week screening period, eligible patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive injection of either TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5&#x000a0;mg (6M group) or TAP-144-SR (3M) 11.25&#x000a0;mg (3M group) for 96&#x000a0;weeks using dynamic allocation with the number of positive axillary lymph nodes (0, 1&#x02013;3, &#x02265;4), tumor diameter (&#x02264;2.0, &#x0003e;2.0&#x000a0;cm), estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PgR) status (ER+/PgR+, ER+/PgR&#x02212;, ER&#x02212;/PgR+), age (at the time of consent; &#x02264;39, 40&#x02013;44, &#x02265;45&#x000a0;years), pre- and post-operative chemotherapy (presence, absence), and study site as factors. All patients in both groups concomitantly received oral tamoxifen citrate (20&#x000a0;mg daily) throughout the 96-week study period.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable laws and regulations, at 20 medical centers in Japan between April 2012 and December 2014. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all study participating sites. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment.

As for the primary endpoint, TAP-144-SR (6M) was non-inferior to TAP-144-SR (3M) for the effect to suppress the serum E<sub>2</sub> to the menopausal level from Week 4 through Week 48.</p><p>TAP-144-SR (1M) and TAP-144-SR (3M) were effective to suppress the serum E<sub>2</sub> level to a menopausal level in premenopausal breast cancer patients at the same dose at which suppression of serum testosterone to the castrate level was achieved in prostate cancer patients in clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the phase III study was conducted at the injection dose of TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5&#x000a0;mg, which was determined in the phase II study for Japanese treatment-na&#x000ef;ve prostate cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The results showed that the injection dose of TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5&#x000a0;mg, which was successfully used to suppress serum testosterone to the castrate level in prostate cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], was also effective in premenopausal breast cancer patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In addition, TAP-144-SR (6M) was as effective as TAP-144-SR (3M) to suppress the serum LH and FSH levels from Week 4 through Week 96 in these patients. All patients also achieved amenorrhea from Week 8, except 1 patient in the 6M group who experienced menses at Week 8. It was therefore suggested that ovarian function was substantially suppressed by treatment with TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5&#x000a0;mg every 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>In this study, there were no significant differences in the DFS and DDFS at Week 96 between the groups. There are several reports that more than 3 or 4&#x000a0;years after surgery, the risk of recurrence is higher in ER-positive patients than ER-negative patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which may indicate that the risk of recurrence must be reduced by postoperative adjuvant hormone or chemotherapy for a longer period after surgery in ER-positive patients. At the St Gallen International Expert Consensus meetings, both postoperative tamoxifen and tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression for 5&#x000a0;years were considered acceptable as the standard treatment for premenopausal patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the results of the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT) showed that 5-year treatment with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression might provide a benefit for DFS in high-risk patients younger than 35&#x000a0;years who have remained premenopausal after adjuvant chemotherapy, compared to tamoxifen alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, long-term administration of an LH&#x02013;RH agonist is a possibility in high risk premenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive breast cancer.</p><p>In the PK analysis, TAP-144-SR (6M) showed a double-peak of TAP-144, similar to the results in the PK analysis obtained in previous Japanese clinical trials in prostate cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which demonstrated that the clinically sufficient drug concentration to suppress ovarian function was maintained throughout a period of 24&#x000a0;weeks with a single injection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The serum TAP-144 concentration profile after the initial administration of TAP-144-SR (6M) was similar to that after its second administration.</p><p>As for safety, there were no significant differences in the safety profiles and tolerability between the groups, regarding the incidence, type and severity of AEs. The most common drug-related AEs included menopausal symptoms such as hot flush, headache and arthralgia, and injection site reactions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). A series of injection site reactions were reported in about 60&#x000a0;% of patients in each group with no significant between-group differences in the incidence and severity. All of these events were &#x02264;Grade 2 in severity, and no cases led to discontinuation due to injection site reactions.</p><p>During the study period, 3 serious drug-related AEs were reported: interstitial lung disease in 1 patient in each treatment group and anal fistula in 1 patient in the 6M group. Both patients with interstitial lung disease had postoperative radiation and adjuvant endocrine therapy in the same period. It is known that pulmonary fibrosis frequently occurs following radiation therapy, and that tamoxifen may cause the development of lung fibrosis by inducing transforming growth factor-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>. It was also reported that tamoxifen treatment during post-mastectomy radiation in breast cancer patients significantly increased the risk for the development of lung fibrosis along with other prognostic factors like age and menopausal status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Since the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease is still unclear, further research is necessary to evaluate whether the concomitant implementation of radiation and adjuvant TAP-144 plus tamoxifen therapy is associated with interstitial lung disease.</p><p>As for the ECG data, there was not a tendency of QTcF interval prolongation around the time of <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>, and the mean change in QTcF intervals from Week 4 through Week 96 was approximately 10&#x000a0;ms in each treatment group. It is considered that this QTcF prolongation may not be primarily due to the pharmacological effect of TAP-144, but be secondary to the suppression of ovarian E<sub>2</sub> production. A study of the effects of sex hormones on QTcF interval prolongation suggests that estrogen might be a risk factor for drug-induced torsades de pointes. Although E<sub>2</sub> may influence clinically relevant QT interval prolongation, the pathogenesis is still not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Although BMD tended to gradually decline over time in both treatment groups, the changes in BMD in TAP-144-SR (6M) were similar to those of the results of our previous clinical study in TAP-144-SR (3M) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is well recognized that serum E<sub>2</sub> level suppression with an LH&#x02013;RH agonist can cause BMD reduction, which can be prevented or mitigated with the concomitant use of anti-osteoporosis drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In this phase III study, the non-inferiority of TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5&#x000a0;mg to TAP-144-SR (3M) at 11.25&#x000a0;mg was confirmed in terms of the suppressive effect on serum E<sub>2</sub> to the menopausal level. No clinically significant other differences in efficacy or tolerability were observed between the treatment groups.</p><p>TAP-144-SR (6M) allows mitigation of the burden on patients and physicians by reducing the dose frequency of the treatment for premenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. In particular, young premenopausal patients who are busy with work and housework may derive great benefit from TAP-144-SR (6M).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all the patients, investigators, and clinical research coordinators who participated in this study.
