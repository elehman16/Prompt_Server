capacity and coronary risk factors (CRFs) of patients with acute myocardial infarction
(AMI). [Methods] Patients who participated in an 8-week supervised, hospital-based phase
II and 6-month home-based phase III CET with monthly telephone and/or home visits were
defined as the exercise group (EG) (n=20), while those who did not receive phase II or
phase III CET were defined as the no-exercise group (NEG) (n=10). CRFs were evaluated pre-
and post-phase II and eight months after discharge. One and two-way repeated measures
ANOVA were used to perform intra- and inter-group comparisons. [Results] Thirty men with
AMI aged 49.3 &#x000b1; 8.3&#x02005;years were studied. EG increased their exercise capacity (METs) (6.8 &#x000b1;
1.6 vs.10.0 &#x000b1; 1.9) after phase II CET and was able to maintain it at 8-month follow-up.
Both groups had significantly fewer persons who kept on smoking compared to the first
examination. High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased from 38.1 &#x000b1; 11.0 to
43.7 &#x000b1; 8.7&#x02005;mg/dl at follow-up in EG while no significant difference was noted in NEG.
[Conclusion] After phase III CET subjects had maintained the therapeutic effects of
smoking cessation, and increasing exercise capacity obtained in phase II CET. HDL-C in EG
continued to improve during phase III CET.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Acute myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>Cardiac exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Coronary risk factors</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programs were established in the 1960s with the
primary objective of restoring exercise capacity after prolonged hospitalization for
myocardial infarction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. More recently,
however, the focus has shifted, with cardiac rehabilitation programs increasingly focusing
on the reduction of coronary risk factors (CRFs) and cardiac events.</p><p>Supervised, hospital-based Phase II cardiac exercise therapy (Phase II CET) can promote
comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation through a program based on increase of exercise
capacity and reduction of CRFs, and results in decreased morbidity of the patients.
Long-term Phase II CET tends to be a stronger predictor of increase of exercise capacity and
improvement of CRFs, with this type of regimen often recommended for acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Considering the inherent disadvantages of the higher cost
and extra inconvenience for patients that are associated with long-term Phase II CET, it
seems that, except where intensive care is required, Phase III cardiac exercise therapy
(Phase III CET), which includes lifestyle modification and leisure-time physical activity,
may offer a reasonable alternative therapy for increase of exercise capacity and improvement
of CRFs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Major epidemiological studies such as the Framingham Study have established the risk
relationship for CRFs and coronary artery disease (CAD). The effects of Phase III CET on
CRFs for subjects recovering from AMI have been less well investigated. The objective of
this research was to analyse the effects of Phase III CET on CRFs of male AMI patients aged
less than 65&#x02005;years, with supervision either through monthly home-visits and/or telephone
contact by a comparison of exercise and no-exercise groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The sample population was AMI patients who had been admitted to Tzu-Chi Medical Center.
During hospitalization, patients and their families received education about the meaning of
reducing CRFs, precautions for preventing recurrence of infarction in daily life, possible
problems after being discharged, and the importance of long-term follow-up and
back-to-hospital evaluation. Furthermore, all of them were followed by questionnaire
concerning the status of home-based exercise and quitting smoking during phase II and phase
III. This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Tzu Chi Medical
Center, and written informed consent was received from each subject.</p><p>Patients were divided into exercise and no-exercise groups. Exercise group (EG) patients
agreed to participate in an exercise therapy program designed specifically for each patient
by the same experienced physical therapist after being discharged from hospital. This
program consisted of eight weeks of Phase II CET, and six months of Phase III CET, made up
of leisure-time physical activity at least three times per week lasting more than 30 minutes
per session. Patients who were unable to maintain leisure-time physical activities, such as
those diagnosed as peripheral vascular disease, were excluded from the EG. The inclusion
criterion for the no-exercise group (NEG) was no regular aerobic exercise (comparable to
Phase II or III CET) for more than eight months after discharge from hospital due to
unwillingness or injuries.</p><p>Phase II CET began 19 &#x000b1; 9 days after AMI, and continued for eight weeks at a frequency of
two times per week. Phase II CET consisted of three stages: 1) warm-up, performed using ten
minutes of calisthenics (gentle stretching) and aerobic exercise; 2) the main exercise
utilizing a treadmill, with the exercise intensity individually prescribed on the basis of
baseline, graded treadmill exercise test results, which was gradually increased to a goal of
60 to 79% of the predicted age-adjusted maximum heart rate (MHR) and maintained for 20
minutes at a level below that which caused symptomatic or silent ischemia; and 3) cool-down,
consisting of five minutes of calisthenics.</p><p>For Phase III CET, patients were asked to continue leisure-time physical activities by
themselves, with an exercise formula prescribed according to the results of the second of
the exercise tests, performed at the end of Phase II CET. With an over-riding emphasis on
safety, exercise familiar to each individual was chosen for Phase III CET. All EG patients
were telephoned and/or visited at home by the same investigator each month to provide
relevant information and personal support<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. For patients with regular medication, 79% or below the
symptom-limited maximum exercise capacity was deemed the appropriate maximum exercise
intensity to enhance exercise adherence and safety<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Patient safety was the primary consideration, with observation of the whole process of the
exercise test before testing. Further, therapy and testing took place on the same machine
making it easier to monitor HR, blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiograms (ECG) during the
training session.</p><p>During the phase II CET, the physical therapist shared the real-time HR information with
the patients as exercise proceeded, and trained them in self-monitoring in the second part
of the program. Phase III CET programs were designed specifically for each individual and
data were collected for six months. Data for duration of hospital stay, medication,
cigarette smoking, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), body mass index (BMI), and
fasting plasma serum levels for total cholesterol (T-Chol), triglyceride (TG), high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were
collected during hospitalization (first examination). Smoking habits, BMI and plasma serum
lipids were re-evaluated at the times of the second and third examinations (two and eight
months after discharge from hospital). Patient medication was re-evaluated at the third
examination.</p><p>Exercise tests were performed at the beginning and the end of Phase II CET, and during the
Phase III CET program at eight months after discharge from hospital for EG only. EG patients
performed an exercise test on a treadmill (Marquette MAX1, Milwaukee WI, USA), in accordance
with the Bruce protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Symptom-limited maximal exercise capacity, expressed in
metabolic equivants (METs), was obtained at the end of the exercise test. The Borg scale of
ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded at the same time. The ECG was monitored
continuously, with both HR and BP (Suntech 4240 BP monitor, Raleigh NC, USA) measured every
three minutes.</p><p>Criteria for terminating the exercise test included ischemic signs and/or symptoms, or
inability to continue the exercise due to fatigue, ventricular arrhythmia (such as
ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation), ST segment depression (&#x02265;2&#x02005;mm) or elevation
(&#x02265;1&#x02005;mm), target HR exceeding 90% of the predicted age-adjusted maximal HR, and BP &#x0003e;220
mmHg or lower than that determined at the beginning of the test. In addition, in accordance
with the emphasis on minimization of patient risk, for the first exercise test, a maximum HR
below 130 bpm or 140 bpm was stipulated for patients aged over or less than 40&#x02005;years,
respectively.</p><p>The basic survey questionnaire of Hsieh et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> was adopted. Patient adherence to individualized training target
HRs, and effects of leisure-time physical activities on exercise capacity and smoking status
were evaluated using these items.</p><p>Coronary stenosis was defined as greater than 50% from coronary angiography. The left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated from the left ventriculogram which was
obtained using echocardiography (Hewlett Packard, Sonos 5500, USA).</p><p>As not all of the parameters were normally distributed, non-parametric analysis was used
for comparison. Inter-group differences were assessed using the chi-squared and Mann-Whitney
U tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Intra-group differences in
pre- and post-intervention measures of all variables were determined using the General
Linear Model &#x02212; one way repeated measure ANOVA and the covariance (BMI) of two way repeated
measures ANOVA with subsequent Least Significant Difference pairwise comparison. All
statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0 for Window (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA)
and statistical significance was accepted for values of p less than 0.05. Continuous values
were express as the mean &#x000b1; SD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 30 patients (mean age 49.3 &#x000b1; 8.3&#x02005;years; range 34 to 63), 20 EG and 10 NEG

Phase II CET were maintained during the Phase III CET, together with a significant
improvement in low serum HDL-C, a characteristic of Taiwanese coronary artery disease (CAD)
patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Low METs levels are associated with subsequent cardiac events during long-term
follow-up<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, it was
deemed appropriate to use the METs level as an index of exercise capacity in this study.
Borg&#x02019;s RPE scale is probably more of a psychological measure than a physiological one,
allowing an individual to concentrate more on how particular exercise intensity feels, while
still having some assurance that they are within the target HR range<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In comparison to the first exercise trial, METs of the
second and the third trials were significantly increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of
phase II CET and the importance of Phase III CET for the maintenance of exercise
capacity.</p><p>Phase II CET is playing an increasingly important role in the care of post-coronary-event
patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. AMI patients who
participate in phase II CET often report increased confidence for in-home physical training
and other types of leisure-time physical activities during phase III CET, with confidence
appearing to be an important factor in continuity of leisure-time physical activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patient compliance is a key factor in
most Phase III CET programs, the success of which may depend on patients&#x02019; attitudes toward
both exercise and illness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Compliance-improving behaviours strategies, such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and
education, may also offer potential for improving exercise adherence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, recent research suggests that the benefits of
Phase III CET are dependent on program participation and long-term adherence to exercise and
other cardiovascular disease risk-reducing behaviours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Leisure-time physical activity has long been recognized as an
independent measure, lowering the risk of CAD by 35 to 55%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, for Phase III CET, it can be argued that a familiar
form of exercise can make the patient feel more comfortable, allaying anxiety as the body&#x02019;s
response to that form of exercise is known through direct experience<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most recent guidelines for CAD patients suggest at least 30 minutes of
moderate-intensity, leisure-time physical activity, on most, and preferably all days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it seems reasonable to propose that
the adoption of moderately intense exercise, especially brisk walking, by the sedentary
majority of post-AMI patients would yield cardiovascular disease benefits comparable to
those achieved by more vigorous exercise. These findings support current federal guidelines
that endorse moderate exercise, which is safe, achievable, and feasible for the majority of
the population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, our
questionnaire results demonstrate that walking-related exercise types made up the major part
(60%) of Phase III CET activities of the EG.</p><p>Given the minimal supervision during Phase III CET, exercise safety was the primary
consideration of this study&#x02019;s design, with secondary emphasis on increasing and maintaining
exercise capacity and improving CRFs through therapeutic exercise. The high level of safety
demonstrated in this study was attributable to the strict standards employed in the medical
screening and assessment of patients, emphasis on thorough education and proper treatment,
careful and individualized exercise prescription, well-trained personnel, and regular
supervision through home-visits and/or telephone calls during the minimally supervised
stage. Further, as no serious cardiac events, such as recurrence of infarction or cardiac
arrest, occurred during Phase III CET for the EG patients in this study, it also seems
reasonable to suggest that Phase III CET may offer a safe and efficacious exercise modality
for post-AMI patients.</p><p>The inverse relationship of serum HDL-C and CAD prevalence was first identified in the
1950s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Associations have been
demonstrated between serum HDL-C concentrations and gender, age, medication, cigarette
smoking, obesity, DM, and exercise type modality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Factors other than exercise that
positively affect serum HDL-C include cessation of cigarette smoking and weight reduction to
ideal body weight. Serum HDL-C levels approximately 5.7% lower have been demonstrated for
smokers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, with cessation associated
with a rebound to normal values<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The negative correlation between body weight and serum HDL-C has been found for pre- and
post-menopausal women and in men<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
pre-eminence of weight loss with increasing serum HDL levels has been emphasized by Wood et
al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, who proposed that the effect of
exercise therapy on serum HDL-C is mainly due to loss of body weight. In contrast, other
researchers have been unable to find any relationship between weight loss, during exercise
therapy and increased serum HDL-C, and thus hypothesize a separate and independent effect of
exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, BMI change
was not significant in either group during the experiment. Further, the increase and
maintenance of exercise capacity was not associated with changes in BMI in the EG.
Additionally, serum HDL-C increased significantly in the EG, but not in the NEG during phase
III CET, indicating that BMI may not have been a determining factor in serum HDL-C change in
this study.</p><p>Exercise therapy can be characterized by type, frequency and duration. Improving exercise
performance is still considered the best lifestyle recommendation for increasing serum
HDL-C. Further, it has been demonstrated that exercise therapy lowers the risk of CAD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most investigators attribute the apparent
protection afforded by serum HDL to its role in reserve cholesterol transport, which is
believed to remove cholesterol from developing plaque deposits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The increases in lipoprotein-lipase activities that have
been associated with long-term exercise therapy have attracted attention as potentially
effective, physiologically desirable, non-pharmacological ways of increasing serum
HDL-C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although acomparable rate of smoking cessation was demonstrated by NEG patients in the
present study, no significant evident change was noted in serum HDL-C. In the EG, serum
HDL-C did not change during Phase II CET, even when the sample was controlled for smoking
cessation, body weight, and training intensity. Possible explanations include insufficient
duration and/or exercise intensity during the Phase II CET stage. Several studies have
concluded that exercise of sufficient duration and adequate intensity does beneficially
influence the atherogenic risk as reflected in the serum lipid profile<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Mendoza et
al. suggested that significant improvement in serum HDL-C requires a longer CET period,
ranging from three to 12 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A previous study has demonstrated that moderate training intensities are adequate for
eliciting improvements in serum HDL-C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Prolonged exercise therapy periods (beyond three months) and increased total caloric
expenditure per session are likely to result in further improvements to the serum HDL-C
profile<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, other studies
have not found changes in HDL-C associated with variations in exercise intensity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the EG in this study, mean serum HDL-C
did not change during Phase II CET, however, it did increase significantly during Phase III
CET. It seems reasonable to propose that improvement in serum HDL-C levels after AMI may be
dependent on the continuity of Phase III CET. Therefore, the intervention of long-term
therapeutic exercise surely assisted the improvement of HDL-C.</p><p>Being the only medical center in Eastern Taiwan, patient travel distance was excessive for
some (up to 150&#x02005;km), which contributed to patient dropout. Furthermore, exercise therapy and
CRFs were followed for up to 8 months, which additionally contributed to dropout. For the
same reason regarding distance and time covered in this experiment, we were unable to
randomize group assignment at the beginning of the study.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that Phase III CET maintained the high percentage of smoking
abstinence and levels of cardiac exercise capacity achieved during the resource-intensive
Phase II CET program. Further, no cardiac events occurred and serum HDL-C levels increased,
suggesting that Phase III CET, a less-expensive and more&#x02013;convenient exercise regime, is
worth introducing to more patients. Given the small sample size, however, the efficacy and
ultimate risk associated with this minimally supervised exercise modality needs further
investigation to confirm the cost-benefit ratio and attendant risks.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Pashkow</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Issues in contemporary cardiac rehabilitation: a
