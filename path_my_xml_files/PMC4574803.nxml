Indeed, the CAC model is a standardized testing model widely accepted by the FDA, as well as the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for registration purposes.<xref rid="b31-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In this study, patients with a history of allergic conjunctivitis were enrolled based on a sufficiently severe response to a controlled CAC on two separate occasions. One advantage of CAC studies over environmental studies is that participants reliably come into contact with the allergen that triggers their allergic conjunctivitis, whereas in environmental studies this is not necessarily the case, and interpretation of results may therefore be confounded.<xref rid="b28-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Other advantages of the CAC model include individual titration of allergens to obtain a threshold dose for adequate reactivity and the highly standardized grading systems used.<xref rid="b28-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>As previously mentioned, the ocular symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis can affect the quality of life of patients.<xref rid="b5-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Olopatadine 0.77% fulfills the need for a treatment that provides full symptom relief over the duration of an entire 24-hour day. The present study has shown that olopatadine 0.77% is superior to its vehicle for the treatment of ocular itching at the onset of action (immediately after dosing), as well as having a lasting duration of action for 24 hours. Olopatadine 0.77% is also superior to its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of conjunctival and total redness at onset of action and for up to 24 hours. These results showed that the relief from ocular itching provided by olopatadine 0.77% was highly consistent, and was maintained over 24 hours. Furthermore, olopatadine 0.77% showed reduced chemosis and tearing compared with its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% at onset of action and for up to 24 hours. These findings are important, because allergen concentrations vary throughout the 24-hour day&#x02013;night cycle, peaking at different times depending on the allergen and local environmental conditions.</p><p>Patients with difficulty managing their allergic conjunctivitis symptoms with one dose of their antiallergy ocular drops and consequently having to use a second dose may benefit from the increased convenience of a once-daily olopatadine 0.77% dosing regimen. Furthermore, once-daily regimens have been shown to contribute significantly to patient compliance,<xref rid="b34-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> reducing the risk of missed doses and possibly improving treatment outcomes and symptom control.<xref rid="b35-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Based on the review of AEs and ocular safety parameters, no safety concerns were identified for olopatadine 0.77% after once daily dosing for 3 nonconsecutive days in adults with allergic conjunctivitis. Evidence from previous studies demonstrates that olopatadine 0.2% is well tolerated in subjects with a history of allergic conjunctivitis.<xref rid="b10-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b36-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Olopatadine 0.2% administered once daily for 6 weeks was also shown to be safe and well tolerated in children who were $3 years old.<xref rid="b18-opth-9-1703" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This study showed that the safety profile of olopatadine 0.77% is comparable with that of its vehicle, as well as olopatadine 0.2%. An additional study has been conducted to assess the safety of olopatadine 0.77%, which included pediatric and adolescent patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifer NCT01698814), and has shown that 6 weeks of daily treatment with olopatadine 0.77% reveals a safety profile comparable to its vehicle. The safety profile is also consistent with that of olopatadine 0.2%, as previously established.</p><p>As with all clinical trials, this study has some limitations. A drawback of the CAC model as implemented in this study was that neither the late-phase response nor quality-of-life outcomes were tested. Additional studies using a modified version of the CAC model could assess efficacy of treatment against a late-phase response. Also, slightly more patients reactive to seasonal allergens (ragweed, grass, and trees) than to perennial allergens (dust mite, cat dander, and dog dander) were observed in the olopatadine 0.77%-treatment group than the olopatadine 0.2% or vehicle groups. However, each randomized patient had to meet a positive bilateral CAC response at screening visits 1 and 2, as described in the &#x0201c;Patients and methods&#x0201d; section, in order to be eligible for the study. Therefore, regardless of the specific type of allergen, all randomized patients met the minimum itching and redness criteria and were randomized to study treatment at visit 3A only after all entry criteria were met. Therefore, this slight difference in distribution of seasonal and perennial allergens was not considered significant in affecting the outcome of the study.</p><p>In conclusion, olopatadine 0.77% is superior to both its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergen-mediated ocular itching and conjunctival redness. The relief from ocular itching provided by olopatadine 0.77% is maintained throughout a period of 24 hours, as assessed by the CAC model, supporting once-daily dosing of olopatadine 0.77% in the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. This study showed that the benefit&#x02013;risk profile for olopatadine 0.77% is superior to olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis-associated ocular itching when both are dosed once daily.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Alcon Research Ltd (Fort Worth, TX) participated in the design of the study, analysis of the data, and approval of the manuscript.
