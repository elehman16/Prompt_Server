However, many back pain sufferers do not adhere to their physiotherapist&#x02019;s recommendations. Poor patient adherence may decrease the effectiveness of advice and home-based rehabilitation exercises. According to self-determination theory, support from health care practitioners can promote patients&#x02019; autonomous motivation and greater long-term behavioral persistence (e.g., adherence to physiotherapists&#x02019; recommendations). The aim of this trial is to assess the effect of an intervention designed to increase physiotherapists&#x02019; autonomy-supportive communication on low back pain patients&#x02019; adherence to physical activity and exercise therapy recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study will be a single-blinded cluster randomized controlled trial. Outpatient physiotherapy centers (<italic>N</italic> =12) in Dublin, Ireland (population&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.25 million) will be randomly assigned using a computer-generated algorithm to either the experimental or control arm. Physiotherapists in the experimental arm (two hospitals and four primary care clinics) will attend eight hours of communication skills training. Training will include handouts, workbooks, video examples, role-play, and discussion designed to teach physiotherapists how to communicate in a manner that promotes autonomous patient motivation. Physiotherapists in the waitlist control arm (two hospitals and four primary care clinics) will not receive this training. Participants (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;292) with chronic low back pain will complete assessments at baseline, as well as 1&#x02009;week, 4&#x02009;weeks, 12&#x02009;weeks, and 24&#x02009;weeks after their first physiotherapy appointment. Primary outcomes will include adherence to physiotherapy recommendations, as well as low back pain, function, and well-being. Participants will be blinded to treatment allocation, as they will not be told if their physiotherapist has received the communication skills training.

A significant number of these patients develop chronic low back pain (CLBP), defined by persistent disabling pain in the lumbar spine, with or without radiation to the buttock and lower limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], for more than 12&#x02009;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition to pain complaints, CLBP is associated with reduced physical function, reduced social participation, increased symptoms of psychological distress, and poorer quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is also an increasingly costly condition, due to the expense of treatment and lost productivity. Accounting for 0.8 to 2.1% of gross domestic product in many western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], CLBP is estimated to be the second largest single cause of work absence in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As a result, the efficacy of treatments designed to alleviate CLBP has been the subject of much scientific attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Physical activity (PA) and exercise therapy (i.e., specific repetitive movements intended to reduce LBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] are among the accepted clinical rehabilitation guidelines and are recommended self-management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] for this condition. However, many LBP sufferers do not adhere to their physiotherapist&#x02019;s recommendations regarding PA and exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Poor patient adherence may decrease the effectiveness of PA advice and home-based rehabilitation exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, interventions that can increase patients&#x02019; adherence may also enhance treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Theory-based interventions are needed in the health domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], as they provide greater understanding of the process of change and may ultimately lead to more effective interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A recent Cochrane systematic review indicated that there was support for therapeutic interventions designed to increase adherence to treatments for musculoskeletal pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Indeed, the review found moderate sized effects on patients&#x02019; adherence. Unfortunately, only two of these interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] were based on a relevant behavior change theory that might explain the process of change resulting from the intervention. Therefore, the most effective methods to increase adherence and the active components of the majority of these interventions remain unclear. Recommendations from recent research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and the Medical Research Council [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] have reiterated the importance of (i) using theory and, where possible, empirical evidence to guide the development of interventions and (ii) investigating treatment fidelity and the process of change to allow researchers to provide effective advice for successful implementation into practice.</p><p>A theory-based intervention to improve adherence should aim to address factors that influence chronic low back pain patients&#x02019; rehabilitation behavior. Research indicates that these factors may include (i) the physiotherapist-patient relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], (ii) the delivery of advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and motivation for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Self-determination theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] may provide a useful framework for addressing these factors, thereby increasing treatment adherence, and improving patient outcomes.</p><sec><title>Self-determination theory</title><p>According to SDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], humans have basic psychological needs for autonomy (feeling fully volitional or free to engage in a behavior), perceived competence (feeling effective in one&#x02019;s actions), and relatedness (feeling safe and cared for in one&#x02019;s interpersonal relationships). When these needs are supported, patients&#x02019; participation in treatment will be more autonomous and less controlled. Autonomous motivation is characterized by perceptions of valued benefits and a willingness to participate. In contrast, controlled motivation in the healthcare domain typically involves patient engagement in treatment due to external pressure, coercion, or feelings of guilt. This distinction between autonomous and controlled motivation represents a continuum rather than a dichotomy (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for details), with more autonomously motivated behaviors leading to greater psychological well-being and long-term behavioral persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. </p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1 </label><caption><p>The Self-Determination Continuum of Motivation (with examples quotes to illustrate motives for following a physiotherapist&#x02019;s recommendations).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2474-13-104-1"/></fig><p>When the social context (i.e., interactions with other people) satisfies the three basic psychological needs, individuals are more likely to autonomously regulate their behaviors, and thus lasting behavior change is more likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In health-related domains, this suggests that healthcare practitioners&#x02019; communication behaviors can be enhanced to more fully support patients&#x02019; psychological needs and, thereby, autonomously motivate their health&#x02013;related behaviors. In this context, the concept of autonomy support represents an interpersonal climate in which the provider (e.g., physiotherapist) considers the perspective of the patient, provides relevant information and opportunities for choice, and encourages the individual to accept personal responsibility for health behaviors without judging or coercing the patient (see further examples in method section) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In contrast, a controlling health care climate involves disregarding patients&#x02019; views, pressuring patients, and making the decisions on the patients&#x02019; behalf without consultation. Unfortunately, research has indicated that when interacting with patients, physiotherapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and other healthcare practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] often adopt a controlling approach.</p><p>In line with the SDT-based model of health behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the relationship between the healthcare provider&#x02019;s autonomy support and the patient&#x02019;s behavior change via autonomous motivation and perceived competence has been supported in numerous health settings including smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and dental hygiene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Evidence from cohort studies in physiotherapy settings has supported the positive relationship between autonomy support and adherence outcomes, such as attendance at clinic-based rehabilitation settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and adherence to home-based exercise programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], However, no study has been conducted to test the effect of an intervention designed to enable physiotherapists to act in a more autonomy supportive manner during the therapeutic scenario. This type of intervention could increase CLBP patients&#x02019; autonomous motivation and competence leading to improved adherence to prescribed home-based treatment and improved LBP outcomes. A diagram presenting the proposed theoretical model of behavior change is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. </p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2 </label><caption><p>Self-Determination Theory Model of Behavior Change.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2474-13-104-2"/></fig><p>We conducted a pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] to establish if an SDT-based intervention designed to enhance physiotherapists&#x02019; communication skills had the capacity to influence the targeted variable (autonomy support) and produce change in the proposed mediators (perceived competence and autonomous motivation), as well as treatment adherence for CLBP patients attending physiotherapy. The findings suggested that the SDT-based training enhanced physiotherapists&#x02019; autonomy supportive communication skills and provided initial evidence that the intervention improved patients&#x02019; perceived competence, autonomous motivation, and treatment adherence. However, the study was limited by the small sample and a number of study design factors, such as unexpected between group differences in the duration of patients&#x02019; LBP and the lack of true baseline measures. Nonetheless, these preliminary results were positive and provided estimates of moderate sized effects. The proposed study is an extension of the pilot study and addresses the above limitations.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the effect of an intervention designed to increase physiotherapists&#x02019; autonomy-supportive communication on CLBP patient&#x02019;s adherence to physical activity and LBP exercise recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypotheses</title><p>1. Patients in the experimental arm will report significantly greater weekly physical activity (PA) participation compared with their pre-treatment PA levels and compared with patients in the control arm. They will also report greater self-rated adherence to physiotherapists&#x02019; recommendations compared with the patients in the control arm. Compared with physiotherapists in the control arm, physiotherapists in the experimental arm will rate their patients as more adherent during physiotherapy sessions.</p><p>2. Patients in the experimental arm will report significantly decreased pain, increased function, greater low back pain (LBP)-related well-being and greater perceived global improvement after treatment compared with their pre-intervention scores, and compared to patients in the control arm.</p><p>3. Compared with their pre-treatment scores and compared with patients in the control arm, patients in the experimental arm will report significantly lower fear-avoidance beliefs and controlled motivation, as well as significantly greater competence and autonomous motivation.</p><p>4. Patients in the experimental arm will rate their physiotherapists as significantly more autonomy supportive than patients whose physiotherapists were assigned to the control arm. As a result of heightened self-awareness that comes from participation in communication skills training, physiotherapists assigned to the experimental arm will rate themselves as less autonomy supportive than physiotherapists assigned to the control arm. Independent raters of audio recordings of patient-physiotherapist interactions will rate experimental arm physiotherapists as more autonomy supportive than physiotherapists assigned to the control arm. Physiotherapists in the experimental arm will employ the specific communication strategies taught in the workshops with higher quality than physiotherapists from the control arm (who will not attend these workshops).</p><p>5. The influence of the experimental manipulation on outcomes (pain, function, and well being) will be mediated by patients&#x02019; rating of the physiotherapist&#x02019;s autonomy support, perceived competence, autonomous motivation, fear-avoidance beliefs and adherence (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design overview</title><p>This study will be a single-blinded cluster RCT.

A research investigator (CL) who holds a PhD in Sport and Exercise Psychology will deliver these training workshops based on self-determination theory principles, implemented via the &#x02018;5A&#x02019; framework (ask, advise, agree, assist, arrange) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Within each of the &#x02018;A&#x02019;s of the 5A framework (as implemented in CONNECT), there are a number of strategies that have been specifically adapted to suit a physiotherapy session for patients with CLBP. A description of each strategy and the manner in which it maps onto constructs from SDT are provided in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Briefly, the &#x02018;Ask&#x02019; phase largely involves strategies designed to promote patients&#x02019; sense of relatedness. During the &#x02018;Advise&#x02019; phase physiotherapists are taught to build patients&#x02019; sense of autonomy, while ensuring they understand the nature of their LBP and treatment options that are most likely to be effective (enhancing perceived competence). In the &#x02018;Agree&#x02019; stage, physiotherapists learn to collaboratively set &#x02018;SMART&#x02019; goals that will enhance patient autonomy and help them believe that these goals are achievable (enhancing competence). In the &#x02018;Assist&#x02019; phase, competence and autonomy are fostered by helping the patient to identify likely obstacles to adherence, as well as potential methods to overcome these challenges. Finally, in the &#x02018;Arrange&#x02019; stage, physiotherapists are taught to provide a rehabilitation diary to support patients&#x02019; competence and autonomy, and ensure that patients feel the physiotherapists wants to ensure that they have adequate resources to support their home-based rehabilitation (enhancing relatedness and competence).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Mapping communication strategies to the &#x02018;5A&#x02019; framework and self-determination theory</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Strategy</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Description / Example</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Main Basic Psychological Need(s) Targeted</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>ASK</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Using Open-Ended Questions<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x0201c;Tell me&#x0201d;/&#x0201c;What&#x0201d;/&#x0201d;How&#x0201d; are useful terms when asking questions, as they allow the patient to elaborate on his/her story.

These training methods (apart from the video examples) were successfully piloted in two Dublin-area physiotherapy clinics in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. At the end of each session, each physiotherapist will work with the workshop leader (CL) to set goals for strategy implementation during treatment sessions. The goals along with likely obstacles and solutions to overcome will be recorded. Physiotherapists in the experimental arm will receive individual follow-up emails 4&#x02009;weeks and 10&#x02009;weeks after the completion of training. During these follow-ups, the workshop leader will discuss progress towards the attainment of the implementation goals and provide assistance to resolve any problems physiotherapists may encounter when employing autonomy supportive communication in their clinical practice. Finally, treatment record forms for physiotherapists in the experimental arm will include 5A prompts, with specific reminders to use strategies taught during the communication skills workshops.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Assessment</title><sec><title>Physiotherapists</title><sec><title>Baseline assessment</title><p>Prior to randomization, all physiotherapists participating in the study will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires (10 minutes long).

a blinded researcher to record the pedometer step count for the previous seven days, self-reported PA, and adherence. This will be done by a telephone call or an email, depending on the patient&#x02019;s preference (provided at the time of recruitment). At this time, the patient can ask any questions regarding the use of their pedometer or any other general questions pertaining to their involvement in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up assessments (Weeks 4, 12, and 24)</title><p>Follow-up outcome measures at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 will be collected via one of three methods, depending on patient preference; (i) over the telephone with a blinded research investigator, (ii) online questionnaire or (iii) hardcopy of the questionnaire sent via post with a pre-paid return envelope. Attempts to ensure complete follow-up data is collected on time will involve; (i) pre-posting the follow-up questionnaire to the patient 1&#x02009;week before it is due with a pre-paid self-addressed return envelope for easy return postage, (ii) sending a text message to let the patient know the follow-up assessment has been posted, (iii) the Research Physiotherapist telephoning the patient during the week the assessment is due to ensure the patients has received the questionnaire and answer any questions he or she may have. In situations where the assessment is overdue by two weeks, the Research Physiotherapist will contact the patient by telephone and, if contact is not made, she will send a handwritten letter asking the patient to complete and return the questionnaire.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>A brief description of the outcomes is listed below. The timeline of assessments is detailed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. Detailed descriptions and references for these measures are presented in Appendix A.</p><sec><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>(i) <italic>General adherence to physiotherapy recommendations</italic>, during the therapy session as rated by the physiotherapist [adapted version of Sports Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Scale] and outside the clinic as rated by the patient [Adherence to Physiotherapists&#x02019; Recommendations Scale]. We will also collect information regarding the patient&#x02019;s recall and adherence to recommendations regarding specific back exercises and PA using an adapted version of a Home Exercise Compliance Assessment.</p><p>(ii) <italic>PA level,</italic> self-reported using the International Short Form Physical Activity Questionnaire.</p><p>(iii) <italic>Back Pain Symptoms, Function and Well Being,</italic> measured by Pain Intensity [Numerical Rating Scale], Pain Bothersomeness, the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, the Patient Specific Functional Scale, the European Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the Perception of Recovery Scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>We will employ secondary outcomes that we expect to change as a result of the intervention and could explain the effect of the intervention on the primary outcomes; including the measurement of autonomy support, perceived competence, autonomous and controlled motivation, as well as fear avoidance as it relates to physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Moderating variables</title><p>We will also measure specific individual factors at baseline that could influence the treatment effect. These include the therapist&#x02019;s personality (causality orientations) and motivation to participate in the study, the therapist and patient&#x02019;s treatment expectations, and the patient&#x02019;s baseline levels of depressive symptoms. Descriptions and references for these measures are presented in Appendix A.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Treatment fidelity</title><p>Audio-recordings will be used to assess fidelity of treatment. For this outcome, at least 20% of the physiotherapists in the control arm and at least 20% of physiotherapists in the experimental arm will be asked to audio record one of their treatment sessions with a study participant. These sessions must be an initial (week 1) appointment. Each audio recording will be assessed by an expert rater, who will be blinded to specific study hypotheses and allocation of the physiotherapist to the experimental or control arm. Raters will assess the overall autonomy support provided. Using a tool that will be designed specifically for this study, they will also rate the quality of the physiotherapist&#x02019;s use of the 18 strategies taught during the communications skills workshops (i.e., fidelity).</p></sec><sec><title>Data integrity</title><p>The research team will monitor the integrity of trial data. For physiotherapist treatment record form data, which are slightly different between experimental and control arms (i.e., 5A prompts described in the intervention section), a research investigator un-blinded to treatment allocation will perform regular data checks during data entry and provide feedback to physiotherapists regarding data omissions where necessary. For patient data, a blinded investigator will enter data within 72 hours of patient completion and follow-up with patients regarding missing data that could be salvaged. All data will be double entered, to detect and correct input errors.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample for the study was calculated using data from our recent pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The effect sizes observed in that investigation were <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.4 for adherence and satisfaction with back pain, and <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.5 for PA-walking behavior. These effect sizes are similar to those reported in a recent Cochrane review of trials investigating the effectiveness of interventions designed to increase adherence among chronic pain patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As a result, the estimated sample required for 80% power (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05) to detect a between arm effect of d&#x02009;=&#x02009;.4 in a non-clustered RCT, using a t-test, would be 156 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;78 per arm).</p><p>To account for the clustered nature of the data, we multiplied this sample size by a correction factor of 1&#x02009;+&#x02009;(<italic>m</italic>&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1)&#x003c1;, where <italic>m</italic> was the mean expected cluster size and &#x003c1; was the anticipated intracluster correlation coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Based on previous research in clinical settings regarding physical activity in patients with CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we estimated that the ICC would be 0.03. Assuming we recruit <italic>m</italic> of 22 patients per clinic, the correction factor is 1.63 for our cluster-randomized design. To account for the clustered design, the study would require 254 participants to achieve 80% power for the adherence and LBP related data.</p><p>We anticipate that approximately 15% of participants will not complete follow-up assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Traditionally, one would account for this loss to follow up and increase the sample size by 15% to 292 participants (146 per arm). However, as our method of analysis (linear mixed models, see statistical methods section) does not require list-wise deletion, and therefore loss to follow-up is expected to have negligible impact. Indeed, Chakraborty and Gu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] demonstrated that up to 20% of the observations can be missing without a meaningful loss of power for mixed modeling approaches. As such, our intended sample of 292 patients will provide more than 80% power to detect significant effects in these primary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Researchers will analyze the data using a coded dataset and these individuals will not become unblinded until analysis is complete. Participants&#x02019; data will be analyzed according to their assigned arm of the study, regardless of whether they attend their physiotherapy treatment sessions or not (i.e., intention-to-treat principle).</p><p>Fidelity of the intervention will be assessed in a subsample of patients. We will employ between-arm comparisons of autonomy support ratings made by (i) patients, (ii) physiotherapists and (iii) independent, blinded raters of audio recordings. We will also compare 5A strategy use, as measured by independent, blinded raters of audio recordings.</p><p>The main study hypotheses will be explored using linear-mixed modeling with measurement occasions, patients, physiotherapists, and clinics as potential levels of the analysis. Using a dummy-coded &#x0201c;treatment&#x0201d; variable (experimental vs. control) as a predictor in the model, we will test differences both in the mean levels and the rates of change of the primary and secondary outcome variables. The primary endpoint for the analysis will be data collected at week 24. Lastly, in order to examine the process of change, we will conduct a structural equation modeling analysis, accounting for clustering effects, to test the direct and mediated relationships outlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>No adverse events are expected as a result of communication skills training. Patients and physiotherapists will be informed that any adverse events should be reported to and will be documented by the research team.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion points</title><sec><title>Potential inconveniences to the participant</title><p>As part of the study, participants will be asked to volunteer their time for the following activities that are beyond the requirements of a normal physiotherapy session; (i) baseline assessment which will require approximately 20 minutes before their initial physiotherapy appointment and five minutes after the session to complete the assessment booklet; (ii) during weeks 1, 4, 12, and 24 all participants are asked to wear a pedometer during waking hours and (iii) during week 1, five minutes will be needed to complete follow-up assessments (iv) during week 4, 12, and 24, approximately 15 minutes will be required to complete follow-up assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Pedometers are limited as tools to measure physical activity. For example, they only provide a total number of steps in a given period, so they cannot measure the intensity of PA at a given time point or the proportion of time spent in activity above a certain intensity during a particular period. However, limited funding for this project means that it will not be possible to include more costly measures, such as accelerometers, that would likely provide more detailed data regarding physical activity.</p><p>In line with SDT tenets, the communication skills training intervention in this trial was designed to teach physiotherapists strategies that would support patients&#x02019; basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. While the health behavior change model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], upon which our study hypotheses are largely based, does not specifically include autonomy or relatedness perceptions, these constructs are theoretical mediators (along with competence) of the relationship between autonomy support and autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As such, it would have been preferable to measure perceptions of autonomy and relatedness. Unfortunately, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, there are no existing measures designed to tap these constructs in the physiotherapy setting or in the context of CLBP rehabilitation. We attempted to adapt measures of autonomy and relatedness from a similar context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], but pilot data indicated significant difficulties in operationalizing these constructs. Thus, we decided not to include these measures. Further research is needed to develop scales to measures these constructs in the CLBP patient population.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Appendix A</title><sec><title>General information</title><p><bold><bold>&#x000b7;</bold></bold><bold><italic>Demographic Information:</italic></bold> Each participant will have a consultation with the Research Physiotherapist to collect demographic information and medical history.
