Participants are randomized to 8 weeks of either a vegan or AHA-recommended diet (March 2014 and February 2017). Participants are provided weekly groceries that adhere to the guidelines of their diet. The primary endpoint is high sensitivity C-reactive concentrations. Secondary endpoints include anthropometric data, other markers of inflammation, lipid parameters, glycemic markers, endothelial function, quality of life data, and assessment of physical activity. Endpoints are measured at each visit (baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks).

Several studies suggest an associated benefit between a reduction in inflammation via statin or anti-inflammatory therapy and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The inflammatory state at the time of coronary revascularization also predicts clinical outcomes. High concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline, in particular, predict a significant increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes after coronary revascularization <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In relatively healthy subjects with elevated concentrations of high sensitivity-CRP (hs-CRP) and normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, initiation of statin therapy significantly lowers both hs-CRP concentrations and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Approximately 30% of the treated stable CAD population has elevated hs-CRP concentrations, highlighting the potential need for alternative strategies to address the residual risk associated with baseline inflammation in patients with CAD <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Addressing adverse dietary patterns may allow patients with CAD to positively impact their overall cardiovascular health. The American Heart Association (AHA) has maintained a focus on a &#x0201c;heart healthy&#x0201d; diet that is low in saturated and trans fats and high in fruits and vegetables to reduce the health burden associated with cardiovascular disease and, as such, has been the recommended diet for patients with CAD. There is evidence to suggest that the lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects noted with statin medications <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Given the potential of lowering LDL-cholesterol concentrations from the substitution of animal-based protein with plant-based protein, an antioxidant-rich vegan diet may improve the inflammatory and glucometabolic state better than the AHA-recommended diet in patients with CAD <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">Although multiple dietary factors influence cardiovascular disease, only a few studies to date examine the effects of overall healthy dietary patterns on cardiovascular disease risk <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Even fewer studies compare a particular diet to the standard recommended heart healthy diet in patients with cardiovascular disease, but, instead, utilize an inappropriate control condition (no active intervention, usual dietary patterns) as the comparison group <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Study aims</title><p id="p0025">The primary aim of this study is to determine the impact of an 8-week vegan diet on inflammation, as measured by hs-CRP concentrations, compared to the AHA-recommended diet in patients with angiographically defined CAD.

Lifestyle interventions, including diet, may be an important approach to address the risks associated with inflammation and impact cardiovascular health. Although epidemiological research supports the relationship between &#x0201c;heart healthy&#x0201d; dietary patterns and vegan diets on inflammatory markers, well-designed randomized clinical trials are limited and the results are mixed <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Furthermore, the study participants included in previous research may have been free from cardiovascular disease. We present the first study to date to comprehensively assess the impact of a vegan diet compared to the currently recommended AHA diet on multiple indices of inflammation and glycometabolic risk in a randomized clinical trial of patients with angiographically defined CAD.</p><p id="p0200">Our study design incorporates several unique and innovative elements to address the research questions. First, this study compares the impact of a vegan diet and the AHA diet on multiple indices of inflammation and glycometabolic risk. All participants receive random assignment to an intervention with the potential to improve health. Thus, the study design calls for as much attention to the control group (AHA) as the comparator group (vegan). Participants are counseled equally on their respective dietary guidelines and complete twice weekly 24-h dietary recalls that allow for equal amount of contact with the research dietitian. The intervention groups are also provided with the same resources: provision of a starter kit that includes a food scale, measuring cups, measuring spoons, cookbook, two-week sample menu with recipes, nutrition education materials summarizing the diet (12 pages), and handouts on serving size and instructions on how to read nutrition labels, as well as weekly groceries. The only difference in these resources is the substitution of animal-based protein in the AHA group for plant-based protein in the vegan group.</p><p id="p0205">Second, we provide groceries and dietary counseling for all study participants. Participants in this study receive $80 in weekly groceries as part of the study design. During a weekly phone call from the study dietitian, participants complete a grocery order for food items to be delivered to their home from a grocery delivery service. Participants are able to select items from a list of foods/ingredients (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental appendix 4</xref>) that support the dietary recommendations of their intervention assignment. Participants are also provided with a two-week sample menu that incorporates the foods/ingredients on the grocery order (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental appendix 2</xref>). Most nutrition clinical studies utilize nutrition education, cooking classes, educational resources, and individual/group counseling as part of the study design when educating research participants on their respective intervention assignment. However, providing whole foods/ingredients to research participants may enhance adherence to the dietary guidelines and is an innovative aspect of this study. During the 15 one-on-one educational sessions with the study research dietitian, the research participants learn how to incorporate these foods/ingredients into healthy meals, which may continue once the study has ended. Other studies have provided some food items to research participants, such as meal replacement products, frozen food entrees, and margarine <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, increasing data suggest a failure of translating research findings into clinical practice, particularly those related to adherence to dietary advice <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Our study provides study participants with the education and tools necessary to prepare healthy meals that follow the dietary recommendations of their intervention assignment and sustain the behavior. This, together with the twice a week telephone calls from the study registered dietitian, may beneficially impact dietary adherence <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p id="p0210">Third, this study incorporates detailed scripts and guidelines, allowing the intervention materials to be disseminated consistently by the study registered dietitian. A counseling guide was developed to encourage a similar discussion between the study registered dietitian and study participants randomly assigned to each intervention group. Furthermore, a script was created for the 24-h dietary recalls so that the initiation of the conversation, questions asked, and guidance for participants were similar for participants assigned to the same intervention group.</p><p id="p0215">Fourth, the multiple measures of adherence are another central aspect of the study's design. These measures include dietary intake (animal protein recommendation for each diet; MyPlate servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) and both plasma and urine TMAO concentrations. Although TMAO concentrations are only detected after the consumption of red meat, participants were only told that there was a marker in the blood and urine that allowed investigators to determine dietary adherence <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. A unique study-specific scoring system was also developed, as described above, to quantitate level of dietary adherence using similar criteria in each group.</p><p id="p0220">There are several limitations to the current study. First, the use of a Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire may limit generalizability of the study results. Given our relatively small sample size, we need to effectively enroll potentially adherent participants, allowing us to better examine the impact of the intervention. Second, although the study registered dietitian consistently encourages intake of whole food choices at each of the 15 educational one-on-one sessions, convenience items are allowed to promote adherence to the diets in the real-world setting. Third, the study nutrition education materials are based on the TLC Program, guidelines that were recommended by the AHA at the time the intervention materials were developed. Although dietary recommendations continue to evolve, the TLC Program is consistent with the current AHA guidelines.</p><p id="p0225">Finally, irrespective of the primary findings, this randomized blinded-endpoint trial will be of scientific importance as a large repository of biological specimens with a comprehensive analysis of inflammatory markers, lipid profiles, and glucometabolic parameters in conjunction with detailed dietary reports in patients with CAD. Thus, the biologic repository can allow for exploration of the effects of different dietary strategies on additional markers of cardiometabolic health. In addition, the results of this study may provide preliminary data for a larger randomized trial evaluating the effects of the two dietary strategies on traditional clinical cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAD. Alternatively, if significant reductions in inflammatory or glucometabolic profiles are noted in both groups, data from the current study may be used to support the evaluation of a rigorous approach to dietary counseling on long-term cardiovascular events in patients with established CAD.</p><p id="p0230">In summary, the EVADE CAD study is a unique and innovative randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of an 8-week vegan diet to the AHA-recommended diet on hs-CRP concentrations in patients with angiographically defined CAD. The study results may provide important information for a larger outcomes-based trial evaluating dietary strategies to decrease inflammation and improve glucometabolic profiles in patients with CAD.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Packard</surname><given-names>R.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Libby</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Inflammation in atherosclerosis: from vascular biology to biomarker discovery and risk prediction</article-title><source>Clin.
