Although various papers using the RI have been published, no study on its reproducibility has been reported. The aim of this report is to estimate the variations of the RI in a number of a pair set of lateral chest radiographs (LCRs). The hypothesis was that the RI should have minimal variability for each subject having successive LCRs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Seventy randomized patients who were treated in the hospital for lung diseases (mainly pneumonia or other communicable lung diseases), were initially included in the study. Each of these patients had two successive LCRs (named A and B group of radiographs) at the radiological department of the hospital, by the same technician, during the course of their treatment. The radiation source - patient distance was constant. LCRs obtained at an incorrect patient&#x02019;s position, or from patients who underwent a thoracic intervention and all LCRs with symmetric hemi-thoraces were excluded from the study. The LCRs of 49 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the study. The RI was calculated in both (A and B) LCRs of each patient. The statistical analysis included the following techniques: paired t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient and intra- and inter-observer error using the formula (SD/&#x0221a;2)/2, where SD is this of the differences of the two sets of measurement (As-Bs). The SPSS v16 statistical package was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the 49 pairs of LCRs there was no statistical difference of the RI, (paired t-test p&#x0003c; 0.314). The RI in the A and B group of LCRs was perfectly correlated (correlation coefficient = 0,924, p &#x0003c; 0.0001). The intra-observer error was 0.0080 while the inter-observer error 0.0213 in terms of 95% CI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The RI proves to be a reliable method to evaluate the thoracic deformity and the effect of surgical or non-operative treatment on the IS RHD.

The RI, extracted from the DRCS on lateral spinal radiographs to evaluate the RHD in IS patients has been earlier introduced.

Forty-nine of the seventy patients were deemed suitable for assessment. The exclusion criteria were LCRs obtained in an incorrect patient&#x02019;s position, those of patients who underwent a thoracic intervention and all LCRs with symmetric hemi-thoraces without a DRCS. Forty one were males and twenty nine were females while their mean age was 58 years, (range 25 to 80 years). Each of them had two successive LCRs to assess the course of their treatment. In order to access the data of the patients this study was approved by the Ethical &#x00026; Scientific Committee for Clinical Research at "ATTIKON" Hospital. The details of the included patients in the study are presented in the additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. The institutional review board (IRB) permission was obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>Two successive LCRs were obtained in a standardized way for each patient included in the study. The LCRs were divided into two groups, namely group A and group B. Group A included the 1<sup>st</sup> LCR and group B included the 2<sup>nd</sup> LCR as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The minimum interval time between the two successive LCRs was two days. The RI was calculated in this set (A and B) of LCRs of each patient. It should also be noted that the radiation source-patient distance remained constant and that the radiographs were performed by the same technician. Radiant Dicom Viewer software was the tool for the measurements on LCRs.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure1</label><caption><p><bold>Examples of two LCRs (group A and group B respectively).</bold> Group A included the 1<sup>st</sup> LCR and group B included the 2<sup>nd</sup> LCR.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1748-7161-10-S2-S9-1"/></fig><p>The RI method (RI=d1/d2) is described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The description of the RI method</bold>.

Yet the RI method provides the possibility for retrospective studies.</p><p>Adolescent scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Quite a few techniques are employed in order to assess the deformity of the spine and the thoracic cage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The most commonly used is the Cobb angle method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The most frequently used techniques for the evaluation of the vertebral rotation are these of Nash-Moe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the Perdriolle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These methods do not assess the degree of rib deformity affecting the thoracic cage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The RI is considered an excellent method to assess RHD due to its simplicity and to the ability to be calculated on the lateral scoliosis film with no need for special imaging or additional exposure to radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As it has been earlier noted the RI method extracted from the DRCS was introduced to evaluate the RHD in IS patients in an attempt to create a safe and reproducible method to assess the thoracic deformity based on lateral radiographs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This assessment is actually the transverse plane thoracic deformity.</p><p>Therefore the answers to the above questions are:</p><sec><title>Question 1: Has the RI the same value in different radiographs of the same individual?</title><p>The results of this study show that there was no significant difference of the RI between the groups (group A and group B) and that it was strongly correlated. Therefore, it can be stated that the value of the RI is the same for each patient in successive radiographs.</p></sec><sec><title>Question 2: Does the same examiner measure the same value of RI in different measurements of the same radiograph?</title><p>The findings suggest that the measurements, which were done twice, produced the same values of the RI for the same radiograph.</p></sec><sec><title>Question 3: Does a second examiner measure the same value of RI of the same patient&#x02019;s radiograph?</title><p>Based on the reliability study results presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, the difference in the measurements of the two observers was insignificant in terms of 95% CI. Consequently, it can be claimed that the value of the RI of each patient&#x02019;s lateral radiograph was the same.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The RI method proves to be a reliable method to evaluate the thoracic deformity or the effect of surgical or conservative treatment on the IS rib-cage deformity (RH).
