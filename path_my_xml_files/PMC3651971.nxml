The trial, known as the Nepal Nutrition Intervention Project Sarlahi-2 (NNIPS-2),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"/></sup> ran from March 1994 through September 1997; details of the trial have been described elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> Briefly, married women of reproductive age were randomly assigned to the treatment group by the ward, an administrative subdivision of the village development committee (VDC). The women received weekly, oral doses of vitamin A (23&#x02005;300&#x02005;IU or 7000&#x02005;&#x003bc;g retinol equivalents) as retinyl palmitate, 42&#x02005;mg of all-<italic>trans</italic> &#x003b2;-carotene (&#x0223c;7000&#x02005;&#x003bc;g retinol equivalents at a 6&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 conversion ratio), arithmetically equivalent to a daily recommended dietary allowance,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> or a placebo. The supplements were identical, opaque, gelatin capsules, all of which also contained 5&#x02005;mg dl-&#x003b1;-tocopherol as a preservative.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> Within the trial catchment area, a subset of three contiguous VDCs (Haripur, Netragunj and Kabalisi), comprising 27 wards (9 per supplement arm), were designated as a substudy area. The women in the substudy area gave blood and urine samples during pregnancy and at 3&#x02005;months postpartum; they were also weighed and measured during the first trimester of pregnancy. Infants in the substudy area were weighed and measured soon after birth and at 3 and 6&#x02005;months of age.</p><p>Participants in the current follow-up study were drawn from 12 wards, 6 each from the vitamin A and placebo groups in two of the three substudy VDCs (Haripur and Netragunj). The participants from the &#x003b2;-carotene arms were excluded for cost and logistical reasons, and because there was no prior basis to posit an effect of &#x003b2;-carotene, beyond its potential as a provitamin A carotenoid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> The participants in this study were chosen from among those alive and enumerated during a project census in 2006, and had been registered by the fall of 2007 into a follow-up study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25 R26 R27">25&#x02013;27</xref> Among women who had contributed &#x0003e;1 pregnancy and live born child to the original NNIPS-2 trial, only the eldest surviving study child was defined a priori as being eligible for the current investigation.</p><p>The children studied were exposed in utero and postnatally through breast milk intake to a weekly supplemental supply of vitamin A, calculated to meet maternal dietary recommendations during pregnancy and lactation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> or to placebo (serving as controls). Beyond 6&#x02005;months of age, the national, semiannual vitamin A supplementation programme, implemented from 1995 onwards, offered children in the Sarlahi district supplements containing 100&#x02005;000&#x02005;IU up to 11&#x02005;months, and 200&#x02005;000&#x02005;IU from 12 to &#x0223c;60&#x02005;months of age, with coverage routinely reaching &#x02265;80%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> The study children were therefore likely to have started receiving vitamin A periodically through the national programme from age 6&#x02005;months onwards, but there are no individual records of their programme participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Objective and outcomes</title><p>This study hypothesised that, by school age, children born to mothers routinely supplemented with vitamin A would perform better on tests of cognitive and motor ability than children born to placebo-supplemented women. The cognitive ability was measured by the child's performance on the Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test (UNIT) and motor ability by an abridged version (using four subtests) of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC).</p><p>UNIT is a non-verbal test designed to be accessible to children who may be at a disadvantage in traditional intelligence testing because they do not speak the same language as the tester.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> It is composed of six subtests: spatial memory, symbolic memory, cube design, object memory, analogical reasoning and mazes. The participants in this study did not take the analogical reasoning test because pretesting determined that the pictures used in this test were not familiar to Nepalese children. The testers summed the raw scores on each subtest to yield a total raw score. UNIT is a relatively new intelligence test, and this study was the first known use of UNIT in Nepal.</p><p>MABC assesses the spectrum of gross and fine motor skills. The participants in this study took four of the eight possible MABC subtests designed for children aged 11&#x02013;12&#x02005;years. The trained research assistants scored the 10-year-old participants (n=10) on the 11-year-old standards and the 13-year-olds (n=63) on the 12-year-old standards. The tests given in this study were the peg turing test, the flower trail test, the walking backwards test and the one-handed ball catching test. The MABC tests are scored on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 is the best possible score and 5 is the worst. The testers summed the scores on each subtest to yield a total raw score.</p><p>All psychological testing was conducted by five research assistants, recruited from social science master's programmes at Tribhuvan University and trained and supervised by psychologists from Penn State University in the scoring and administration of UNIT and MABC. The testers were masked to the participant's treatment group. As the purpose of this study was to compare two groups of children, not to diagnose learning or motor problems or calculate intelligence quotients, a lack of test validation data from Nepal was not a serious limitation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size</title><p>Our sample size was determined by considerations of both a minimum detectable difference between groups and logistical constraints associated with enrolling and testing participants. We hypothesised that early life vitamin A supplementation could yield differences of 40% of an SD based on standardised distributions obtainable from UNIT and MABC, with 80% power, and arbitrarily assumed a design effect associated with ward randomisation of 2 and a 5% refusal rate. These assumptions led us to a required sample size of &#x0223c;210 children per group, for a total N=420. The sample included all resident children (n=47) in the 12-ward substudy area whose mothers were documented to have had night blindness, a clinical symptom of moderate vitamin A deficiency, during the original trial. The remaining 373 children were drawn from a unified random sample distribution generated using the RANUNI command in SAS V.9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data collection and informed consent</title><p>Fieldwork was carried out from January to September 2008. The study staff visited the participants at their project-verified address, introduced themselves, explained the study and obtained consent from each child&#x02019;s parent. The interviewer then conducted a series of structured interviews with the mother on the child's health and school history, the family's socioeconomic status, and conducted an early adolescent version of the Home Observation for Measurement of Environment (HOME inventory) and the Ten Questions Plus disability screening.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> After these interviews, each mother and child were invited to visit a local, central testing site in the next few days.</p><p>Testing rooms had natural and electric lights, fans in the warm weather and heaters in the cool winter months. The study staff brought the sampled child with a parent or guardian to the test site by car. At the test site, study staff read a consent form to the parent or guardian, and assent to the child, whose verbal responses were recorded. The children and their mothers were then fed a snack to ensure that no participant would be distracted by hunger during testing.</p><p>At the central site, the participants were weighed on a digital scale (Model 881, Seca, Hamburg, Germany, read to the nearest 100&#x02005;g) and height was measured using a stationary board with a portable head block (Shorr Products, Olney, Maryland, USA), read to the nearest 0.1&#x02005;cm. A staff member drew a capillary blood sample from the middle finger of each child's non-dominant hand using a BD Genie Lancet (BD Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA), and collected the blood in a microcuvette for haemoglobin testing in a B-Hemoglobin Analyzer (HemoCue, Lake Forest, California, USA).</p><p>While the research assistants conducted the psychological tests on children, the trained study staff conducted Raven's coloured progressive matrices, one of the oldest and most validated tests in cognitive testing, on the children's mothers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Quality control</title><p>The field supervisors reviewed all forms for completeness, and identified and corrected errors before sending the forms to project headquarters in Kathmandu for data entry.

Fifty-five per cent of children in both groups were stunted, suggesting comparable levels of chronic undernutrition, although children born to mothers in the placebo group had a lower prevalence of anaemia (26% vs 36.6%, p=0.03) and lower exposure to adequately iodised salt in their home, based on tested concentrations of &#x02265;30&#x02005;ppm (78% vs 85.7%, p=0.05), than in the vitamin A group.

The lack of effect is unlikely to be due to a lack of vitamin A deficiency among pregnant women; &#x0223c;20% of mothers were noted to have a serum retinol concentration below 0.70&#x02005;&#x000b5;mol/l, a prevalence that fell to &#x0223c;3% with supplementation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> Gestational night blindness of &#x0223c;10% also responded to vitamin A supplementation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> and the risk of maternal death was reduced by &#x0223c;40% through supplementation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> There was no lack of cognitive or motor effect, which is likely to be owing to the poor response to supplementation among the offspring; infants born to supplemented women had a higher serum retinol than infants born to placebo mothers by 3&#x02005;months of age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> The children born to supplemented women also had better lung function (as measured by the forced expiratory volume at 1&#x02005;s and forced vital capacity)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> and raised natural antibody levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> in childhood, further evidence of a physiological effect.</p><p>The hypothesised effect of gestational vitamin A supplementation on cognition and motor development is based on sound theory. Animal models have hinted at a special sensitivity of the emerging motor system to retinoic acid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> The developing cerebellum and motor neurons appear to be especially vulnerable to fluctuations in retinoic acid concentration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> One explanation for the lack of effect is that the participants in this study have passed the age at which differences in their early development are measurable. The human studies that have suggested a role for vitamin A in cognitive and motor development are limited to much younger children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Another possible explanation for our results is that differences between groups were attenuated by routine supplementation from the national vitamin A programme started in 1995.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Given the wide CIs for experimental measures of cognitive and motor development, and the potential for brain plasticity, the supplementation programme might have attenuated a treatment effect, allowing placebo group children to regain the nutritional losses of their early life. There are also a host of other nutritional influences on cognitive development, some of which might obscure the relationship between early vitamin A deficiency and developmental outcomes. Iron and zinc deficiencies, both common in Nepal, can also influence child development, as can deficiencies of essential fatty acids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> The high prevalence of stunting in this sample suggests that the participants&#x02019; diets are severely lacking in multiple micronutrients and macronutrients. These deficiencies, working individually or in combination, might also have attenuated between-group differences.</p><p>There is also the possibility that the study lacked statistical power to detect a difference between groups, given the modest number of clusters represented in the sample. Though the study had the power to detect a difference of about 40% of SD in the test score, a smaller difference in mean scores might have been undetected. Similarly, this study recruited children from among those alive and accounted for in the study area in 2006. We found that vitamin A group children in the sampling frame were from more affluent families than their counterparts in the placebo group, as indicated by measures of wealth collected during the NNIPS-2 trial. However, the adjusted analysis that controlled for socioeconomic status also found no difference between groups.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the lack of difference between groups is that UNIT and MABC are insufficiently precise to pick up on subtle differences in vitamin A nutriture. This is possible, despite the fact that both instruments estimate ability using a diverse cross-section of tests that draw on widely different cognitive and motor functions. Both tests were adapted for use in rural Nepal, but these adaptations were unlikely to adversely affect test validity. Furthermore, research assistants with master&#x02019;s degrees in social sciences conducted the tests; they were trained, standardised and regularly monitored by professional psychologists. All testing was performed in central sites selected for a calm setting that would enable the children's concentration and adequate attention to testing. We consider it unlikely that procedural flaws could explain the lack of effect.</p><p>The post hoc analyses reported in this paper hinted at differences in motor skills after in utero vitamin A supplementation, but did so only after excluding children who never attended school and those who repeated a grade. This analysis does not include the entire spectrum of ability and social background in the population, and therefore should not be overinterpreted. Similarly, measures of cognitive and motor development are influenced by other factors that are difficult to measure, such as school and teacher quality. The children in this sample attended different schools; the differences in education and enrichment of their school environments may have introduced differences into the data that were not accounted for in the analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, in this vitamin A deficient setting, where maternal vitamin A supplementation reduced maternal night blindness and mortality, no long-term effects have been observed on the cognitive and motor skill development of prepubescent offspring. Given that some positive effects have been observed in other organ systems, specifically the lung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> and innate immune<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> function, it may be that the central nervous system is relatively more protected during gestation under such marginally nourished conditions.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf">http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf</ext-link></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e204" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002000.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e205" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002000.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Apart from the authors, the following members of the Nepal study team helped in the successful implementation of the study: Sharda Ram Shrestha, Tirtha Raj Shakya, Gokarna Subedi, Uma Shankar Shah, Keshab Dhakal, Shishir Shrestha, Dhruba Khadka, Dhan Raj Lama.
