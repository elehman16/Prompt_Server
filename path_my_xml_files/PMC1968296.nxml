Marker changes at 2 and 4 months showed a highly significant correlation with the UICC assessed response at 3 and 6 months (P &#x0003c; 0.001); sensitivity 100%, specificity 87%; positive predictive value 85%; negative predictive value 100%. This index was then used to select out truly responsive patients and to prospectively direct their chemotherapy. Twenty-six responding (biochemical/clinical) patients were randomised to discontinue cytotoxics after 6 months and move to maintenance hormones (n = 13) or continue chemotherapy whilst the biochemical markers kept falling or remained within the normal range. Biochemical progression prompted a change of chemotherapy. Continuous chemotherapy in biochemically defined responders was associated with a significant lengthening of remission duration and an improved quality of life and survival. We are now using the index to routinely direct chemotherapy and select out true responders for maintenance chemotherapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="181" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="182" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="183" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="184" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="185" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
