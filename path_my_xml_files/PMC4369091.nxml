Approximately 70% of NSCLC patients who present with locally advanced or metastatic disease have a poor prognosis, with an expected 5-year survival rate of &#x0003c;5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite various combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], overall survival rates remain poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A better understanding of what is the key factors for locally advanced and metastatic disease states may be very important for improving LC therapeutic outcomes.</p><p>Microparticles (MPs) are identified as &#x0201c;small plasma membrane fragments&#x0201d; of cells shed into the circulation by activated and/or apoptotic cells in response to changes such as physiological stimulations (thrombin, endotoxin or shear stress), stress, cellular apoptosis (growth factor deprivation or apoptotic inducers), and/or neoplastic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, MPs appear to have differential roles in angiogenesis depending on their origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Of note, MPs exhibit pro-angiogenic activity, in that they promote formation of capillary-like structures and pro-angiogenic factor production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Accumulating published evidence indicates that numbers of circulating MPs are increased in various type of cancer, including LC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We have also recently displayed that circulating levels of MPs are significantly increased in LC patients, and circulating levels of endothelial-derived apoptotic MPs are significantly associated with different LC cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These studies raise the possibility that circulating MPs are not only biomarkers but may also directly participate in angiogenesis for promoting nutrient delivery to LC cells, local invasion and metastasis. However, these potentially important propositions remain untested in the literature. To extend our recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the aims of this study, which included both in vitro and in vivo studies, were to address: (1) whether circulating MPs derived from LC patients promoted angiogenesis, differentiation, nitric oxide (NO) production and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) expression in culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs); and (2) whether administration of MPs rescued rat critical limb ischemia (CLI) mainly through angiogenesis and enhanced blood flow in ischemic regions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics</title><p>All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication No. 85&#x02013;23, National Academy Press, Washington, DC, USA, revised 1996).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Rationale for the source and dosage of MPs</title><p>Because of the results of our recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] that demonstrated strong correlation between the circulating level of MPs and poor prognostic outcome of patients at advanced stages of NSCLC (i.e., stage IIIb or staged IV of NSCLC upon presentation), MPs were obtained from these patients in the present study.</p><p>First of all, the safety and efficacy of different regimens of MP administration were compared in the current study. Second, the amount of MPs that could be obtained from one patient was determined based on our knowledge that usually about 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> MPs could be harvested from10 mL of patient&#x02019;s blood. Therefore, our pilot study used four animals for verification of dosage of MPs for the current study, including one with CLI only and another three animals receiving 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>, 5.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> and 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> MPs, respectively. By day 14, the results of Laser Doppler showed that the blood flow to the ischemic limb was highest in animals treated with the high-dose regimen (i.e., 1.0 x 10<sup>7</sup> MPs) without notable complication or tumorigenesis. Therefore, the high-dose regimen (1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> MPs) was used in subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Animal model of critical limb ischemia, animal grouping, and treatments</title><p>The procedure and protocol were based on our previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In brief, male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) rats in CLI groups were anesthetized by inhalation of 2.0% isoflurane. The rats were placed in a supine position on a warming pad at 37&#x000b0;C with the left hind limbs shaved. Under sterile conditions, the left femoral artery, small arterioles, circumferential femoral artery and veins were exposed and ligated over their proximal and distal portions before removal. To avoid the presence of collateral circulation, the branches were removed together. For Laser Doppler study, 10 rats in each group were utilized and 8 rats in each group were used for cellular-molecular assessment. For animals that served as normal controls with and without receiving MPs, the arteries were only isolated without ligation.</p><p>The SD rats (n=40) were equally divided into four groups: group 1 [sham control (SC)&#x02009;+&#x02009;1.0 ml phosphate buffered saline (BPS) (0.5&#x000a0;ml from penile vein injection and 0.5&#x000a0;ml via intra-muscular injection], group 2 [SC&#x02009;+&#x02009;lung cancer-derived (Lc)-MPs (1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> particles) in 1.0&#x000a0;cc BPS given as SC group)], group 3 (CLI only), group 5 (CLI&#x02009;+&#x02009;Lc-MPs, 5.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> particles in 0.5&#x000a0;ml BPS via penile vein injection and 5.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> particles in 0.5&#x000a0;ml BPS by intra-muscular injection into ischemic zone) just after CLI induction. The rationale for administration of MPs from both intravenous and intra-muscular injection were to consider that combined circulatory and localized therapy with MPs in a situation of CLI would be offer a great enhancement of angiogenesis effect.</p><p>In the present study, another 10 animals (group 4) serves as positive controls that received MPs from healthy subjects (Hs) (i.e., Hs-MPs) after the CLI procedure to verify the potential capacity of enhancing angiogenesis of Hs-MPs in ischemic limbs. Laser Doppler, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, immunofluorescent (IF) and Western blot studies were used for measuring blood flow, identification of small blood vessel, and quantification of cellular elements of angiogenesis [i.e., CD31<sup>+</sup>, CXCR4<sup>+</sup>, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup>, von Willebrand factor (vWF)<sup>+</sup> and VEGF<sup>+</sup> cells], respectively.

First, the results of HUVEC culturing study proved that Lc-MP treatment enhanced angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and NO production as well as VEGFR2 protein expressions, suggesting that MP treatment augmented angiogenesis mainly through eliciting the VEGF signaling pathway. Second, both ex vivo (i.e., aortic ring) and in vivo (i.e., ischemic limb) studies demonstrated that MP therapy enhanced angiogenesis. Third, the remarkably increased blood flow to the ischemic limbs after MP treatment suggests that MPs may also play a principal role in restoring the microcirculation in other ischemia-induced organ injuries. Fourth, lung cancer-derived MPs were more effective than those derived from healthy subjects in enhancing angiogenesis and restoring blood flow in the ischemic regions. Importantly, our in vitro and in vivo studies provided an outcome of scientifically mutual authentication.</p><p>One important finding of the in vitro study using aortic-ring and HUVEC cultures is the angiogenesis-promoting capacity of Lc-MPs. In particular, Lc-MPs were shown to augment HUVEC proliferation and NO production (i.e., an indicator of angiogenesis). Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies that demonstrated MP-induced angiogenesis and differentiation of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another important finding of the present study is the in vitro demonstration of markedly up-regulated VEGFR2 protein expressions in HUVECs after Lc-MP treatment. In contrast, the protein expression of bFGF (i.e., angiogenesis molecules) in HUVECs did not show significant change in with and without Lc-PM treatment. Intriguingly, one recent study has suggested that MPs can act directly through the ligand/receptor interaction or indirectly on angiogenesis by modulating soluble factor production involved in endothelial cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that the PPAR alpha and VEGF family of angiogenic factors and their receptors are essential for MP-induced differentiation and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Additionally, another previous study has shown that circulating levels of PMs and circulating endothelial cells correlated with prognosis, and could be useful as prognostic markers in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this way, our finding is comparable to those of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], suggesting that VEGF receptor may be one of the important signaling pathways in angiogenesis and cell differentiation. Target therapy is one of the common management strategies for advanced NSCLC. Recent data has suggested that anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab is an acceptable palliative drug for advanced NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Accordingly, our data strengthen the support for potential clinical application of anti-VEGF regimen in this setting.</p><p>The most important finding in the present study is that, as compared to the SC group, administration of Lc-MPs to SC animals did not result in any significant change of blood flow in the ischemic limbs. On the other hand, while Hs-MP therapy significantly increased blood flow in the ischemic regions, Lc-MP further significantly enhanced blood flow in the CLI area. The finding, which was first identified by the present study, highlights the superior potency of Lc-MP to that of Hs-MP in enhancing angiogenesis which may help in explaining tumor sprouting and augmented angiogenesis for supporting tumor growth and metastasis. Our findings, therefore, support the finding of the previous study that MPs plays an essential role on the propagation of non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>An essential finding in the current study is that, as compared to animals with ischemic limbs without treatment, Hs-MP substantially enhanced and Lc-MP further boosted the numbers of angiogenesis cells in the ischemic limbs. Another interesting finding in the present study is that the number of small vessels showed an identical pattern of changes compared to that of expression of the angiogenesis cells among these animals. Our findings also reinforce those of previous studies demonstrating enhancement of vasculogenesis after treatment with platelet-derived or ischemic muscle-derived MPs in experimental models of vascular injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Another finding not previously reported is the lack of difference in the number of small vessels and pro-angiogenic cells in the healthy limbs between control animals with and without MP treatment. Again, these findings highlight the therapeutic role of MPs only under the condition of ischemia.</p><p>A principal finding in the present study is that the protein expressions of pro-angiogenic factors were markedly increased in CLI animals with MP treatment as compared to those without. Besides, the expressions of anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic biomarkers were remarkably higher, whereas the apoptotic and fibrotic biomarkers were notably lower in CLI animals with Lc-MP treatment than in those without. Our previous studies have also shown identical pattern of expressions of these biomarkers in CLI animals without treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Another interesting finding is that there was no alternation of these biomarkers between control animals with and without MP treatment. Accordingly, our findings, in addition to being consistent with the results of our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], once more explain the restoration of blood flow after MP treatment in a rodent model of CLI.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This study has limitations. First, the potential long-term side-effect of tumorigenesis from lung cancer-derived MPs was not assessed in the current study. Second, since the present in vitro study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) did not screen for all pro-angiogenic molecules/receptors acted on by Lc-MPs other than VEGFR2 and bFGF, no such information was available. Additionally, the findings from Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> did not allow drawing the conclusion that effects of MPs from healthy subjects were inferior to those from cancer patients. Third, this study focused on the investigation of angiogenesis rather than on the tumor sprouting and metastasis. Fourth, we did not provide the effects of MPs from healthy subjects in Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. Therefore, we did not know how specificity of the effects of Lc-MPs on these biomarkers. Finally, although extensive investigation has been performed in the current study, the exact mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of circulating MPs on improving the CLI are still unclear. The proposed mechanisms by which MP treatment salvaged CLI and improved the blood flow in ischemic area in a rodent CLI model have been summarized in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>

<bold>Determination of the effects of Lc-MPs on Angiogenesis, Proliferation, Nitric Oxide (NO) Production, and Expressions of Angiogenesis Factors.</bold> The procedures for determining angiogenesis were based on our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In brief, HUVECs (10<sup>4</sup> cells) were incubated with MPs (3.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> or 6.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> particles); or vehicle for 72 hours. HUVECs were then plated on 96-well plates at 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in serum-free M199 culture medium mixed with cold Matrigel (Chemicon international) for 5 hour incubation at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Three random images were taken for counting cluster, tube, and network formations. To investigate the effect of Lc-MPs on NO production, examination of NO production in HUVECs were performed by adding 5 &#x000b5;M 4-amino-5-methylamino-2&#x02019;,7&#x02019;-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM Diacetate; Molecular Probes) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. Cells were washed with PBS twice, and counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (0.5 &#x000b5;g/mL, Sigma) for 30 minutes in room temperature. To determine the impact of Lc-MPs on cellular proliferation, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (0.01 mM) was used. Following 48 hours of BrdU incubation, in situ detection was performed using the BrdU In-Situ Detection Kit (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, USA). To determine the impact of MPs on the protein expressions of VEGFR2 and basic-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), two indicators of angiogenesis, HUVECs (5.0&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells) were cultured with low-dose (1.0 x 10<sup>4</sup> particles) and high-dose (5.0 x 10<sup>4</sup> particles) MPs for time courses of 6, 12 and 24 hrs (i.e., Cells were harvested after 6, 12, and 24hrs). Treatment of the HUVECs with the VEGF (50 ng/mL) served as a positive control. The cells then were collected for Western blot analysis.To assess the direct effect of Lc-MPs on angiogenesis in blood vessel, aortic ring (from rat ascending aorta) was cultured with Lc-MPs (i.e., ex vivo test) in M199 culture.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p>Jiunn-Jye Sheu and Fan-Yen Lee contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests of any sort, including commercial association, such as consultancies, stock ownership or other equity interests or patent-licensing arrangements.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JJS, FYL and HKY participated in the design of the study, data acquisition and analysis as well as drafting the manuscript.
