Consuming a cup of coffee is one of the most commonly used ways to combat driver sleepiness. An estimated 80% of the population consumes caffeine-containing beverages, often on a daily basis (Fredholm et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999</xref>; Heckman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is rapidly and completely absorbed in the body within approximately 45&#x000a0;min (Blanchard and Sawers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1983</xref>). It reaches its peak plasma concentration within 15 to 120&#x000a0;min after intake (Arnaud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1987</xref>), averaging around 30&#x000a0;min (O&#x02019;Connell and Zurzola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1984</xref>; Blanchard and Sawers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1983</xref>). Its elimination half life is 1.5 to 9.5&#x000a0;h (Arnaud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1987</xref>; Bonati et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1982</xref>). Although additional mechanisms of action are involved, it is now believed that caffeine&#x02019;s stimulant effects are exerted by antagonizing adenosine, primarily by blocking the adenosine A1 and A2A receptors. Adenosine is considered to be a mediator of sleep (Dunwiddie and Mansino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2001</xref>; Fredholm et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999</xref>).</p><p>A great number of studies have demonstrated effects of caffeine on mood and performance (Childs and De Wit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Christopher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>; Haskell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1987</xref>; Olson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>). However, the effects are complex and depend on the specific tasks examined, dosages, subjects, and test conditions (Lorist and Tops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2003</xref>). Overall, caffeine was found to be specifically effective in restoring performance to baseline levels when individuals are in a state of low arousal, such as seen during the dip in the circadian rhythm, after sleep restriction, and in fatigued subjects (Nehlig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>; Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2002</xref>). Indeed, many people consume coffee with the purpose to refresh or stay awake, for example, when driving a car (Anund et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Vanlaar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>).</p><p>Several driving studies showed that caffeine improves performance and decreases subjective sleepiness both in driving simulators (Biggs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>; Brice and Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>; De Valck and Cluydts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>; Horne and Reyner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1996</xref>; Regina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1974</xref>; Reyner and Horne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>) and on the road (Philip et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>; Sagaspe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>). Most of these studies tested sleep-restricted subjects. In addition, relatively high dosages of caffeine (100&#x02013;300&#x000a0;mg) were examined. These studies showed that relatively high dosages of caffeine had a positive effect on driving performance and reduced driver sleepiness. In real life however, it is more likely that a driver consumes only one cup of coffee (80&#x000a0;mg of caffeine) during a break, before continuing driving. Up to now, the effects on driving performance of lower dosages of caffeine, e.g., a regular cup of coffee, have not been examined.</p><p>Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of one cup of coffee (80&#x000a0;mg caffeine) on prolonged simulated highway driving in non-sleep deprived individuals. Various traffic safety organizations advise drivers to take a 15-min break after 2&#x000a0;h of driving. The protocol used in the current study (2&#x000a0;h driving, a 15-min break with or without consuming caffeinated coffee, followed by 2&#x000a0;h of driving) was based on this advice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. The study was conducted according to the ICH Guidelines for &#x0201c;Good Clinical Practice,&#x0201d; and the Declaration of Helsinki and its latest amendments. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants before taking part in the study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board; no medical ethical approval was required to conduct the study.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-four adult healthy volunteers (12 males and 12 females) were recruited by means of public advertisements at and around Utrecht University campus. Subjects were included if they were healthy volunteers, moderate caffeine drinkers (two to four cups a day), non-smokers, had a body mass index between 21 and 30, possessed a valid driver&#x02019;s license for at least 3&#x000a0;years, and drove more than 5,000&#x000a0;km per year.</p><p>Sleep disturbances were assessed with the SLEEP-50 questionnaire (Spoormaker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>), and excessive daytime sleepiness was examined using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; Johns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1991</xref>), filled out by participants on the screening day.</p><p>Before the start of each test day, urine samples were collected to test for drugs of abuse including amphetamines (including MDMA), barbiturates, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and opiates (Instant-View, Alfa Scientific Designs Inc.) and pregnancy in female subjects (&#x003b2;-HCG test). To test for the presence of alcohol, the Dr&#x000e4;ger Alcotest 7410 Breath Analyzer was used. From 24&#x000a0;h before the start of the test day until completion of the test day, alcohol consumption was not permitted. Caffeinated beverages were not allowed from awakening on test days until the end of the tests.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>Participants were screened and familiarized with the test procedures during a training day. When meeting all inclusion and passing all exclusion criteria, subjects performed a practice session in the STISIM driving simulator and completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (Kennedy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1993</xref>) to identify possible simulator sickness. Included subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment order comprising decaffeinated coffee and caffeinated coffee (80&#x000a0;mg) administered during a break.</p><p>Upon arrival, possible use of drugs or alcohol, pregnancy, illness, and medication were checked. In addition, quality and duration of sleep was assessed using the 14-item Groningen Sleep Quality Scale (Mulder-Hajonides van der Meulen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1980</xref>). When all criteria were met, a 120-min drive in the STISIM driving simulator was conducted. Thereafter, a 15-min break was scheduled in which subjects received the double-blind treatment. After the break, another 120-min driving session was performed. Every hour, subjective assessments of driving quality, driving style, mental effort to perform the test, and sleepiness were conducted. Test sessions were scheduled at the same time for each subject, either in the morning (0800&#x02013;1300&#x000a0;hours) or in the afternoon (1300&#x02013;1700&#x000a0;hours).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatments</title><p>This study aimed to mimic the effect of a cup of coffee drivers consume when having a break along the highway. Treatments were 2.68&#x000a0;g of Nescaf&#x000e9; Gold&#x000ae; instant coffee containing 80&#x000a0;mg caffeine or 2.68&#x000a0;g of Nescaf&#x000e9; Gold&#x000ae; decaffeinated coffee dissolved in 180&#x000a0;ml boiled water. To confirm that each cup of coffee contained 80&#x000a0;mg of caffeine, the amount of caffeine in the instant coffee was determined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu LC-10AT VP equipped with UV&#x02013;Vis detector). The column was a reversed-phase Select B column Lichrocart HPLC C18, 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, length, 0.125&#x000a0;m, &#x000d8;&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.6&#x000a0;mm. All of the procedures were carried out isocratic. The separation was done at room temperature. Caffeine and the spiked matrices were separated with a mobile phase of 20% MeOH and 10&#x000a0;mM HClO<sub>4</sub>, at a flow rate of 0.5&#x000a0;mL/min. The injection volume was 5 &#x003bc;L, and the detection was carried out at 273&#x000a0;nm. The mean (SD) amount of caffeine per gram Nescaf&#x000e9; Goud instant coffee samples (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) was 29.79 (0.656) mg/g. The mean amount of caffeine in decaffeinated coffee was 0.79&#x000a0;mg/g. The accuracy of determinations was 98.1% (SD, 0.56). Because both the precision and the accuracy met up to the requirement demands, all of the results of this HPLC determination can be concluded with certainty.</p><p>Treatments were administered double-blind, and a nose clip was worn to enhance treatment blinding. Drinks were consumed within 5&#x000a0;min, starting from 5&#x000a0;min after onset of the break.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>STISIM highway driving test</title><p>Driving tests were performed in a fixed-base driving simulator employing STISIM Drive&#x02122; (version M300, Systems Technology Inc., Hawthorne, CA, USA). This is an interactive system in which the roadway scenery is projected on a screen (2.10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.58&#x000a0;m), 1.90&#x000a0;m in front of the center of the steering wheel of the car unit (Mets et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011a</xref>). The 100-km highway driving test scenarios were developed (EyeOctopus BV) in accordance with Dutch traffic situations, including a two-lane highway in each direction and a monotonous environment with trees, occasional hills and bridges, and other traffic. The duration of each 100-km scenario is approximately 60&#x000a0;min. Two scenarios (200&#x000a0;km) were conducted before a 15-min break, and two other scenarios (200&#x000a0;km) thereafter (Mets et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011a</xref>).</p><p>Subjects were instructed to drive with a steady lateral position within the right, slower, traffic lane with a constant speed of 95&#x000a0;km/h. Overtaking slower-moving vehicles was allowed. During blinded editing, these maneuvers were removed from the data, before statistical analysis of the &#x0201c;clean&#x0201d; data. The primary outcome variable was the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP, centimeters), expressing the weaving of the car (Verster and Roth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). The standard deviation of speed (SDS, kilometers per hour) was the secondary outcome measure. Mean speed (MS, kilometers per hour) and mean lateral position (MLP, cm) were control variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Subjective assessments</title><p>After each hour of driving, questionnaires were administered on subjective sleepiness and driving performance.

For each variable, mean (SD) was computed for each subsequent hour. Data of the first 2&#x000a0;h were compared, to confirm that no significant differences between the treatment days were present before the break and treatment administration. To determine whether caffeinated coffee has an effect on driving performance, data from the third and fourth hour were compared using a general linear model for repeated measures (two-tailed, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 24 subjects (12 males and 12 females) completed the study.

The effect on SDLP of caffeinated coffee, compared to placebo, is comparable to changes observed with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% (Mets et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011b</xref>), i.e., the legal limit for driving in many countries, but in the opposite direction. Hence, the improvement by caffeinated coffee can be regarded as clinically relevant.</p><p>The magnitude of driving improvement observed after coffee consumption was comparable to the improvement seen in a driving study with Red Bull&#x000ae; Energy Drink using the same design and driving test (Mets et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011a</xref>), and on-road driving studies showing improvement after administration of methylphenidate to patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (Verster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008</xref>).</p><p>The improvement in objective performance was accompanied by improvement in subjective assessments of sleepiness and driving performance. An average decrease of almost 2 points (out of 7) on the KSS scale was observed after the intake of caffeinated coffee as compared to decaffeinated coffee. The average KSS score was 6 (&#x0201c;some signs of sleepiness&#x0201d;) in the decaffeinated coffee condition compared to 4 (&#x0201c;rather alert&#x0201d;) in the caffeinated coffee condition. These findings are in agreement with the pharmacokinetic profile of caffeine (Tmax&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;min; T1/2&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;h), as well as with the known actions of caffeine as a sleepiness countermeasure with the ability to restore performance to baseline.</p><p>Up to now, higher dosages of caffeine (150&#x02013;250&#x000a0;mg, comparable to two to three cups of regular coffee) have been shown to be effective in counteracting sleep restriction (&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;h spent in bed) when driving in the early morning (Reyner and Horne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>) and in the early afternoon (Horne and Reyner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1996</xref>; Reyner and Horne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1997</xref>). A moderate caffeine dosage (100&#x000a0;mg) decreased drifting out of lane and reduced subjective sleepiness in drivers who had slept for no more than 4&#x000a0;h (Biggs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>). Furthermore, caffeine (3&#x000a0;mg/kg, approximately 225&#x000a0;mg in a 75-kg adult) improved steering accuracy in non-fatigued volunteers (Brice and Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>). Slow release caffeine capsules (300&#x000a0;mg) had similar effects (De Valck and Cluydts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>). Interestingly, caffeine decreased lane drifting both in individuals who had spent 4.5&#x000a0;h in bed and in those who had spent 7.5&#x000a0;h in bed, while effects on speed maintenance, fatigue, and sleepiness were only observed after 4.5&#x000a0;h spent in bed (De Valck and Cluydts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>). Two on-the-road driving studies on a public highway in France confirmed these findings and showed that relatively high dosages of caffeine (200&#x000a0;mg) improved nighttime driving both in young and in middle-aged drivers (Philip et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>; Sagaspe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>).</p><p>The current results are in agreement with these studies, but further show that lower caffeine content found in one regular cup of coffee also significantly improves driving performance and reduces driver sleepiness. In addition, where studies find effects on lane keeping, the current study shows that speed maintenance is also affected, indicating more pronounced effects on vehicle control. The importance of this finding is evident, since it can be assumed that in order to refresh, most drivers consume only one cup of coffee during a break, instead of three or four. Driving simulator research has several limitations, which are discussed elsewhere (e.g., Mets et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011b</xref>; Verster and Roth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>). Therefore, it is important to replicate and confirm our findings in an on-the-road driving study. Furthermore, subjects who were tested in the afternoon may have had an additional effect of the afternoon dip in the circadian rhythm. For this reason, each subject had his test days at the same time of day. However, no significant differences were found between subjects tested in the morning and those tested in the afternoon. Further studies could examine if a low dose of caffeine has similar effects on (professional) drivers who are sleep-restricted or shifted their day&#x02013;night rhythm, since current studies have only been performed with higher dosages of caffeine.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that one cup of caffeinated coffee (80&#x000a0;mg caffeine) has a positive effect on continuous highway driving in non-sleep restricted, healthy volunteers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Lucien Bus for advice on the manuscript and
