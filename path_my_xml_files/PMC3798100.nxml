Twenty-seven patients participated in this open-label, randomized, single-and multiple-dose, crossover study. The pharmacodynamic models included a biophase effect site with a sigmoid E<sub>max</sub> transduction for tapping and UPDRS and an ordered categorical model for dyskinesia. The pharmacodynamics of LD was characterized by a conduction function with a half-life of 0.59 hours for tapping rate, and 0.4 hours for UPDRS Part III and dyskinesia. The LD concentration for half-maximal effect was 1530 ng/mL, 810 ng/mL, and 600 ng/mL for tapping rate, UPDRS Part III, and dyskinesia, respectively. The sigmoidicity of the transduction was 1.53, 2.5, and 2.1 for tapping rate, UPDRS Part III, and dyskinesia, respectively. External validation of the pharmacodynamic model using tapping rate indicated good performance of the model.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>IPX066</kwd><kwd>levodopa</kwd><kwd>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 1&#x02013;2% of the population above 60 years of age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> The cardinal clinical manifestations of PD are resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait dysfunction. During the early stages of the disease, about 70% of patients may experience a slight tremor. Bradykinesia is described as a general reduction in spontaneous movement, and can cause difficulty with repetitive movements, such as finger tapping. Rigidity may cause stiffness of the limbs, neck, and trunk and may affect walking. The Unified Parkinson&#x02019;s disease rating scale (UPDRS) is a scale developed by the Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Rating Scales for Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> This scale provides an efficient and flexible means of monitoring PD-related disability and impairment, and has been used in studies of early, mild, moderate, and advanced disease with motor fluctuations. The total UPDRS scale comprises four components: Part I, Mentation, Behavior, and Mood; Part II, Activities of Daily Living; Part III, Motor; Part IV, Complications of therapy.</p><p>Levodopa (LD), combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor such as carbidopa (CD) or benserazide, continues to be an important mainstay in the symptomatic treatment of PD. No other medicinal or surgical therapy currently available has been shown to provide antiparkinsonian benefits superior to those achieved with LD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> During the early stages of the disease, immediate release (IR) LD provides a stable response and has an adequate duration of effect. However, as the disease progresses and with continued LD therapy, the duration of effect from each dose progressively decreases and begins to approximate the plasma half-life of the drug. Eventually, patients may fluctuate between periods of &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; when the subject&#x02019;s medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness, stiffness, and periods of &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; which is defined as the state when the medication has worn off and is no longer providing benefit. A majority of patients treated with LD will experience motor fluctuations, dyskinesia or other complications within 5 years of treatment. Dyskinesias are involuntary twisting, turning movements which are an effect of medication and occur during the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; state. Non-troublesome dyskinesias do not interfere with function or cause meaningful discomfort. Troublesome dyskinesias interfere with function or cause meaningful discomfort.</p><p>Although several controlled-release (CR) formulations of LD (with CD or benserazide) have been developed, these formulations are associated with erratic absorption and variable LD plasma concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> In addition, the latency to onset of motor improvement is typically 30&#x02013;90 minutes for the IR formulation and 60&#x02013;180 minutes with the CR formulation due to the slower absorption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Thus, CR CD&#x02013;LD is commonly administered with IR CD&#x02013;LD in patients with fluctuations to improve the control of PD symptoms, particularly for the first dose in the morning.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></p><p>IPX066 is a multiparticulate extended-release (ER) oral capsule formulation of CD&#x02013;LD. The CD:LD ratio is 1:4 similar to current CD&#x02013;LD products. The formulation is designed to provide a rapid initial absorption of LD to achieve therapeutic concentrations of LD and maintain these therapeutic concentrations for an extended duration to assure an early &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; state and sustained efficacy. Pharmacokinetic properties of this formulation and the associated efficacy in patients have been reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> This report focuses on the development of population pharmacodynamic models for IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD in patients with advanced idiopathic PD.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The design of this Phase 2 study has been reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Briefly, this was an open-label, multicenter, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, single-and multiple-dose, crossover study comparing IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD in patients with idiopathic PD with motor fluctuations. The protocol was approved by the investigational review boards of the participating institutions, subjects provided informed consent, and the study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles that are consistent with good clinical practice. Subjects were randomized to one of two dosing sequences: IPX066 followed by IR CD&#x02013;LD or IR CD&#x02013;LD followed by IPX066. During each treatment period, subjects received 8 days of medication. During the IR CD&#x02013;LD treatment, patients continued therapy according to their prestudy LD regimen, with dose adjustments for excluded COMT inhibitors and other LD formulations. Subjects were assigned their initial IPX066 regimen by the investigator based on a dosage conversion table, with IPX066 dosed approximately every 6 hours. The suggested initial conversion for IPX066 was designed to achieve similar peak concentrations of LD for the IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD regimens. Pharmacokinetic and efficacy/pharmacodynamic measurements were assessed in the clinic following a single dose (Day 1) and following multiple dosing (Day 8) of each treatment period. Tapping speed, a surrogate measure of bradykinesia,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> was measured by the number of times in 1 minute the subjects could alternatively tap two counter keys 20 cm apart with the most affected arm. Walking speed was assessed as the time required to rise from a chair, walk 6 m, turn, and to return to a sitting position. On Day 1, tapping and walking assessments were conducted every 30 minutes, beginning 1 hour before and for 8 hours after dosing. On Day 8, assessments were conducted for 12 hours. Motor function was assessed using the Motor Examination portion (Part III; 14 questions) of the UPDRS. Each subject also completed a PD diary using the Hauser diary<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> on three consecutive days immediately prior to the first treatment and at the end of each treatment period (Days 5, 6, and 7). In addition, the investigator staff evaluated each subject every 30 minutes on Day 1 and every hour on Day 8 during the clinic visits to assess the degree of motor effect (ON/OFF) and dyskinesia. In order to maintain similar predose conditions between the two treatment periods on Day 1, subjects returned to their prestudy anti-PD regimens for approximately 1 week between the two treatment periods, and stopped taking CD&#x02013;LD after 10:00 pm prior to the Day 1 clinic dose of each treatment period. Prior to the Day 8 visits of each treatment period, subjects were allowed to take study medications as needed. Since several patients were unable to initiate or complete the timed walk, the pharmacodynamic modeling focused on tapping rate, UPDRS Part III, and investigator-rating of ON/OFF, including dyskinesia.</p></sec><sec><title>Tapping and UPDRS Modeling</title><p>Studies have suggested a time delay between the plasma LD concentration and pharmacodynamic response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> This time delay may be modeled by linking the plasma concentration to a biophase effect site concentration, c<sub>e</sub>(t), by means of a conduction function,

In addition, Hoehn and Yahr stage was examined as a categorical covariate for tapping rate and for UPDRS Part III. Additional covariates, such as gender and race, were not examined since this was a small study (n = 27 subjects) and a majority of the subjects were males (78%) and Caucasian (89%).

The pharmacodynamic responses evaluated in the study are endpoints that are commonly used to evaluate the effect of LD in PD. Tapping speed is an objective, quantitative measure of dexterity that has been used as a surrogate measure of bradykinesia, one of the cardinal motor symptoms of PD. The UPDRS Part III provides an efficient means of quantitatively assessing PD-related motor disability and impairment by the clinician. This endpoint has been used in studies of early, mild, moderate, and advanced disease with motor fluctuations. In addition, the study included investigator assessments of &#x0201c;OFF,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;ON,&#x0201d; and dyskinesia, which are direct outcomes of LD therapy.</p><p>The pharmacodynamic parameters estimated in the present study for tapping rate (E<sub>max</sub> 93.7 taps/minute; EC<sub>50</sub> 1590 ng/mL, k<sub>eo</sub> 1.80 hour<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) are comparable to those reported by Nelson et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> who reported an E<sub>max</sub> of 93.3 taps/minute and an EC<sub>50</sub> of 1.6 mcg/mL in a study characterizing the pharmacodynamics of CR CD&#x02013;LD (Sinemet&#x000ae; CR4) in PD patients. Similarly, Triggs et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> reported equilibrium half-life values of 173 and 43.3 minutes, and EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.35 and 1.4 mcg/mL in patients with Hoehn and Yahr scores of 1 and 4, respectively.</p><p>The pharmacodynamic parameters estimated in the present study for UPDRS Part III (E<sub>max</sub> 63% of E<sub>0</sub>; EC<sub>50</sub> 812 ng/mL; k<sub>eo</sub> 1.80 hour<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; &#x003b3; 2.5) are comparable to those reported by Troc&#x000f3;niz et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (E<sub>max</sub> 49% of E<sub>0</sub>; EC<sub>50</sub> 951 ng/mL; k<sub>eo</sub> 2.01 hour<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; &#x003b3; 6.2). In a recent study, Adamiak et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects (UPDRS Part III) of LD in 14 patients with advanced PD at Hoehn and Yahr Stage 2 and 3. In their study, these investigators estimated an E<sub>max</sub> value of 23 and 29 for patients at Hoehn and Yahr Stage 2 and 3, respectively. Estimated values of EC<sub>50</sub> were 601 ng/mL and 756 ng/mL, respectively. These values are comparable to those noted in the present study. However, Adamiak and colleagues reported Hill coefficient values of 4 and 9 for patients at Hoehn and Yahr Stage 2 and 3, respectively. The Hill coefficients reported by these authors were larger than that noted in the present study or those reported by Troc&#x000f3;niz.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> Both the present analysis and that by Troc&#x000f3;niz<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> employed a mixed effect population approach whereas Adamiak et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> used a two stage approach, which may have contributed to the wider variability in estimation of the Hill coefficient. However, all these models suggest a steep exposure&#x02013;response relationship.</p><p>Comparison of the pharmacodynamic parameters for tapping rate and UPDRS Part III indicates that both pharmacodynamic measures have generally similar equilibration rate constants (k<sub>eo</sub>) with half-lives of approximating 20 minutes and 40 minutes. These results are consistent with those reported with various other pharmacodynamic measures in PD (tapping, UPDRS, walking, sum of Columbia University Rating Scale).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref></p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> presents the time to onset of effect and duration of effect for IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD estimated using the final pharmacodynamic parameter estimates (tapping and UPDRS Part III). A change of &#x02265;15% from baseline in tapping rate and in UPDRS Part III score was defined as &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; for efficacy. Previous studies have used a similar criterion of 10% or 15% change from baseline in defining effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> The onset of treatment effect was rapid and generally comparable for IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD.

The duration of effect was approximately 2 hours longer with IPX066 compared to IR CD&#x02013;LD whether measured using tapping or UPDRS Part III. Consequently, the baseline effect on Day 8 was higher with IPX066 than with IR CD&#x02013;LD, consistent with the ER properties of IPX066 (Supplementary Materials <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>).

The current model assumed that the intrinsic tapping rate is constant across the day and that any potential diurnal effects could not be distinguished from the drug effect. There are conflicting reports on the diurnal response to oral LD. Frankel et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> evaluated the diurnal variation in the duration and magnitude of motor response to standard LD in PD. Motor response to LD did not differ significantly in the morning and afternoon, and the relationship between plasma LD concentrations and motor function was the same following morning and afternoon doses suggesting that there may not be a significant diurnal effect. LD PD models that have incorporated diurnal effects have involved modeling diurnal variation in the endogenous LD synthesis. The data have typically been from infusion studies involving multiple-day assessments with periods of LD administration and periods of no LD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> The contribution of the diurnal variation in the endogenous LD synthesis to the pharmacodynamic effect has generally been small compared to the overall drug effect. Although Nutt et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> noted a significant decrease in tapping rate in the 15:00&#x02013;18:00 and 19:00&#x02013;22:00 time intervals compared to the 7:00&#x02013;10:00 and 11:00&#x02013;14:00 time intervals, the difference in mean tapping rate was approximately 30 taps/minute and these authors did not account for the potential effects of fatigue later in the day.</p><p>Although some previous studies have included tolerance in describing LD pharmacodynamics, the final UPDRS model in the present analysis characterizing the acute effects of LD did not include tolerance. This may be justified based on the fact that the subjects in the present study had been on a stable dose of CD&#x02013;LD for an extended period of time prior to entry into the study and it is unlikely that tolerance would be noted over the 1-week study period. As a placebo treatment was not included in the current study, the dynamics of a placebo response cannot be identified. The current pharmacodynamic analysis also employed a single pharmacodynamic relationship for IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD in the final model. During model development, an examination was made to determine if inclusion of a treatment effect on the pharmacodynamic parameters improved the pharmacodynamic fits. Inclusion of treatment effects on E<sub>max</sub> or EC<sub>50</sub> resulted in no statistically significant decrease in the objective function, so a single pharmacodynamic relationship for IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD was employed in the final model.</p><p>The incidence of patients reporting troublesome dyskinesia in the present study was relatively low. Although the logit model adequately described the dyskinesia response, it assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed. It is likely that this may not be the case since the probability that a subject is in a given response state depends on what state they were in 30 minutes earlier. Mean daily doses of LD were 3054.4 and 816.7 for IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD, respectively, with peak LD plasma concentrations of 3000 ng/mL and 2360 ng/mL for IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Based on the concentration&#x02013;effect relationship these concentrations are on the asymptote and hence may explain the lack of a difference in the degree of dyskinesia between IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD in spite of the higher LD dose with IPX066. Patients enrolled in the study were required to have been on a stable dose of CD&#x02013;LD prior to their entry in the study, and hence likely to have been on a regimen designed to minimize troublesome dyskinesia.</p><p>The concentration&#x02013;effect relationship for IPX066 is comparable to IR CD&#x02013;LD for tapping and UPDRS Part III. IPX066 had an estimated onset of effect within approximately 20&#x02013;40 minutes of administration, comparable to that noted with IR CD&#x02013;LD. The estimated duration of effect for IPX066 was approximately 2&#x02013;3 hours longer than that for IR CD&#x02013;LD. The longer duration of effect is consistent with the sustained LD plasma-concentration profile from IPX066. The incidence of dyskinesia was low for both LD products.</p><p>The pharmacodynamic models indicate that the concentration&#x02013;effect relationship for LD is similar for IPX066 and IR CD&#x02013;LD. The rapid onset and longer duration of effect with IPX066 are a result of the LD concentration profile. The favorable pharmacodynamic effects noted with IPX066 in this short-term study in advanced PD patients merit further examination in longer term studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by Impax Pharmaceuticals, a division of Impax Laboratories, Inc.
