In retrospective observational study, six RRP patients who received the quadrivalent HPV vaccine and whose HPV seroreactivity was measured were included. Multiplex HPV Serology was used to determine HPV-specific antibodies pre- and post-vaccination. Surgical interventions and patient records were analyzed. Five HPV6 and 1 HPV11 infected patient were included. Mean antibody reactivity against the associated HPV type rose from 1125 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) pre-vaccination to 4690 MFI post-vaccination (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). Median post-vaccination follow-up was 4&#x000a0;years. Poisson regression analysis showed that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine decreased the incidence rate of surgeries. The immune system of RRP patients is able to increase antibody reactivity against the associated HPV type. A double blind randomized controlled trial is needed to determine whether this immunological increase can cause decrease in number of surgeries.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Therapeutic drug</kwd><kwd>Immunology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection with a subset of human papillomaviruses (HPV) can cause anogenital cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, condylomata acuminata and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since 2006 many national vaccination programs have started with the bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a., Rixensart, Belgium) or the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Merck &#x00026; co, Whitehouse Station, USA) targeting high-risk oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. Papillomavirus vaccines are generally safe and highly effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is a subunit vaccine composed of the major capsid protein L1 primarily in the form of&#x000a0;virus-like particles (VLPs) of low-risk HPV6 and 11 and high-risk HPV16 and 18. HPV6 and 11 cause 90&#x000a0;% of genital warts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is expected that preventive global use of this HPV vaccine against cervical cancer will decrease the incidence of HPV6 and HPV11 related disease worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a wart-like disease characterized by its unpredictable clinical course. It is associated with HPV6 and 11 for 80&#x02013;100&#x000a0;% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therapy focuses on repeated surgical removal of exophytic lesions. Some patients may need over a 100 surgical interventions to keep the airway open and the voice sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Antibody response after vaccination with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine is higher than after natural infection in patients with high-risk HPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Little is known about the antibody response for low-risk HPV. Increased seroreactivity after vaccination in RRP patients was only addressed in two case reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. After vaccination with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, HPV seropositive women were protected against&#x000a0;cervical and anogenital diseases from the corresponding HPV type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, vaccination of RRP patients could be a potential treatment against HPV re-infection or auto-inoculation. In this independent exploratory study we investigated whether vaccination with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine results in increase of antibodies against the associated viruses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Patients included in this retrospective cohort study were clinically treated off-label with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine; there was no scientific intent.

Blood samples were analyzed by the multiplex human papillomavirus serology, based on in situ-purified glutathione S-transferase proteins, as described by Waterboer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Briefly, full-length L1 proteins were bacterially expressed as fusion proteins with N terminal glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and a C terminal tagging peptide (tag) and were affinity-purified in situ from cleared bacterial lysates through binding to glutathione casein-coated fluorescence-labeled polystyrene beads. A fusion protein consisting of GST and tag (GST-tag) without intervening viral antigen served for background determination. Each fusion protein was bound to a spectrally distinct bead set. Fusion protein-loaded bead sets were mixed. Sera were pre-incubated at 1:50 dilution in PBS containing 1&#x000a0;mg/mL casein, 2&#x000a0;mg/mL lysate from bacteria expressing GST-tag alone to block antibodies directed against residual bacterial proteins and GST-tag, 0.5&#x000a0;% polyvinylalcohol (PVA, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie Gmbh Munich, Germany), 0.8&#x000a0;% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie Gmbh Munich, Germany) and 2.5&#x000a0;% Superchemiblock (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to suppress unspecific binding of antibodies to the beads themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Serum dilutions were incubated with the same volume of mixed bead sets, resulting in a final serum dilution of 1:100. Bound antibodies were detected with biotinylated goat-antihuman IgG (H&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;L) secondary antibody and streptavidin-<italic>R</italic>-phycoerythrin. A Luminex analyser (xMAP, Luminex Corp., Austin, TX, USA) was used to identify the internal color of the individual beads and to quantify their reporter fluorescence (expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of at least 100 beads per set per serum). Antibody reactivity, i.e. the amount of antigen-specific antibody bound per bead is expressed as net MFI values calculated as difference of MFI with HPV-protein minus MFI with GST-tag.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses were performed using PASW statistics version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p><p>Categorical variables are presented as number (percentage).

Nonetheless there is still no curative therapy for RRP patients. The primary goal of this exploratory study was to monitor effectiveness of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine during treatment of RRP as determined by increased seroreactivity. This is the first study that shows that vaccination of a group of RRP patients with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine results in increased seroreactivity against associated viruses.</p><p>Five of six patients were infected with low-risk HPV6, one was infected with low-risk HPV11. The ratio between HPV6 and HPV11 differs per cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], probably because of geographical spread of both viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This research consisted of both JoRRP and AoRRP patients. The immunological response is therefore representable for both groups. A difference in immune response is not expected. RRP patients with a pre-vaccination history of 1&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years were included.</p><p>The presented data show that RRP patients with HPV6 and HPV11 have low levels of seroreactivity against these viruses despite many years of disease. After administration of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine HPV seroreactivity against the causal HPV type rose in every patient. The vaccination induced higher seroreactivity than the natural infection in the same patients. Theoretically this induced increase in seroreactivity might influence the clinical course of RRP by intensifying immune response and preventing re-infection.</p><p>This study is the first study to measure seroreactivity in a group of RRP patients. Results could be biased due to the small sample size and short follow-up. An effect of other adjuvant therapy on immunological response was not expected as patients did not receive any adjuvant therapy 1&#x000a0;month before, neither during or after vaccination. More research is needed to analyze the duration of the immunological response.</p><p>Chirila et al. concluded that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was effective to diminish the recurrence rate of RRP in 85&#x000a0;% of patients, although that study was retrospective and lacked a control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore the natural decreasing surgical rate of RRP was not taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is unknown if there is a immune response after vaccination which explains a clinical response, therefore this study was conducted. The clinical response described in this article was only used for a power analysis for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT), as the sample size was too small to analyze the clinical course and to correct for the natural clinical course and other therapies (e.g. cidofovir). A RCT is needed to draw conclusions on the real clinical effect of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. The proposed sample size for a trial with a follow-up of 2&#x000a0;years should be 29 patients per group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>RRP patients increase seroreactivity against the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, regardless of their age, age of onset, HPV type and severity of disease. Antibody reactivities to the associated viruses of all patients rose significantly. A double-blinded randomized controlled trial is needed to evaluate the effect of this vaccination on the clinical course. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine could be of future help in the treatment of RRP, as this research showed that vaccination causes a robust immunological response.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>R.
