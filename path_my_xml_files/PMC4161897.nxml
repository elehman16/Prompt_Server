Often considerable doses of insulin are needed and weight gain and hypoglycemia can occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4-inhibitor) vildagliptin is an oral glucose-lowering drug that leads to glucose-dependent insulin secretion and improvement of alpha cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and less hypoglycemia was shown in a previous study adding vildagliptin on top off an existing insulin regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Multiple randomized-controlled trials investigating the effect of DPP4-inhibitor added to existing insulin have been performed since [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; however, no data exist about vildagliptin use at the start of insulin treatment in patients with Type 2 DM. Adding a DPP4-inhibitor at the beginning of insulin treatment could especially be interesting because it is during this period that considerable residual beta cell function is still present. The benefit of such a strategy could be a lower insulin dose necessary for glycemic control. To study this, we titrated insulin in all patients to the best achievable degree of glycemic control. Therefore, we did not use HbA1c as the primary end-point, as most previous studies on DPP4-inhibitors and insulin did, but the required insulin dose instead.</p><p>The aim of the study was to investigate whether or not the addition of a DPP4-inhibitor to start of insulin treatment could lead to lower exogenous insulin requirements together with lower glucose variability, less weight gain, less hypoglycemia, and improved insulin and glucagon dynamics after a mixed meal test through improvement in alpha and beta cell function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this study 19 patients were screened and 4 excluded (reasons for exclusion in (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

None of these events were considered to be severe or related to the study medication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study investigating the addition of a DPP4-inhibitor to the <italic>start</italic> of once-daily long-acting insulin in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients. Although this study was set up as a double-blind parallel-arm placebo-controlled trial, the sample size is limited and therefore we cannot make conclusions about the effect of addition of vildagliptin on units of insulin at the end of the study, variability, weight, hypoglycemia or response of insulin, C-peptide or glucagon after a mixed meal test.</p><p>This important limitation is due to difficulties in patient recruitment. In the Netherlands, most patients starting with once-daily insulin are treated by a general practitioner and not in an (academic) hospital, where this study was performed. Despite extensive collaboration with many general practitioners and hospitals in the region, patients were still difficult to recruit. The small sample size is therefore too small to have statistical power to confirm or reject the null hypothesis.</p><p>However, given the working mechanism of DPP4-inihibitors and our small sample size, we think it would be very interesting to investigate our hypothesis in a larger study. Our small study could potentially serve as a guidance for such larger studies. From our data it can be derived that a repeat study would need approximately 46 patients per group. This is based on a median units of insulin of 40 (SD 17) and 10 units of insulin decrease, which would be clinically significant (and 25% is comparable to the difference in median units of insulin in our study of 28%). This sample size calculation must be considered as a rough estimation, given the small sample size and not-normal distribution of our main end-point, but at this moment the best estimation available.</p><p>Besides the smaller sample size our study differs in two major design aspects from previous randomized-controlled trials. First, previous trials investigated the effect of add-on DPP4-inhibition therapy to <italic>existing</italic> insulin regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], whereas we investigated the addition of vildagliptin to the <italic>start</italic> of insulin therapy in our study. We hypothesized that adding a DPP4-inhibitor to start of insulin treatment could lead to less exogenous insulin requirements. This could lead to a reduction of hyperinsulinemia, which is thought to have atherogenic and mitogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, lower insulin use could reduce side effects of insulin treatment such as hypoglycemia and weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The addition of a DPP4-inhibitor to an existing insulin treatment without the intention to change the insulin regimen as previous trials did does not reflect clinical practice in which physicians will choose to alter insulin schedules. Only in one randomized trial the insulin dose was changed as a goal in one arm (insulin-increasing arm) and compared to the addition of sitagliptin to existing insulin regimen. In that trial, a difference of 25% in insulin dose was described between the insulin-increasing and the insulin-sitagliptin group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] together with a more pronounced HbA1c decrease in the sitagliptin group. The 25% decrease in units of insulin found in that study is comparable to the magnitude (28%) we found.</p><p>Second, we used a different end-point compared to previous trials. In randomized-controlled trials about the effect of the addition of DPP4-inhibitors to insulin thus far, HbA1c or glycemic control were used as primary end-point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We chose required units of insulin since, in our study, we added vildagliptin to the start of insulin and we aimed at the best glycemic control with insulin glargine in all patients.</p><p>Because a lower insulin dose may lead to less side effects, we also investigated these as secondary end-points. The first was hypoglycemia. With improvement of glycemic control, the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes was expected to increase. This was indeed observed in a study using sitagliptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In contrast, a study by Fonseca et al. showed less hypoglycemia together with a decrease in HbA1c when vildagliptin was added to an insulin regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], although this could not be confirmed in a study by Kothny et al., using the same DPP4-inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Less hypoglycemia, as shown in the study by Fonseca, could be a result of an improved alpha cell function, which has been described not only postprandial (reduction in glucagon) but also during the reaction after induced hypoglycemia when a slightly increased increment of glucagon was seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In our study occurrence of hypoglycemia was low in both groups. The second secondary end-point studied was weight. In contrast to GLP1-analoga, DPP4-inhibitors do not show a large effect on weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Differences in body weight were not shown in previous randomized-controlled trials with DPP4 inhibitors in combination with insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], except for one study which compared insulin-increasing therapy with addition of sitagliptin to existing insulin regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The design of that study most resembled ours, and it also found a difference in required units of insulin between the groups. Furthermore, that study showed less weight increase in the DPP4 addition group (between-group difference 1.7&#x000a0;kg in favour of the DPP4-group, which is in concordance in magnitude with our findings (vildagliptin group (+0.5&#x000a0;kg), placebo group (+3&#x000a0;kg).</p><p>We also studied additional end-points, including glucose variability. We hypothesize that since variability is determined by hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic excursions, effects on alpha cell function could result in less glucose variability. A decrease in postprandial glucagon could reduce hyperglycemic excursions, while an increase in glucagon response following a hypoglycemia could reduce a hypoglycemic excursion. A decrease in variability has been reported before from single-arm trials, investigating the effect of addition of a DPP4-inhibitor to insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In our study, median glycemic variability (SD) at the end of the study was 2.1 in the placebo group and 1.5 in the vildagliptin group. We evaluated responses of insulin, C-peptide and glucagon during a mixed meal test, which were comparable in our study. It is difficult to assess insulin and glucagon dynamics in patients taking insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. All patients were on stable insulin dose, titrated at the fasting glucose levels and all patients were fasting. However, since exogenous insulin was present at time of testing because all patients took their glargine at bedtime the day before the testing, we cannot exclude that measurements are confounded by exogenous insulin. Since GLP1 could also have an effect on cardiovascular parameters, these were also included as an endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Levels for blood pressure, LDL and skin autofluorescence were comparable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This small randomized study did not have sufficient power to detect effects of the addition of vildagliptin to the beginning of once daily long-acting insulin.

Consecutive patients were allocated to the two different groups using two computer-generated randomized lists (block size 4), which were stored in sealed envelopes. Randomization and distribution of blinded study medication was performed by a person not related to the study (pharmacy). Patients and care providers were unaware of the randomization code.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Treatment</title><p>Besides the study medication, all patients started with once daily long-acting insulin glargine at bedtime in combination with a fixed dose of metformin (twice daily 850&#x000a0;mg). Other glucose lowering drugs were terminated. The combination with metformin was used since this is standardized approach in Dutch clinical practice. The dose of insulin glargine was protocolized and titrated based on daily fasting blood glucose measurements of the patients and an algorithm comparable to the one published by Davies et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In short, all patients started with 8 units insulin glargine at bedtime and performed daily fasting glucose measurements. The insulin dose was increased based on the mean of the last glucose measurements. This was performed twice a week for the first 3&#x000a0;weeks and once a week during the remainder of the study. The insulin dose was raised as follows: mean glucose 5.5-6.7&#x000a0;mmol/L: raise of 0&#x02013;2 units, 6.7-7.8&#x000a0;mmol/L: 2 units, 7.8-10&#x000a0;mmol/L: 4 units, &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;mmol/L: 6&#x02013;8 units increase. The dose was only raised in the absence of hypoglycemia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome: units of insulin at the end of the study.</p><p>Secondary outcomes: 1) glycemic variability estimated by the standard deviation (SD) of 48&#x000a0;hours glucose values at the end of the study as measured by three days blinded continuous glucose measurement (CGM)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] 2) change in weight 3) hypoglycemia (defined as the total number of hypoglycemia during the study period (any glucose self-measurement&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4.0&#x000a0;mmol/L or symptoms which the patients recognises as hypoglycemia and clinically judged by the investigator as hypoglycemia)) 4) severe hypoglycemia (defined by help needed from others, seizure, or coma) 5) alpha and beta cell function (between group comparison of glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon levels, measured after standardised meal) 6) cardiovascular analysis; change in blood pressure (mean ambulant 24&#x000a0;hour arterial pressure) and change in plasma lipids 7) change in skin Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (measured as skin-autofluorescence by the AGE-reader) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Adverse events (AE): any (worsening of an) undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition that was noted by the patient occurring after starting the study drug even if the event was not considered to be related to the study drug.</p><p>Serious adverse events (SAE): AE judged as medically significant, requiring in-patient hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, or resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or are life-threatening or fatal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Age, BMI, duration of DM, medication use, history of diabetic complications, blood pressure, prior hypoglycemia (defined as symptomatic hypoglycemia in the past year), HbA1c, glucose variability and laboratory values were recorded at baseline. Patients were seen every 4&#x000a0;weeks in the out-patient clinic in our academic hospital and with telephone consultation every week. Drug accountability and laboratory measurements were performed at 8 and 16&#x000a0;weeks. CGM and ambulant blood pressure measurement were repeated at the end of the study. At the end of the study a standardised mixed meal test (MMT) was performed. Patients arrived fasting at the outpatient clinic and took their medication (metformin and study medication) at t&#x02009;=&#x02009;0, after blood samples were drawn as a baseline (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;0). At t&#x02009;=&#x02009;30 blood samples were drawn again and they consumed a standardized breakfast within 15&#x000a0;minutes (containing 522 Kcal; 27 gr protein, 60 gr carbohydrates, 18 gr fat). Blood samples for glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon were then drawn at t&#x02009;=&#x02009;45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 210&#x000a0;minutes. Insulin and C-peptide were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Modular E170 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, D-68298 Mannheim, Germany). Finally glucagon was measured with a competitive radioimmunoassay (Glucagon KGND1, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc, Los Angeles, USA).</p><p>The study was conducted using Good Clinical Practice according to the declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the UMCUtrecht and all patients provided written informed consent. This investigator-driven study was designed, performed and analysed by the researchers of the UMCUtrecht. Novartis provided study medication and a research grant. The protocol of this trial was published before start of the trial at www.trialregister.nl (NTR2022).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The group size was based on the primary study parameter: the absolute difference in daily insulin dose of long-acting insulin between the two groups at the end of the trial. A previous study in patients starting on once-daily insulin showed a mean insulin glargine dose of 57 +/&#x02212; 15 units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A meaningful decrease would be a difference of at least 14 units. A similar decrease (25%) in insulin dose has been observed when adding metformin to existing insulin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. With a beta of 0.2 and a one-sided alpha of 0.05, the minimum number of patients in each group is 15. To correct for unforeseen circumstances, we planned to include 20 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistics</title><p>Results are presented as median and range, categorical parameters as percentages.
