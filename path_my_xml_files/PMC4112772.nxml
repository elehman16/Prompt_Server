The rate of elimination of EtOH is determined largely by the activity of hepatic alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), the primary enzymes that metabolize EtOH. ADH are saturated at relatively low concentrations of EtOH leading to a rate of elimination that is sometimes described as zero&#x02010;order kinetics at higher concentrations and pseudo&#x02010;linear or first&#x02010;order at concentrations below the saturation of ADH (Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>). Absorption of EtOH continues over a prolonged period of time after ingesting alcoholic beverages, with BACs continuing to increase until the rate of elimination exceeds the rate of absorption. For these reasons, the rate of absorption is a primary determinant of the peak BAC. As most of the effects of EtOH are related to the BAC, variables that influence the rate of absorption are of interest. EtOH is absorbed more rapidly during the fasting than the fed state (DiPadova et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">1987</xref>; Horowitz et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>; Jones, <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Roine et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). Furthermore, solid meals delay gastric emptying more so than liquid meals, and the rate of absorption of EtOH consumed with a solid meal is likewise slower than when consumed with a liquid meal, probably as a function of the rate of gastric emptying (Horowitz et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). Other studies indicate that food increases the rate of elimination of EtOH (Ramchandani et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2001b</xref>).</p><p>During both the fasting and fed states, the rate of absorption of alcoholic beverages is influenced by the concentration of EtOH in the beverage (Mellanby, <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">1919</xref>; Roine et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>; Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>). Previous studies reported variable results depending on the concentration of alcohol in the beverage. Some studies reported that higher concentration of alcohol in a beverage delays the rate of gastric emptying particularly after a meal (Haggard et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1941</xref>; Roine et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>; Sedman et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">1976</xref>). Many of these studies utilized 95% EtOH diluted to different concentrations in orange juice or water, although some used beer, wine, and spirits (both diluted and neat) during or after a standard meal. Other studies have reported that during the fasting state, dilute alcoholic beverages such as beer are absorbed more slowly than beverages with a high EtOH concentration such as whiskey (Mellanby, <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">1919</xref>; Roine et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>).</p><p>Alcoholic beverages are consumed in a variety of situations, including with meals and at social gatherings where food may or may not be consumed with the beverages. In bars and taverns, alcoholic beverages are often consumed in the absence of food or several hours after eating, at which time the stomach is empty or nearly so. These social settings more closely resemble the fasting condition than drinking with meals. The purpose of this study was to determine during the fasting state, the kinetics of alcohol absorption and elimination and peak BACs after drinking the same amount of EtOH in the form of beer (5.1% v/v), white table wine (12.5% v/v), and vodka (diluted to 20% v/v with tonic water).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="acer12355-sec-0006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="acer12355-sec-0007"><title>Subjects</title><p>Fifteen healthy, nonsmoking men between the ages of 25 to 65 were selected for participation after responding to an advertisement.

These results indicate that spirits resulted in higher exposure compared to wine and beer, while beer resulted in lower and delayed exposure compared to spirits and wine.</p><table-wrap id="acer12355-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Pharmacokinetic Parameters After Spirits, Wine, or Beer</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="top"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PK Measure</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spirits</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wine</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Beer</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>p</italic>&#x02010;Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C<sub>max</sub> [mg%]</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">77.4 (17.0)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.7 (10.8)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.3 (9.8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>F</italic>(2,28) = 30.757, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;tests: Spirits &#x0003e; Wine &#x0003e; Beer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">T<sub>max</sub> [hour]</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6 (0.2)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9 (0.2)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0 (0.4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>F</italic>(2,28) = 12.103, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;tests: Spirits &#x0003e; Wine = Beer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUCt [mg*h/l]</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,510.9 (216)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,379 (219.9)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,193.6 (184.1)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>F</italic>(2,28) = 22.082, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;tests: Spirits &#x0003e; Wine &#x0003e; Beer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MRT [hour]</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.7 (0.2)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8 (0.3)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8 (0.2)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>F</italic>(2,28) = 3.968, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.030 <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;tests: Spirits = Wine &#x0003e; Beer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CL<sub>app</sub></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.7 (3.6)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.4 (5.3)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.0 (4.2)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>F</italic>(2,28) = 6.527, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005 <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;tests: Spirits = Wine &#x0003c; Beer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VD<sub>app</sub></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.3 (7.5)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.7 (8.3)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.6 (8.9)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>F</italic>(2,28) = 14.291, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;tests: Spirits &#x0003c; Wine &#x0003c; Beer</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="acer12355-note-0001"><p>Results of post hoc <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;tests are shown to compare results among the 3 conditions (spirits, wine, or beer).

The estimated bioavailability for wine relative to spirits was 0.96&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.13 (SE) and was not significantly different from the theoretical value of 1 for bioequivalent formulations. The estimated bioavailability of beer relative to spirits was 0.90&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.02 (SE) and was significantly lower than the theoretical value of 1 for bioequivalent formulations. This finding implies that there is a 10% reduction in bioavailability of alcohol when administered as beer compared to spirits. Apparent clearance and volume of distribution showed higher values for beer compared to spirits or wine, probably resulting from the lower relative bioavailability of alcohol following wine and beer compared to spirits (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer12355-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>).</p><p>In 14 of 15 subjects, the rate of absorption of spirits was greater than wine or beer. In 7 of the 15 subjects, the peak BAC exceeded 80&#x000a0;mg/dl (0.08%) after drinking vodka/tonic compared to beer or wine, and in 4 subjects, the peak BAC after vodka/tonic was more than 2&#x02010;fold higher than after drinking beer. Peak BAC remained below 80&#x000a0;mg/dl in all subjects after consumption of this amount of beer or wine.</p></sec><sec id="acer12355-sec-0015"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results show clearly that beer and wine are absorbed more slowly than vodka/tonic and that the peak BAC after drinking beer is significantly lower than the peak BAC after drinking a similar amount of EtOH as wine or vodka/tonic. The peak BAC after drinking wine was also significantly lower than after drinking vodka/tonic. In addition, the overall BAC exposure (AUC) following beer was lower than that for wine or vodka/tonic, which suggest a lower relative bioavailability for beer compared to the other beverages. While the estimated clearance for beer appears to be higher than that obtained for the other beverages, it is an &#x0201c;apparent&#x0201d; estimate because the route of administration is nonsystemic and artificially inflated as a result of the lower C<sub>max</sub> and bioavailability for beer. Similarly, the apparent volume of distribution does appear to differ across beverages; however, this too may be confounded by the differences in bioavailability across the beverage types.</p><p>The beverages used in this study differ in both the concentration of EtOH and the caloric content of the beverages. The concentration of alcohol in beer was 5.1% v/v, wine was 12.5% v/v, and vodka was diluted to a concentration of 20% v/v in tonic. Thus, the concentration of EtOH in vodka/tonic (20%) was almost twice that of wine (12.5%) and 4 times the concentration of beer. Although this study was not designed to test the effect of concentration of alcoholic beverages directly, the findings suggest that, in the fasting state, less concentrated beverages such as beer and wine are absorbed more slowly than those that are more concentrated. Previous studies have not shown a consistent effect of concentration on the rate of absorption from different alcoholic beverages (Mellanby, <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">1919</xref>; Roine et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>; Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>). Both the caloric content and other minor constituents of beer, wine, or vodka/tonic could potentially influence the rate of absorption. Although the calories from EtOH in each beverage were constant, beer has more total calories than either wine or vodka/tonic due to the carbohydrate content. An 80&#x000a0;kg subject would have ingested 409 calories as beer, 334 calories as wine, and 297 calories as vodka/tonic. The caloric content of beer could play a role in our findings because gastric emptying is influenced by the calories ingested more than the composition of the meal (Calbet and MacLean, <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>; Velchik et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). However, the differences in peak BAC between wine and vodka/tonic which have similar caloric value suggest that concentration is a more important determinant of the rate of gastric emptying and/or absorption of EtOH. Our findings do not permit a way to evaluate the effects of minor components of the beverages.</p><p>The findings in this study confirm previous observations that alcoholic beverages are absorbed rapidly during the fasting state, reaching a peak BAC within 1&#x000a0;hour (Jones, <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Roine et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>; Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>). We observed that the peak BAC occurred much sooner after consumption of vodka tonic (0.60&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.17&#x000a0;hours) than after drinking wine (0.91&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.23&#x000a0;hours) or beer (1.04&#x000a0;&#x000b1;0.38&#x000a0;hours). This finding is internally consistent with differences in the rate of absorption of EtOH from beer, wine, or vodka/tonic.</p><p>EtOH is well absorbed by the intestinal mucosa (Gentry, <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). As portal venous blood first passes through the liver before reaching the systemic circulation, the liver is exposed to most of the EtOH that is ingested. The liver is the primary site of metabolism of EtOH. Previous studies have shown that the bioavailability of EtOH is &#x0003c; 1 for very low doses of EtOH suggesting a possible &#x0201c;first&#x02010;pass&#x0201d; effect (Gentry, <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="acer12355-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>). This effect is saturated at relatively low doses and thus would not apply to our findings. However, if alcoholic beverages are consumed and/or absorbed at a rate that is lower than the rate of metabolism and elimination by the liver, the amount of EtOH reaching target organs such as the brain would be negligible. The AUC reflects aggregate exposure of organs other than the liver to EtOH following ingestion of alcoholic beverages. The AUC after consumption of beer was significantly lower (geometric mean 160.9) than after consumption of wine (177.5) or vodka/tonic (196.8). This finding suggests that the exposure of organs such as the brain to EtOH may be lower after drinking equivalent amounts of EtOH in the form of beer compared to wine or vodka/tonic in the fasting state. Although a different amount of EtOH (0.3&#x000a0;g/kg body weight) was ingested, Roine and colleagues (<xref rid="acer12355-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>) reported similar findings in AUC for beer, wine, and undiluted whiskey (40%) when consumed in the fasting state.</p><p>These findings have implications for individuals who consume alcoholic beverages in the absence of food. Drinking more concentrated beverages such as vodka/tonic is highly likely to produce higher peak BAC than when the same amount of EtOH is consumed as beer or wine. Although 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, and 1.5 ounces of liquor (80 proof) contain approximately the same amount of EtOH, the peak BAC and the aggregate exposure to EtOH of organs other than the liver and gut may differ significantly depending on the type of alcoholic beverage and the rate at which it is consumed. Rapid consumption of alcoholic beverages, particularly those that are highly concentrated, in the absence of food, should be discouraged.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="acer12355-sec-0016"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This paper was supported by ABMRF/The Foundation for Alcohol Research, Baltimore, Maryland.</p></ack><ref-list content-type="cited-references" id="acer12355-bibl-0001"><title>References</title><ref id="acer12355-bib-0001"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Calbet</surname>
