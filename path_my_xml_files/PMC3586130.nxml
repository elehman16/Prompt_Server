However, implementation levels remain low because of time constraints and other factors. Facilitated access to an alcohol reduction website offers primary care professionals a time-saving alternative to standard face-to-face intervention, but it is not known whether it is as effective.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A randomised controlled non-inferiority trial for risky drinkers comparing facilitated access to a dedicated website with standard face-to-face brief intervention to be conducted in primary care settings in the Region of Friuli Giulia Venezia, Italy. Adult patients will be given a leaflet inviting them to log on to a website to complete the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) alcohol screening questionnaire. Screen positives will be requested to complete an online trial module including consent, baseline assessment and randomisation to either standard intervention by the practitioner or facilitated access to an alcohol reduction website. Follow-up assessment of risky drinking will be undertaken online at 1&#x02005;month, 3&#x02005;months and 1&#x02005;year using the full AUDIT questionnaire. Proportions of risky drinkers in each group will be calculated and non-inferiority assessed against a specified margin of 10%. Assuming a reduction of 30% of risky drinkers receiving standard intervention, 1000 patients will be required to give 90% power to reject the null hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol was approved by the Isontina Independent Local Ethics Committee on 14 June 2012. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and public events involving the local administrations of the towns where the trial participants are resident.</p></sec><sec><title>Registration details</title><p>Trial registration number NCT: 01638338.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Health Promotion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Article summary</title></caption><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Is the website-facilitated access to alcohol brief Intervention (BI) as good as face-to-face BI?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is primary care the right setting to promote internet usage?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Risky drinking is an important health issue.</p></list-item><list-item><p>General practices are too busy to provide BI on alcohol.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A new, widespread tool is proposed to reduce risky drinking.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If not effective, this study will promote BI among general practitioners.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The domestic use of computers is not widespread in Italy, and community involvement might be important.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Hazardous alcohol consumption is a significant public health problem, with an estimated 3.8% of all global deaths and 4.6% of global disability-adjusted life years lost attributable to alcohol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> The European Union (EU) is the heaviest drinking region in the world, drinking an average of 11 litres of pure alcohol per adult each year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> In Region Friuli Venezia Giulia, risky alcohol consumption varies between 23.2% and 37.4% of the general population, being more significant in young adults (18&#x02013;24 years).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4 R5 R6">3&#x02013;6</xref> There is strong evidence that screening and brief interventions (SBIs) are effective in reducing both alcohol consumption and the harms associated with hazardous drinking.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> However, in primary care, less than 10% of hazardous and harmful drinkers are identified and less than 5% of those who could benefit are offered BIs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> One of the principal reasons for this is that conventional delivery of BI can add up to 15&#x02005;min to the primary consultation. In Italy, research on the topic of SBI in general practice is scarce and although there is some evidence about general practitioners&#x02019; (GPs&#x02019;) knowledge and attitudes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> no evidence exists on the extent to which SBIs are currently implemented.</p><p>The provision of facilitated access by primary care professionals to an alcohol reduction website could significantly increase BI rates by offering a time-saving alternative to face-to-face intervention. A review of trials of computer-based interventions in college drinkers found them to be more effective than no treatment and as effective as alternative treatment approaches. The recent online trial of Down Your Drink (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.downyourdrink.org.uk/">http://www.downyourdrink.org.uk/</ext-link>) indicated potentially significant reductions in alcohol consumption and risky drinking behaviours in subjects who used the trial websites,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> and a number of initiatives are underway to test the acceptability of this approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> The EU-funded ODHIN trial currently underway in five European countries is designed to determine the impact of facilitated access on levels of implementation of BIs by primary care practitioners. The DYD website has also been deployed in two NHS Primary Care Trust settings in London, including the automated baseline assessment of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems together with facilitated access by primary care professionals. The initial findings suggest that facilitated access is both feasible and attractive in primary care settings, but evidence is required to establish whether it is as effective as standard intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>Effectiveness of primary care based Facilitated Access to alcohol Reduction website - a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial-Friuli Venezia Giulia (EFAR-FVG) is a primary care-based randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing facilitated access to a dedicated website for risky drinkers with standard face-to-face BI.

Assuming a reduction of 30% in the proportion of risky drinkers in the face-to-face intervention group and allowing for an overall attrition of 10% of patients in the trial, it is calculated that 500 patients will be required in each group to give the trial 90% power (1-&#x003b2;) to reject the null hypothesis that facilitated access is inferior to face-to face intervention.
