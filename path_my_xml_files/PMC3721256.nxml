VO<sub>2max</sub> was measured pre- and post-experimentally using a continuous on-line oxygen analyser. Aerobic training consisted of exercise using a combination of treadmills, rowers, steppers and cycle ergometers, whereas resistance training consisted of eight prescribed exercises performed for three sets of 15 repetitions at 60% of the estimated one-repetition maximum (1-RM). In an attempt to equalise exercise duration across all three experimental groups, concurrent aerobic and resistance training consisted of a combination of aerobic training at 60% of heart rate maximum, and resistance training for two sets of 15 repetitions at 60% of the estimated 1-RM.</p><p>The NonG were found to have decreased their VO<sub>2max</sub> by 3.36%, whereas the ResG increased their mean VO<sub>2max</sub> by 13.16%.

One such benefit of aerobic training is an increased cardio-respiratory endurance, which in turn reduces the relative risk of death associated with lack of maximal aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2max</sub>). This is because an increased VO<sub>2max</sub> has concomitant cardio-protective effects, which include minimised left ventricular hypertrophy, increased levels of erythrocytes and haemoglobin and increased maximal capacity of the cardio-respiratory system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref></p><p>Compared with aerobic training, resistance training has produced conflicting results regarding its effect on VO<sub>2max</sub>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref> and despite resistance training sometimes increasing VO<sub>2max</sub>, it appears to be less effective than aerobic training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref> Even though resistance training is considered less effective, inactive individuals continue to use both aerobic and resistance training in an attempt to increase VO<sub>2max</sub>. This is in spite of research not convincingly demonstrating the effectiveness of this combined mode of training on VO<sub>2max</sub>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></p><p>Nevertheless, it is hypothesised that the addition of resistance training to aerobic training could improve VO<sub>2max</sub> in certain populations. This is since increases in strength and muscle mass (which improve mechanical efficiency, force&#x02013;velocity relationships, blood lactate clearance and buffering mechanisms, and motor unit recruitment patterns) have been associated with increases in VO<sub>2max</sub>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Due to the above conflicting findings and scarcity of research on the ability of resistance and concurrent training to improve VO<sub>2max</sub>, the purpose of the study, therefore, was to compare the effects of 16 weeks of aerobic training, concurrent resistance and aerobic, or resistance training on VO<sub>2max</sub> in previously untrained subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2a"><title>Methods</title><p>Fifty inactive men who volunteered to participate in this study (mean age: 25 years and six months), were selected after meeting the following final criteria for participation: being inactive, weight stable and on no dietary programme six months prior to the study, not using any pharmacological agent or dietary supplement known to affect VO<sub>2max</sub>, and free of medical conditions that could have prohibited exercise.

They were then shown the proper technique for each exercise utilised in their individualised training programmes. Prior to participation in the investigation, all volunteers gave written informed consent and underwent a medical screening history and physical examination, and they were allowed to discontinue the study at any time. This investigation was approved by the Rand Afrikaans University, Department of Human Movement Studies&#x02019; Research Committee.</p><p>All subjects underwent a similar battery of tests before and after the 16-week intervention period. All were evaluated in the post-absorptive state following a 12- to 14-hour fast and at least 48 hours prior to or following any exercise. Subjects were weighed in kilograms (to the nearest 0.1 kg) on a calibrated medical scale (Mettler DT Digitol, Mettler-Toledo AG, Ch-8606 GreiFensee, Switzerland) wearing only running shorts. Each subject&#x02019;s stature was measured in centimetres (to the nearest 0.1 cm) via a standard wall-mounted stadiometer. Percentage body fat was calculated according to the equation of Jackson and Pollock (1978):<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Percentage fat = 100 (4.95/D<sub>b</sub> &#x02013; 4.5), where D<sub>b</sub> (body density in g/cm<sup>3</sup>) = 1.120 &#x02013; 0.00043499 (&#x003a3;7) + 0.00000056 (&#x003a3;7) &#x02013; 0.00028826 (age), and &#x003a3;7 = sum of the seven skinfolds (in mm).</p><p>The triceps, subscapular, supra-iliac, abdominal, frontal thigh, mid-axilla and pectoral skinfolds were measured on the righthand side to the nearest 0.1 mm using a manual skinfold caliper (Harpenden John Bull, British Indicators Ltd., England).</p><p>VO<sub>2max</sub> was measured directly at the start and completion of the experimental period using a continuous on-line oxygen analyser (OXYCON-5, Mijnhardt, Bunnik, Netherlands) and cycle ergometer (Monark Ergo Trainer 810, Monark, Vargberg, Sweden). Readings of oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded every 30 seconds over the test period using the metabolic cart (OXYCON-5, Mijnhardt, Bunnik, Netherlands) and a Hans Rudolph two-way non-rebreathing valve (T-shape configuration model 2700B) (Wynadotte, Kansas City, United States of America). The VO<sub>2max</sub> was determined at an altitude of 1 650 m above sea level and at a controlled temperature of 21 to 23&#x000b0; C.</p><p>The graded YMCA cycle ergometry protocol was utilised and if needed, extra stages of 25 watts were added to ensure that all subjects reached their respective maximums. The VO2max test was terminated when VO<sub>2</sub> or heart rate decreased or remained unchanged in response to increases in workload, a respiratory quotient value of 1.14 and/or a rating of perceived exertion of 20 was reached, or the subjects experienced severe leg muscle fatigue or requested to stop. Workload was also considered maximal when successive increments in work intensity resulted in VO<sub>2</sub> differences of not more than 1 ml of oxygen per kg per minute (ml O<sub>2</sub>.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Periodised training programmes</title><p>All subjects were under direct supervision during the training sessions and were familiarised with the equipment before commencement of the experimental programme.

Aerobic exercise intensity was readjusted every four weeks with a 5% increase in heart rate, and the exercise programme was adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Subjects in the ResG performed three sets of 15 repetitions for shoulder press, latissimus dorsi pull-downs, seated rows, unilateral leg presses, unilateral knee extensions and unilateral hamstring curls at 60% of the estimated 1-RM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> during each training session, using a combination of Polaris&#x000ae; weight machines and York&#x000ae; free weights.

As with the ResG, every four weeks each subject&#x02019;s estimated 1-RM was re-evaluated and his exercise programme adjusted accordingly. The ConG subjects were also required to exercise using a combination of treadmills, rowers, steppers and cycle ergometers for 22 minutes at an intensity of 60% of their individual age-predicted heart rate maximum. This intensity was re-adjusted every four weeks by a 5% increase in heart rate.</p><p>While subjects in the exercise groups were not permitted to engage in any form of exercise other than their prescribed intervention programmes, the NonG subjects were not allowed to take part in any structured exercise and had to continue with their inactive lifestyles.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were analysed using commercial software [Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 11, Chicago, IL].

However, the significant reductions in body mass and percentage body fat observed following the exercise training programmes could explain the concomitant increases in VO<sub>2max</sub>. A possible reason for the smaller changes observed in VO<sub>2max</sub> following resistance training could be related to the exercise dose, workload, intensity and repetitions of the programme.</p><p>From the results of the study, it appears that the interference effect may only hold true in specific situations, and may be related to differences in design factors, including the mode, frequency, duration and intensity of training, the training history of participants, the scheduling of training sessions, selection of dependent variables, age of participant, the upper limit of the subject&#x02019;s genetic potential and the way in which the two modalities of exercise were integrated. This is because the results suggest that increases in VO<sub>2max</sub> are not impeded by combining resistance and aerobic training when compared with aerobic training alone in a sample of previously

this mode of training may not only increase VO<sub>2max</sub>, but also allow an individual to elicit the unique benefits of each mode of exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are
