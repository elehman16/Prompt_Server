Sedentary behaviour does not simply reflect the bottom end of the physical activity continuum, but is now considered as an independent domain. Sedentary behaviour may be defined as any activity characterised by a low energy expenditure (&#x02a7d;1.5 metabolic equivalents) in a sitting or reclining posture. It includes behaviours such as sitting and watching television or other screen-based activity including using computers for professional or entertainment purposes.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p id="P12">Sedentary behaviour is increasingly recognised as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders independent of physical activity.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Sedentary behaviour such as television or screen-based entertainment time has also been prospectively associated with depressive symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> For example, in a large, 10-year follow-up study, time spent watching television was associated with an higher risk of depression independent of physical activity.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In another prospective study, sitting for more than 42 h per week was associated with a 31% (95% CI 1.01&#x02013;1.68) increased risk of developing a mental disorder compared with sitting for less than 10.5 h per week.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p id="P13">To date, all of the evidence has been generated from epidemiological studies which cannot establish causality and leaves open the possibility that unmeasured variables may confound the findings. Additionally, studies have relied on self-report measures of sedentary time. Self-report suffers from recall bias and social desirability that likely result in underreporting of sedentary time.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p id="P14">The mechanisms underlying the effect of sedentary time on mental health are not completely understood. Since inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) are implicated in depression and mood disorders,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and inflammatory stimuli can cause transient mood disturbances in healthy individuals,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> a systemic inflammatory process may underlie the association of sedentary time with mood. Indeed, some studies have reported cross-sectional associations between inflammatory markers and sedentary time.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p id="P15">Sedentary time may also contribute to a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease through an exaggerated or sustained cardiovascular and inflammatory response to stress. Heightened autonomic responses to mental stress are cross-sectionally and prospectively associated with biological risk factors including hypertension, coronary atherosclerosis and intima media thickness.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Psychobiological responses to acute stress may be clinically relevant as they index an individual's typical response to daily stressors. Several mechanisms including central nervous system activation, immune cells redistribution and non-immune cell pathways are thought to mediate the effect of psychosocial stress on concentrations of inflammatory markers in the blood. One relevant mechanism is activation of transcription factors, since nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) DNA-binding activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is increased in response to acute stress.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The activation of this transcription factor is thought to be responsible for triggering inflammatory gene expression<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and the release of inflammatory markers into the circulation. Chronic or sustained activation of this pathway by psychosocial stress over sustained time periods may result in dysregulation, which in turn may lead to a systemic inflammatory activity<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> with adverse health consequences.</p><p id="P16">It is therefore plausible to hypothesise that sedentary individuals may be hyper-responsive to stress. This could be an important mechanism through which sedentary behaviour influences cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, pro-inflammatory responses to acute mental stress are known to be exaggerated in individuals with depressive symptoms possibly contributing to enhancing systemic inflammation and therefore mood disturbance. However, we are not aware of any study that has experimentally examined the effect of sedentary time on psychophysiological responses. Likewise, we are not aware of any study that has experimentally investigated the effect of sedentary time on mood. Such a study may offer strong support to the observational evidence linking sedentary time with depression and risk factors.</p><p id="P17">The aim of this study was to experimentally manipulate sedentary time under free-living conditions in a cross-over randomised fashion and examine the effect of this manipulation on mood symptoms and psychobiological responses to acute mental stress. It was hypothesised that: (a) in healthy participants, mood disturbance and psychological distress will develop after 2 weeks of a free-living sedentary intervention compared with 2 weeks of regular activity (control condition) independent of changes in measured physical activity; (b) psychobiological responses to acute mental stress will be greater following the sedentary condition compared with the control condition independent of changes in measured physical activity; and (c) changes in negative mood or distress post-intervention will be associated with greater pro-inflammatory responses to acute mental stress.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Method</title><sec sec-type="subjects" id="S2"><title>Participants and study design</title><p id="P18">Based on prior evidence from our group,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> we anticipated small to medium intervention effects; thus, for a within-participant design (&#x003b1; = 0.05 and [1&#x02013;&#x003b2;] = 0.80) a sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 46 was calculated. Fifty-one participants were recruited from the University of London student and staff population between February 2008 and December 2009 for a study examining physical activity and health.

Following completion of the first condition (+2 weeks), participants reported back to the laboratory to complete mood assessments and for a psychophysiological testing session. Participants were required to switch condition and return to the laboratory (+4 weeks) for repeated mood assessments and psychophysiological testing. All participants were instructed to refrain from vigorous physical activity and from drinking alcoholic beverages the night before scheduled testing appointment, and to have a light, low-fat meal no later than 3 h before the appointment.</p><p id="P21">A research nurse masked to the study's hypotheses provided participants with a letter of condition allocation. The letter also contained instructions and requirements for each condition. In the sedentary condition, participants were instructed to replace any daily structured or unstructured form of physical activity by being sedentary, and were encouraged to be sedentary as much as possible. In the control condition, participants were instructed to maintain their habitual levels of daily activity. Participants were required to wear the ActiGraph around their waist as instructed every day after waking and until bedtime, and only remove it briefly when showering or swimming.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Measures</title><p id="P22">Anthropometric measures were obtained by a research nurse using standard protocol.</p><sec id="S5"><title>Mood outcomes</title><p id="P23">Psychological distress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28).<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> It has four subscales (somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction and depression) that measure the participant's current state of emotional distress as compared with the usual state. According to established norms,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> each scale has a possible score range of 0&#x02013;21, and a total score (range 0&#x02013;84) may be computed by adding up the subscales. Higher values indicate greater distress. Cronbach's &#x003b1; was 0.85 (control) and 0.90 (sedentary). Mood was assessed with the short version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS-SF).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This question-naire has been used extensively in a variety of settings with healthy and clinical populations, and has good psychometric properties<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> comparable to the original, longer version.

A negative mood mean score was also computed by adding the five negative mood subscales and subtracting vigor/activity (range 0&#x02013;100), with higher scores reflective of greater negative affective states.

Mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) models with condition (sedentary and control) as within-participant factor, and order of study condition allocation as fixed factor tested the effect of sedentary behaviour on the GHQ and POMS scores. Change scores (mean difference from control to sedentary) were computed for the GHQ, POMS, sedentary time and MVPA, and were used in regression models to test whether changes in sedentary time were associated with changes in mood, and if this association was independent of changes in objective MVPA. Changes in basal level of inflammatory markers were tested using related <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p><p id="P31">Cardiovascular stress responses were averaged over 5-minute trials to yield a baseline value (mean of last 5 min of the rest period), a stress value (mean of speech and mirror task) and a recovery value (mean of the last 5 min of the recovery period). Main effects and interaction effects were determined using mixed ANOVA models with condition (sedentary and control) and trial (baseline, stress and recovery) as within-participants and order of condition allocation as a covariate (to control for a possible order effect). Significant interaction effects were examined by comparing stress reactivity (stress&#x02013;baseline values) and recovery scores (recovery values&#x02013;baseline) using paired <italic>t</italic>-test.

Furthermore, this study examined whether changes in mood post-intervention were associated with pro-inflammatory responses to mental stress independent of response at control testing. We induced approximately 7.5 h of additional free-living sedentary time during the experiment as confirmed by objective measurement using an accelerometer device. Our prediction that sedentary time would result in negative mood symptoms was supported. Increased sedentary time was associated with negative mood which was independent of changes in objectively measured MVPA. Therefore, using an experimental design we demonstrated a link between sedentary time and the development of negative mood and psychological distress, which largely supports the findings from observational studies.</p><p id="P44">We measured a wide range of cardiovascular (blood pressure and heart rate), neuroendocrine (cortisol) and inflammatory (IL-6) markers in response to acute mental stress, but contrary to our hypothesis there was limited evidence that sedentary behaviour resulted in heightened psychophysiological responses. There was no difference in reactivity to or recovery from acute stress in the sedentary condition compared with the control condition in the measure assessed. Although we found a condition &#x000d7; time interaction for heart rate suggesting greater responses in the sedentary condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), a closer examination of the interaction indicated that the effect may be accounted for by higher baseline heart rate values in the sedentary condition stress testing rather than greater reactivity.</p><p id="P45">One reason that could explain the null effects is that the duration of the intervention and the magnitude in changes to sedentary behaviour might not have been sufficient to induce such marked stress-induced physiological changes in this healthy sample. Sedentary time may lead to vascular and metabolic adaptations including changes in insulin sensitivity and accumulation of visceral adipose tissue<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> that may precede changes in stress reactivity or stress recovery. These changes may emerge in response to chronic exposure to a sedentary lifestyle.</p><p id="P46">Basal levels of the inflammatory markers CRP and IL-6 did not change following 2 weeks of increased sedentary time compared with control. This is not consistent with previous epidemiological work that showed an association between basal circulating CRP and television viewing (as an index of sedentary time).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Other recent work has shown favourable effects of acutely breaking up prolonged sitting on the expression of various genes linked to inflammatory responses.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p id="P47">Our hypothesis that mood disturbances or psychological distress following sedentary intervention would be associated with pro-inflammatory responses was supported. We showed that negative mood was associated with the IL-6 pro-inflammatory stress response independent of the IL-6 response during control. Individuals with greater mood disturbances measured with the POMS following sedentary time displayed an heightened IL-6 response. There was also a near-significant association of psychological distress measured with the GHQ and pro-inflammatory IL-6 responses. This suggests that the transient mood disturbances induced by being sedentary may interact with acute stress to enhance pro-inflammatory reactivity. This finding can be interpreted in relation to the literature on depressive symptoms and acute inflammatory stress reactivity. It has been shown that depressed mood at the subthreshold level measured continuously<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> or as a binary variable<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> was associated to greater pro-inflammatory IL-6 responses to mental stress independent of BMI and resting levels. Sedentary behaviour may therefore contribute to negative mood by enhancing inflammatory responses to stress leading to an upregulation of the inflammatory signalling pathway and enhanced vulnerability to mood disturbances. However, at present this hypothesis can only be speculative since to address this question large experimental studies with adequate follow-up periods would be required. Other mechanisms may also be involved. For example, displacement of physical activity with passive sedentary activities such as television viewing might encourage social isolation, known to be linked with depression.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><sec id="S26"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="P48">This study has some limitations. Our sample included habitually active and healthy individuals and the findings may not generalise to the general population. In particular, caution should be employed in generalising the findings of this study to individuals with clinical depression or clinical levels of psychological distress or indeed to individuals with chronic illnesses for whom being sedentary may be a consequence rather than a cause of depression. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 45 min post-stress only but evidence suggest that IL-6 may continue to increase up to 90 min post-stressor.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Had we employed a longer post-stress recovery period and further sampling we might have uncovered effects that were not apparent using the current protocol. Although IL-6 seems to be reliably activated by mental stress and to play an important role in mood disorders,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> other cytokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1ra and IL-1&#x003b2; appear to be relevant in the association of sedentary behaviour and mood but were not assessed in this study. The method used to assess sedentary time in this study has some limitations. The ActiGraph quantifies time spent in different intensities of activity by summing time above and below specified count thresholds which have to be chosen according to the population of interest.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> ActiGraph wear time in this study was about 12 h/day thus we cannot account for non-wear periods or potential daytime naps. Nevertheless, wear time did not differ between experimental conditions. Contextual information on sedentary time was not collected, which may be important in relation to mental health,<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> nor was any familial history of risk factors such as coronary heart disease or depressive disorders which may potentially affect stress reactivity.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Strengths of the study include the use of a wide range of stress-induced measures and the cross-over study design that is less prone to inter-individual confounding. In addition, a notable strength of the study is the objective assessment of sedentary time and activity using an accelerometer rather than relying on self-report as is the case in the majority of studies of sedentariness and mental health.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Implications</title><p id="P49">The findings of this study have some important implications. Sedentary time does not simply reflect the lower scale of the physical activity continuum but represent a risk factor for mental health in its own right. Therefore, efforts should also be devoted to modifying sedentariness as well as promoting physical activity especially in populations more at risk of mental health problems.</p><p id="P50">In summary, we have shown for the first time that experimentally manipulating free-living sedentary time resulted in robust increases in psychological distress and mood disturbance, and these changes were associated with greater inflammatory responses to acute stress. The link between sedentary behaviour and mood may therefore partly be driven by repeated or sustained inflammatory responses to daily stressors, but further research is required to tease apart whether mood disturbances drive inflammatory responses or vice versa.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p><p>None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>This research was supported by the <funding-source>British Heart Foundation</funding-source>.
