Recent epidemiological studies show a strong association of insomnia and paranoia. The clinical implication is that reducing insomnia will reduce paranoid delusions. This study, evaluating for the first time the treatment of insomnia in individuals with persecutory delusions, provides a test of this hypothesis. It was predicted that a brief cognitive behavioural intervention for insomnia (CBT-I) for individuals with persistent persecutory delusions and sleep difficulties would not only reduce the insomnia but that it would also reduce the paranoia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fifteen patients with persistent persecutory delusions and insomnia in the context of a psychotic disorder were each individually given a standard-format, four-session CBT-I intervention. Outcome assessments were conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment and one-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no missing data. Following the intervention, significant reductions were found in levels of insomnia and the persecutory delusions. The effect sizes were large, and the changes were maintained at the follow-up. At least two-thirds of participants made substantial improvements in insomnia and approximately half showed substantial reductions in the persecutory delusions. There were also reductions in levels of anomalies of experience, anxiety and depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitations are the absence of a control group and unblinded assessments. A more methodologically rigorous evaluation of this intervention is now warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These preliminary findings suggest that CBT-I can be used to treat insomnia in individuals with persecutory delusions and that, consistent with the hypothesised causal role, it also lessens the delusions.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Highlights</title><p>&#x025ba; First ever test of the effects of an insomnia reduction intervention for patients with persistent persecutory delusions. &#x025ba; There were large reductions in both insomnia and persecutory delusions. &#x025ba; The reductions persisted at one-month follow-up. &#x025ba; The intervention is brief (4 sessions) and uses basic CBT for insomnia techniques, meaning that it can be easily disseminated. &#x025ba; The results support the theoretical idea that insomnia is a causal factor in paranoid experiences.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Persecutory delusions</kwd><kwd>Paranoia</kwd><kwd>Schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Insomnia</kwd><kwd>Cognitive behavioural therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Treatments for psychosis are likely to be improved by targeting single symptoms using theoretically-driven interventions (<xref rid="bib11 bib33 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Foster, Startup, Potts, &#x00026; Freeman, 2010; Ross et al., in press; Trower et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Persecutory delusions are one of the key psychotic experiences, for which improvements in both pharmacological and psychological treatments are needed (see reviews by <xref rid="bib20 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Garety, Bentall, &#x00026; Freeman, 2008; Bebbington, Pilling, &#x00026; Whittington, 2008</xref>). In the current report we take a putative causal factor of persecutory delusions identified from recent research and evaluate the effects of an intervention designed to reduce it. Insomnia - difficulties with getting and staying asleep - is common in people with paranoia and is likely to exacerbate psychotic experiences (<xref rid="bib13 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Freeman, Brugha et al., 2010; Freeman, Pugh, Vorontsova, &#x00026; Southgate, 2009</xref>). Given that there are efficacious cognitive behavioural treatments (CBT) for insomnia these should be evaluated in psychosis populations, and they may well have the significant added benefit of reducing persecutory delusions. This is the aim of the work described in this report.</p><p>It is well established that insomnia is a cause of anxiety, depression and anomalies of experience (e.g. <xref rid="bib4 bib31 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Breslau, Roth, Rosenthal, &#x00026; Andreski, 1996; Morphy, Dunn, Lewis, Boardman, &#x00026; Croft, 2007; Luby, Frohman, Grisell, Lenzo, &#x00026; Gottlieb, 1960</xref>), which are all factors that raise the risk of persecutory thinking (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Freeman, 2007</xref>). Four recent studies have evaluated the link between insomnia and paranoia. In the first study it was found in a small group of patients with persecutory delusions in the context of psychosis that 27% had severe clinical insomnia, 27% had clinical insomnia of moderate severity, and 30% sub-threshold insomnia (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). In the same study, there was a strong and significant association of persecutory thinking and insomnia symptoms in a general population group. The second study analysed data from the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity survey, a representative general population sample of over eight thousand people, and found that insomnia was associated with a two to threefold increase in the risk of paranoid thinking (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Freeman, Brugha et al., 2010</xref>). This association was subsequently closely replicated in an analysis of the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of over seven thousand people (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Freeman, McManus et al., 2010</xref>). Stronger evidence has been obtained from a longitudinal follow-up of 2382 people from the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity survey, in which it was shown that symptoms of insomnia at the first assessment increased both the likelihood of the new development of paranoid thinking and of the persistence of existing paranoid thinking over the next 18 months (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., submitted for publication</xref>). Insomnia may be a causal factor in both the development and maintenance of paranoid thinking, and it is likely that in some instances a vicious cycle occurs, with paranoid fears, inactivity, and sleep difficulties exacerbating each other. In sum, the link between insomnia and paranoia is theoretically plausible and is supported by an emerging empirical literature. The clear next step is to test the effects of reductions of insomnia on paranoid thinking.</p><p>Studies of insomnia show that it is associated with a negative impact on individuals&#x02019; quality of life, health, relationships, ability to perform at work and enjoyment of leisure activities (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Smith, Huang, &#x00026; Manber, 2005</xref>). Chronic insomnia is often poorly managed and treatment of chronic insomnia with pharmacotherapy remains controversial because of issues of tolerance and dependency (<xref rid="bib10 bib30 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Espie et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Morin et&#x000a0;al., 1999; NICE 2004</xref>). In insomnia linked with schizophrenia, treatment often involves antipsychotics and sedative hypnotics which are only partially effective in the long term, and are often associated with a daytime &#x0201c;hangover&#x0201d; effect, which can contribute to poor global functioning (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kantrowitz, Citrome, &#x00026; Javitt, 2009</xref>). However, a large body of research, outside of psychosis groups, has found that non-pharmacological cognitive behavioural interventions (CBT-I) are highly effective (<xref rid="bib10 bib25 bib30 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Espie et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Jacobs, Pace-Schott, Stickgold, &#x00026; Otto, 2004; Morin et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Smith et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The present investigation aimed to provide an initial evaluation of CBT-I intervention for people with persistent persecutory delusions and co-morbid chronic insomnia. The main prediction was that the insomnia intervention would lead to a reduction in both insomnia and the delusions. The secondary prediction was that the insomnia intervention would also reduce anxiety, depression and anomalies of experience, which are potential mediators of the relationship between insomnia and paranoia. The study provides the first direct evaluation of the effects of an insomnia intervention for individuals with persecutory delusions and was therefore an uncontrolled pilot study of potential efficacy. We targeted patients with delusions that had not responded to current treatments (i.e. a persistent symptom group) in order to strengthen claims for the effects of the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Method</title><p>The study hypotheses were tested in a pilot study using an open uncontrolled trial methodology based on <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Harvey, Sharpley, Ree, Stinson, and Clark (2007)</xref>. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from an NHS research ethics committee.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>15 patients with persecutory delusions and insomnia participated. Criteria for inclusion in the trial were: primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, psychosis, schizoaffective disorder or delusional disorder, as indicated by clinical case notes; current experience of persecutory delusions as defined by <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Freeman and Garety (2000)</xref>; persecutory delusions that had persisted, despite treatment, for six months or longer; sleep difficulties lasting for one month or longer; medication stable for at least one month prior to taking part in the study; and aged between 18 and 65. Exclusion criteria were: unable to give informed consent; not wanting help for sleep problems; currently involved in any other cognitive behaviour therapy; and a primary diagnosis of drug or alcohol dependence. Participants were recruited from outpatient services.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Intervention</title><p>All participants were offered a four-session individual CBT-I intervention (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each session lasted approximately 1&#x000a0;h. The aim was to deliver them weekly, though for some participants it took eight weeks to complete four sessions. The main techniques, standard for CBT sleep interventions, were taken from four main sources: <xref rid="bib9 bib14 bib23 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Espie (2006); Freeman and Freeman (2010); Harvey et&#x000a0;al., (2007); Meir and Kryger (2004)</xref>. Initially the sessions focussed upon psycho-education about sleep difficulties, assessment of the triggering and maintenance of sleep difficulties, and goal-setting. Based upon the assessment, the active therapeutic techniques that were used included sleep hygiene, stimulus control therapy (e.g. setting appropriate and regular sleep times, not doing anything else in the bed or bedroom apart from sleeping, not staying in bed if not able to sleep for longer than 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min, stopping daytime naps), relaxation, and, less often, cognitive techniques addressing unhelpful beliefs and attitudes about sleep, attentional bias, monitoring, and safety behaviours. The intervention was deliberately simplified, with the principal therapeutic technique being stimulus control i.e. learning to associate bed with sleep. Participants were also given written information as part of the intervention in the form of a newly-devised handbook to read between sessions and on completion of the intervention. Therapy was carried out by EM, supervised by DF, but adherence and competence was not formally assessed. The persecutory delusions were not discussed in the sessions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Addendum to design</title><p>A baseline assessment had not been included in the original trial design in order not to deter potential participants from taking part in this initial evaluation. However after eight participants had been through the intervention indicating positive outcomes, we enhanced the design for the remaining seven patients with the addition of a baseline measure one or two weeks prior to the pre-treatment measure. The baseline measure included the same set of outcome measures outlined below, so that the stability of the participants&#x02019; symptoms could be assessed. Ethical approval was obtained for this addendum to the design.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="sec2.4.1"><label>2.4.1</label><title>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bastien, Vallieres, &#x00026; Morin, 2001</xref>)</title><p>The ISI includes seven self-rated items evaluating the perceived severity of insomnia on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very much</italic>), according to the perceived degree of severity.

The ISI indicates sleep difficulties involving both day and night functioning and covers DSM-IV insomnia criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Scoring guidelines are as follows: 0&#x02013;7, absence of clinically significant insomnia; 8&#x02013;14, sub-threshold insomnia; 15&#x02013;21, moderate clinical insomnia; and 22&#x02013;28, severe clinical insomnia.

The results are very promising. Across all the different outcome measures the results were consistent. There were substantial and significant reductions in insomnia and persecutory delusions. The sleep intervention, which did not discuss the delusions, nevertheless decreased paranoia, which is consistent with a causal role for insomnia in the maintenance of psychotic symptoms. This was a group of patients with long-term and significant difficulties, who would be considered as difficult to treat, but who took very well to a targeted intervention that focussed on a key concern. We recommend more systematic assessment and treatment of sleep difficulties in patients with persecutory delusions. However there is a clear caveat. This was a pilot study, with no control group and unblinded assessments. A randomised controlled trial is now required.</p><p>All the participants completed the four session intervention. The results clearly indicate that following the CBT-I intervention, the participants reported significant reductions in insomnia as measured by both the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The effect size of the reductions was large. More than two-thirds of participants showed both reliable and clinically-significant change following the intervention. Around half of participants made a 50% improvement and the majority of participants made a 25% improvement on the measures of insomnia. The effect sizes found in the current study are comparable with those found in more rigorous clinical trials of non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Morin et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>), and those found in other trials of CBT-I for co-morbid insomnia (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). The benefits of the intervention were maintained at the one-month follow-up, which suggests at least a short-term durability of the treatment on insomnia, which is again in keeping with previous treatment studies of non-pharmacological treatments of insomnia (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Morin et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Despite the persecutory delusions not being a topic of discussion in the intervention sessions, an improvement in sleep resulted in a lessening of paranoid experiences. The results revealed that following the CBT-I intervention there was a significant reduction in paranoia as measured by the Green et al Paranoid Thoughts Scale (G-PTS) Part A (ideas of reference), G-PTS Part B (ideas of persecution) and the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS) at post-treatment and one-month follow-up. The effect sizes were large. Approximately one half of the participants showed substantial reductions in paranoia on the basis of reliable and clinically-significant change. A small number of participants improved by 50% and almost half of the participants made a 25% improvement on measures of paranoid thinking. These findings are consistent with a recent trial of the treatment of insomnia with sodium salt or y-hydroxybutyric acid (SXB) in eight patients with insomnia linked to schizophrenia (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kantrowitz et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our introduction of a small baseline period into the study supported the idea that the participant group had persistent symptoms and were not on a path of natural recovery, though this can only be truly tested with a trial design that includes a control group.</p><p>It is also of note that the CBT-I intervention was also associated with reductions in levels of anomalies of experience, anxiety and depression. The effect sizes for these reductions were moderate to large, and are similar to those from previous research into CBT-I treatment for insomnia co-morbid with other psychiatric conditions (e.g. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Our interest in these variables was due to their being plausible routes that insomnia may contribute to the occurrence of paranoid thinking. In previous cross-sectional research there were indications that affective disturbance mediates the relationship between insomnia and paranoia (<xref rid="bib18 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et&#x000a0;al., 2009; Freeman, Brugha et al., 2010</xref>). In essence, reductions in anxiety, depression, and anomalies of experience are likely to lead to reductions in persecutory delusions (<xref rid="bib15 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Freeman, Freeman, &#x00026; Garety, 2008; Foster et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We have highlighted basic elements of the design of this study that limit the strength of conclusions that can be made at this stage of development of the intervention. We also note that there was only a single therapist, who also carried out the assessments, though these measures were self-report as well as interviewer rated. There was no assessment of therapist adherence or competence. However the simplified intervention we have devised will have the advantage of being easily administered by other therapists. The intervention does not rely on complex formulations or difficult therapeutic manoeuvres. A further weakness is the multiple statistical testing with a relatively small sample size, though confidence is gained by all the measures showing similar changes. Given that there is a substantial evidence base for cognitive behavioural insomnia interventions, we recommend their use for patients with psychosis reporting such difficulties. Our results do not indicate that their effects will be any different for patients with psychosis. Indeed, they hold the intriguing promise of improving psychotic symptoms such as persecutory delusions.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None</p></sec><sec
