Whether nonpharmacological thermal therapies promote the endurance of loaded inspiratory muscles in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear. The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of two thermal interventions on endurance time (ET) and plasma IL-6 concentration following an IRB challenge.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized, parallel-group, unblinded clinical trial in a single-center setting. Forty-two patients (aged 42&#x02013;76 years) suffering from mild to severe COPD participated in this study. Both groups completed 12 sessions of the mud bath therapy (MBT) (n=22) or leisure thermal activity (LTA) (n=19) in a thermal spa center in Italy. Pre- and postintervention spirometry, maximum inspiratory pressure, and plasma mediators were obtained and ET and endurance oxygen expenditure (VO<sub>2Endur</sub>) were measured following IRB challenge at 40% of maximum inspiratory pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no difference in &#x00394;IL-6 between the intervention groups. But, IRB challenge increased cytokine IL-6 plasma levels systematically. The effect size was small. A statistically significant treatment by IRB challenge effect existed in ET, which significantly increased in the MBT group (<italic>P</italic>=0.003). In analysis of covariance treatment by IRB challenge analysis with LnVO<sub>2Endur</sub> as the dependent variable, &#x00394;IL-6 after intervention predicted LnVO2Endur in the MBT group, but not in the LTA group. Adverse events occurred in two individuals in the MBT group, but they were mainly transient. One patient in the LTA group dropped out.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MBT model improves ET upon a moderate IRB challenge, indicating the occurrence of a training effect. The LnVO<sub>2Endur</sub>/&#x00394;IL-6 suggests a physiologic adaptive mechanism in respiratory muscles of COPD patients allocated to treatment. Both thermal interventions are safe.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

We conducted this clinical trial with a parallel-group design in patients suffering from COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage I&#x02013;III). We compared the mud (ie, medicinal clays) therapy (mud bath therapy [MBT]) model and the leisure thermal activity (LTA) model to test their efficacy in blunting the cytokine IL-6 plasma levels, circulating after a moderate IRB challenge.

The tests were repeated after thermal interventions (Day 17) by the same staff.</p><p>On Day 0 and Day 17, all the patients were challenged against a submaximal linear inspiratory resistance during an IRB challenge. It was performed using a dedicated pressure threshold breathing device (Threshold IMT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>Respironics).</p><p>We implemented the IRB challenge in COPD patients presenting with acute inspiratory loads to test endurance, ie, time to task failure. We measured respiratory oxygen consumption and acid lactic as markers of metabolic efficiency of respiratory muscles. Also, we assessed changes in reactive C-protein together with changes in several plasma cytokines, namely IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, and interleukin tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), as markers of hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis stimulation.</p><p>On Day 1, all the enrolled patients moved to one of the selected thermal spa hotels in a major thermal site in Italy. Here they were allocated to receive treatment: MBT Group, or comparator: LTA Group. The groups were required to complete 12 sessions (Days 3&#x02013;15) of either thermal treatment (MBT) model or comparator (LTA) model. The former consisted of the application of mud packs followed by a bath in thermal water provided by thermal-trained therapists. The latter consisted of unsupervised leisure thermal activities in the thermal pools.</p><p>According to the study protocol, the concealment of the patient&#x02019;s allocation ensured that investigator and outcome assessors were blind to group assignment, while participants and thermal therapists were not.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>We studied 42 patients with a clinical and functional diagnosis of COPD classified according to GOLD stages I&#x02013;III. They were recruited into the study at Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit of S Maugeri Foundation IRCCS (Montescano, Italy) from March 2010 to May 2013. It is a major pulmonary rehabilitation center, treating &#x0003e;1,500 cases annually.</p><p>Sites to deliver thermal treatment/comparator interventions were six selected spa hotels in AbanoTerme, Padua, Italy. A total of 12 thermal therapists participated in the study, two therapists per each thermal hotel. AbanoTerme is a major thermal center with a turnover of &#x0003e;180,000 patients annually.</p><p>Eligible patients were current or former smokers with smoking history of at least five pack-years, aged &#x0003e;40 years.

The eligible individuals must not have received thermal care in the previous 2 years. Also, they must be able to accomplish the protocol requirements relevant to hotel accommodation for 2 weeks and confident about participating in leisure as well as thermal activities. Exclusion criteria were the presence of any specific contraindications to MBT, such as bronchial asthma, chronic respiratory failure due to severe pulmonary emphysema, cor pulmonale, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. They were excluded from the study if they presented with any malignancy, gastrointestinal disorders, severe endocrine disorders or recent (ie, within the last 4 weeks) surgery, respiratory tract infection, and abnormal fluid balance as manifested by the presence of edema or regular use of diuretics.</p><p>Participants kept taking all drug regimens prescribed within the previous 6 months, such as short-acting &#x003b2;2-agonists (4/42) long-acting inhaled &#x003b2;2-agonists (28/42), long-acting anticholinergic (28/42) inhaled corticosteroids therapy (fluticasone: 22/42, beclometasone: 4/42, and budesonide: 3/42). In addition, 8/42 kept taking formerly prescribed antihyperlipidemic, 34/42 antihypertensive, and 5/42 antihyperglycemic medications. None of the patients was on either oral steroids or beta-blockers.</p><p>The medical ethics committee of the Scientific Institute of Montescano approved the study design. A written informed consent was obtained prior to the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and interventions</title><p>The study was a single-center controlled study. Simple (unrestricted) randomization was assured using a computer random number generator for generating the complete randomization sequences, which were concealed until assignment. The concealed allocation ensured that the investigator and outcome assessors were blind to thermal therapist/not supervised intervention allocation at the participating spa hotels.</p><p>Thermal MBT model consisted of a supervised intervention over 2 weeks. Once per day, a thermal-trained therapist applied the treatment by progressively packing the patient&#x02019;s skin with mud (ie, medicinal clay) packs at temperatures gradually increasing from 38&#x000b0;C to 42&#x000b0;C. He covered the whole body with the exception of the head, cardiac area, and genital area. After 20 minutes, the patient took a shower to remove the mud pack. A thermal bath at 38&#x000b0;C, lasting 8&#x02013;15 minutes, and 60 minutes bed rest, during which time the body was kept warm to favor the sweating reaction, completed the treatment. In addition, patients had free access to thermal swimming pools once or twice daily, to do unsupervised leisure activities in thermal swimming pools, each not exceeding 30 minutes.</p><p>Comparator LTA model consisted of a nonsupervised intervention over 2 weeks. Patients underwent 12 sessions of leisure activities (bathing, walking, swimming, etc) in thermal swimming pools twice daily, each not exceeding 30 minutes.</p><p>Overall, patients were empowered to record their oxygen saturation before and after each thermal activity session. They logged a self-reported card, listing their activities on a daily basis, number of sessions, and the relevant oxygen saturations (SpO<sub>2</sub>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary function tests and biomarkers in venous blood</title><p>Lung function testing included spirometry (FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC) and thoracic gas volumes, which were measured using the spirometer and body box MasterScope<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Body (VIASYS Healthcare GmbH, Wuerzburg, Germany).

Then, a starting pressure load set at 50% of patient&#x02019;s MIP was added. If this load was not sustainable for &#x0003e;3 minutes, it was reduced by 10%. And, the patient attempted to perform additional runs to identify the sustainable inspiratory pressure (SIP).</p><p>Seat height and position remained constant for each subject during all studies to minimize variations in posture. Patients were highly motivated to endure as long as possible, and until exhaustion. They were coached and encouraged to perform maximally during inspiration, and to completely relax during expiration. They were free to choose their strategy to cope with the imposed pressure load and were free to adjust their breathing pattern.</p><p>ET was the time to task failure while performing repetitive contraction at a constant SIP. It was defined as the highest pressure the individual can generate in each breath for at least 12 consecutive minutes, and until exhaustion.</p><p>We took the SIP expressed as ratio PI/PI<sub>max</sub> as an index of the mechanical load imposed on the inspiratory muscles (numerator) to the inspiratory force reserve (denominator).</p><p>Oxygen consumption of IRB challenge was calculated as mean VO<sub>2IRB</sub> &#x02212; meanVO<sub>2Rest</sub>, expressed as mL/min.

It is classified under the label of traditional medicine as specified in the World Health Organization Guideline in the Strategies for Traditional Medicine 2014-23.<xref rid="b17-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Nevertheless, implementation of the best quality studies to validate hydrology therapies as a cure for systemic inflammatory manifestations remains a challenge for research funding institutions in a range of chronic disease conditions like COPD.</p><p>The novelty of the trial was to look at both thermal interventions as passive warm-up routines and to test their effects on immunologic (cytokine) response upon a moderated loaded breathing challenge and, further, to explore the effects on loaded inspiratory muscle endurance and explain the homeostatic adaptations leading to the increase in ET in the treatment group. To this end, we analyzed the covariate relationship between cytokine IL-6 and endurance oxygen expenditure of loaded inspiratory muscles.</p><p>According to Vassilakopoulos et al<xref rid="b12-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> the immunologic effects of loaded breathing result in stimulation of HPA axis and particularly in upregulation of cytokine IL-6. The effects occurred in healthy subjects breathing strenuously against a load set at 75% of their maximal inspiratory pressure, but not in healthy individuals breathing against a moderate load.</p><p>Fuster et al<xref rid="b18-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> found that patients with COPD and very severe airflow obstruction failed mounting an appropriate anti-inflammatory response to the maximal inspiratory loading test.<xref rid="b19-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In agreement with these authors, we were not able to measure any simultaneous HPA axis stimulation as assessed by increase in either cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; or ACTH plasma levels. Nevertheless, we documented a timely (within 40 minutes) and statistically significant increase in cytokine IL-6 response in our patients. They performed against an inspiratory threshold load set at &#x02248;40% of their maximal inspiratory pressure, both before and after thermal interventions.</p><p>Differences in maximal inspiratory loading test, compared to our endurance test, timing of venous blood sample collection and differences in severity of airflow obstruction make it difficult to compare the present results with those of Fuster et al.<xref rid="b18-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> On the other hand, the change of IL-6 over its baseline value (&#x00394;IL-6) was pretty inconsistent among patients suffering from COPD in comparison to the change observed in healthy individuals performing strenuously against high inspiratory loads. The coefficient of variation of our patients was just over five-folds as high as the coefficient of variation of healthy subjects studied by Vassilakopoulos et al<xref rid="b12-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> (COPD coefficient of variation: 115% vs healthy coefficient of variation: 20%). Moderate intensity of inspiratory resistive breathing might have been the cause of the milder and inconsistent increase in cytokine IL-6 over its baseline value. Also, the fact that our COPD patients volitionally stopped exercising within 40 minutes and were unable to endure behind this failure point might have been responsible for the lack of HPA axis stimulation. Reportedly, changes in ACTH plasma levels lagged ~15 minutes behind failure point, ie, the time point when resistive load cannot be sustained anymore.<xref rid="b12-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>A thorough examination of the immunological signaling of these responses is beyond the aims of the present study. So, it remains a matter of speculation whether the milder upregulation of cytokine IL-6 was dependent on moderate intensity of IRB challenge and whether the inability to perform behind the failure point until the exhaustion point might have prevented HPA axis activation among patients suffering from COPD. Alternatively, these responses would have been relevant to different stimuli within respiratory muscles because the stimuli responsible for increased proinflammatory cytokine production during inspiratory resistive loading remain elusive.<xref rid="b13-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In theory, the failure, to stimulate HPA axis, would have resulted from impaired sympatho-corticotrophic axis outflow. Lately, Iranmanesh et al<xref rid="b20-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> suggested this hypothesis after they compared responses to incremental bicycle ergometer in COPD patients with no exposure to corticosteroids within 3 months and in healthy subjects. They documented no increase in peak ACTH, cortisol, and epinephrine in response to cycling at both maximal and submaximal levels; in addition, patients performing at submaximal levels showed failure to regularize ACTH secretion pattern. It is conceivable that an impaired corticosteroid feedback would have also occurred in our COPD patients, who were regularly taking maintenance inhaled corticosteroid medications.</p><p>The second result of the trial was the significantly higher ET in patients allocated to treatment than in those allocated to comparator. Central to the interpretation of this effect is the observation that elongation of ET occurred while enduring against a submaximal inspiratory load, which is defined as an exercise requiring less than VO<sub>2max</sub>. Under this condition, it seemed unlikely that improved delivery of O<sub>2</sub> to respiratory muscles was responsible for the increased endurance. On the contrary, it would have been consistent with the occurrence of a training effect brought about by the metabolic consequences of biochemical adaptations in respiratory muscles. They were represented by the increase in oxygen expenditure due to ET elongation and plasma lactate after IRB challenge and presumably slower utilization of carbohydrates, as assessed by &#x00394;IL-6<sub>IRB</sub>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that IL-6 production during resistive breathing is regarded as a predictor of respiratory muscle metabolic adaptations in response to a nonpharmacological thermal intervention such as MBT model. And, there is considerable interest regarding the mechanisms, which can elicit increase in ET in response to packs with medicinal clays. Eventually, the achievement of a training effect using a passive warm-up routine is of vital importance in patients suffering from COPD. It could represent a smart strategy for treating the effects of deconditioning that often limits the success of traditional rehabilitative options.</p><p>Previous studies<xref rid="b21-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> in both rat model and human beings have provided indirect evidence for muscle mitochondria adaptations to training of adequate intensity. Lately, studies conducted using saponin-skinned fiber oxygraphic technique showed the higher capacity for in situ mitochondria of respiratory muscles to generate ATP<xref rid="b23-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and higher efficiency of ATP production and changes in energy distribution within patients with COPD, who chronically experience an endurance training-like effect.<xref rid="b24-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, the significant increase in ET we documented was not the result of an active strenuous muscle contraction training. Instead, it probably resulted from the temperature effect and possibly chemical and biochemical properties of mature medicinal clays applied on the body skin for 2 weeks. And, we feel quite confident to exclude that the use of a single session of threshold IMT before thermal interventions and 2 weeks later would have had adequate intensity and duration to elicit the hypothesized biochemical changes. Overall, training effects have been reported in response to strenuous endurance exercise carried out for &#x0003e;1 h/d over a period of time exceeding 2 weeks in elite runners.<xref rid="b25-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Brooks et al<xref rid="b26-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> measured the relationship between temperature and mitochondrial respiration in isolated rat skeletal muscle in vitro at temperatures between 37&#x000b0;C and 45&#x000b0;C. They reported an increase in nonconservative mitochondrial respiratory state (state 4) and suggested the possibility for metabolic effects to occur due to the well-known effect of temperature on the rates at which biochemical reactions proceed. Lately, Power et al<xref rid="b27-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> used a new technique for the measurement of ATP consumption in real time and confirmed previous in vitro findings. Therefore, under the high state 4 respiration at ~40&#x000b0;C, the ATP production seems not to increase with increasing temperature, despite the increased energy demand. The ATPase stimulation favors the reaction to proceed toward generation of ADP and inorganic phosphate to result in higher oxygen consumption and potentially in a certain reduction of ADP:O ratio.</p><p>The clinical rehabilitation setting of the study prevented the possibility of using dedicated laboratory techniques to ascertain the biochemical mechanisms of energetic adaptations occurring at the subcellular mitochondrial level. Nevertheless, LnVO<sub>2Endur</sub>/&#x00394;IL-6<sub>IRB</sub> relationship we measured during IRB challenge can be regarded as a clinical biomarker of the respiratory&#x02013;metabolic adaptations, which occurred after exposure to the high temperature of packs with medicinal clays.</p><p>After thermal interventions, the higher oxygen expenditure during endurance suggested better O<sub>2</sub> utilization to cope with muscle&#x02019;s need for energy because it resulted from an increase in ET while average VO<sub>2</sub> did not change. In addition, the results of ANCOVA analysis indicated that the higher VO<sub>2Endur</sub> in patients allocated to MBT model is predicted by &#x00394;IL-6<sub>IRB</sub> when adjusting for baseline respiratory oxygen cost. To the extent that muscle-derived IL-6 can be regarded as a hormone-like glucose-regulatory mechanism and a signal of critical low levels of glycogen content to the working muscles,<xref rid="b28-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> its rise upon the IRB challenge after the passive warm-up sessions of medicinal clays would be taken as an indirect sign of lower glycogen utilization or slower glycolysis activation in respiratory muscles during IRB challenge.</p><p>There is no contrast between these results and currently available evidence in patients suffering from COPD that the primary factor regulating diaphragm and inspiratory muscles oxidative capacity is the high concentration of phosphate acceptor ADP.<xref rid="b24-copd-10-2235" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Thus, it is conceivable that the moderate IRB challenge performed after muscle warm-up with medicinal clays acted as an input signal to the respiratory oxidative muscles fibers. Here, the higher ADP-stimulated respiration and tightly coupled energy transfers within the oxidative muscle fibers might have enabled the higher respiratory oxygen expenditure and slower glycolysis activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>In addition to the above topics, two further aspects must be accounted for in the interpretation of the results.
