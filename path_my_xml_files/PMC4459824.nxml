Animal work indicates that post-training caffeine administration augments inhibitory avoidance memory, spatial memory, and object memory. In humans, post-training caffeine administration enhances the ability to discern between familiar images and new, similar images. However, the effect of post-training caffeine administration on motor memory has not been examined. Therefore, we tested two groups of low caffeine consumers (average weekly consumption &#x02264;500 mg) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving acquisition of a continuous isometric visuomotor tracking skill. On Day 1, subjects completed 5 blocks (150 repetitions) of training on the continuous isometric visuomotor skill and subsequently ingested either 200 mg of caffeine or placebo. On day 2, subjects completed an additional 5 blocks of training. Day 1 mean performance and performance variability were both similar between groups, suggesting that both groups acquired the motor skill similarly. For mean performance on Day 2, patterns of re-learning, mean performance learning magnitudes, mean performance learning rates, and mean performance retention magnitudes were all similar between groups. For performance variability on Day 2, there was a small trend towards increased variability in the caffeine group during re-learning, but performance variability learning magnitudes and performance variability retention magnitudes did not differ between groups. Because motor skill acquisition can also be conceptualized as a reduction in performance variability, these results suggest that there may be a small negative effect of post-practice caffeine administration on memory of a newly-learned visuomotor skill. Overall, we found no evidence to suggest that post-training caffeine administration enhances 24-hour retention of a newly-learned continuous visuomotor skill, and these results support the notion that memory-enhancing effects of post-training caffeine ingestion may be task-specific.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this project was provided by Graduate and Professional Student Government at the University of Iowa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gpsg.uiowa.edu/">http://gpsg.uiowa.edu/</ext-link>).

In the motor domain, caffeine ingestion decreases reaction times [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but reduces motor steadiness. For example, a single dose of 200&#x02013;300 mg of caffeine increases whole-arm resting tremor [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which could potentially interfere with the performance of motor skills.</p><p>Caffeine also may improve learning and memory, although it is difficult to exclude increased arousal and motivation at the time of learning as the underlying cause of these improvements [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, recent work indicates that caffeine directly impacts the neural mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Acute administration of caffeine immediately <italic>after</italic> task exposure improves both 24-hour inhibitory avoidance memory and 24-hour spatial memory in rodents [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, caffeine administration after exposure to a novel environment does not enhance memory for the new environment [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], suggesting that caffeine may not improve all forms of memory. Recent work in humans showed that ingestion of a single 200 mg dose of caffeine immediately after exposure to visual images enhanced subjects&#x02019; ability to discriminate between those images and lure images (i.e., images that resembled those presented initially) one day after initial exposure [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because caffeine was given immediately after learning in this study and in the aforementioned animal work [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] it appears that a single dose of caffeine may stabilize the neural representation of newly-acquired information.</p><p>Few studies have directly examined the effects of caffeine on motor memory, and these have produced conflicting results. When caffeine was ingested prior to conditional motor skill learning, the rate of learning across three consecutive days increased but the final amount of learning was unaffected [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In contrast, when caffeine was ingested 60 minutes prior to recall of a newly-learned motor sequence, memory was impaired [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In these studies, caffeine was administered prior to testing; thus, the attentional, motivational, and psychomotor effects of caffeine cannot be ruled out. These potentially confounding effects can be avoided by administering caffeine immediately <italic>after</italic> motor practice, and examining retention of the newly-learned skill 24 hours later after the acute effects of caffeine have dissipated. In this way, changes in performance one day later can be attributed to alteration of offline processes underlying motor memory stabilization. However, we are unaware of any reports using such an experimental design in the context of motor learning.</p><p>We therefore aimed to determine if a single dose of caffeine immediately after visuomotor skill acquisition alters 24-hour retention of the skill. To answer this question, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy, young individuals who normally consume low levels of caffeine. Based on recent findings that post-training caffeine administration improves memory processes in humans [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] we predicted that subjects who ingest caffeine immediately after practicing a novel continuous visuomotor skill would demonstrate better 24-hour retention of the skill than those who ingested placebo immediately after practice. However, we found no evidence that post-practice caffeine administration improved retention of the continuous visuomotor skill.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited 26 subjects for participation in this study. Subjects were assigned to either the caffeine or placebo group to ensure similar distributions of age, sex and average weekly caffeine consumption between groups (see <xref rid="pone.0129543.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Subjects were free of neurological, orthopedic, or cardiovascular disorders and were not taking any medications that act on the central nervous system. All subjects reported right hand dominance and consumed less than 500 mg of caffeine during an average week. We recruited low caffeine consumers because these individuals may be more sensitive to caffeine ingestion, which should strengthen our ability to detect an effect of caffeine on motor memory. However, it is important to note that results from low caffeine consumers may not generalize to individuals who consume higher levels of caffeine (James 2014).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0129543.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0129543.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Subject characteristics.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0129543.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0129543.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measure</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Caffeine Group (mean &#x000b1; SEM)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo Group (mean &#x000b1; SEM)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">t-value (df = 24)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Avg.

For this study, we developed a continuous isometric visuomotor tracking task (CIVTT) that requires precise control of index finger abduction force. During motor practice, subjects were seated at a small console. The right hand was placed palmar side down on a flat surface, with the webbing between the index finger and thumb braced against a vertical steel rod. The medial border of the hand and forearm was blocked in place using sandbags, and a small sandbag was laid on top of the forearm to restrain motion further. The radial side of the distal phalanx of the index finger contacted a small force transducer with a round surface (diameter = 3.3 cm; ATI Nano, Assurance Technologies, Garner NC) covered with fine-grain sandpaper and mounted on a rigid frame. Subjects were instructed to abduct their index finger against the force transducer to generate a force that drove an oscillographic display on a flat computer monitor in order to control the vertical movement of a cursor. The cursor scrolled automatically from left to right at 5.9 cm/sec. During testing, a single stationary complex waveform was statically displayed on the computer screen (<xref rid="pone.0129543.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), and this waveform was visible during all trials. To successfully track the waveform, subjects had to produce a time-varying abduction force. The cursor moved 1 cm vertically per 0.08 N of abduction force, with a maximum waveform height of 12.5 cm (i.e., peak of waveform equivalent to 1.02 N of abduction force). The waveform template was 26 cm long, each trial lasted for 4.4 seconds, and subjects rested for a minimum of 1.6 seconds between trials. In general, most subjects rested for 2&#x02013;4 seconds between trials and therefore moved through each practice block in a self-paced manner. Subjects completed 5 blocks of 30 trials each, and rested for 2 minutes between blocks but were allowed an additional 1&#x02013;2 minutes of rest between blocks if requested. During each trial of the CIVTT, subjects received continuous visual feedback of the cursor position, and both the tracking trajectory from the previous trial and the complex waveform were displayed on the computer screen after each trial. Subjects could visually compare their tracking trajectory to the shape of the complex waveform after each trial. After all training blocks were complete, subjects ingested (with water) either a 200 mg capsule of caffeine anhydrous or a visually-identical placebo capsule. Subjects were then free to leave the laboratory and were reminded to abstain from caffeine and alcohol until the next testing session.</p><fig id="pone.0129543.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0129543.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Image of the complex waveform used in the CIVTT.</title><p>Subjects were instructed to produce a time-varying abduction force by pressing on a small force transducer using their index finger in order to track the complex waveform.

Force signals applied perpendicular to the plane of the transducer were sampled at 1000 Hz and data were stored for offline analysis.</p><p>The main outcome measure for this study was root mean square error (RMSE; Schmidt and Lee 1988) of the target waveform and the tracking force-time trajectory generated by index finger abduction force. Here, RMSE measures the discrepancy between perfect performance and actual performance. Smaller RMSE values indicate better performance (less tracking error), whereas larger RMSE values indicate poorer performance (more tracking error). RMSE was calculated for each trial of each block using custom-written MATLAB routines (TheMathWorks, Natick MA). We calculated mean performance from trial-by-trial RMSE values within each block, and as a secondary measure of skill acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we also determined each subject&#x02019;s performance variability by calculating the trial-by-trial standard deviations for each block.</p><p>We also calculated learning rates using mean performance values. We determined the mean performance learning rates on days 1 and 2 by fitting each subject&#x02019;s data with an exponential function. For each day, we first averaged each subject&#x02019;s trial-by-trial data into 15 consecutive bins of 10 trials each. Then, we fit a single exponential function to each subject&#x02019;s Day 1 and Day 2 data using the least squares method. The general form of the exponential function was:

where <italic>a</italic> is the performance asymptote, <italic>b</italic> is the change in performance from bin 1 to performance asymptote, <italic>n</italic> is the amount of practice, and <italic>c</italic> is the rate constant. The rate constant was defined as the proportion of mean performance reduced per unit time and was taken as the measure of learning rate. Smaller rate constant values indicate slower skill acquisition and larger rate constant values indicate faster skill acquisition. In one case where the <italic>b</italic> parameter was negative (i.e., exponential fit showed performance losses during practice), the rate constant value was set at 0. Additionally, we did not include performance variability learning rates in our overall analyses due to poor fits of the exponential models with binned standard deviation data (averaged R<sup>2</sup> value for exponential fits for binned standard deviation data = 0.56 &#x000b1; 0.04 [SEM]).</p><p>For both mean performance and performance variability, we calculated learning magnitudes for each day using the following formula:

Here, learning magnitudes represent the percentage of either mean tracking error (for mean performance learning magnitudes) or variability in tracking error (for performance variability learning magnitudes) that subjects reduced by the end of testing on each day. Finally, we calculated retention magnitudes for mean performance and performance variability by dividing Block 5 Day 1 values by Block 1 Day 2 RMSE values and multiplying by 100. Hence, retention magnitudes of 100% represent complete retention of practice-induced gains in mean performance or reductions in variability, whereas retention magnitudes greater than 100% or less than 100% represent offline gains or losses, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We tested for group differences in age, average weekly caffeine consumption, sleep quality and sleep duration using unpaired t-tests.

Group x day ANOVA, with repeated measures on factor day, were used to examine differences in mean performance learning rates, mean performance learning magnitudes and performance variability learning magnitudes. We also performed unpaired t-tests to assess group differences in mean performance and performance variability retention magnitudes. Finally, Pearson&#x02019;s correlations were used to examine relationships between average weekly caffeine consumption and mean performance and performance variability learning magnitudes, mean performance and performance variability retention magnitudes, and mean performance learning rates.

We found no evidence that post-practice caffeine ingestion improved 24-hour retention of a continuous visuomotor skill. Specifically, on Day 1, prior to any caffeine or placebo administration, subjects in both groups demonstrated similar improvements in mean tracking performance and similar reductions in performance variability. Day 1 learning rates and magnitudes were also similar, indicating that there was no systematic bias in motor performance or learning ability at baseline. On day 2, subjects who had ingested 200 mg of caffeine immediately after Day 1 skill acquisition demonstrated similar retention magnitudes, re-learning magnitudes and re-learning rates compared to those who had ingested placebo after Day 1 skill acquisition. However, we found that subjects in the caffeine group showed greater within-subject performance variability than those in the placebo group on Day 2, although this effect did not reach significance. Because motor learning can also be assayed as a reduction in performance variability with practice [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], this small trend suggests that post-practice caffeine administration may slightly negatively impact motor memory. Finally, we also detected near-significant positive relationships between average weekly caffeine consumption and Day 1 mean performance learning magnitudes and Day 1 performance variability learning magnitudes. At first, the correlational results may appear to contradict our overall findings, but it is important to note that any benefits of regular caffeine use detected using performance measures (such as the learning magnitudes examined here) do not necessarily extend to retention [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Our findings contrast with a recent study by Borota and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These investigators reported that ingesting 200 mg of caffeine immediately after studying visual images improved subjects&#x02019; ability to discriminate between the studied images and lure images (i.e., images that resembled the images that were previously studied). Animal studies utilizing post-training caffeine administration have demonstrated augmented inhibitory avoidance memory [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and improved spatial memory [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, retention of habituation learning was unaffected by post-training caffeine administration [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Angelucci and colleagues suggested that the effects of caffeine on memory cannot be generalized to all forms of learning and that such effects are probably task-dependent. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a well-accepted biological substrate for learning and memory [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], so one possible explanation is that the task-dependent effects of caffeine on memory are related to differences in the forms of LTP underlying the memory of each task. For example, differences exist in hippocampal LTP even between basal and apical dendrites; LTP at apical dendrites becomes resistant to reversal much faster than LTP at basal dendrites does [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Likewise, it is reasonable to consider that different learning tasks might rely on LTP-like processes with different properties. Such differences may mediate caffeine&#x02019;s apparently task-dependent effects.</p><p>Genetic variation also may have contributed to the discrepancy between our results and those from Borota and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], although this seems unlikely. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and catechol-<italic>O</italic>-methyl transferase (COMT) can affect motor learning. For example, presence of the BDNF polymorphism impairs motor learning and cortical plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and presence of the COMT polymorphism enhances certain types of motor learning [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and may also influence cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that the groups tested in our study versus the Borota study had different distributions of individuals with pro-learning and pro-memory genotypes, but because neither of these studies tested for polymorphisms in the BDNF or COMT gene, we cannot be sure if genetic variability can explain our contrasting findings. Additionally, in our study, individuals with pro-learning genotypes may not have been equally distributed between groups, but if this was the case we would expect to observe significant differences between groups during Day 1 skill acquisition prior to any caffeine or placebo administration. Indeed, subjects in both groups performed very similarly during Day 1 skill acquisition, so we do not think differences in genetic variability between groups significantly impacted our findings.</p><p>One motivation for this study was that caffeine administration might improve motor memory through adenosine receptor antagonism. Long-term potentiation-like plasticity is thought to underlie motor learning [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and may even be critical for motor skill retention [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], so any intervention that alters the induction and maintenance of LTP-like changes in human cortex might also alter memory [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that supra-physiological concentrations of adenosine can prevent the development of LTP in hippocampal slices [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], potentially through activation of A1 receptors [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The adenosine receptor agonist 2-chloradenosine inhibits the induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus in vivo [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and endogenous adenosine also exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on the development of LTP in rat hippocampal slices [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because the effects of moderate caffeine consumption are primarily mediated by adenosine receptor antagonism [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], A1 receptor antagonism via caffeine could attenuate adenosine&#x02019;s inhibitory influence on LTP. In support of this idea, theophylline (a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist that is chemically similar to caffeine) facilitates hippocampal LTP [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The task tested here (CIVTT) relies heavily on visuomotor integration, which involves fronto-parietal circuits [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Frontal and parietal cortex have a moderate density of A1 receptors [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], so we hypothesized that caffeine would antagonize A1 receptors in these brain regions, leading to facilitation and stabilization of LTP-like changes in frontal and parietal cortex. However, our findings do not support this hypothesis.</p><p>We are aware of limitations to the current study. Caffeine withdrawal may develop during caffeine abstinence [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Caffeine withdrawal produces symptoms such as headache, tiredness/fatigue, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, and irritability (for review, see [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]) can impair cognitive and motor performance [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and subsequent caffeine ingestion reverses these effects [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. If withdrawal reversal was a significant issue in this study, individuals with higher levels of average weekly caffeine consumption should have performed the poorest on day 1. Instead, we found the contrary: these individuals tended to perform the best (see <xref rid="pone.0129543.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Thus, we do not think that withdrawal reversal impacted our findings. In addition, it is also possible that the motor learning task used here was not sensitive to the memory-enhancing properties of caffeine. Recent work suggests that motor learning relies on the interaction of several different neural mechanisms, including use-dependent plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], operant reinforcement [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], error-based learning [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and explicit strategy [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Importantly, different motor learning tasks (such as sequence learning, skill learning, and motor adaptation) likely recruit each of these mechanisms to a different extent [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and the extent to which each mechanism is recruited might affect consolidation patterns. For example, explicit sequence learning shows sleep-dependent consolidation whereas implicit sequence learning does not [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and there are also differences in brain activation patterns during consolidation depending on whether explicit information is provided during learning [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that different motor learning tasks could respond distinctly to post-training caffeine administration, and we caution against over-generalization of our results to other forms of motor learning. Future studies should test the effects of post-training caffeine ingestion in other motor learning paradigms.</p><p>Previous work examining caffeine&#x02019;s effects on learning and memory have relied on either self-reporting of caffeine use [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or biochemical assays to confirm abstinence [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We did not collect saliva samples to confirm caffeine abstinence. Nevertheless, if subjects in either group did not abstain from caffeine prior to or during testing, this should have increased the between-subject variability in our data set. Yet, an examination of between-subject variability during Day 2 testing (visualized through the error bars in Figs <xref rid="pone.0129543.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129543.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>) reveals that this variability was small, demonstrating that our sample was relatively homogenous in terms of motor performance. Such homogeneity suggests that either 1) caffeine use was well-controlled during abstinence periods and subjects complied with our requests for caffeine abstinence, or 2) caffeine was ingested during abstinence periods, but this ingestion did not produce much between-subject variability. If the latter scenario occurred, then it appears that any undocumented caffeine ingestion between sessions did not significantly alter the homogeneity of our sample, and thus probably did not impact Day 2 performance. In addition, even if subjects did not completely abstain from caffeine prior to or during the study, subjects in the caffeine group still received a large dose of caffeine immediately after motor skill learning on Day 1. In order to match any effect of this post-practice caffeine ingestion, subjects in the placebo group would have needed to consume a large amount of caffeine (approaching 200 mg) immediately after leaving the laboratory on Day 1. Given that subjects in the placebo group consumed, on average, less than 100 mg of caffeine during a normal week, this possibility seems improbable.</p><p>Overall, we found no evidence that post-training caffeine administration enhances 24-hour retention of a newly-learned continuous isometric visuomotor tracking skill. These results contrast with other work completed in both humans and animals [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but are consistent with claims that post-training caffeine administration does not enhance all types of memory [<xref rid="pone.0129543.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To better characterize any memory-enhancing effects of post-practice caffeine administration, future studies should examine multiple forms of learning and memory.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Michael Freedberg for assistance with exponential curve-fitting.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0129543.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
