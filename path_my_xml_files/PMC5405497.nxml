Foot orthoses are an effective intervention for improving pain and function in younger individuals with patellofemoral pain and may be effective in those with patellofemoral osteoarthritis. This pilot study will seek to establish the feasibility of a phase III randomised controlled trial to investigate whether foot orthoses worn in prescribed motion controlled footwear are superior to prescribed motion control footwear alone in the management of patellofemoral osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This phase II pilot clinical trial is designed as a randomized, single-blind, parallel group, two arm, superiority trial. The trial will recruit 44 participants from Queensland and Tasmania, Australia. Volunteers aged 40&#x000a0;years and over must have clinical symptoms and radiographic evidence of patellofemoral osteoarthritis to be eligible for inclusion. Those eligible will be randomized to receive either foot orthoses and prescribed motion control shoes, or prescribed motion control shoes alone, to be worn for a period of 4&#x000a0;months. The feasibility of a phase III clinical trial will be evaluated by assessing factors such as recruitment rate, number of eligible participants, participant compliance with the study protocol, adverse events, and drop-out rate. A secondary aim of the study will be to determine completion rates and calculate effect sizes for patient reported outcome measures such as knee-related symptoms, function, quality of life, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, general and mental health, and physical activity at 2 and 4&#x000a0;months. Primary outcomes will be reported descriptively while effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the secondary outcome measures. Data will be analysed using an intention-to-treat principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this pilot trial will help determine the feasibility of a phase III clinical trial investigating whether foot orthoses plus motion control footwear are superior to motion control footwear alone in individuals with patellofemoral osteoarthritis.

Knee OA is common, affecting up to one-third of individuals aged over 60&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Individuals with knee OA experience significant pain, functional disability and poorer quality of life compared to age-matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Importantly, knee OA has no cure. Those with end-stage disease typically undergo total knee replacement, which is associated with annual costs exceeding $145 million per year in Australian public hospitals alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Based on radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, the patellofemoral (PF) joint is the knee compartment most commonly affected by OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. When considering the compartments individually, isolated PF OA is more prevalent than isolated tibiofemoral (TF) OA (PF OA: 15&#x02013;25%, TF OA: 1&#x02013;17%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Notably, even mild radiographic PF OA is associated with greater pain and functional limitations when compared to similar levels of radiographic TF OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patellofemoral OA is observed in 55% of people aged 40 to 50&#x000a0;years of age who have PF pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and has the potential to significantly impact on economic productivity, quality of life and daily function.</p><p>Despite the substantial individual and societal burden of PF OA, there is surprisingly little evidence for effective treatments. Based on similarities in clinical symptoms, structure and function between PF OA and PF pain in adolescents and young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], it is plausible that treatments with known efficacy for PF pain may also be effective for PF OA. Support for this suggestion comes from a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), which demonstrated that a physical therapy program developed for PF pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] is also effective in improving pain in older adults with PF OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Foot orthoses, inserts worn in everyday footwear, are another intervention with potential to be an effective intervention for PF OA. In those with PF pain, there is evidence from RCTs that foot orthoses are significantly more efficacious than a wait-and-see approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and flat insoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] over 6&#x000a0;weeks, with few and mild adverse effects observed. We have shown that individuals with PF OA experience immediate improvements in pain when performing functional tasks with foot orthoses, compared to shoes alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While mechanisms of foot orthoses effects in PFP and OA are unclear, it has been proposed that foot orthoses may reduce the internal rotation of the tibia and femur that often accompanies foot pronation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] thereby reducing lateral forces of the patella against the femur and resultant PF joint stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The longer-term effects of foot orthoses on pain and function in those with PF OA have yet to be evaluated.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to establish the feasibility of a phase III randomized clinical trial to determine if customized foot orthoses worn in prescribed motion control footwear are superior to prescribed footwear alone, in individuals with PF OA over 4&#x000a0;months. Specifically, feasibility will be assessed by evaluating: (i) participant recruitment rate; (ii) the number of eligible participants; (iii) the willingness of participants to commit to the study protocol; (iv) optimal time frames for manufacture and provision of the interventions; (v) adherence to the interventions over the 4&#x000a0;months of the study; (vi) the number of adverse events; (vii) diary completion, and; (viii) drop-out rate.</p><p>The secondary objective of this study is to determine completion rates and calculate treatment effect sizes for patient reported outcomes assessing knee-related symptoms, function, quality of life, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, general and mental health, physical activity, treatment satisfaction, treatment success, and self-reported recovery rate, at two and 4&#x000a0;months. Two measures, the change in average and worst knee pain rated on a visual analogue scale, and patient-perceived global improvement from the interventions, will form the primary outcomes for a phase III trial and will assist in sample size calculations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental design</title><p>This pilot study is a 4-month randomized, assessor-blind, multicenter, parallel group superiority trial with a 1:1 allocation.

The interventions will be issued 2 to 4&#x000a0;weeks after the initial baseline testing session. All participants will receive an educational package outlining wearing-in procedures and the importance of regular use of the interventions. Clear verbal and written instructions will be provided on how to acclimatize to the intervention over a period of 1&#x000a0;week, according to standard clinical protocols. For example, on the first day of use, participants will be asked to wear the allocated intervention for one hour during light activity (preferably around the home), then two hours on the second day, three hours the third day, and so on, until eight hours of continuous use is achieved. Participants are then encouraged to continue to wear the interventions for at least 8&#x000a0;h each day thereafter. In addition, general information on PF OA and advice regarding management of the condition will be provided. Participants will be encouraged to continue with all regular activities. We will also advise patients to avoid using additional pain medications (other than those used regularly prior to study commencement), topical preparations for their knee, knee braces, or additional physical therapies during the study period.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Foot orthoses</title><p>This study will utilise custom-made foot orthoses. The older cohort targeted in this trial is expected to display a greater range of foot deformity and morphologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] than those observed in PF pain cohorts under 40&#x000a0;years of age. Commencing with an individualised, neutral semi-weight bearing foot scan for the fabrication of the foot orthoses will partially address this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>To fabricate the devices, 3D foot contours will be acquired during the baseline visit via an Orthema&#x000ae; Mobile 08/12 digitiser with Orthowin Software (version 4.80.80, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), using standardised procedures detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The foot digitiser has 544 mechanical measuring pins, which elevate to obtain a full contact 3D measure of the foot contours. All scans will be taken by the same investigator (NW), who has over 6&#x000a0;years experience with the Orthema system. Scans will be acquired according to a standardised protocol (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) similar to the gait-referenced system used by Trotter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to acquire foam impressions of the foot.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Foot scanning protocol</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Foot scanning protocol</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>One foot is placed in a semi-weight bearing position with the other foot on the floor for stability.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Foot posture is adjusted to obtain a neutral talonavicular position determined by manual palpation, with the supra- and infra-malleolar curves of equivalent curvature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>The long axis of the foot is aligned in the sagittal plane with the long axis of the scanner plate.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The hip, knee and ankle joints are aligned in the sagittal plane.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The medial forefoot is loaded to contact the scanning plate if possible, to correct for soft tissue forefoot varus alignment.

</p><p>Foot orthoses will be modified using Orthema Orthowin Software (version 4.80.80, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Additions will be according to a standardized procedure (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). All participants will receive a metatarsal dome, cuboid pad, heel cup contour and a plantar fascia groove. A medial or lateral rear-midfoot wedge will be added, depending on the degree of foot pronation or supination rated using the Foot Posture Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and the degree of pronation or supination (mild, moderate, severe) observed upon visual gait assessment, reflecting clinical practice. The orthoses will be fabricated by Orthema Australasia (Brisbane, Australia) from single medium to high density EVA bases (Shore A 45&#x000b0;). The orthoses will be milled in an Orthema&#x000ae; M65 CNC Milling Machine (Rotkreuz, Switzerland) into a size-matched orthotic blank. The rough milled device will be undercut in the arch to improve shoe fit, then covered in 1.5&#x000a0;mm medical grade neoprene (OrthoNeo, Orthema Australasia) and buffed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Orthema Orthowin&#x000ae; Software Addition Protocol and Orthotic Fitting Modifications</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="3">CAD software adjustments</th></tr><tr><th/><th>Addition type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Heel cup contour</td><td>&#x025aa; Width of horseshoe shape adjusted to create smooth heel contour</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Medial rearfoot skive</td><td>&#x025aa; Height dependant on degree of pronation as rated by the FPI:<break/>&#x02003;Mild: 140% (height approx. 23&#x000a0;mm; FPI: 0&#x02013;4),<break/>&#x02003;Moderate: 170% (height approx. 28&#x000a0;mm; FPI: 5&#x02013;8),<break/>&#x02003;Severe: 200% (height approx. 33&#x000a0;mm; FPI: 9+)<break/>&#x025aa; No medial skive will be added to a supinated foot type</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Cuboid pad</td><td>&#x025aa; 50% height (approx. 10&#x000a0;mm)<break/>&#x025aa; 150% of original addition length added to region of cuboid (approx. 122&#x000a0;mm)</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Metatarsal dome</td><td>&#x025aa; Standard shape at 90% height (approx. 5&#x000a0;mm) and width adjusted to leave approx. 1.5&#x000a0;cm either side of block<break/>&#x025aa; Length adjusted to extend from proximal metatarsal heads to base of metatarsals</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Rearfoot-midfoot supination/pronation wedge</td><td>&#x025aa; Height adjusted dependent on degree of pronation or supination as rated by the FPI<break/>&#x02003;Mild: 140% (height approx. 13&#x000a0;mm; FPI: 0&#x02013;4),<break/>&#x02003;Moderate: 170% (height approx. 17&#x000a0;mm; FPI: 5&#x02013;8),<break/>&#x02003;Severe: 200% (height approx. 20&#x000a0;mm; FPI: 9+)<break/>&#x025aa; Length adjusted to finish just proximal to 1<sup>st</sup> metatarsal head</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Plantar fascia groove</td><td>&#x025aa; 2&#x000a0;mm depth<break/>&#x025aa; Length adjusted to span medial longitudinal arch along approx. line of plantar fascia and the FHL tendon</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Footwear</title><p>All participants in both groups will receive one pair of standardized shoes. Those allocated to the foot orthoses intervention group will wear their orthoses in the prescribed shoe. We chose to prescribe a standardized shoe for participants to wear the orthoses in, on the basis that good quality footwear alone exerts therapeutic effects on lower limb pain and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and has the potential to alter lower limb kinematics at the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, footwear may influence the therapeutic effects of foot orthoses. It has been recommended that footwear be controlled for in studies investigating clinical outcomes in knee pain populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Participants allocated to the footwear intervention will use the prescribed shoes alone for the study duration.</p><p>Footwear will be sized by an independent professional retailer (The Athletes Foot, Brisbane, Queensland; The Running Edge, Hobart, Tasmania) approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks after baseline testing, and sent directly to the primary investigator (NW) who will administer them to participants approximately 4&#x000a0;weeks after baseline testing. If the participant is allocated to the foot orthoses group, they will also collect their foot orthoses at the time the footwear is issued. Participants will receive a New Balance 857 cross-trainer (Boston, Massachusetts) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This shoe is a neutral motion control cross-trainer, available in multiple width fittings to accommodate most foot dimensions. It features medial and lateral thermoplastic urethane posts so as to not induce a medial or lateral bias to rear- and mid-foot alignment. The posts are further reinforced by a graphite ROLLBAR&#x000ae; for motion control. The midsole of the New Balance 857 is dual density. The midsole density at the forefoot is 57&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 Asker C (equivalent to Shore A 35&#x000b0;), while the heel is 65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 Asker C (equivalent to Shore A 40&#x000b0;). These densities exceed minimum density requirements to reduce falls risk in older populations (Shore A 33&#x000b0;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Due to these features, the shoe does not compress easily and will maintain the prescribed wedging included in the orthoses, in addition to ameliorating any increased risk of falls in this older cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Modifications to interventions</title><p>The orthoses may be modified at the initial fitting session to optimize comfort and foot alignment when worn in the prescribed footwear. Modifications will be according to a standardized protocol based on our previous RCT of foot orthoses for PF pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). If modifications are required, the orthoses will initially be modified for comfort using self-adhesive wedges (Formthotic&#x000ae; firm 6&#x000a0;mm extended wedges, Christchurch New Zealand). Once comfort has been achieved, the effect of the orthoses on the support of the foot alignment during gait will be visually determined. The orthoses may be further modified using the same steps described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> to attain a more neutral rear and midfoot posture as required.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Foot orthoses fitting and modification protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13047_2017_200_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

All modifications will be kept to a minimum and fully documented by the primary investigator.</p><p>While inclusion/exclusion criteria aim to ensure that participants do not exhibit other significant lower limb pathology, it is possible that either intervention may generate new pain in addition to exacerbating existing knee pain. If new or increased pain occurs, and the interventions are suspected to be the cause, this will be managed using standard clinical practice principles. The interventions will be withdrawn until the new pain settles, and slowly reinstated as able and without exacerbating any pain. Should the pain return, the treatment will be ceased. All increases in pain will be reported as an adverse event. Participants will be questioned regarding any adverse effects from either intervention at 3&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks and at the completion of the study (16&#x000a0;weeks).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Adherence &#x00026; retention</title><p>To encourage adherence, when interventions are issued at baseline, all participants will be informed that both interventions are &#x02018;active&#x02019; interventions i.e. neither is a control intervention.

If participants experience adverse effects (e.g. excessive pressure from the foot orthoses, blistering, increase in knee pain), modifications will be made by the primary investigator. Participants experiencing difficulties will be contacted by phone or email at weekly intervals thereafter to ensure they are progressing satisfactorily until they are comfortable with their intervention. All participants will be contacted via email at 8&#x000a0;weeks regarding their allocated intervention (at 2&#x000a0;month follow-up).

<italic>Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</italic>. The KOOS is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses five domains: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living function, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A 5-point Likert scale is used to score items from 0 (no problems) to 4 (extreme problems). Scores are transformed to a 0&#x02013;100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems.

<italic>PainDETECT</italic>. The painDETECT questionnaire will be used to identify the presence of neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This questionnaire consists of nine items; seven evaluating pain quality, one evaluating pain pattern, and one evaluating pain radiation. These items contribute to an aggregate score ranging from &#x02212;1 to 38, where a higher score indicates more neuropathic&#x02014;like symptoms. In knee OA populations, painDETECT score is associated with pressure pain thresholds, and may reflect central pain processing in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</italic>. The IPAQ will be used to give an estimate of physical activity level across the study period. The short-form IPAQ is a seven-item questionnaire that assesses the intensity and duration of physical activity over the last 7&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Questions 1&#x02013;4 ask the participant to indicate the number of days they undertook vigorous and moderate activity for a minimum of 10&#x000a0;min. They are also asked to rate the total number of minutes they usually undertook these activities per day. Questions 5 &#x00026; 6 rate the number of days and minutes per day spent walking.

Thirty-six items are used to calculate eight scores across the following domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Transformed scores range from 0 (worst health state) to 100 (best health state).</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>EQ-5D</italic>. Quality of life will be measured using the EQ-5D (EuroQoL) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The EQ-5D is a generic measure of health-related quality of life and has 5 dimensions: (i) mobility; (ii) self-care; (iii) usual activities; (iv) pain/discomfort; and (v) anxiety/depression. Each question has three possible responses: no problems, some problems, or extreme problems. The EQ-5D also has a health state scale which asks participants to rate their state of health on a 100-point scale, with 0 indicating worst imaginable health state and 100 indicating best imaginable health state.

<italic>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia</italic>. Psychological factors are associated with impairment in knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Kinesiophobia, defined as &#x0201c;an irrational and debilitating fear of physical movement and activity resulting from a feeling of vulnerability to painful injury or (re) injury &#x0201c;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] will be assessed using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia. This scale consists of 17 statements on the subjective experience of injury and physical activity, which are each scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;. A total score from 17 to 68 is then calculated by summing the individual item scores after inversion of the individual scores of items 4, 8, 12 and 16. A score of 17 represents no fear of movement or re-injury, and 68 indicates a greater fear. The 17-item Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (English version) possesses a high degree of internal consistency and is predictive of disability levels after controlling for clinical pain in back and neck pain populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The Tampa Scale has been applied to knee OA populations for rating &#x02018;activity avoidance&#x02019; and &#x02018;somatic focus&#x02019; (the tendency to notice and report physical symptoms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale</italic>.

It is a reliable and widely used 20-item scale with 3 subscales: self-efficacy for managing pain (5 items); self-efficacy for physical function (9 items); and self-efficacy for controlling other symptoms (6 items) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Items are rated on a 10-point scale regarding certainty of their ability to perform a task, manage their pain or control their symptoms, with 0 being very uncertain and 10 being very certain. Each subscale is scored separately by taking the mean score of the subscale items. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale</italic>. The HAD scale is a 14-item scale that will be used to investigate whether there is an association between PF OA and emotional state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Seven questions relate to anxiety and seven to depression, with participants asked to select the best of four possible responses. The questions are scored from 0 to 3 with scores for anxiety and depression summed separately to give total scores for each component. Total scores of 0&#x02013;7 represent no anxiety or depression, 8&#x02013;10 is borderline, and 11&#x02013;21 indicates the presence of an anxious or depressive state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The HAD has been shown to be a reliable and valid indicator of anxiety and depression severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and has been used in a previous study of physiotherapy in PF pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></list-item></list>

As PF OA and PF pain in younger individuals may form a disease continuum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], non-surgical interventions known to be effective in younger individuals with PF pain may also improve symptoms associated with PF OA. This has been demonstrated with multimodal physiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, it is plausible that foot orthoses, another effective intervention in PF pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], will also be effective in older people with PF OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>This pilot trial protocol has been designed to optimize its scientific rigor by following SPIRIT guidelines and with reference to the CONSORT statement for pilot and feasibility trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Strengths of the trial design include randomized, concealed allocation of interventions, blinded data analysis, and the use of outcome measures with proven reliability and validity in PF pain, PF OA or general knee OA. Furthermore, we have selected interventions and outcome measures that are easily administered in a clinical setting, which improves the clinical applicability of study findings.</p><p>We have chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of customized foot orthoses for PF OA. This is on the basis that the older cohort targeted in this trial is expected to display a greater range of foot deformity and morphologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which can be more readily accommodated with a customized orthoses base. This is in contrast to previous studies in PF pain in younger adults, which used prefabricated foot orthoses based on their cost effectiveness, clinical time constraints with regards to provision of devices, ease of standardization for a research setting, and wide availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, increasing availability of computer-assisted design and manufacture of customized foot orthoses allows for more standardized adjustment of custom molded devices suitable for a research setting, as well as faster manufacturing times. This pilot trial will assist in determining time frames for provision of customized devices. Should point estimates of effects suggest positive short-term benefits of customized foot orthoses for PF OA, this trial will inform the conduct of larger RCTs with longer-term follow-up reflecting standard clinical practice (e.g. at least 12&#x000a0;months), and concurrent cost-benefit analyses.</p><p>Eligibility criteria for this trial do not require participants to have a particular foot type. While foot orthoses have traditionally been prescribed for conditions associated with excessive foot pronation, they have been shown to be effective in a range of foot types and conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. While the mechanism of effect of foot orthoses in PF pain is unclear, foot mobility rather than foot posture has better predicted outcomes with foot orthoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. It is unknown as to what foot characteristics are associated with PF OA, and whether specific foot characteristics will predict outcome with foot orthoses. A recent review highlighted that with advancing age there is a decrease in foot mobility, strength and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Thus, the relationship between foot characteristics and foot orthoses outcomes in PF OA are likely to be different to younger individuals with PF pain. While this issue would benefit from investigation, individual differences in foot structure and mobility in this older cohort will be accounted for in this study by the use of customized foot orthoses.</p><p>Foot orthoses must be worn in footwear. Recent investigations into the effects of different footwear on pain and medial knee loads in individuals with medial TF OA concluded that personal footwear might have significant, potentially negative effects on knee loading and pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Footwear features such as midsole density or flexibility alter the interface between the foot and the support surface, affecting both the proprioceptive input and structural support of the foot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Clinical trials investigating the effect of foot orthoses on lower limb pathology must therefore consider the influence of the type of footwear worn on the stuctural support of the foot and the effect of the footwear on proprioception, as footwear has a significant effect on balance parameters and falls risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The decision to use the New Balance 857&#x000ae; motion control cross-trainer with foot orthoses in this study was based on its structural features, which were considered unlikely to influence the camber of the orthoses, while physically supporting the foot and providing a stable base of support to reduce risk of falls. By controlling for footwear, and using footwear as a comparator, this trial will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of customized foot orthoses, while reducing the potential influence of confounders such as footwear. This pilot trial will assist in determining participant compliance with footwear restrictions over 4&#x000a0;months to inform feasibility of footwear restrictions for longer term studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This phase II pilot randomized controlled clinical trial will explore the effectiveness of foot orthoses and prescribed motion control footwear, compared to prescribed footwear alone, in the management of PF OA over a 4-month period. The information derived from this trial protocol will help inform future large-scale clinical trials on non-surgical management of PF OA.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of participants commenced in November 2014, and final results are expected to be available mid 2017.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AKPS</term><def><p>Anterior knee pain scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Approx</term><def><p>Approximate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>EuroQol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GROC</term><def><p>Global Rating of Change</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAD</term><def><p>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPAQ</term><def><p>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KOOS</term><def><p>Knee osteoarthritis outcome score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mm</term><def><p>Millimeters</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>n</term><def><p>Number</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p>Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PASS</term><def><p>Patient acceptable symptoms state</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PF</term><def><p>Patellofemoral</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPIRIT</term><def><p>Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TF</term><def><p>Tibiofemoral</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Orthema Australasia for the loan of the foot digitizer, Orthowin Software and manufacturing and provision of the orthoses; Jean Gurney, Chris Hetherington and Adam Wolbers from New Balance Australia for the provision of footwear; and staff of The Athletes Foot (Brisbane) and The Running Edge (Hobart) for their professional service in sizing participants for the study footwear.
