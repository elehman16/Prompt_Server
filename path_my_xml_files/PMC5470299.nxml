Twenty-five percent of adults and 60% of individuals aged more than 60 years in developed countries.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Hypertension prevalence is remarkably high in Iran.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] A study in Iran had reported that 91.2% diabetic patients had no blood pressure control.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Community-based control or prevention of hypertension is achievable just through accurate and proper strategies in different community levels; all community members including family members, religious institutes, schools, and social organizations and others have to be involved and to participate in order to achieve the goals.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It seems that traditional programs are insufficient without the application of educational models or using theoretical frameworks.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, the impact of knowledge and attitude on behavior is reasonable; there are many other factors in treatment processes or patient's adherence to treatment protocol, such as personal skills and environmental factors affecting patients&#x02019; behaviors.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] BASNEF Model is one of the educational models which highlighted impact of enabling factors and subjective norms besides knowledge and attitude in individual behavior.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This changing behavior model indicated factors such as attitudes (semistructured beliefs about an object or situations which make individuals ready to respond to specific directions), enabling factors (supplements, funds, skills that coordinate necessary situations for the realization of behavior), behavior (an observable practice), and subjective norms (perceived social pressure causes more tendency to be significant to others as role models).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It is obvious that planned theory-based interventions can lead to behavioral changes.

This research was approved by the Educational Deputy of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The criteria included confirmed type 2 diabetes and hypertension of at least 1 year, systolic blood pressure of more than 130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of more than 80 mmHg were confirmed in two visits; there was no history of psychological disorders and willingness to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were failure to attend the educational program or missing one-fourth of the planned sessions. Research team prosecuted a call to invite study participant, then, two hundred patients who met inclusion criteria participated as intervention or control groups. Baseline data were conducted and participants were divided randomly into two groups of intervention and control. Permuted block size of four patients was used to randomly divide patients into two study groups. The purpose of this study explained to participants to acquire guaranteed verbal information about their consent and confidentiality of data. Based on principles of research ethics, participation was voluntary and they had the right to leave the study. The questionnaires were filled anonymously. To consider ethical points, an educational program in two sessions was performed for control groups after completing the study process. The one hundred participants who were attended to in the intervention group during the 6-month intervention program which included 5&#x02013;6 educational sessions within the period of 1 month consisted lecturing, question and answer, group discussions, and problem-solving strategies were based on BASNEF Model to adopt self-care behaviors regarding type 2 diabetes and control and its complications, especially hypertension. Based on the nature of BASNEF constructs, different and appropriate educational strategies were utilized. The control group just received routine treatment plan of the center. Data were collected at baseline and 6 months after the last session of intervention program. The self-designed questionnaire included two main sections; demographic characteristics and health-related variables including type 2 diabetes and hypertension including age, gender, level of education, family income, occupation, smoking, disease duration. The BASNEF Model-related items included BASNEF Model constructs (38 items) behavioral belief (8 items, e.g., regular physical activity [i.e., 30 min 5 days a week] has positive effect on blood pressure control), attitude (8 items, e.g., adherence to healthy diet and smoking cessation), intention (8 items, i.e., did you have serious decision on blood pressure and diabetes control), subjective norms (8 items, i.e., my family support me in blood pressure control), and enabling factors (6 items, i.e., educational sessions about blood pressure control is available for me). Scoring all the constructs except those that were based on 5-point Likert scale (very low = 1 to very high = 5); hence, the total score of the constructs excluded the enabling factors that ranged from 38 to 160. Enabling factors were ranged with three responses (from 2 = Yes, 1 = Sometimes, and 0 = No). Practice about hypertension control was assessed by 6 items with three responses (from 2 = Yes, 1 = Sometimes, and 0 = No). The validity of questionnaire was confirmed by 10 expert members in diabetes, hypertension, and health education fields. Cronbach's alpha for each construct was as follows: belief = 0.95, attitude = 0.88, intention = 0.88, subjective norms = 0.71, enabling factors = 0.70, and practice = 0.84. Cronbach's alpha for the model constructs ranged from 0.70 to 0.95. The theory-based intervention program about blood pressure control was performed by one of the researchers who were aware of the health education models. The purpose of this blend of educational programs and importance of the nature of disease were introduced to the patients to involve them and to choose appropriately informed actions based on individual conditions theoretically and practically. Blood pressure measured by a unique pressure gauge for two groups during the study. Interventional program contents were provided based on pretest results. The intervention program included five to six sessions of lecturing, question and answer, role playing, educational films, and printed materials that focused on different aspects of the disease. In intervention group, ten groups consisted of ten participated in the study. Every session lasted 45&#x02013;60 min with 2-week intervals. In the first session, patients and educators have reviewed the baseline data together to arrange the patient's concerns, classify more challenging areas, and set behavioral goals. The whole intervention program lasted 1 month. After intervention, the patients spent 6 months getting prepared to change previous behaviors and adopt behaviors to attain healthier lifestyles. Then, they filled out the questionnaire 6 months after intervention programs for the second time. The most important purposes of this program included helping patients to confront care issues, explaining about the importance of blood pressure control and diabetes care behaviors, organizing behavioral stages to reach the goals gradually, reinforcing the achieved benefits, identifying barriers, and trying to overcome these concerns, improving general knowledge about blood pressure control and diabetes care. All data analyses were performed using SPSS version 16 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A) through descriptive and inferential statistical tests. Sociodemographic and disease-related variables were compared at baseline between the two groups. Means were compared using independent sampled <italic>t</italic>-tests.
