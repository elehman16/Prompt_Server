It provides the body with nitrogen and amino acids, including the 9 amino acids classified as indispensable that are of crucial importance in preserving and maintaining bodily functions and life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Both in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) it has been shown that energy and macronutrient balance are regulated over time, and it has been posed that specifically protein intake is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Accordingly, animal studies have shown that rodents have several behavioral strategies for regulating the ingestion of indispensable amino acids, including meal termination, altered food choice, foraging for foods that will complement or correct for deficiency, development of learned aversion to a deficient or imbalanced food to avoid that food in the future, and memory for the taste, smell, or place associated with protein-containing foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In humans, the range of protein intake has remained relatively constant over time and across populations, both as a percentage of energy in the diet (&#x0223c;10&#x02013;25%) and in terms of absolute amount eaten (&#x0223c;40&#x02013;100 g), but it is less clear whether behavioral strategies exist to avoid shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Several studies have shown that hungry subjects show a preference for high-protein foods (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), but the causal short-term relation between protein content, food choice, and satiety remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), because there are many contradictory findings (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a low protein status compared with a high protein status on food intake and food preferences.</p><p>Our approach consisted of measuring the effect of 2 different diets that varied in protein content (a low-protein diet compared with a high-protein diet). To achieve differences in protein status, the dietary intervention lasted for 14 d. Afterward, ad libitum food intake was measured for 2.5 d.</p><p>We hypothesized that when protein status is low, after 14 d of consuming a low-protein diet, food preferences will shift to high-protein foods, resulting in a higher protein intake than after consuming a high-protein diet.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty-seven subjects (12 men, 25 women) with a mean (&#x000b1;SD) age of 21 &#x000b1; 2 y and a mean (&#x000b1;SD) BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of 21.9 &#x000b1; 1.5 completed the study. Of the 41 participants enrolled in the study, 4 dropped out during the first week (2 from each treatment). A supplemental flow diagram of the progress through the phases of the study is available online (<italic>see</italic> Supplemental Figure 1 under &#x02018;Supplemental data&#x02019; in the online issue). We recruited healthy, normal-weight subjects aged 18&#x02013;35 y. Exclusion criteria were as follows: restrained eating [Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire: men, score of &#x0003e;2.25; women, score of &#x0003e;2.80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>)], lack of appetite, an energy-restricted diet during the past 2 mo, change in body weight &#x0003e;5 kg during the past 2 mo, stomach or bowel diseases, diabetes, thyroid disease or any other endocrine disorder, prevalent cardiovascular disease, use of daily medication other than birth control pills, having difficulties with swallowing/eating, hypersensitivity for the foods used in the study, being a vegetarian, and, for women, being pregnant or lactating. Potential participants filled out an inclusion questionnaire including a medical history questionnaire. They then attended a screening session, which included measurement of weight and height. In addition, the procedures were explained and an FFQ<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2"><sup>4</sup></xref> was filled out. Results of the FFQ showed that the mean (&#x000b1;SD) daily energy intake reported by the subjects was 11.3 &#x000b1; 3.8 MJ, and protein intake 93 &#x000b1; 31 g.</p><p>Subjects were unaware of the exact aim of the study and were informed that we were investigating the effect of specific diets, which varied in macronutrient content, on food preferences. Subjects were naive to the fact that we specifically varied the protein and carbohydrate content of the diets.</p><p>The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Wageningen University. This trial has been registered with the Dutch Trial register (registration no. NTR2491). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The study consisted of a 14-d fully controlled dietary intervention involving subjects who consumed isoenergetic diets that were either low in protein (containing 0.5 g protein &#x000b7; kg BW<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; &#x0223c;5% of energy derived from protein) or high in protein (containing 2.0 g protein &#x000b7; kg BW<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; &#x0223c;21% of energy) in a randomized, crossover design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The amount of protein in the low-protein diet was below the average daily recommendation and was considered to be inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Both diets were preceded by 2 d during which subjects ate a normal-protein diet containing 1.0 g protein &#x000b7; kg BW<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (&#x0223c;11% of energy), which is the average consumption of the Dutch population within this age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). These 2 d were used to adapt subjects to the procedure and to ensure energy balance. To assess the effect of protein status on food intake and food preferences, the intervention was followed by an ad libitum phase of 2.5 d during which a large array of food items was available. During the dietary intervention, appetite was assessed during 3 single 24-h periods: on day 2 of the normal-protein diet (baseline rating) and on days 1 and 14 of the low- and high-protein diets. In addition, the LFPQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) was completed on day 14 of each dietary condition, before the first ad libitum lunch. The 2 dietary conditions were separated by a 2-wk washout period, and during this time subjects were instructed to consume their habitual diet.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p>Design of the study. Subjects received a normal-protein diet for 2 d. Afterward, they were divided into 2 groups: one group received a low-protein diet for 14 d and one group received a high-protein diet for 14 d. The diets were followed by an ad libitum phase of 2.5 d during which a large array of food items was available, and intake was measured. Appetite was measured during 3 single 24-h periods: on day 2 of the normal-protein diet and on days 1 and 14 of the low- and high-protein diets (24-h appetite ratings).

Subjects chose the remaining 10% of energy from a list of items that included virtually protein-free and fat-free foods (common procedure within our division with regard to long-term controlled dietary intervention studies, <italic>see</italic> reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Their choice was recorded in a diary. Each subject's total energy requirement was estimated by using the results of the FFQ, which was filled out during screening, and by means of the Schofield equation, taking into account age, weight, height, sex, and a physical activity level of 1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>During weekdays at lunch, the participants visited the division and consumed their hot meals. All other foods were supplied daily as a meal package and consumed at home. The home meal package contained 2 bread meals with toppings for dinner and breakfast and beverages, fruits, and snacks. On Fridays, subjects received a home meal package with foods and beverages for the entire weekend plus instructions for the preparation of these foods. Subjects were instructed to eat all of the foods that were provided. They were allowed to use seasoning and table salt. During weekdays, palatability of the hot meals was rated by using a 10-point Likert scale (mean &#x000b1; SD results: low-protein diet, 8 &#x000b1; 2; high-protein diet, 7 &#x000b1; 2). Palatability of the home meal packages was measured 3 times for both dietary conditions (day 1, day 8, day 14; mean &#x000b1; SD results: low-protein diet, 7 &#x000b1; 1; high-protein diet, 8 &#x000b1; 1).</p><p>The ad libitum phase of 2.5 d that followed the dietary intervention started with a hot lunch; participants could select foods themselves and eat until comfortably satiated. Large meal packages were provided for consumption at home and contained &#x02265;200% of the estimated energy requirements. The home meal packages consisted of foods that were not available during the intervention and included buns with toppings for dinner and breakfast and beverages, fruits, and snacks. The foods were provided in unusual portion sizes to prevent habitual intake. In addition, many foods were offered in both a low- and high-protein version to enable selective protein intake (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). In total, the ad libitum phase comprised 3 lunches and 2 home meal packages. Individual food intake was measured by weighing the remainder of food on the plate (during lunch) and the home meal packages the next day.

Each subject completed an appetite questionnaire hourly during waking hours over the 24-h period by using a Personal Digital Assistant (HP iPAQ with EyeQuestion version 3.8.3 software; Logic8 B.V.) starting after lunch from 1400 until 1200 the next day. The questionnaire consisted of 7 dimensions: hunger, fullness, prospective consumption, desire to eat, appetite for something sweet, appetite for something savory, and thirst. The 10-point Likert scale was anchored with &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;extremely.&#x0201d;</p><p>The LFPQ was completed on day 14 of each dietary condition, before the first ad libitum lunch. The LFPQ is a computerized hedonic analysis platform that measures explicit and implicit components of food reward and included photographs of 16 foods varying in 2 dimensions: protein (low and high) and taste (sweet and savory). These 4 categories were matched on energy density, fat content, and type of food (each category contained one sandwich, one snack, one cookie, and one meal item). For explicit measures, each food was shown and subjects had to rate their liking (&#x0201c;How pleasant would you find the taste of this food right now?&#x0201d;) and their wanting (&#x0201c;How much do you want to eat this food right now?&#x0201d;) on a visual analog scale (100 mm). In addition, foods were presented in randomized pairs, and subjects had to select their most wanted food (&#x0201c;select the food that you most want to eat right now&#x0201d;) as quickly and accurately as possible. During the latter procedure, both frequency of preferred choice (relative food preference) and reaction time were measured. Because participants were not informed about the measurement of their reaction time for each choice and were unable to monitor their responses, this measure provided a nonverbal, implicit assay of their motivation (implicit wanting). Reaction times were transformed to a standardized <italic>d</italic> score by using a validated algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>): the smaller the <italic>d</italic> score, the greater the implicit wanting for that food category relative to other categories in the task.</p></sec><sec><title>BW, urine nitrogen excretion, and analytic methods</title><p>BW was measured twice a week before subjects ate their hot meal while subjects were wearing no shoes or heavy clothing. If a subject's weight fluctuated &#x0003e;0.2 kg from baseline, the research dietitian decided whether energy intake needed to be adjusted for weight maintenance.</p><p>As an independent, objective marker of dietary compliance, total urine nitrogen excretion was measured from two 24-h urine collections made during day 14 of each dietary condition. Results showed that total urine nitrogen excretion decreased with low dietary protein intake (low-protein diet: 84 &#x000b1; 17 mg &#x000b7; kg BW<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; high-protein diet: 248 &#x000b1; 38 mg &#x000b7; kg BW<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). These data confirm that the low-protein diet was inadequate and contained protein amounts below the average daily recommendation (equivalent to 105 mg nitrogen &#x000b7; kg BW<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Completeness of the two 24-h urine samples was verified by recovery of three 80-mg doses of paraaminobenzoic acid given with the meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Analyses showed an average recovery rate of 96.5%. Nitrogen in urine was determined colorimetrically according to the Kjeldahl method (27) (method 920.87) on a Vitros 250 Chemistry System (Ortho-clinical Diagnostics).</p><p>Although we relied primarily on the total nitrogen excretion data as an independent, objective marker of dietary compliance, we also used other means to promote compliance. These included instructing participants to keep a diary to record any deviations from the diet, illness, and use of drugs. Subjects were urged not to change their smoking habits and their physical activities. The latter was also monitored by assessing the number of steps taken each weekday with pedometers (Yamax Digi-walker SW-200).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Comparisons of appetite ratings between the low- and high-protein diet were made by calculating the AUC for all ratings (trapezoidal method), and these were compared by means of ANOVA (mixed-model procedure).

Analyses were performed on protein intake (g) and total intake (MJ) for the total 2.5 d, and separate analyses were performed with days (3 d), lunches (3 lunches), and home meal packages (2 packages) as factors in the model. Intake of the different food categories were compared by means of a paired <italic>t</italic> test. The results of the LFPQ were analyzed by using ANOVA (General Linear Model procedure).</p><p>In all analyses, both main effects and interactions were analyzed. In addition, participants were included in all models as random factors. Post hoc comparisons were made by using Tukey's correction.

In addition, after a low-protein diet, preferences for savory high-protein food were enhanced. These results indicate that after a protein deficit, food intake and food preferences change to restore adequate protein status.</p><p>In animal studies it has long been determined that protein balance is achieved by behavioral strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), whereas in humans it is less clear whether behavioral strategies exist to avoid protein shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).

However, the role of the sensory qualities in the influence of protein on food intake and food choice requires further clarification. Within our food range, foods containing high amounts of protein are in general more savory tasting, whereas foods containing carbohydrates are generally sweeter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>) [&#x0201c;savory taste&#x0201d; refers to nonsweet taste, closely linked to the &#x0201c;umami taste,&#x0201d; which is also described as &#x0201c;broth-like&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;meaty&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>)]. Through consumption of foods during our lifetime we learn to estimate their satiating effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), and it has been suggested that this plays a central role in the development of specific macronutrient appetites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). The intake of different foods observed during the ad libitum phase of our study indicates that sensory attributes play a role in selecting food for macronutrient balance. Indeed, after the low-protein diet, food choice was directed toward savory high-protein foods in comparison with after the high-protein diet. These findings were reinforced by the results of the LFPQ, which showed that after the low-protein diet, food preferences were enhanced and oriented toward savory foods, whereas after the high-protein diet preferences remained stable.</p><p>As shown in our data, the preference for high-protein foods was still present after 3 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It appears, therefore, that protein appetite induced through 2 wk of selective reduction of dietary protein is not extinguished after 3 d of ad libitum intake. It might be that a longer period of time is needed to recover from the protein shortage that has been imposed. More research is needed to quantify the time needed for an organism to regain macronutrient balance.</p><p>To be able to create a large difference in protein amounts between the 2 diets, some compromises were made with regard to the control for the sensory differences between the diets. To obtain more insight, we calculated a taste ratio of the low- and high-protein diets by classifying the offered foods as sweet tasting, savory tasting, or neutral tasting. Subsequently, the total amount of food (g) per taste was divided by the total amount of food (g) provided by the diet. The ratio of sweet:savory:neutral for the low-protein diet was 53:9:39 and for the high-protein diet was 54:15:31, indicating that the low-protein diet contained slightly fewer savory-tasting foods and more neutral-tasting foods. This might have affected the choice behavior during the ad libitum phase, because long-term sensory-specific satiety has been shown to affect food choice and intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). The intake of the different foods during the ad libitum phase, however, indicates that after the low-protein diet a specific selection for high-protein foods was present, and not just for savory foods in general (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Because we offered foods during the ad libitum phase that were not offered during the intervention, we believe that this specific selection for savory high-protein foods is a result of compensatory mechanisms that are induced to restore adequate protein status. In future research, however, it would be preferable during the preparation phase of such a study to perform sensory tests on the foods that are included. This would enable a more specific characterization of the diets on a sensory level, facilitating an even better match.</p><p>The results from the LFPQ indicated that the changes in food preferences appear to involve both conscious (explicit) and subconscious (implicit) processes. It is recognized that both explicit and implicit processes are involved in human eating behavior (eg, references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>); the degree to which implicit processes are involved, however, is not clear. The results of the present study suggest that the role of implicit motivational processes in driving food choice is not static, but can vary. When the human body is in balance (eg, macronutrient balance), it appears that explicit and implicit hedonic responses to foods are similar (eg, after the high-protein diet, explicit and implicit outcomes showed similar results). However, when homeostasis is challenged (eg, prolonged macronutrient imbalance), implicit processes appear to play a stronger determining role in decisions about what to eat (eg, after the low-protein diet, subjects implicitly, but not explicitly, preferred high-protein foods). Results from intake in the ad libitum phase showed that subjects indeed ingested selectively more high-protein foods, even among savory foods. These data advocate the use of these kinds of advanced psychological tools in behavioral food research to help identify underlying mechanisms involved in human eating behavior.</p><p>In conclusion, after a protein deficit, food intake and food preferences show adaptive changes that suggest compensatory mechanisms that are induced to restore adequate protein status. Hence, it appears that human protein intake can be controlled in a very specific manner when allowed by the composition of the food available. This indicates that there are human behavioral strategies present to avoid protein shortage and that these involve selection of savory high-protein foods, made either consciously or unconsciously.</p></sec>
