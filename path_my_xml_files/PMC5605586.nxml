Cerebrolysin is a parenterally administered neuropeptide preparation approved for the treatment of stroke. Both studies had a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Treatment with 30&#x000a0;ml Cerebrolysin once daily for 3&#x000a0;weeks was started 24&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h after stroke onset. In addition, patients participated in a standardized rehabilitation program for 21&#x000a0;days that was initiated within 72&#x000a0;h after stroke onset. For both studies, the original analysis data were used for meta-analysis (individual patient data analysis). The combination of these two studies by meta-analytic procedures was pre-planned, and the methods were pre-defined under blinded conditions. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney (MW) effect size of the two studies on the ARAT score on day 90 indicated superiority of Cerebrolysin compared with placebo (MW 0.62, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001, Wei-Lachin pooling procedure, day 90, last observation carried forward; <italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;442). Also, analysis of early benefit at day 14 and day 21 by means of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, which is regarded as most sensitive to early improvements, showed statistical significance (MW 0.59, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.002). The corresponding number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for clinically relevant changes in early NIHSS was 7.1 (95% CI: 4 to 22). Cerebrolysin had a beneficial effect on motor function and neurological status in early rehabilitation patients after acute ischemic stroke. Safety aspects were comparable to placebo, showing a favourable benefit/risk ratio.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cerebrolysin</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Recovery</kwd><kwd>Early benefit</kwd><kwd>NIHSS</kwd><kwd>Meta-analysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l. 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">After the failure of monomodal neuroprotective therapy to demonstrate benefit in acute ischemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], new concepts must be developed to use multimodal therapeutic strategies, which might not only diminish tissue damage in the acute phase but additionally support neuroplasticity and thereby improve recovery.

In combination with stochastic ordering or one-dimensional alternative, it is a powerful and robust meta-analytic procedure for combining the MW effect size across studies. The one-dimensional alternative of stochastic superiority is to be interpreted as follows: at least one trial has an underlying true beneficial effect and none have an adverse effect (no qualitative interaction). In contrast to other pooling procedures, the Wei-Lachin procedure is also appropriate in case of only very few included studies, such as in the present case of two studies of identical design. Originally developed for robust pooling of subgroup results, the Wei-Lachin approach requires minimal assumptions and has been shown to be robust also with respect to presence of heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Qualitative interaction was tested by means of the Gail-Simon test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">As sensitivity analysis, the classic pooling procedures based on the fixed effect model (Hedges-Olkin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the random effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] were calculated in addition.

Of the patients treated with Cerebrolysin, 46.0% reported at least one adverse event (AE) compared with 41.5% of the patients in the placebo group. Most of the AEs were rated mild in severity (Cerebrolysin, 65.9%; placebo, 66.8%). Most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in at least 5% of the patients in any group were urinary tract infection (5.8% in the Cerebrolysin group and 7.6% in the placebo group) and depression (8.5% in the Cerebrolysin group and 6.3% in the placebo group). Eleven patients (4.9%) in each group suffered from serious adverse events (SAEs), but none of the SAEs were rated as related to study medication. In the Cerebrolysin group the outcome of all SAEs was described as resolved or resolved with sequelae except for two patients (0.9%) who died due to pneumonia and ischemic stroke. In the placebo group, four patients (1.8%) died due to sepsis with acute renal failure and coma, sepsis with multi-organ failure, intestinal ischemia and subdural plus intracerebral hematoma.</p><p id="Par22">Vital signs were similar between the treatment groups, and these factors did not show clinically relevant changes during the course of the study. The laboratory values classified by the investigators as clinically relevant did not exhibit any significant differences between the treatment groups, and no trends toward specific pathological laboratory findings were detected. Overall, the safety outcome reflected the expected safety and tolerability profile of patients after acute ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Observed Case analysis</title><p id="Par23">Since missing values and dropouts represent a risk of bias, an observed case (OC) analysis was performed as pre-planned sensitivity analysis. The OC result of the primary efficacy criterion ARAT is well supporting the primary LOCF analysis (MW<sub>OC</sub> 0.62 with P<sub>OC</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001 as compared to MW<sub>LOCF</sub> 0.62 with P<sub>LOCF</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001).

This deviation should be interpreted with certain care due to the inappropriateness of the random approach to estimate between-study variance properly with only two included studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">While the test for qualitative interaction suggests that there is no indication for opposite effects (Gail-Simon test <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.5), the test for quantitative interaction indicates serious heterogeneity in the full mITT population with respect to the final ARAT results at day 90 (<italic>I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.90). This heterogeneity may be due to the markedly milder stroke severity in CARS-2, allowing good recovery also in the placebo group. The pre-planned analysis of the target subset (exclusion of ARAT zero scores at baseline) markedly reduces the impact of the baseline heterogeneity of the two studies (MW<sub>fixed</sub> 0.60 and MW<sub>random</sub> 0.61, as compared to MW<sub>MERT</sub> 0.61, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lower panel; all <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 two-sided), and quantitative heterogeneity at day 90 is reduced below 50% in the target subset&#x000a0;(<italic>I</italic>

Both studies were placebo-controlled, double-blind, and parallel-group trials with a treatment period of 21&#x000a0;days. Patients were randomly assigned to either Cerebrolysin or placebo, and treatment arms were equally balanced with regard to demographic characteristics. All analyses have been performed using individual patient data (IPD). Cerebrolysin treatment resulted in a statistically significant benefit in the pre-planned nonparametric meta-analysis of the primary efficacy criterion ARAT (Wei-Lachin pooling procedure [MERT]), in the full mITT population as well as in the pre-planned target subset of patients with ARAT baseline score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0. The rate of premature discontinuations was below 5% in both studies (CARS-1, 3.8%; CARS-2, 4.2%), adding to the validity of each of the studies individually and the resulting meta-analysis.</p><p id="Par29">While treatment groups were well comparable at baseline within each single study, and early effect sizes for early improvements were highly consistent, the final results at day 90 showed considerable heterogeneity of effect sizes due to the marked final ceiling effects in the placebo group of CARS-2. The ceiling effects may well be explained by the substantially milder baseline levels allowing good final outcome also in the placebo group of CARS-2. In order to better understand the structural differences between the two studies and also to learn for future study designs and treatment concepts, the baseline situation shall be discussed in more detail, using the highly deviating results of the two placebo groups (final placebo ARAT median of 53.0 in CARS-2 as compared to 27.0 in CARS-1).</p><p id="Par30">In-depth comparison of the placebo distributions of the two studies by means of the cumulative distribution function revealed that CARS-2 has substantially milder baseline levels as compared to CARS-1 throughout the whole ARAT distribution (strong right shift of the CARS-2 curve). This is also expressed by the associated ARAT baseline medians: 33.0 (&#x02018;mild&#x002bc;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in CARS-2 as compared to only 2.0 (&#x02018;severe&#x002bc;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in CARS-1.</p><p id="Par31">Additional baseline characteristics underline the heterogeneity of the two placebo populations: with ARAT baseline zero scores (worst score) in 20 vs 49% of the subjects and an NIHSS baseline level &#x02264;7 in 70% (CARS-2) vs 30% (CARS-1) of the subjects, baseline differences of the two studies are in fact substantial and well explain the good placebo results in CARS-2.</p><p id="Par32">This is also made evident by the motor subscore of the NIHSS: an initial score of 1, indicating only minor impairment, was found in 16.8% of placebo patients in CARS-1 but in 58.3% of placebo patients in CARS-2 (with a mean baseline NIHSS motor score for paretic arm of 2.6 in CARS-1 as compared to 1.7 in CARS-2). It is important to note that NIHSS or single NIHSS items were not an inclusion or exclusion criterion; the inclusion criterion regarding motor arm deficits was based on the primary efficacy criterion ARAT.</p><p id="Par33">Together with the observed ceiling effects in CARS-2 (see boxplots in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, lower panel), the different baseline situation well explains the heterogeneity of the effect sizes for the comparison of Cerebrolysin vs placebo. Where patients are already in a &#x02018;mild&#x002bc; severity status at baseline, also placebo may reach after 90&#x000a0;days the ceiling of the outcome scales.</p><p id="Par34">A major source of baseline heterogeneity could be eliminated by discarding the &#x02018;zero&#x02019;-ARAT scores (worst possible ARAT score). The &#x02018;zero-problem&#x02019; and its corresponding floor effect were discussed in the past by various researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. As expected, the heterogeneity of the studies could substantially be reduced in the target subset (<italic>I</italic>
<sup>2</sup> reduction from &#x0003e;90 to &#x0003c;50%), and the meta-analysis of the two studies became statistically significant also in the random effects model (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0288, two-sided).</p><p id="Par35">Nijland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] defined floor and ceiling benchmarks for the ARAT score as &#x0003c;3 points (floor) and &#x0003e;54 points (ceiling). Sensitivity analysis applying these benchmarks to the baseline ARAT scores for defining a more homogeneous subset of the overall population showed statistical significance in all analyses including the random effects model (MW 0.61, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.68, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0068, Wei-Lachin pooling procedure [MERT]; MW&#x000a0;0.59, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.66, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0110, fixed effects; MW 0.59, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.66, random effects, <italic>I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0). Thus, excluding the outlying baseline patients according to Nijland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], heterogeneity between the two studies was reduced even in a more dramatic way than with sole exclusion of the ARAT baseline zero values, leading to a marked reduction of <italic>I</italic>
<sup>2</sup> from &#x0003e;90 to 0%. It may be useful to apply these benchmarks also in future studies in order to control heterogeneity and to obtain more precise results. More restrictive benchmarks (especially at the upper end of the ARAT scale) could not be evaluated due to the low number of patients within the potential windows of interest.</p><p id="Par36">Due to the final ceiling effects in the placebo group of CARS-2 (day 90), the analyses of earlier points in time were of special interest regarding impact on heterogeneity: placebo effects might not yet have reached the ceiling of good recovery&#x02014;thus, leaving room for detection of additional beneficial treatment effects and potentially converging the results of the two studies.</p><p id="Par37">As noted previously, the NIHSS is most sensitive for such earlier points in time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The analyses for early benefit by means of the NIHSS showed statistical significance in all analyses including the &#x02018;classic&#x02019; fixed effect and random effects models (day 14: <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0016, Wei-Lachin pooling procedure [MERT]; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0014 fixed effects, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0014 random effects, <italic>I</italic>

<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0). Thus, between-study heterogeneity was completely resolved. This confirms the findings of Kerr et al. (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], highlighting the importance of early NIHSS for future research in stroke due to greater sensitivity and better control of background noise.</p><p id="Par38">A supportive analysis on final global disability was performed by means of the modified Rankin scale (mRS) since this is the most commonly used functional measure in stroke trials. The nonparametric analysis of the mRS showed statistical significance at the final visit (day 90) with combined MW&#x000a0;0.61 and <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001 in the mITT population (Wei-Lachin pooling procedure [MERT]). The analysis of the Nijland subset (see above) resulted in an identical effect size (MW&#x000a0;0.61; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0031). As expected from the markedly milder initial stroke severity in CARS-2, substantial heterogeneity of final mRS effect sizes was found at the end of the two trials, even in the more homogeneous Nijland subset (excluding ARAT baseline outliers): while CARS-1 showed strong treatment effects with MW&#x000a0;0.70, CARS-2 indicated only weak effects with MW&#x000a0;0.52. The difference is well explainable by the cited ceiling effects in CARS-2, preventing sufficient assay sensitivity for final mRS. Further trials with higher initial stroke severity are recommended to obtain better insight into the size of treatment effects with respect to long-term functional outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Summary and conclusions</title><p id="Par39">This meta-analysis provides evidence that Cerebrolysin has a beneficial effect on motor function recovery in early rehabilitation patients after stroke. The primary meta-analytic result (ARAT at day 90) was statistically significant in the full mITT population (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) as well as in the pre-planned target subset (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0015). While there was some study heterogeneity, well explainable by the different initial stroke severity with substantially milder cases in CARS-2, sensitivity analyses for patients within the ARAT floor-ceiling benchmarks according to Nijland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] reduced heterogeneity to 0% (<italic>I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>), showing consistent statistical significance in all analytical models. Also, the analysis of early benefit at day 14 and day 21 by means of the NIH stroke scale (NIHSS), which is regarded as most sensitive to early improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], showed statistical significance throughout all analytical approaches. The number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for clinically relevant changes in early NIHSS was 7.1 (95% CI 4 to 22), with a 17.3% rate difference in CARS-1 and a 11.0% rate difference in CARS-2.</p><p id="Par40">The safety characteristics of Cerebrolysin were comparable to placebo, thus suggesting a favourable benefit-risk ratio.</p><p id="Par41">Cerebrolysin as a therapeutic agent should be considered by clinicians seeking early recovery treatment options after stroke. Due to the exploratory character of the two trials, the results should be confirmed by a broader ensemble of trials with sufficient initial stroke severity. Furthermore, introduction of proper inclusion criteria of the ARAT score, avoiding floor and ceiling effects, may be considered for future efficacy studies. The positive and very homogeneous results on early benefit (NIHSS) may encourage future early-phase research on therapeutic interventions after acute ischemic stroke.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="Par42">Alla Guekht: principal investigator of the CARS2 trial.
