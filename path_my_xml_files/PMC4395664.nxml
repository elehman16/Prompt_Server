functional electrical stimulation (BCI-FES) on brain activation in patients with stroke.
[Subjects] The subjects were randomized to in a BCI-FES group (n=5) and a functional
electrical stimulation (FES) group (n=5). [Methods] Patients in the BCI-FES group received
ankle dorsiflexion training with FES for 30 minutes per day, 5 times under the
brain-computer interface-based program. The FES group received ankle dorsiflexion training
with FES for the same amount of time. [Results] The BCI-FES group demonstrated significant
differences in the frontopolar regions 1 and 2 attention indexes, and frontopolar 1
activation index. The FES group demonstrated no significant differences. There were
significant differences in the frontopolar 1 region activation index between the two
groups after the interventions. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that
BCI-FES training may be more effective in stimulating brain activation than only FES
training in patients recovering from stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Brain-computer interface</kwd><kwd>Stroke rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Brain activation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A brain-computer interface (BCI) mesures neuronal signals by using an electrocorticogram

proprioceptive, stimulation sent to direct the movement of muscles by the brain, and
functional electrical stimulation (FES) uses electrical stimulation to overcome paralysis by
directly activating nerves to stimulate motor function. Feedback varies according to the
extent of brain activation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most BCIs are
designed based on motor imagery (MI) and movement execution (ME)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>BCI technology is used in the fields of medical treatment and education as a form of
neuro-feedback. Early technology was developed to allow individuals with severe motor
disabilities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to communicate and interact with their
external environment<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Later on, BCI
technology was applied to rehabilitation exercises for motor neuron rehabilitation in
quadriplegic patients with spinal injury<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.

neuron diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The treatment effects of FES application
can occur by peripheral or central mechanisms. Peripheral mechanisms entail FES applied to
stimulate the patient&#x02019;s remaining motor units to enhance muscular strength, increase range
of motion, and reduce stiffness<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Central
mechanisms occur by a reorganization of the cortex based on neurophysiological responses to

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients were studied more than
six months after clinical diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic hemiparetic stroke, (2)
scored more than 24 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and (3) were able to walk
independently more than 10&#x02005;m. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) severe
hemineglect, (2) history or current diagnoses of other neurological diseases or
musculoskeletal conditions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and (3) prior
adverse reaction to FES application.</p><p>The participants in both the BCI-FES group and FES group participated in the program
according to the designated schedule and were randomly allocated to either group; one
research assistant participated in training, and two research assistants performed study
measurements. Research assistants were educated and trained on the usage of equipment,
measurement method, and training programs prior to the study to minimize errors. BCI-FES
patients received ankle dorsiflexion training with FES for 30 minutes per day for a total of
5 times under the brain-computer interface based program. FES participants received ankle
dorsiflexion training with FES for the same time.</p><p>In the BCI-FES-based training, FES was applied to train the participants when they were
concentrating on the moving ankle motion on the monitor screen, and brainwave patterns were
displayed as the ratio of sensorimotor and M-Beta waves to theta waves. The BCI equipment
consisted of a monitor screen for the subjects, a brainwave measurement tool (PolyG-I), a
laptop to record and process brainwave activity, a USB output board to link the brain waves
to FES signals when the activity was high, and FES and EEG sensors to receive brainwave
information.</p><p>As factors of the external environment such as temperature, place, intensity of
illumination, noise, and smell can influence performance and brain activity, participants
were provided with private space without external stimuli. To measure brainwave activity,
electrodes were attached on the frontopolar 1 (Fp1), and frontopolar 2 (Fp2) regions, with
the reference electrode attached behind the right earlobe, and ground electrode attached on
the left earlobe. For FES training, an inactive electrode was attached to the proximal
tibialis anterior (located 5&#x02005;cm inferior to the head of fibula), which is an antagonist of
plantar flexor muscles, and an active electrode was attached to the distal tibialis anterior
(located on the lateral upper 5&#x02005;cm of the fibula). The study participants sat comfortably on
chairs with armrests and concentrated to move their ankles by looking at a monitor screen
displaying a dorsiflexing ankle. The degree of mental concentration was analyzed using a
brainwave concentration index. For measuring brain waves, the concentration index was
quantified as in the formula above. In a state of concentration, the theta rhythm decreases,
while the SMR (12&#x02013;15&#x02005;Hz) and Mid-Beta rhythms (16&#x02013;20&#x02005;Hz) increase. Increased SMR implies
unfocused attention ability, whereas Mid-Beta rhythms connote focused attention and
cautiousness. Therefore, the concentration index was quantified by a ratio involving SMR,
Mid-Beta, and theta waves as expressed by the formula: (SMR + Mid-Beta)/Theta.</p><p>Before performing measurements, the experimenter passively modulated the stimulated current
intensity of frequency 35&#x02005;Hz, and pulse with 250&#x02005;&#x000b5;s from 1 mA to 50 mA according to the
response from the subject&#x02019;s ankle joint, and input them as they reacted. To gauge the
focused threshold of the subjects, 10 times of focused inspections were implemented before
the training to build an average threshold, and the concentration index threshold was input
into the computer algorithm. After these steps, the subjects were instructed to focus on the
movement of the ankle on the monitor screen. When the measured concentration index exceeded
the threshold of the concentration index where the degree of the subject&#x02019;s concentration was
recorded, this information was transferred to the USB output board to activate the FES
equipment. However, when the measured concentration index did not exceed the threshold, this
information was transferred to the USB output board to turn OFF the FES equipment.
Therefore, FES activation occurred based upon the degree of concentration of the subject. In
addition, when the measured concentration index exceeded the threshold to turn ON the FES,
the electrical stimulation was set to last a maximum of 5 seconds in order to avoid muscle
fatigue.</p><p>Microstim<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Medel GmBH, Germany) equipment was used for both BCI-FES based
training and FES training. This equipment has an adjustable frequency, contraction time,
relaxing time, and pulse width and consists of a foot switch, a pair of surface electrodes
measuring 50 &#x000d7; 50&#x02005;mm, and a stimulator. An inactive electrode was attached to the proximal
tibialis anterior (located 5&#x02005;cm inferior to the head of fibula), which is an antagonist of
plantar flexor muscles, and an active electrode was attached on the distal tibialis anterior
(located on the lateral upper 5&#x02005;cm of the fibula). The waveform was rectangular biphasic and
the therapeutic exercise was adjusted so as not to exceed 50 mA for the patients to endure
as much dorsiflexion as possible. The ramp-up for the maximum intensity was set to take
place in 2 seconds, and the duration of stimulation was set to last 7 seconds. In order to
avoid muscle fatigue because of electrical stimulation, the off-time was set to last 7
seconds, pulse frequency was 35&#x02005;Hz, and pulse width was 250&#x02005;&#x000b5;s.</p><p>A Poly-I instrument (Laxtha, Inc., Daejeon, South Korea) was used to take EEG measurements.
Each EEG measurement was recorded for one and a half minutes while the subjects were
instructed to maintain a comfortable posture with the eyes open and refraining from speaking
or moving to minimize interference from artifacts. EEG electrodes were attached to four
places on the scalp using the monopolar derivation method. The four sites included
frontopolar 1 (Fp1), frontopolar 2 (Fp2), central lobe 3 (C3), and central lobe 4 (C4) in
order in accordance with the International 10&#x02013;20 system. Moreover, reference and ground
reference electrodes were placed behind the right earlobe and left earlobe, respectively.
The electrodes used were gold-plated disc-shaped EEG electrodes (ElefixZ-401CE, Nihon
Kohden, Tokyo, Japan)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For EEG data analysis, a quantitative analysis was conducted using Telescan 2.98 (Laxtha
Inc., Daejeon, South Korea). Among the overall EEG raw data, 70 seconds of each measurement
after excluding the first and last ten seconds was analyzed. Raw EEG data were converted
into frequencies using a fast Fourier transformation. Brain waves were categorized following
convention into theta (4&#x02013;8&#x02005;Hz), alpha (8&#x02013;13&#x02005;Hz), sensorimotor rhythm (12&#x02013;15&#x02005;Hz), mid beta
(15&#x02013;20&#x02005;Hz), and high beta waves (20&#x02013;30&#x02005;Hz). The attention index is the ratio of theta waves
to SMR and mid beta waves, and the activation index is the median age frequency 50%.</p><p>SPSS version 12.0 was used for all statistical analyses. Nonparametric statistical methods
were used due to the small sample size. Wilcoxon&#x02019;s test was used to compare the pretest and
posttest results within each group, and the Mann-Whitney test was performed to compare the
two groups before and after training. A p-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Differences in brain activation after the interventions are shown in <xref

among neurons. They contain important information in a specific pattern varying according to
state of awareness and mental activity. High theta wave activity and low beta wave activity
are common in patients with attention deficit disorder<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Duffy et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that alpha and beta were decreased in quantitative brain wave analysis of elderly
individuals, and Kaiser et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
a significant correlation between event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the unaffected
hemisphere with severity of damage in patients recovering from stroke, and between ERD on
the affected side and severity of spasticity. Nevertheless, there is very little, research
on brain wave analysis in stroke patients. Our study was aimed at grasping the changes in
the attention and brain activation indexes depending on the training method applied to
stroke patients.</p><p>Attention or concentration is defined as the ability to focus and be clearly aware of a
stimulus or to react solely to an internal or external stimulus. It is a significantly
important psychological task in a variety of settings such as in learning or in sports
conditions<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, inability to
concentrate following brain injury is one of the most common problems reported<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Parker et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that patients with apoplexy or traumatic brain
damage were unable to concentrate on a single problem or situation. Individuals&#x02019; minds were
already distracted before finishing a meaningful task. Duchet et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the deficit of concentration common in
stroke or traumatic brain injury can decrease global functioning in learning and daily
activities.</p><p>Given that each domain in the brain plays a specific role in cognition and specific
functions may be impaired if one is affected, the Fp1 domain has been implicated in
concentration disorders, whereas judgment and impulse control are relevant to decreased
function of the Fp2 domain<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our
study, the BCI-FES group showed significant differences in the Fp1 and Fp2 attention
indices, and the Fp1 activation index. On the other hand, the FES group showed no
significant differences. The concentration of the Fp1 and Fp2 domains increased because the
chance to exceed the brain wave concentration index threshold increased following training
of the patients. In order to measure the degree of concentration during BCI-FES training,
electrodes were attached to Fp1 and Fp2 to measure the concentration index of the brain wave
(SMR+Mid Beta/Theta).</p><p>There were a few limitations to this study. First, there were differences between study
groups. Even though the threshold of the BCI program was set up based on the concentration
index, individuals varied in concentration ability, and the small sample size means that
baseline concentration ability differences could significantly alter the results. Second,
when the concentration index figure of the BCI program exceeded the threshold to activate
the FES, the time of functional electrical stimulation was set up to last 5 seconds so that
muscle fatigue would not occur and to provide a resting phase. However, FES often
continuously activated within 5 seconds because of some patients&#x02019; excellent ability to
concentrate, thereby limiting the amount of resting phase. As part of this study, electrodes
were attached to Fp 1 and Fp 2 in an isolated environment without external influences to
measure the concentration index. However, some electrodes attached to patients who showed a
high degree of participation detached from their foreheads due to perspiration. In order to
prevent this problem, electrode pads, rather than electrode glue, were used to fix the
electrodes, and straps were used to prevent pads from falling off, which may serve as
additional sensory stimuli and could potentially bias results. Fourth, attachment of
electrodes was studied in a unipolar induction method when measuring brain waves in this
study. With the unipolar induction method, electric potential activity can be closely
observed, and subcortical depth abnormalities can be easily detected. However, assessing
small local differences is difficult, and noise artifacts can limit detection of subtle
differences.</p><p>In the future, the use of BCI-FES-based training can be revised to rehabilitate not only
ankle movements, but also upper extremity motor function. Additional research and clinical
use of BCI systems is needed to develop programs suitable for rehabilitation of not only
stroke patients but also patients with various disabilities because very little work has
been done with these populations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hochberg</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></name><name><surname>Serruya</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Friehs</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Neuronal ensemble control of prosthetic devices by a human
