Food choice is a complex process, affected by life course experiences, and influenced by personal factors, resources and social context (Furst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>). Thus, an interdisciplinary approach, including physiology, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as other disciplines, is necessary to capture a broad picture of the process. Food choice involves conscious and unconscious negotiations, taking into account sensory perceptions, monetary considerations, health and nutrition beliefs and concerns, convenience, social relationships and food quality decisions (Furst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>; K&#x000f6;ster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>). One important aspect of this process is the perceptions people have of foods. Knowledge about people&#x02019;s perceptions of food in terms of health is essential in order to understand how current nutritional advice is interpreted, and to develop meaningful health messages for the future (Paquette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2005</xref>). Knowledge about people&#x02019;s sources of information about healthy eating gives the opportunity to channel desired health messages through the most relevant media, and to make the use of media more efficient.</p><p>Perceptions of foods in terms of health are fairly consistent across Western populations, with vegetables and fruit more or less universally mentioned as important in a healthy diet (Paquette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2005</xref>). However, regional differences in emphasis exist, due to variations in consumption patterns and nutrition education (Martinez-Gonzalez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>). Healthy eating is a dynamic concept, which may change over time. Immigrants&#x02019; food perceptions are likely to be influenced by both traditions from home country and host culture. However, investigations of food perceptions in terms of health among South Asian immigrants in Western countries are scarce. In a qualitative study among Bangladeshi diabetics in the UK, traditional food classifications such as strong/weak and digestible/indigestible were commonly referred to (Chowdhury et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>). A traditional account of a hot/cold classification of foods has also been reported among Pakistanis in Norway (Mellin-Olsen and Wandel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>). Furthermore, Lawton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>) reported that British Pakistanis tended to view their traditional diet as unhealthy.</p><p>Pakistanis constitute one of the largest non-Western immigrant groups in Norway, and they are among those with highest risk of developing T2D (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>; Jenum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>). A culturally adapted intervention study with the aim to reduce diabetes risk by influencing established risk factors, such as diet and physical activity, has been carried out among women in this immigrant group in Oslo, Norway. The main dietary advice of the intervention was to reduce the intake of sugar and other refined carbohydrates, due to its effect on blood glucose, and exchange them with more fibre-rich carbohydrates, which have been shown to prevent diabetes (Bantle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>). Furthermore, reducing intake of sugar-rich drinks is important in the prevention of obesity, which is a risk factor for T2D and other chronic diseases (WHO/FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2003</xref>). The primary outcomes of the study were changes in fasting and 2-h plasma glucose. Among the secondary outcomes were food perceptions in terms of health, which are reported in the present article. Further, sources from which the women have got their information about healthy eating, and how these different sources are related to food perceptions in terms of health, are explored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and sample</title><p>The intervention study was carried out in 2006&#x02013;2008 in a suburban area of Oslo (S&#x000f8;ndre Nordstrand), containing the highest proportion of Pakistani immigrants/children of immigrants (12%) in the city. Based on experience from working with South Asian populations it has been recommended to use a multi-recruitment approach, and additionally, to follow certain strategies for recruitment of South Asians: define the demographic and social profiles of the population to be included, consult representative community members to provide assistance in the study, and set eligibility criteria as wide as possible (Hussain-Gambles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>). These strategies were followed in the present study, and the multi-recruitment strategy included visits to mosques and other formal and informal gatherings in the local community, as well as word of mouth. Interested women were contacted by phone and given a verbal invitation to participate in the project and to come to an appointment at the local mother and baby health care centre where the intervention took place. Since many women in this group have a low level of literacy, oral communication secures more comprehensive information to potential participants and reaches a larger part of the population. An Urdu-speaking research assistant was in charge of the recruitment.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were: women living in Norway and born in Pakistan or born in Norway by two Pakistani parents, 25&#x000a0;years or older. Of the 245 women invited to the study, 47 were not included according to the following criteria: a history of T2D, close relative already in the project, pregnancy, heart disease, not fitting the inclusion criteria, lack of interest (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9) or other reasons (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11). In total, 198 women were included in the study and randomized to either intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;101) or control (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;97) using a computerized block randomization list, set up by the trial statistician. A central telephone randomization system was used. The research assistant called the randomization telephone at an independent Research Unit to get information on which group the participant belonged to. The Research Unit stored information on ID number. This information was obtained and communicated to the participant after finishing the baseline measurements. The sample size was calculated on the basis of a presumed 10% reduction in 2&#x000a0;h plasma glucose, a significance level of 5%, and a power of 80%, with a calculated dropout on 15%. This resulted in an estimated need of 82 women in each group.</p><p>The intervention group was divided into nine subgroups of 10&#x02013;12 women. Each subgroup had six group sessions, lasting 2&#x000a0;h each, during the 7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;month of the intervention. The group sessions were focused on the importance of diet and physical activity for blood glucose regulation. They aimed at helping the women to incorporate the knowledge acquired into their everyday lives, and to help the women obtaining positive expectancies for lifestyle changes. Culturally adapted materials were used and discussions were encouraged. All the teaching was translated into Punjabi, the preferred language of the participants. The participants were encouraged to reduce sugar and other refined carbohydrates, and change to more fibre-rich carbohydrates, to eat more vegetables, beans and lentils in line with their traditional diet, and to eat more fatty fish. Fruits were recommended in small amounts. Carbohydrates were the main focus of the teaching. Less attention was given to protein and fat. However, the participants were encouraged to change the type of fat from butter/margarine/vegetable oil to olive- and rapeseed oil, and asked to measure the amount of oil used in cooking. In addition, they were given short individual feedback on diet and physical activity, based on their blood tests, after the first group session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Variables</title><p>Data were collected and anthropometric measurements were taken at the local mother and child health clinic both before (baseline) and after (follow-up) the intervention. Interviews carried out by Urdu and/or Punjabi speaking interviewers with the help of a structured questionnaire with open-ended questions were used to collect data on food perceptions in terms of health. The questionnaire was developed based on previously conducted studies in this population (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>; Mellin-Olsen and Wandel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>). Food perceptions in terms of health were assessed through the questions: &#x02018;If you decide to eat food which is good for your body (healthy), what do you emphasise?&#x02019; and &#x02018;What do you think you should eat in limited amounts (unhealthy)?&#x02019; The interviewer wrote down the answers. To ease the work, some expected answers were already written in the questionnaire (not read out loud), and the interviewer could tick one or more of those if the participant&#x02019;s answer fitted. The same procedure was followed for the question to assess the women&#x02019;s sources of information: &#x02018;From whom have you learned what is good to eat, what is healthy?&#x02019; For logistic regressions, having mentioned one food item/source was coded as 1 and not having mentioned it as 0. The women were also asked when/on which occasions they were eating unhealthily. Items mentioned by &#x0003e;5% of the participants are reported here.</p><p>A pre-coded questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data: age, years lived in Norway, years of education (both from Pakistan and Norway), number of children born and self-reported command of Norwegian language. Command of Norwegian language was recoded from five response categories (&#x02018;very good&#x02019;, &#x02018;good&#x02019;, &#x02018;average&#x02019;, &#x02018;quite poor&#x02019; and &#x02018;poor&#x02019;) to &#x02018;good&#x02019; (average&#x02013;very good) and &#x02018;poor&#x02019; (quite poor&#x02013;poor). BMI was calculated from measured height and weight (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight defined as BMI&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;25 and obesity as BMI&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;30. The cut off of BMI&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;27.5, indicating high risk of T2D and cardiovascular disease for South Asians (Deurenberg-Yap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2000</xref>) was also reported. A standardized oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed, i.e. 75&#x000a0;g glucose in 200&#x000a0;ml water was ingested and plasma glucose was determined at time zero (after 12-h fasting) and after 2&#x000a0;h. T2D was defined as by WHO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>) plasma glucose &#x02265;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/l fasting and/or &#x02265;11.1&#x000a0;mmol/l after OGTT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analyses</title><p>The data were analysed using SPSS version 14.02.

McNemar tests were used to explore differences in change from baseline to follow-up within each group. Logistic regressions were carried out to explore associations between socio-demographic factors (age, years in Norway, years of education and command of Norwegian language) and food perceptions and changes in these perceptions. Logistic regressions were also carried out to explore relationships between sources of information and food perceptions in terms of health at baseline. These regression analyses were carried out as bivariate analyses with food items reported to be emphasised in a healthy diet or regarded as to be eaten in limited amounts as dependent variables (reference: those who did not mention the food item in question) and having mentioned an information source as independent variable (reference: those who did not mention the information source).

From baseline to follow-up, there was an increase in proportion of women who emphasised salad/raw vegetables in healthy eating and meant that consumption of refined carbohydrates should be limited, in line with the emphasis of the intervention.</p><p>The Pakistani population is difficult to reach with more conventional recruiting strategies, possibly due to low literacy, poor skills in host language and health beliefs and behaviours different from the host population (Hussain-Gambles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>). Thus, a multi-recruitment strategy was carried out, and the representativeness of the sample can therefore be questioned. However, the women in the present study were comparable to Pakistani women in a large population-based health study in Oslo (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>), with regard to prevalence of BMI above 25 (80%), years of education, years in Norway, and number of children.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Food perceptions at baseline</title><p>In Punjabi, there are no words for &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; or &#x02018;unhealthy&#x02019;. The Punjabi translation of the questions about food perceptions in terms of health was therefore: &#x02018;If you decide to eat food which is good for your body (healthy), what do you emphasise?&#x02019; and &#x02018;What do you think you should eat in limited amounts (unhealthy)?&#x02019; Even if the words &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; and &#x02018;unhealthy&#x02019; do not exist in the language of the participants, they did have concepts of what food items are good for the body and what is not. Thus, the concept was not new to them. The questions were open, in order not to limit the range of responses. Thus, responses could be overlapping. The distinction many women made between vegetables and salad probably reflects the position of these foods in a Pakistani meal. Vegetables are commonly cooked or fried in mixed dishes. Raw vegetables are served as salad, which is a side dish. The results suggest that salad is considered less important in a healthy diet than other vegetables, or regarded less relevant because it is eaten more seldom. However, the high proportion of women perceiving vegetables as healthy is consistent with what is found in the Norwegian and other Western populations (Paquette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2005</xref>; Wandel and Fagerli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1999</xref>). In a Norwegian study (Wandel and Fagerli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1999</xref>), fish, fruit and potatoes were also viewed as important elements of a healthy diet. Fruit is not recommended in great amounts to people with diabetes. Since the prevalence of diabetes is high in the Pakistani community, many women may have heard that fruit consumption should be limited, and therefore not mentioned it as good for the body<italic>.</italic> Furthermore, the women were during the intervention recommended to limit the intake and to use fruit mostly as dessert.</p><p>There were large variations among the women in food perceptions in terms of health. However, socio-demographic differences were generally not significant. In a Norwegian study on perceptions of a healthy diet emphasis on foods rich in protein and fat decreased with education and younger age (Wandel and Fagerli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1999</xref>). The generally low level of education and narrow age range, are likely reasons for not finding similar associations among the Pakistani women. However, the influence of socioeconomic position and demographics on food perceptions in terms of health among Pakistani immigrants should be explored more thoroughly in future research.</p><p>In a qualitative study by Mellin-Olsen and Wandel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>), Pakistani women told about three stages in changes of fat intake after migration. In the beginning they increased the use of butter and margarine, since these foods were culturally favourable and relatively cheap in Norway. Then, as a response to nutrition information received in Norway, they changed to oil. Finally, as the prevalence of overweight and obesity is high in this population, public health information to Pakistani immigrants emphasised reduction of the amount of oil for cooking, and some started to adapt to this advice. The fact that 83% of participants in the present study at baseline considered &#x02018;oil&#x02019;, &#x02018;hard fat&#x02019; and/or &#x02018;fat in general&#x02019; as something to eat in limited amounts, and even some more mentioned frying, indicates that these women have heard the public health information regarding fat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Sources of information</title><p>Common sources of information about food and health were &#x02018;mother&#x02019; (49%), &#x02018;school&#x02019; (40%) and &#x02018;other women&#x02019; (35%), as well as children and other family members. In a study among Norwegian women (Fagerli and Wandel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1999</xref>), &#x02018;mother&#x02019; and &#x02018;other relatives and friends&#x02019; were mentioned as sources of information by about 10%. Thus, having family and friends/acquaintances as important sources of information seems to be far more widespread among Pakistani than among Norwegian women. Furthermore, &#x02018;literature on diet&#x02019; and &#x02018;TV&#x02019; was the most common sources of information about food and health among Norwegian women. The low percentage of Pakistani women seeking information about healthy eating from these sources may be due to less use of these media, low level of literacy, poor Norwegian skills or that relevant literature or programs are not accessible in the mother tongue. However, the distinct use of sources may rather reflect cultural differences in what kind of information is regarded informative and trustworthy. The importance of family, friends and also health personnel as sources of information about healthy eating among Pakistani women implies that peer education may have a large effect. Peer education has shown good effects among South Asians in the UK (Farooqi and Bhavsar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>; Davies et al. 2009).</p><p>The sources of information were related to some of the food perceptions. Having mother as a source of information increased the likelihood of perceiving meat as healthy. This may be due to more traditional ways of thinking about food and health, where meat is considered nourishing and strength giving (Dawes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>). The likelihood of mentioning white rice as something to limit increased when having doctor/health personnel as source of information. Previous qualitative research among Pakistani immigrants with T2D (Fagerli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>) have shown that many experience dietary advice they get from doctors as inadequate to their food&#x02013;cultural background, and often leaves them thinking that their traditional diet, which includes frequent consumption of white rice, is not good for health. The present study emphasised positive aspects of a traditional Pakistani diet, such as high intakes of legumes and vegetables, and the message was not to stop eating rice, but to eat smaller amounts of polished rice and rather exchange this with unpolished rice. A modest increase in the proportion perceiving white rice as something to be limited in the intervention group is likely to reflect this. As about one-fourth of the women mentioned doctor/health personnel as a source of information, it could be beneficial if health personnel focused their advice on healthy eating which is a part of the traditional Pakistani diet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Changes in perceptions following intervention</title><p>The main focus of the intervention was blood glucose regulation, and the benefit of reducing refined carbohydrates, and especially the role of soft drinks, was emphasised. The significant increase in proportion of the intervention group mentioning to limit the intake of sugar (including soft drinks) and white flour indicates success in communicating this message. The focus on vegetables as important in a healthy diet is reflected in the higher proportion of the intervention group emphasising salad/raw vegetables at follow-up. The lack of significant change in perceptions of oil/fat may be due to the fact that most women already at baseline perceived that consumption of these items should be limited, and that it was not the main focus of the intervention. The reduction in proportion of women in the intervention group perceiving meat as good for the body is most likely due to the strong focus on vegetables, lentils and fish during the intervention, which is exchangeable with meat in some dishes.</p><p>The use of open-ended questions to capture food perceptions in terms of health made the likelihood of &#x02018;desirability bias&#x02019; low. However, we cannot rule out that some, after the intervention, have answered according to the recommendations in the group sessions, without being convinced.</p><p>In addition to food perceptions, there are many interacting factors in the food choice process (K&#x000f6;ster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Furst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>). In the present study, changes in perceptions to a large degree corresponded to previously reported changes in food intake in the intervention group (Johansen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>), namely an increase in intake of vegetables and fruit, and a decrease in intake of sugar-rich drinks and meat. However, the answer to the questions on in what occasions they ate unhealthily, implies that other factors, and especially social obligations, were important in food choice. This confirms previous research in this group (Dawes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>; Mellin-Olsen and Wandel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions and recommendations</title><p>The majority of the women in the study emphasised vegetables in a healthy diet and they listed oil, hard fat and sugar as something to be eaten in limited amounts. The food perceptions in terms of health were in general in line with public dietary advice, however, there was large variation among the women. This study indicates that a culturally adapted intervention has the potential to alter food perceptions in terms of health. Lessons learnt from the present study may be used in developing new and needed strategies to communicate health information in this group. Family members and other women were important sources of information about food that is good for the body. Use of community members and peer education could therefore be beneficial. By focusing on various advice such as increasing intake of vegetables and legumes to immigrants of Pakistani origin, public health personnel can contribute to raise the awareness of healthy dietary practices in this population. Focus on the social barriers to putting knowledge on healthy eating into practice has to be continued in future interventions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We want to thank Monica Morris, Aisha Ali, Anica Munir, Marianne Lunde and Eva Kristensen for their contribution to coordination and collection of data.
