This study evaluated the impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (neopterin elevation; a biomarker of pharmacological activity induced by interferon beta-1a) of peginterferon beta-1a following a single subcutaneous dose at 63&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) or 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30). The results showed a fractional increase in area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC [30&#x02013;53%]) and peak serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub> [26&#x02013;42%]) in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, versus healthy subjects; AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were similar for healthy subjects and end-stage-renal-disease patients receiving hemodialysis. Pharmacokinetic simulation showed that the steady state concentration overlapped in the majority of healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment. Neopterin baseline, peak concentration, and AUC increased as renal function decreased. Peginterferon beta-1a was well tolerated in all groups. These results do not warrant peginterferon beta-1a dose adjustment in subjects with renal impairment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>pegylation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>All currently approved injectable treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) require frequent (from daily to weekly) administration, which can inconvenience patients suffering from a debilitating chronic disease. Pegylated interferon beta-1a (peginterferon beta-1a) is in development as a less frequently-injected subcutaneous (SC) therapy for relapsing MS (RMS) that may provide similar safety and efficacy to currently available interferons.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In a pivotal Phase 3 study that dosed 1512 RMS patients, peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g administered SC once every two weeks reduced annualized relapse rate by 36%, risk of relapse by 39%, and risk of disability progression by 38%, when compared with placebo at the end of year 1.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) endpoints, such as new or newly-enlarging T2 hyperintense and gadolinium-enhancing lesions, were also significantly reduced versus placebo. A once every four week dosing regimen was also included in this study; while peginterferon beta-1a every 4 weeks also had a significant effect on the clinical endpoints, the reduction relative to placebo in clinical and MRI endpoints was numerically greater in the every 2 week group compared with the every 4 week group.</p><p>Interferons, as small proteins, are cleared primarily through renal catabolism and excretion;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> pegylation can increase the apparent size of a biomolecule, reducing the glomerular filtration rate, extending the biomolecule's half-life, enhancing its in vivo activity through prolonged systemic drug exposure, and enabling less frequent dosing.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Therefore, to extend the half-life of interferon beta-1a, peginterferon beta-1a was formed via attachment of a 20-kDa methoxy poly(ethyleneglycol) (peg) polymer to the alpha-amino group of the N-terminus of interferon beta-1a, which is not critical for binding to the type 1 interferon receptor.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, compared with non-pegylated interferon beta-1a, peginterferon beta-1a (125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) had a longer half-life (&#x0223c;2 days versus &#x0223c;1 day), increased exposure (maximum serum concentration [C<sub>max</sub>] and area under the serum concentration curve through 168&#x02009;hours [AUC<sub>168</sub><sub>&#x02009;h</sub>]), and prolonged and higher elevations in well-characterized pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of type 1 interferon receptor activation (serum neopterin and 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetase),<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> supporting the contention that pegylation of interferon beta-1a would allow for less frequent dosing.</p><p>Although pegylation reduces the contribution of the renal system to overall clearance and increases the significance of alternative clearance routes (e.g., hepatic<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), renal clearance may still comprise the major clearance pathway. For instance, it was shown that the AUC of 10-kDa pegylated interferon alpha-2b was increased in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment vs. healthy subjects, which necessitated a 25&#x02013;50% dose reduction in patients with renal impairment.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The objective of this study was to investigate whether renal impairment impacts the pharmacokinetics (PK) of peginterferon beta-1a and to provide dose adjustment guidance in MS patients with renal impairment. A population PK model was developed and simulation was carried out to predict and compare the steady state peginterferon beta-1a concentration&#x02013;time profiles between healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment.</p><p>Neopterin (D-erythro-1&#x02032;,2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-trihydroxypropylpterin), a well-characterized biomarker induced by interferon beta-1a in vivo, is a product of the activity of guanosine triphosphate-cyclohydrolase I and is produced by macrophages and monocytes.

Corresponding NCA PK parameters are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>. Peginterferon beta-1a serum concentrations reached a peak at approximately 1&#x02013;2 days post-dose, followed by a gradual decline. By 14 days post-dose, peginterferon beta-1a concentrations had dropped below the LLOQ in all subjects. Peginterferon beta-1a exposure increased with increasing renal impairment except for ESRD subjects. In subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, a 30%, 40%, and 53% increase in geometric mean AUC<sub>336</sub><sub>&#x02009;h</sub>, and a 27%, 26%, and 42% increase in geometric mean C<sub>max</sub> were observed, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. In contrast, AUC<sub>336</sub><sub>&#x02009;h</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were similar between the ESRD and healthy groups. An approximately 24% decrease in peginterferon beta-1a concentration was observed following each hemodialysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>b), indicating that hemodialysis partially removed the drug from systemic circulation. The geometric mean t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> of peginterferon beta-1a was approximately 2 days for subjects with normal renal function or mild or moderate renal impairment, and approximately 3 days in subjects with severe renal impairment.

The absorption rate estimate was 0.0556&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, corresponding to an absorption half-life of 12.5&#x02009;hours, which suggests that absorption of peginterferon beta-1a was almost complete (&#x0003e;95%) 3 days after administration. The typical value of V was greater than the typical values of V for other groups (305 vs. 229&#x02009;L), which might be due to water retention in the ESRD subjects. Based on the drug elimination rate by hemodialysis (K<sub>dialysis</sub>) estimate (0.0454&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), the model predicted a 20% concentration drop following a 4-hour hemodialysis session, which was within the random error, compared to the observed concentration decrease (24%) following each hemodialysis. The hemodialysis schedule was at 3, 5, and 7&#x02009;days post-dose. Based on the typical values, 23% of the dosed drug was removed by hemodialysis. Other hemodialysis schedules were also simulated; hemodialysis occurring at 2, 4, and 6 days or at 1, 3, and 5 days showed 26% or 22% drug removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Simulation</title><p>Simulated steady-state PK profiles for peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g administered every 2 weeks showed that the majority of 5th&#x02013;95th concentration intervals overlapped between subjects with normal renal function and subjects with severe renal impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>).

Exposure to peginterferon beta-1a was similar in subjects with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, and in those with normal renal function. Consistent results were seen for exposure to peginterferon beta-1a, regardless of whether renal impairment was classified according to CrCl or MDRD-GFR.</p><p>Extrapolation using a non-compartmental analysis or using population PK model indicated that non-renal clearance accounted for 53% or 62% of total peginterferon beta-1a clearance, respectively. Hepatic catabolism has been shown to be important for clearance of pegylated (40-kDa) interferon alpha-2a.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A tissue distribution study in mice showed that murine interferon beta was distributed across multiple tissues, including kidney, liver, spleen, and lung.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Catabolism could potentially occur in these tissues and multiple clearance pathways reduce the likelihood of drug accumulation in cases of organ insufficiency.</p><p>Data for ESRD subjects suggest that hemodialysis partially removes peginterferon beta-1a from the systemic circulation; simulation of different hemodialysis schedules confirmed that hemodialysis timing does not significantly change the amount of drug removed by hemodialysis (20&#x02013;27% of dosed drug was removed by dialysis across four different schedules).</p><p>Concentrations of neopterin, an established marker of type 1 interferon receptor activation, increased in all subjects after administration of peginterferon beta-1a, confirming the pharmacological activity of peginterferon beta-1a. Increases in neopterin E<sub>AUC672h</sub> and E<sub>peak</sub> with the severity of renal impairment might have been due to reduced renal clearance of neopterin and possibly due to increased exposure to peginterferon beta-1a. It is known that neopterin is cleared in the kidney and that increasing renal impairment results in greater neopterin accumulation, particularly in subjects with ESRD, due to activation of cellular immune response and changes in blood coagulation molecules upon exposure to hemodialysis.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> These increases in neopterin concentrations are unlikely to be clinically relevant, as there was no corresponding increase in AEs, SAEs, or shifts in laboratory parameters, and no correlation between neopterin concentrations and clinical efficacy has been reported. Additionally, no toxicity of neopterin has been reported.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Therefore, the neopterin PD parameters were not relevant in consideration of dose adjustment, but provided supportive information on the maintenance of peginterferon beta-1a pharmacological activity in renally-impaired subjects.</p><p>Single SC doses of peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g were well tolerated in subjects with renal impairment, with no meaningful difference in the type or incidence of AEs or laboratory assessments between renally-impaired and healthy subjects. The safety profile of peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g SC in this study reflects that previous observations in Phase 1 trials,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> which were suggestive of a safety profile similar to that of non-pegylated interferon beta-1a. Additionally, the pivotal Phase 3 study showed that peginterferon beta-1a was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile, consistent with the well-established safety profile of beta interferons currently used to treat MS; there was no evidence of a relationship between the incidence of influenza-like illness and exposure to peginterferon beta-1a.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Overall, the fractional increase in exposure in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment was not considered clinically significant and no dose adjustment appears to be necessary for patients with renal impairment receiving peginterferon beta-1a. An evaluation of the PK and PD of peginterferon beta-1a in the Phase 3 study is currently underway and will be the subject of a subsequent publication to assess whether MS disease changes drug disposition, and whether the current study interpretation is applicable to MS patients.</p><p>In comparison, analyses of another pegylated interferon, 10-kDa peginterferon alpha-2b, showed that renal impairment can affect drug exposure, with a greater elevation in exposure seen with decreased renal function.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In a single-dose PK study, AUC increased by 27%, 77%, and 107% in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, respectively;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> in a multiple dose PK study, AUC increased by 30% and 120% in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Variation in the impact of renal impairment on the PK of these two pegylated interferon agents could be explained by differing molecular sizes (with peginterferon beta-1a having a larger 20-kDa pegylation attachment), as this can increase steric hindrance for renal clearance and reduce the contribution of renal clearance. Another difference was that peginterferon alpha-2b is administered more frequently (once weekly) than peginterferon beta-1a (once every two weeks). Given that t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> was similar between peginterferon beta-1a and peginterferon alpha-2b (52.7&#x02013;77.8&#x02009;hours vs. 40.0&#x02013;65.6&#x02009;hours), this may suggest that more accumulation of peginterferon alpha-2b could be expected during the chronic treatment of patients in the clinic than peginterferon beta-1a at steady state. Consequently, a dose reduction of 25% and 50% was recommended for peginterferon alpha-2b for subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.</p><p>Participants were categorized to renal function groups based on recommended regulatory guidelines available at the time of study design (CHMP<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and Food and Drug Administration [FDA]<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which was slightly different from the updated draft FDA guidance on PK studies in renal impairment subjects,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and versus 2012 Practice Guidelines from Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, subjects were evenly distributed across the whole renal function spectrum and linear regression analyses, which utilized data from all subjects other than ESRD subjects; this enabled calculation of clearance based on different classification systems, which provided similar results.</p><p>In conclusion, this study indicates that renal impairment marginally increases exposure to SC peginterferon beta-1a in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, whereas a similar exposure profile was seen between healthy subjects and ESRD subjects undergoing hemodialysis. Peginterferon beta-1a was well tolerated in healthy subjects and subjects with various degrees of renal impairment, and incidence of AEs were similar across groups. Based on these results, no dose adjustments in subjects with various severities of renal impairment are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank the subjects who volunteered for this study and the site staff members who help to conduct the study.
