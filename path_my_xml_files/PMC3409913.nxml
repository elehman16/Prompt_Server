Inclusion criteria were: (1) patients were &#x02264;38 years old with infertility caused by tubal, idiopathic, male factors or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); (2) they had body mass index (BMI) of no more than 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; (3) serum Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level was under 12 IU/L on Day 3 of the previous menstrual cycle; (4) they needed to undergo their first or second IVF/ICSI treatment cycle; and (5) they had no active endometriosis, adenomyoma or uterine fibroid. From January to December in 2005, the eligible patients were randomized by a staff nurse into two treatment groups on the day of initiating down-regulation, using a sealed envelope supplied by the statistician, and then no blindness for patients and clinicians. In group I (50 patients), pituitary desensitization was obtained with a one-third-dose (1.25 mg) depot triptorelin (Dipherelin 3.75 mg, Beaufour Ipsen, Paris, France) in a single i.m. injection in mid-luteal phase (Day 21) of the menstrual cycle preceding treatment or on Day 16 of oral contraceptive pill, and in group II (50 patients) with a half-dose (1.88 mg) depot triptorelin on the same timing.</p><p>The 3.75-mg triptorelin depot was mixed with 2 mL sterile water for injection, then shaking the vial well after mixing, and used right away with 1 mL sterile syringe; 0.67 mL and 1.0 mL medication contained 1.25 mg and 1.88 mg triptorelin depot, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>COS and IVF/ICSI procedure</title><p>After the confirmation of pituitary down-regulation on Day 3&#x02013;5 of the cycle by sonographic detection of an endometrium with the thickness of &#x02264;5 mm and suppressed ovaries (no antral follicles &#x02265;10 mm) and serum estradiol levels of &#x02264;50 pg/ mL and LH levels of &#x02264;5 IU/L, gonadotrophin stimulation with recombinant FSH (Gonal-F, Serono, Switzerland) was started at the usual dose of 2&#x02013;3 ampoules (150&#x02013;225 IU) daily. We adjusted the initial and ongoing dosage according to the patient's age, antral follicle count, BMI, basic FSH level, and follicular growth response. Ovulation was induced with 10,000 IU of hCG (Profasi, Serono, Switzerland) when at least one follicle had reached a diameter of &#x02265;18 mm.

Clinical pregnancy was confirmed with the detection of gestational sacs by ultrasound 4&#x02013;5 weeks after the embryo transfer. Early pregnancy loss was defined as a biochemical pregnancy without subsequent ultrasound signs of gestational sacs. Implantation rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of gestational sacs over the number of transferred embryos. Early miscarriage was defined as a pregnancy failing to reach the 12<sup>th</sup> gestational week. Pregnancies were followed to term by obstetricians at the patients&#x02019; local hospitals.

The recent Cochrane Review showed no significant difference in clinical pregnancy rate between the long protocol using depot or daily GnRHa for IVF cycles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] However, because of profound pituitary desensitization, depot formulations require more gonadotrophin ampoules, which are needed for ovarian stimulation, and a significantly longer duration of ovarian stimulation than daily GnRHa.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Previous study demonstrated a direct correlation between the reduction of the daily dosage of short-acting triptorelin and the decrease in the degree of pituitary suppression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] To find a lower depot dose with sufficient suppression potential, several studies have shown that a half-dose (1.88 mg) of triptorelin injection was sufficient to prevent LH surges, and similar or better IVF outcomes were obtained comparing full-dose triptorelin with half dose in COS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] A half-dose depot triptorelin in a long protocol has been accepted in IVF treatment. From 2001 to 2004, a half-dose depot triptorelin was routinely used for the long protocol of COS in our IVF centre. However, when comparing half-dose depot GnRHa with daily short-acting GnRHa in a long protocol clinical, outcomes were not significantly different, but the length of gonadotrophin stimulation was significantly longer and estradiol level on Day 3 and LH level on hCG day were lower in the protocol of half-dose depot GnRHa.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] That indicated the half-dose depot GnRHa would still cause profound suppression for ovarian stimulation.</p><p>Thus, to investigate the efficacy of the further reduced depot dose in this study, we originally compared a one-third-dose depot triptorelin (1.25 mg) with a half-dose depot triptorelin (1.88 mg) in a long protocol for IVF or ICSI and embryo transfer cycles. Both one-third dose and half-dose group showed adequate suppression and no premature LH surge. There were fewer cases with LH &#x0003c;1.0 IU/L and estradiol &#x0003c;30 pg/mL on Day 3&#x02013;5 after down-regulation in one-third-dose group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05). This indicated that reduced depot GnRHa deceased the degree of suppression. There were fewer but still appropriate oocytes retrieved (<italic>P</italic> =0.086) and embryos obtained (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05) in the one-third-dose group. It seemed that there was a dose-finding effect of GnRHa on the numbers of oocytes and embryos in women with normal ovarian reserve.</p><p>Several studies demonstrated the similar dose-finding effect of GnRHa on the degree of pituitary suppression with different doses of daily GnRHa or full-dose and half-dose depot GnRHa.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] For the dose-finding effect of GnRHa on the numbers of oocytes and embryos, previous studies show controversial results. Janssens <italic>et al</italic>. reported firstly a dose effect of short-acting daily triptorelin on the numbers of oocytes and embryos in normal responders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] They mentioned the possible mechanisms: A longer duration of stimulation with FSH with higher daily doses of agonist enables more follicles to enter the stage FSH-dependent growth; a greater suppression of endogenous LH than FSH by the higher doses of GnRHa results in an increase in the FSH/LH ratio during the follicular phase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] A recently study would suggest another mechanism, which showed that pituitary desensitization with GnRHa results in a significant increase in anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, which may explain the enhanced ovarian response to conventional controlled ovarian stimulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] But it is still unknown whether the effect of GnRHa on AMH levels is associated with the dose of GnRHa. These findings contrast with the work by Dal Prato <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In their study, the low dose (half-dose) depot triptorelin gave rise to a higher number of oocytes and embryos than the full-dose depot triptorelin. The difference between the two studies might result from the different degree of pituitary suppression. Full-dose depot GnRHa in their study may cause too profound suppression and impair ovarian response to exogenous FSH. Another study by Yim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] showed no difference in the number of oocytes and embryos with full-dose or half-dose depot triptorelin. The difference lies probably in the kind of gonadotrophin used: rFSH (no LH activity) in the present study and hMG (with LH activity) in that of Yim <italic>et al</italic>. The administration of hMG may have partially balanced the effects of the different degrees of pituitary suppression on ovarian response.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, there was a higher rate of high-quality embryos in one-third-dose group than that in half-dose group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05). Clinical pregnancy, implantation, live birth, and early miscarriage rates showed no significant differences. Previous two studies compared a half-dose and full-dose depot triptorelin in the long protocol of IVF. In the study of Dal Prato <italic>et al</italic>., a higher number of good-quality embryos and a higher cumulative pregnancy rate were obtained in the half-dose group than the full-dose group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In the present study, similar results showed that decreased suppression improved the quality of embryos, and it is probably due to small sample size that the differences of clinical outcomes were not found significantly. In the study of Yim <italic>et al</italic>., the data of embryo quality was not mentioned and the clinical outcome showed no differences.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The difference lies probably in the kind of gonadotrophin used, just mentioned above.</p><p>Both FSH and LH are required for a normal follicular growth and maturation according to the two-cell, two-gonadotrophin theory. Previous study in GnRH antagonist down-regulated primates shows that an intrafollicular environment depleted of LH and estradiol impairs oocyte maturation, embryo development, and implantation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Clinical studies in women with hypogonadal hypogonadism have shown that while follicular development can be achieved by stimulation with pure FSH preparations, concentrations of circulating estradiol and fertilization rates of retrieved oocytes are severely compromised compared with stimulation with preparations containing LH activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>For IVF treatment with GnRHa down-regulation and FSH stimulation, profound pituitary gland suppression with LH levels of &#x0003c;0.5 IU/L led to significantly lower E<sub>2</sub> production,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] fewer oocytes, lower fertilization rate, and fewer embryos that were available for cryopreservation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] An increased risk of early pregnancy loss has also been suggested.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, the study by Tesarik <italic>et al</italic>. has suggested that endometrial maturation is disturbed in women with low endogenous LH, and a direct action of LH on uterus may be required to support endometrial growth and uterine receptivity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Another study shows that the expression of endometrial estrogens and progesterone receptors is altered in COS cycles with GnRH agonist and low LH levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] GnRHa has been shown to cause extra-pituitary side effects, including direct inhibition of ovarian steroidogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] and effects on the differentiation of granulose cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] These findings should furthermore suggest the use of the possibly lower dose of GnRH agonist.</p><p>Finally, lower dose of depot GnRHa might reduce the cost for patients undergoing assisted reproduction treatment. In our IVF centre, three patients can share one ampoule of depot triptorelin. Decreased pituitary suppression by lowering the dose of depot GnRHa in our trial suggests that one-third-dose of depot GnRHa may also reduce the LH requirement in patients undergoing IVF treatment.</p><p>There were some limitations in the present study. Although sample size was enough for evaluating the degree of pituitary suppression, it may be not adequate for comparing the clinical outcome after IVF. Further reduced dose of triptorelin depot and dose-finding effect had not been studied. Optimal dose of long-acting GnRH agonist for COS should be investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, it has been shown in our study that one-third-dose (1.25 mg) depot triptorelin can be successfully used in ovarian stimulation for IVF or ICSI. LH and estradiol levels confirm the reduced pituitary suppression caused by one-third-dose than half-dose depot triptorelin. Higher good-quality embryo rate could be explained better quality oocytes, while clinical outcome were similar between two groups. Whether a further reduced dose of depot GnRHa still results in a similar or better outcome remains to be determined.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
