ventilation is able to improve functional capacity of patients with CHF. </p></sec><sec><title>Objectives:</title><p> The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous positive
airway pressure (CPAP) on physical exercise tolerance and heart rate variability
(HRV) in patients with CHF. </p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>: Seven men with CHF (62&#x000b1;8 years) and left ventricle ejection fraction of 41&#x000b1;8%
were submitted to an incremental symptom-limited exercise test (IT) on the
cicloergometer. On separate days, patients were randomized to perform four
constant work rate exercise tests to maximal tolerance with and without CPAP (5
cmH<sub>2</sub>O) in the following conditions: i) at 50% of peak work rate of
IT; and ii) at 75% of peak work rate of IT. At rest and during these conditions,
instantaneous heart rate (HR) was recorded using a cardiofrequencimeter and HRV
was analyzed in time domain (SDNN and RMSSD indexes). For statistical procedures,
Wilcoxon test or Kruskall-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc were used accordingly.
In addition, categorical variables were analysed through Fischer's test
(p&#x0003c;0.05). </p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p> There were significant improvements in exercise tolerance at 75% of peak work
rate of IT with CPAP (405&#x000b1;52 vs. 438&#x000b1;58 s). RMSSD indexes were lower during
exercise tests compared to CPAP at rest and with 50% of peak work rate of IT. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p> These data suggest that CPAP appears to be a useful strategy to improve
functional capacity in patients with CHF. However, the positive impact of CPAP did

outcome of the disease<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Reduced exercise tolerance is due to cardiac conditions but also to respiratory
and appendicular muscle dysfunction<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Several factors such as chronic hypoxia, oxidative stress, nutritional
depletion, peripheral muscle disuse, medication effects and sympathetic-vagal
imbalance<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> are important contributors. Therefore, reduction in exercise tolerance could be
attributed to a redistribution of blood flow to the respiratory muscles as a result of
work demand and metabolites in the muscles. The consequence would be greater sympathetic
vasoconstrictor response in the peripheral muscles, whose metabolic efficiency is
compromised by lower blood flow<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has had its efficacy proven in various
conditions of acute respiratory failure, particularly as a treatment option for the
management of patients with acute pulmonary edema<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. Positive pressure decreases the pulmonary shunt through expansion of collapsed
alveoli, thereby improving gas exchange and oxygenation of the tissues<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. The NIV also reduces the transmural pressure of the left ventricle, the
afterload, and hence improves cardiac output<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. Furthermore, the use of NIV with a continuous pressure level improves
functional residual capacity and lung compliance, generating lower ventilatory work<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>, which may represent an important effect for those patients who have respiratory
muscle fatigue during exercise<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. Few studies<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> have evaluated the response of this therapeutic approach in the improvement of
physical exercise performance of patients with CHF. In addition, some of the
studies<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> only evaluated the impact of rest on exercise tolerance and not the combined
effect of NIV and physical exercise. Knowledge of the efficacy of NIV, as a supporting
therapeutic approach in the prescription of physical exercises for patients with CHF, is
particularly important in the area of cardiovascular therapy. These patients have
reduced exercise tolerance and the peripheral musculature<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> is the target of physical therapy interventions.</p><p>However, it is important to emphasize that the application of NIV is able to cause
important hemodynamic repercussions, especially when prescribed inadvertently.
Therefore, studies have shown the importance of heart rate variability (HRV), which
reflects the sympathetic-vagal balance of the sinus node, for understanding the
cardiovascular adjustments during application of NIV at rest in patients with chronic
heart failure<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. However, little is known about HRV when physical activity is associated with
the application of NIV.</p><p>In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether the use of NIV
through a continuous pressure level (CPAP) in a protocol of physical exercise at
constant load is able to improve tolerance to physical exercise and to determine if the
CPAP could influence the sympathetic-vagal modulation in physical exercise in patients
with CHF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Sample</title><p>Seven male patients with a clinical diagnosis of CHF volunteered to participate in
this cross-sectional study. Subjects were recruited from a public health primary care
facility and to be included in the study presented with the following
characteristics: previous history of CHF caused by systolic left ventricular
dysfunction documented in the last six months (ejection fraction of the left
ventricle &#x0003c;45%), clinically stable in the last three months and no history of
angina or pulmonary disease. Subjects with clinical and/or functional evidence of
chronic lung disease (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c;70%)<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>, with exercise induced asthma, angina or significant arrhythmias, myocardial
infarction within the last six months and those who had participated in a
cardiovascular rehabilitation program in the year preceding the study, were excluded.
All subjects were submitted to clinical evaluation and pulmonary function tests,
assessment of functional capacity according to the New York Heart Association
(NYHA)<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>, biochemical tests, ECG and a symptom-limited physical exercise test prior to
the study. In addition, subjects with CHF had their medication optimized. All
subjects signed an informed consent and the protocol was approved by the Ethics
Committee from Universidade Federal de S&#x000e3;o Carlos (UFSCar), S&#x000e3;o Carlos, SP, Brazil
(protocol 238/06).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>The research was conducted in an acclimatized laboratory at temperatures between 22
&#x000ba;C and 24 &#x000ba;C and relative humidity between 50% and 60%, during the same period of the
day (between 8h and 12h). Prior to and on the day of the test, each subject was asked
to ensure they avoided consumption of stimulating beverages, avoided physical
activity for 24 hours prior to the tests; consumed light meals and slept for at least
8 hours.</p><p>Initially, the subjects were familiarized with the experimental equipment and
environment and the researchers involved in the study. Prior to the tests, the
subjects were evaluated and examined to ensure that the directions given had been
strictly followed. In addition, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lung
auscultation and SpO<sub>2</sub> were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary function</title><p>Spirometry was performed using a Vitalograph<sup>(r)</sup> spirometer (Hand-Held 2021
instrument. Ennis, Ireland). The CVF test was conducted to determine the FEV1 and
FEV1/CVF ratio. The reference values used were those suggested by Knudson et al.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref> and were expressed in terms of BTPS (<italic>Body Temperature Pressure
Standard</italic>). Technical procedures, criteria for acceptability and
reproducibility, were performed according to the guidelines recommended by the
<italic>American Thoracic Society</italic>
<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Incremental physical exercise protocol</title><p>The assessment was performed by a cardiologist to determine the maximum load the
patients were able to achieve. In addition, this step was considered important to
assess the clinical and functional conditions of the cardiovascular and peripheral
muscular systems of the subjects and to identify evidence of cardiorespiratory
comorbidities elicited by physical exercise. Initially, the subjects were evaluated
using an ECG with the standard 12-lead ECG, followed by the evaluation of the
electrocardiographic signal from the derivations MC5, DII modified and V2 in the
following conditions: supine, sitting, apnea (15 s) and hyperventilated (15 s). The
exercise test was performed on a cycloergometer with electromagnetic brakes (Quinton
400 Corival Ergometer, Croningen, Netherlands) and power increments externally
controlled by a microprocessor model <italic>Workload Program</italic>
(<italic>Quinton</italic>, <italic>Croningen, Netherlands)</italic>. The subjects
remained seated with the knees flexed at 5-10&#x000ba;. Initially, a 2-minute warm up period
was performed with no load, corresponding to 4 watts (W). Following the warm up, the
subjects performed, increments of 5W every 3 minutes at 60 rpm, until physical
exhaustion or it was impossible for them to maintain the pedaling speed. The test was
stopped on the first indications of signs and/or symptoms such as dizziness, nausea,
cyanosis, complex arrhythmias, excessive sweating, angina and peripheral oxygen
desaturation. During the test, subjects were monitored from the MC5 derivation, DII
modified and V2. The measurements of HR, blood pressure (auscultation method) and
electrocardiographic recordings were performed in the 30 final seconds of each power
level and at the 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>
minutes of recovery. At the end of the recovery period, with the subject in the
supine position, the standard 12-lead ECG was performed. In addition to the variables
described above, using formulae recommended by the <italic>American Heart
Association</italic> (which take into account peak load and body mass), maximum
oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) achieved by the subjects was obtained.
Throughout the test, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was measured
using pulse oximetry (<italic>Oxyfast, Takaoka</italic>, Brazil).</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol of constant load in spontaneous breath and during CPAP
application</title><p>All subjects performed four physical exercise tests at a constant load. The order of
the tests was randomized by lottery using sealed, opaque numbered envelopes. The
tests were performed on two days (two tests per day) with an interval of 48 hours
between the days. For the implementation of this protocol, initially, the subjects
were kept at rest in the sitting position for about 10 minutes, with the goal to
achieve basal values for HR. At the same time, the instantaneous HR was obtained at
rest in the sitting position for 15 minutes. Subsequently, subjects were randomized
by lottery to perform submaximal exercise at a constant load until maximum tolerance,
with and without application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP - 5
cmH<sub>2</sub>O, <italic>Breas PV101, Sweden</italic>) using a nasal mask
(Respironics, <italic>Murrysville, PA</italic>) under the following conditions: i)
50% of the peak load of the incremental test and ii) 75% of the peak load of the
incremental test. The subjects were positioned in the horizontal electronically
braked cycle ergometer (Quinton 400 Corival Ergometer, Croningen, Netherlands) with
knees flexed between 5&#x000ba; and 10&#x000ba;. Initially, the subjects remained seated on the cycle
ergometer at rest for 1 minute and then were instructed to pedal at a cadence of 60
rpm until maximum tolerance. SpO<sub>2</sub> (<italic>Oxyfast, Takaoka</italic>,
Brazil) and ECG (<italic>Ecafix</italic> 500, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil), in leads MC5, DII
modified and V2, were monitored continuously throughout the experimental protocol.
Blood pressure and the modified BORG scale (CR-10) were verified every two minutes
with care to avoid interference in the collection of the variables. The constant
workload tests were performed on a single day and at the same time to avoid circadian
influenceswith an interval of 30 minutes or until cardiovascular variables returned
to baseline values. A team of trained researchers conducted the tests and carefully
monitored the signs and/or symptoms of exercise intolerance and who could determine
when to immediately stop the test.</p></sec><sec><title>Heart rate and R-R intervals</title><p>The HR and R-R intervals (R-Ri) were collected, beat-by-beat, using a heart rate
monitor (Polar<sup>(r)</sup> S810i). Data collection occurred during the 15-min rest
in the sitting position and during exercise at constant loads at random conditions of
50% and 75% with and without CPAP. The heart rate monitor had a sampling frequency of
1,000 Hz. It was fixed using an elastic belt to the lower third of the sternum and
data was simultaneously transmitted to and stored in a watch. Subsequently, through a
serial port interface of an infrared sensor, the data were transferred and stored in
a computer (Pentium III, 1100 MHz) to be analyzed. The transition points of the
protocol were also properly marked for proper data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The maximum time for completion of the physical exercise during the protocol of
constant workload was identified by tolerance time. The HR, subjective sensation of
effort for dyspnea, and discomfort of the lower limb variables were assessed at
baseline and at the peak of the protocol. HRV was analyzed in time domain through the
application Kubious HRV (version 2.0 Released November 2008). The interval selection
of the rest seated conditions and during constant workload protocol was performed by
visual inspection of the distribution of R-Ri (ms). The period with greater signal
stability and sampling rate of 256 points as recommended by the <italic>Task
Force</italic>
<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>, was selected. The analysis in the time domain was performed from the indices
RMSSD (ms) - corresponding to the square root of the squared successive mean
difference between adjacent R-Ri divided by the number of R-Ri less one and SDNN (ms)
- standard deviation of all R-Ri .</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were subjected to a normality test (Shapiro-Wilk). As a non-normal distribution
was observed, the non-parametric statistical tests were used. For comparisons between
rest and exercise, the Wilcoxon test was applied, and for the conditions of exercise,
the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc was used. For categorical variables, the
Fisher exact test was applied. Analyses were performed with GraphPad Instat 3
software, with a significance level of p&#x0003c;0.05. Demographics, anthropometrics and
clinical data were presented as means with standard deviation, and the variables
related to the conditions of exercise were presented in median (maximum -
minimum).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Initially, 31 subjects with CHF were screened. Twenty-four were excluded and only seven

tolerance with CHF in loads of 75% with CPAP, (ii) there was no difference in HRV
between the conditions of physical exercise studied, and finally, (iii) the RMSSD index
(representative of vagal modulation) revealed significantly lower values during the
physical exercise conditions when compared to rest.</p><p>At baseline, the subjects were mostly eutrophic, with left ventricular ejection fraction
reduced at ischemic levels. All subjects had preserved lung function and showed reduced
functional capacity presented by the lower peak load at the incremental test. In
addition, all subjects kept optimal use of their medication, with &#x003b2; - blockers and
angiotensin-converting enzyme the most frequent drugs in use. During the protocols of
constant load, the subjects showed a significant increase in HR and RF at exercise
compared to rest. These results were expected; although it may have been influenced by
the health condition of the individuals, since human systems will always determine the
onset of central and peripheral adjustments (by mechanisms of feeding/retro-feeding) in
search of homeostasis before a new demand is imposed<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The main finding of the current study was the increased time of physical exercise
tolerance observed at 75% of the incremental load test with CPAP. Borghi-Silva et
al.<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> observed a significant difference on the time of exercise tolerance in patients
with heart failure when subjected to proportional assisted ventilation with volumes and
flows titrated of 5.7&#x000b1;1.5 H<sub>2</sub>O/l and 3.1&#x000b1;1.1
cmH<sub>2</sub>O.l<sup>-1</sup>.s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, concomitantly to
constant load exercise of high intensity (70-80% of peak load of the incremental test).
In another study, Chermont et al.<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> also observed an increase in exercise tolerance with an increase in the distance
walked during the 6-minute walk test and chronotropic reserve of patients with CHF when
submitted to CPAP - 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for 30 minutes before the test. In a similar
research protocol, Lima et al.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> also found an increase in distance walked during the 6-minute walk test in
patients with chronic heart failure when experiencing CPAP - 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O prior
to testing.</p><p>Dempsey et al.<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> have shown that in high intensity exercise, blood flow redistribution occurs
from the peripheral muscles to the ventilatory muscles (theory of shunt). This occurs
due to the overload of ventilatory muscles that demand an increment of 30% of the
relative cardiac output. As a result, there is less blood supply to peripheral muscles,
which induces an early fatigue. Accordingly, the association of ventilatory support to
physical exercise can facilitate the work of the respiratory musculature by decreasing
the lower metabolic demand and permitting better redistribution of blood flow to the
peripheral muscles<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> - which might explain our findings. Likewise, the improvement in cardiac
performance may also have been responsible for the increased exercise tolerance, since
the application of CPAP reduces the transmural pressure of the left ventricle, improving
cardiac output and reducing the end-systolic<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>. In this respect, our results on gains of physical exercise tolerance might be
related to improvements in oxygen supply to peripheral muscles, at the expense of
redistribution of blood flow even with CPAP of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. We emphasize that the
increase in tolerance time was followed by an increase in HR because the metabolic
demand is high.</p><p>In addition to the above, we observed a reduction in the subjective effort scale (Borg
CR-10) between the conditions RE and CPAP during physical exercise of constant load.
Although the data showed no statistical difference, some studies<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref> have shown that a two-point change on the Borg scale is clinically important.
This finding confirms our hypothesis that blood flow was more evenly distributed in the
peripheral muscles in condition CPAP, which has led to a greater tolerance to physical
exercise.</p><p>Regarding HRV, previous studies<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref> have shown that patients with CHF have sympathetic-vagal imbalance at rest and
this can be mitigated by proper titration pressure level during the application of CPAP
at rest. However, our results revealed no differences between the values of SDNN index
(representative of the total HRV) under the conditions of physical exercise studied.
These findings support the hypothesis that the application of CPAP pressure level of 5
cmH<sub>2</sub>0 did not bring major hemodynamic consequences, since the increase in
intra-thoracic pressure (through positive pressure) can result in significant
hemodynamic changes<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref>. Although, we used a different exercise protocol and modality of NIV, our data
corroborated with Borghi-Silva et al.'s<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> findings that the effect of proportional assisted ventilation during physical
exercise on cardiac output variables, systolic volume and HR, can be assessed
noninvasively by thoracic bioimpedance. The authors showed that patients with CHF
exhibited improvement in physical exercise tolerance during application of non-invasive
ventilation without significant changes in hemodynamic variables.</p><p>Concomitantly, the HRV analysis showed a decrease in the mean iR-R with an increase in
mean HR during physical exercise compared to the resting condition. This finding can be
easily explained by the increased metabolic demand during the transition from rest to
physical exercise<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>, which is present in individuals with chronic cardiopulmonary disorders, even if
influenced by the patient's condition. Interestingly, these data were followed by a
decrease in the RMSSD index (representative of vagal modulation). This implies that the
adjustment of HR to exercise may be due to a lower parasympathetic modulation, since
these individuals were using &#x003b2;-blockers - the type of drugs that are known to influence
the sympathetic modulation on the control of HR<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref>.</p><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>A larger sample size of CHF patients would be desirable. However, the smaller sample
size of this study is attributed to the complexity of CHF disease that influenced
sample size loss during the research. Another aspect relates to the influence of the
use of &#x003b2; - blockers on HRV analysis, but currently this is the therapy of choice to
preserve cardiac function and myocardial metabolic demand in patients with CHF.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical implication</title><p>As presented in our study, patients with CHF had a reduced exercise tolerance and
appeared to benefit from NIV application associated with physical exercise.
Therefore, this might be a good strategy for the treatment of patients to improve
their functional capacity in cardiovascular therapy programs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study showed improved functional capacity of patients with CHF when submitted to
CPAP at loads of 75% of incremental test, but no improvements in exercise tolerance at
loads of 50% of incremental test. Additionally, no significant change in HRV during the
exercise conditions studied was observed. Moreover, decreased values of RMSSD index
(representative of vagal modulation) were observed in the transition from rest to
physical exercise, suggesting the adjustment of the HR was predominantly sympathetic and
at the expense of reduced parasympathetic modulation when submitted to NIV.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>To Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Carlos Chagas de Apoio da Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ -
