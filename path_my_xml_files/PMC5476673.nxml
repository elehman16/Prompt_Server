This post hoc analysis was performed to assess the effect of treatment in the symptomatic patient group participating in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Symptomatic patients (defined as those with Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms [E-RS&#x02122;] in COPD baseline score &#x02265;10 units) received aclidinium bromide 400 &#x003bc;g twice daily (BID), tiotropium 18 &#x003bc;g once daily (QD), or placebo, for 6 weeks. Lung function, COPD respiratory symptoms, and incidence of adverse events (AEs) were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 277 symptomatic patients were included in this post hoc analysis. Aclidinium and tiotropium treatment improved forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) from baseline to week 6 at all time points over 24 hours versus placebo. In addition, improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline during the nighttime period were observed for aclidinium versus tiotropium on day 1 (aclidinium 157 mL, tiotropium 67 mL; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and week 6 (aclidinium 153 mL, tiotropium 90 mL; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Aclidinium improved trough FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline versus placebo and tiotropium at day 1 (aclidinium 136 mL, tiotropium 68 mL; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) and week 6 (aclidinium 137 mL, tiotropium 71 mL; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Aclidinium also improved early-morning and nighttime symptom severity, limitation of early-morning activities, and E-RS Total and domain scores versus tiotropium (except E-RS Chest Symptoms) and placebo over 6 weeks. Tolerability showed similar incidence of AEs in each arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this post hoc analysis of symptomatic patients with moderate to severe COPD, aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g BID provided additional improvements compared with tiotropium 18 &#x003bc;g QD in: 1) bronchodilation, particularly during the nighttime, 2) daily COPD symptoms (E-RS), 3) early-morning and nighttime symptoms, and 4) early-morning limitation of activity.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>24-hour bronchodilation</kwd><kwd>long-acting muscarinic antagonist</kwd><kwd>nighttime</kwd><kwd>symptoms</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Symptoms of COPD can vary in severity over a 24-hour period, and studies indicate that they are generally worse in the early morning and at nighttime.<xref rid="b1-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Symptoms include chronic cough, sputum production, and breathlessness, which can severely impact on a patient&#x02019;s daily activities and overall well-being,<xref rid="b3-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and have a corresponding high socioeconomic burden.<xref rid="b4-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Estimates suggest that the frequency of nocturnal symptoms and symptomatic sleep disturbance may exceed 75% in patients with COPD, and potential long-term consequences may include lung function changes, increased exacerbation frequency, emergence or worsening of cardiovascular disease, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality.<xref rid="b1-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is therefore important that symptoms over the entire 24-hour day are identified and managed appropriately.</p><p>In order to provide appropriate therapy, clinical guidelines (Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD]) suggest that symptoms, airflow limitation, and risk of exacerbations are assessed.<xref rid="b5-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Patients are classified into one of four groups according to their symptom burden and risk of exacerbations: A, low risk, less symptoms; B, low risk, more symptoms; C, high risk, less symptoms; or D, high risk, more symptoms;<xref rid="b5-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> current evidence suggests that bronchodilator treatment may be more effective in those patients who are considered symptomatic (ie, groups B and D).<xref rid="b5-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Bronchodilator therapies are a mainstay of COPD treatment, with two classes of long-acting bronchodilators currently available: long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABAs).

After 6 weeks, the improvement in E-RS score was greater with aclidinium compared with both placebo and tiotropium, as indicated by changes in RS-Breathlessness, RS-Cough and Sputum, and E-RS Total scores. In addition, the percentage of patients defined as E-RS responders increased with aclidinium compared with tiotropium or placebo. Improvement over placebo and tiotropium was also observed in early-morning symptom severity, nighttime symptom severity, individual early-morning symptoms (shortness of breath and cough), and limitation of early-morning activity caused by symptoms. Safety and tolerability in symptomatic patients appeared to be similar to that in the overall study population, with the most commonly reported TEAEs being headache and nasopharyngitis.</p><p>The overall study population included both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Results have been previously reported and indicated that aclidinium provided significant 24-hour bronchodilation versus placebo from day 1, with comparable efficacy to tiotropium after 6 weeks.<xref rid="b6-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In this post hoc analysis, some notable differences were observed in the symptomatic patient group. Improvements in bronchodilation during the nighttime period were greater with aclidinium than with tiotropium in symptomatic patients, whereas in the overall population, no differences were observed between the two treatments. Furthermore, symptomatic patients experienced a greater reduction in nighttime symptom severity from baseline to 6 weeks with aclidinium, compared with tiotropium. In the overall population, although nighttime symptom severity was significantly reduced with aclidinium versus placebo, the difference between the two comparators was not statistically significant.<xref rid="b6-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> For both the overall population and the symptomatic patient group, no differences in nighttime symptom severity were observed for tiotropium versus placebo.</p><p>While noting that the BID dosing regimen of aclidinium may have contributed to the observed improvement in nighttime efficacy versus tiotropium QD in symptomatic patients, improvement of nighttime lung function is of particular importance for patients with COPD as nighttime symptoms and poor quality sleep are common.<xref rid="b1-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> To date, relatively few studies have demonstrated significant improvements in nighttime lung function and/or sleep quality following bronchodilator therapy.<xref rid="b1-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b18-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The improvements in E-RS score observed in symptomatic patients receiving treatment with aclidinium are likely to be clinically significant since E-RS has been shown to be a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of respiratory symptoms of COPD in clinical trials.<xref rid="b11-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b14-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b23-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The minimal clinically important differences for the different aspects of the E-RS tool have recently been proposed: RS-Total &#x02265;&#x02212;2 units; RS-Breathlessness &#x02265;&#x02212;1 unit; RS-Cough and Sputum &#x02265;&#x02212;0.7 units; and RS-Chest Symptoms &#x02265;&#x02212;0.7 units,<xref rid="b14-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and the ability of the E-RS to capture treatment effects has recently been evaluated.<xref rid="b11-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In this study, change in E-RS Total score was &#x02212;2.8 units with aclidinium versus &#x02212;0.7 units with placebo and &#x02212;1.6 units with tiotropium. With aclidinium, changes from baseline in individual domain scores at week 6 were &#x02212;1.3 for Breathlessness, &#x02212;0.6 for Chest Symptoms, and &#x02212;0.8 for Cough and Sputum.</p><p>There are some potential limitations of this post hoc analysis. There was found to be a significantly higher proportion of patients with baseline bronchial reversibility in the aclidinium group compared with the tiotropium group, which may potentially account for the significant difference in efficacy observed. The apparent higher proportion of patients with severe COPD in the tiotropium group is, however, unlikely to have influenced the FEV<sub>1</sub> response in these patients, since the differences between groups were not found to be significant. Also, the 6-week study period may not be long enough to reflect a patient&#x02019;s symptom burden. In addition, the E-RS threshold used to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic patients has not been formally validated and requires further investigation.<xref rid="b11-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> One must also consider that unvalidated, early versions of the early-morning (Early Morning Symptoms of COPD Instrument) and nighttime symptoms (Nighttime Symptoms of COPD Instrument) questionnaires were used in this study. Both questionnaires have subsequently been developed and evaluated further, and there are published data indicating that these are valid tools for measuring COPD symptoms in large randomized trials.<xref rid="b15-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The use of a patient questionnaire, rather than clinical assessments, to evaluate limitation of early-morning activity could be considered a potential constraint of this study; however, the benefit of this method is that it can assess if patients are restricted in their usual morning activities, such as getting washed and dressed.</p><p>One further consideration of this post hoc analysis is that although symptomatic patients constituted 45% of the overall study population, the total sample size remains relatively small (n=414). Furthermore, it should be noted that it is possible that a different group of symptomatic patients may have been identified if the COPD Assessment Test or modified Medical Research Council criteria outlined in the GOLD report were applied.<xref rid="b5-copd-12-1731" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results from this post hoc analysis of a symptomatic patient group with moderate to severe COPD showed that aclidinium 400 &#x003bc;g BID provided additional improvements compared with tiotropium 18 &#x003bc;g QD in: 1) bronchodilation, particularly during the nighttime, 2) E-RS responder status, 3) early-morning, daytime, and nighttime symptoms, and 4) early-morning limitation of activity. These results suggest that symptomatic patients may achieve greater benefits during the nighttime with aclidinium treatment than patients with fewer symptoms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank all of the patients and their families, the team of investigators, research nurses, and operations staff involved in these studies.
