In the case of depression and anxiety, interventions delivered via the Internet are popular with users [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], cost efficient, and clinically effective, with outcomes equivalent to face-to-face psychological therapies [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Much of the variance in outcomes of face-to-face psychotherapy has been attributed to the therapeutic alliance, defined as a non-specific treatment factor reflecting the extent of collaboration, purposeful action, and emotional connection between a client and therapist [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Considered the &#x0201c;quintessential integrative variable&#x0201d; of therapy [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that enables patients to &#x0201c;accept, follow, and believe in treatment&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], client-derived ratings of the therapeutic alliance have been associated with positive outcomes in face-to-face therapy irrespective of the type of psychological treatment, study design, and outcome measure used [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In some studies, therapeutic alliance accounts for approximately 50% of the effect size [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Positive associations have also been found between the therapeutic alliance and treatment engagement [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>A tendency for humans to respond socially to computing technology in the same way as they respond to other humans has been well documented [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and anthropomorphism (ie, the attribution of human qualities to inanimate objects) is widely recognized as integral to the successful design and use of information technologies [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], including in the therapeutic context [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, therapy provided in the Internet environment has been criticized for its limited capacity to facilitate a therapeutic relationship due to reduced responsiveness to nonverbal interpersonal cues, limited ability to provide reassurance and clarification of misunderstandings, potential for conflicts of interest, and difficulty providing timely corrective feedback [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. By and large, however, the available evidence tends not to support these criticisms [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the contrary, recent reviews show that client ratings of the therapeutic alliance in Internet-delivered interventions are generally equivalent to ratings in face-to-face therapy [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting that development of a therapeutic relationship during Internet-based psychotherapy is indeed possible. However, there is no consensus as to whether this has implications for treatment outcomes [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The majority of evidence relating to the therapeutic alliance in Internet-delivered interventions derives from studies of interventions that are therapist-assisted to some extent. The nature of the client-therapist interaction varies widely between existing programs, in terms of frequency (ie, number of interactions), nature (eg, provision of therapeutic support, technical support, and/or feedback on therapeutic tasks), modality (ie, email versus SMS text message (short message service)), and timeliness (ie, synchronous versus asynchronous) [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, all programs have some degree of overt therapist input into a client&#x02019;s treatment. In some studies, program users have even been provided with the name, photo identification, and biographical details of the assisting therapist [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This being the case, it is difficult to conclude whether existing findings of a positive therapeutic alliance in Internet-delivered psychotherapy reflect the quality of clients&#x02019; working relationships with the therapists involved or with the Internet programs themselves. Furthermore, it remains unclear as to whether alliance features can develop in the Internet environment in the absence of therapist assistance.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, only one study has examined whether a therapeutic alliance can develop in a completely automated and self-guided Internet-delivered intervention without therapist input. Ormrod et al [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] used the Agnew Relationship Measure (ARM) [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to examine the therapeutic alliance in a pilot study (N=16) of <italic>Beating the Blues</italic>, a Web-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention for depression and anxiety. The ARM assesses 5 dimensions of the client-therapist relationship: bond, partnership, confidence, openness, and client initiative. On average, participants&#x02019; perception of the strength of their alliance with the program was positive, although ratings of the alliance were lower than those noted for face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). These pilot data are tentative, however, and require replication in a larger and more rigorously designed study.</p><p>In a recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT), we reported significant symptom and functional outcome gains for people with mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety, and stress who used a fully automated mobile phone and Web intervention with no therapist input, known as &#x0201c;myCompass&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (ACTRN 12610000625077). This paper reports outcomes of a secondary objective of the RCT; namely to explore the role of the therapeutic alliance in this type of intervention. Specifically, we explored whether (1) participants reported a therapeutic alliance with the intervention; (2) participants&#x02019; ratings of the therapeutic alliance were associated with symptom and functional gains and improved positive well-being; and (3) ratings of therapeutic alliance features were associated with participants&#x02019; level of program engagement. Whereas previous studies of the therapeutic alliance have used predominantly quantitative methods, we also utilized interview methodology to further examine in qualitative detail the nature and form of participants&#x02019; reported alliance with the mobile phone and Web-based intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants and Procedure</title><p>The myCompass RCT examined the effectiveness of a fully automated and self-guided psychological treatment that is delivered via the Internet to mobile and stationary technology devices for improving mental health symptom and functional outcomes. Participants in the RCT were 720 community volunteers with self-reported mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety, and/or stress symptoms who were recruited nationally in Australia between October 2011 and March 2012 via Internet, radio, and print media advertising. Following baseline assessment, participants were randomly allocated to the myCompass intervention, an attention control program, or a waitlist control condition, for 7 weeks. Subsequent assessments were conducted online on completion of the intervention phase (8 weeks) and at 20 weeks. The design and recruitment procedures for the myCompass RCT have previously been reported in greater detail [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Quantitative data for this secondary analysis was derived from participants randomly allocated to receive the myCompass intervention. This was supplemented by qualitative data provided by a purposively selected sample that completed the post-intervention questionnaire and agreed, via email, to participate in a semi-structured telephone interview with one of the authors (MAB). A sampling to saturation recruitment method was used in which data collection continued until no new themes emerged from the interviews [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The RCT was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia (HREC 10019) and registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN 12610000625077).

The program is completely self-guided with no therapist input, and is accessible from any Internet-enabled mobile phone, tablet, or computer.</p><p>The myCompass program assesses users&#x02019; self-reported symptoms on registration and then provides 24/7 access to a personalized intervention that includes real-time, self-monitoring of moods and behaviors (via mobile phone, tablet, or computer), and interactive, evidence-based psychotherapeutic modules (via tablet and computer). In addition, users can schedule SMS text message (short message service) or email reminders to facilitate self-monitoring, receive and print graphical feedback about their self-monitoring alongside contextual information on their phone or computer (to monitor change and assist identification of triggers), and elect to receive helpful facts, mental health care tips or motivational statements by text message or email. Registering to use the program is free, and users are not billed for the text messages they receive.

Total scores on the DASS range from 0 to 126 and subscale scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</p><p>The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) assesses the impact of mental health problems on daily functioning in 5 domains: work, social leisure activities, private leisure activities, home-management, and personal relationships [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Scores on the WSAS range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating poorer adjustment.</p><p>The Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) measures positive mental health defined as the presence of positive feelings (emotional well-being), and positive functioning in individual life (psychological well-being) and community life (social well-being) [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Total scores and subscale scores on the MHC-SF range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating higher levels of positive mental health.</p><p>The Agnew Relationship Measure (ARM) uses 28 items to measure 5 elements of the client-therapist relationship: the affective element (bond), extent of mutual collaboration and engagement (partnership), perceived professional competence (confidence), perceived freedom to disclose personal concerns (openness), and empowerment (client initiative) [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Subscale scores range from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating a stronger and more positive client-therapist alliance. In line with Ormrod et al [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and to facilitate comparison of our data with theirs, ARM items were modified in the present study by replacing the word &#x0201c;therapist&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;program.&#x0201d;</p><p>Participant engagement with the myCompass program was measured using the following 3 indices: (1) number of program interactions (ie, logins), (2) number of modules completed, and (3) frequency of self-monitoring [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative Measures</title><p>Participant interviews were semi-structured and asked about the non-specific or &#x0201c;common&#x0201d; treatment factors identified in previous studies as contributing to development, persistence, and quality of the therapeutic alliance in face-to-face psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Internal consistency of the modified ARM subscales was tested using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, and subscale means were examined to determine alliance strength. In line with previous studies of Internet-delivered therapies [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], residual gain scores were calculated to represent post-intervention treatment gains using the formula described by Steketee and Chambless [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (the standardized subscale score at post-intervention minus the standardized subscale score at baseline, multiplied by the correlation between these scores). Residual gain scores thus represented treatment gains at post-intervention scores adjusted for baseline scores, and bivariate correlation analyses examined relations between these and scores on the ARM subscales. Since ARM data was collected at post-intervention only, it was not possible to perform the analyses on an intention-to-treat basis [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Interview transcripts were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed independently by 2 of the authors (MRB and MAB) using a word processing package (MS Word). Thematic analysis of responses was used to identify the main themes and subcategories, while at the same time a thorough search was conducted for divergent views to enable a richer description of therapeutic alliance features [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A 95% level of agreement was reached for themes and subcategories, with differences resolved after discussion.

Consistent with Ormrod et al [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and other studies of Internet-delivered therapies [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], results of the quantitative analysis showed that participants reported development of a positive alliance with the myCompass intervention. A point of differentiation from most previous studies, however, is that these findings were obtained in the absence of any therapist involvement in delivery of the intervention. Insights gained from the qualitative interviews provided further evidence that non-specific alliance features were experienced in participants&#x02019; interactions with the intervention, including empathy, collaboration, reassurance, and reciprocity. Whereas classic definitions of the therapeutic alliance require that a client and therapist are involved in the relationship [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and therapists have previously questioned or down-played the existence of relationship process variables in computer-based therapies [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], our findings show that a significant and positive alliance can exist in the Internet environment in the absence of human support.</p><p>We also examined whether therapeutic alliance features were associated with treatment gains and program engagement. Consistent with previous studies of Internet-delivered interventions across a range of disorders [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we found no support for a link between therapeutic alliance factors and symptom, functional, and positive well-being outcomes. These findings contrast with those for face-to-face psychotherapies [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and lend further support for the idea that the quality of the alliance in the Internet environment may be less important than other factors for understanding treatment gains [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, components of the therapeutic alliance did show significant and positive associations with participants&#x02019; level of engagement with the myCompass intervention. Most notably, ratings of perceived emotional connection with the program correlated positively with program logins, frequency of self-monitoring, and the number of psychoeducational modules completed, suggesting that users may engage with an Internet intervention to the extent that they experience a collaborative partnership that is working well, just as in face-to-face therapy [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Engagement with program content is generally linked with increased treatment gains, yet rates of adherence with Internet-delivered therapies are characteristically low [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and attrition rates are high [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A contribution of our study, therefore, is to suggest that incorporating program content and functions that target alliance processes directly may improve client adherence and retention in the Internet context. Indeed, it has recently been proposed that the real value of a strong alliance may lie in its capacity to promote therapeutic engagement as opposed to contributing to clinical improvement [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Because the ARM and other popular measures of the therapeutic alliance (eg, the Working Alliance Inventory [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]) were originally developed for the face-to-face context, they are unlikely to tap clients&#x02019; perceptions of common factors or relationship features that may be distinct to Internet psychotherapies. For example, flexibility in the nature of the therapeutic encounter (in terms of time, location, and duration of access) is generally considered a particular advantage of Internet treatment [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], as is the option of interacting via different communication pathways [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, these relationship variables are not assessed in existing alliance measures, and they remain largely unexplored as contributors to psychotherapy outcomes in the Internet context [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Further work is needed to conceptualize, from a client&#x02019;s perspective, the common or non-specific processes that characterize relationships in the Internet environment, and to examine the implications of these for treatment outcomes and program engagement using appropriately developed and validated alliance measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations must be considered in interpreting these findings. As we have discussed previously [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], dropout attrition in the intervention arm of the RCT was high, especially among employed participants. Given positive links between alliance strength and treatment engagement [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and a typical pattern of high alliance ratings among trial participants [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we cannot discount the possibility that dropout from the intervention group reflected a lack of perceived alliance with the myCompass intervention. Furthermore, the sample was predominantly female which is potentially problematic as gender differences appear to influence the therapeutic alliance [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The generality of our findings, therefore, is somewhat limited.</p><p>From a measurement point of view, we remain uncertain as to whether the psychometric adequacy of the ARM is affected when scale items are adapted along the lines reported here (ie, replacing the word &#x0201c;therapist&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;program&#x0201d;). Until reliability and validity of the modified ARM is demonstrated and/or alternative measures of the human-computer alliance are developed, our conclusions must be considered tentative. In addition, therapeutic alliance data were collected at only one time point (ie, at post-intervention). Previous researchers have discussed the importance of measuring therapeutic alliance variables at various stages of the therapeutic process [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and there is evidence that therapeutic success in the face-to-face context is more likely for patients whose alliance increases in the early stages of treatment [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. At the same time, relations between therapeutic alliance features and program engagement are potentially reciprocal, such that a strong alliance predicts increased program interactions and vice versa [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Repeated administration of the ARM over the course of the intervention would have allowed a stronger test of the contribution made by therapeutic alliance features to treatment outcomes, program engagement, and study dropout.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study is among the first to provide quantitative and qualitative support for the existence of a positive therapeutic alliance with a fully automated, mobile phone and Web-based psychotherapy intervention involving no therapist assistance. Although it appears that a strong alliance contributes less proximally to therapy outcomes in a fully automated, Internet-delivered intervention compared with face-to-face psychotherapy, our data suggest that the ability to connect meaningfully and work collaboratively may be similarly important for client engagement across both contexts. Client engagement is vital for therapeutic success, yet effective translation of non-specific alliance components of face-to-face therapies into the Internet environment is not easily achieved [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For the sake of expediency, and in the interest of optimizing therapeutic gains, future studies should isolate the critical relational components of encounters in the Internet environment that relate to treatment outcomes and client engagement. These can then be honed in the development of new and refinement of existing Internet-delivered interventions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing.
