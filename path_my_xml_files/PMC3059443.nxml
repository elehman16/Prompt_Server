Sixty patients of uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis patients enrolled for this study. One patient from each group dropped out as they did not follow up. Patients were recruited from the Medicine OPD of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Nagpur. This study was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Nagpur.

Placebo capsule was containing lactose powder 500 mg.</p><p>Both Livwin and placebo were given orally, two capsules two times a day for eight weeks followed by drug treatment free period of four weeks. Baidhyanath Research Foundation, Nagpur provided the formulation in the form of inert gelatin capsule of same color, which contained either drug or placebo. The capsules were packaged in container that was labeled as drug code either A or B. Codes were given as Drug A for Livwin and Drug B for Placebo. Both the investigator and patient were unaware of the treatment. The codes were broken only on completion of the study as no patient developed serious adverse reactions during the study period. The diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis was made by physician based on clinical criteria such as jaundice, yellow urine, fever, nausea, vomiting, weakness, tender hepatomegaly and biochemical criteria like raised serum bilirubin, AST (serum aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (serum alanine aminotransferase) and serum alkaline phosphatase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Serological investigation was done for only for Hepatitis B, other serological markers for other viral hepatitis were not done due to high cost of investigations.</p><p>Efficacy of Livwin in acute viral hepatitis was evaluated by recovery of weakness and by measuring serum bilirubin and activity of enzymes AST, ALT and serum alkaline phosphatase at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Serum bilirubin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] was quantitatively estimated by semi-autoanalyser, TRANSASIA, ERBA, CHEM-5- PLUS.

Values of serum bilirubin 0.10-1.20 mg/dl, ALT 10-40 IU/L, AST 5-40 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase 32-92 IU/L were considered as normal range with these methods.</p><p>No other therapy was given to patients during the study period.

Both groups were comparable in age, sex and duration of illness. Mean age of patients in Livwin group was 29.93 &#x000b1; 2.70 and that of placebo group was 33.37 &#x000b1; 2.43. There were 22 male and 7 female patients in Livwin group and that in placebo group were 25 and 4, respectively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>The polyherbal formulations like Liv.52,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Liv.52DS,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Hepax,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Kamalahar forte,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Arogyawardhini[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and Valiliv[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] have got two or more similar contents as that of Livwin such as <italic>Kutki, Arjuna, Daruharidra, Punarnava, Guduchi</italic> and Bhumyamalaki, <italic>Ashvagandha</italic>. Therefore, the efficacy of these previous formulations was reviewed in the light of observation of present study. These polyherbal formulations have more components ranging from 9 to 19 and contain components other than herbal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Livwin has seven components and all are herbal.</p><p>In the present study, there was significant earlier recovery of weakness in Livwin group as compared to placebo group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]</p><p>Baijal <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] also observed that there was significant improvement of weakness in Liv.52 DS group over a period of 1 month.</p><p>Livwin contains <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> which is used as general tonic, useful in debility, fatigue, inability to concentrate specially due to the liver disease or other problems as stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Antioxidant action of Livwin probably can explain the mechanism for improvement of weakness. Mohanty <italic>et al</italic>, (1999)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] found that <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> has optimum protective effect against selenite-induced oxidative damage lenses. Singh <italic>et al</italic>, (2000)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] found antioxidant action of Kutki (<italic>Picrorhiza kurroa</italic>) in rats. Stanely <italic>et al</italic>, (2001)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] observed that Guduchi (<italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic>) root extract exhibited antioxidant action in rats.</p><p>Levels of serum bilirubin, AST and ALT were observed in normal range in significantly more number of patients earlier with Livwin treatment as compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Dange <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] observed that biochemical recovery (serum bilirubin, AST, ALT) occurred in significantly less days with <italic>Arogyawardhini</italic>, Hepax and Valiliv as compared to placebo. The results of present study are comparable with these studies.</p><p>Recovery of raised serum bilirubin with Livwin treatment is due to ingredients like <italic>Kutki</italic> and <italic>Punarnava</italic>, which helps in recovery of icterus and raised serum bilirubin by virtue of their choleretic action. Shukla <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] observed choleretic action of Kutki in animal studies. Chandan <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] in animal study observed choleretic action to <italic>Punarnava</italic>. Raised serum bilirubin in acute viral hepatitis presumably results from intrahepatic obstruction of biliary canaliculi; the obstruction is direct consequence of cellular inflammation. Begum <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] observed anti-inflammatory action of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic>. Pandey <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> observed anti-inflammatory action of <italic>Kutki</italic>.</p><p>Livwin contains <italic>Bhuiamla</italic>, which has activity against hepatitis B virus. In present study, number of hepatitis B positive patients were less (Livwin-1, placebo-1). Venkateswaren <italic>et al</italic>, (1987)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] observed that <italic>Bhuiamla (Phyllanthus niruri)</italic> had antiviral action against Hepatitis B virus (HBV) <italic>in vitro</italic>. To prove the efficacy of Livwin in hepatitis B virus positive patients, further evaluation is needed.</p><p>Adverse events such as epigastric pain and diarrhea were reported by 10.37% patients in this study. Adverse events such as epigastric pain, diarrhea and skin rash were observed with Arogyawardhini in 10% patients, with Valiliv in 17.39% patients and with Liv.52 in 8.82% patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Adverse events observed with Livwin are comparable to adverse events with these polyherbal formulations.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the fact that viral markers for Hepatitis other than &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; was not done due to high cost of investigations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>Livwin caused significant earlier recovery of weakness in uncomplicated patients of acute viral hepatitis. Also Livwin caused earlier biochemical recovery as levels of serum bilirubin, AST and ALT were in normal range in significantly more number of patients at 2,4 and 8 weeks as compared to placebo. Adverse events reported with Livwin were epigastric pain and diarrhea. Hence, Livwin is effective in uncomplicated patients of acute viral hepatitis. Livwin needs further evaluation in treatment of hepatitis B virus infection.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
