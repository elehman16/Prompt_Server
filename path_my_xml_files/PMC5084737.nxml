</p><p>Treatment of IMHA in dogs typically consists of immunosuppressive medications, drugs that inhibit hemostasis, and supportive care. Although glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy, additional immunosuppressive agents often are needed, and these drugs commonly are associated with adverse effects that can be deleterious to the patient, undesirable to owners or both. Cyclosporine has become a popular drug for the treatment of IMHA in dogs because of perceived safety and minimal adverse effects associated with its use.<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>
</p><p>In humans, cyclosporine increases platelet synthesis of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> triggers vasoconstriction, causes platelet activation, and enhances platelet aggregation, all of which will decrease blood flow, increase blood stasis, and promote coagulation.<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> When compared to renal transplant recipients treated with azathioprine, human patients receiving cyclosporine have increased thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> production and increased rates of thrombus formation within the renal parenchyma.<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> In dogs, similar to humans, the administration of cyclosporine is associated with a significant increase in thromboxane synthesis, especially at immunosuppressive cyclosporine dosages and at times of peak blood drug concentrations.<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> This increase in thromboxane synthesis suggests that standard immunosuppressive dosages of cyclosporine might enhance platelet activation in dogs, potentially predisposing hypercoagulable patients to thromboembolic complications.</p><p>Drugs that inhibit hemostasis routinely are used prophylactically in dogs with IMHA in an attempt to prevent thromboembolism. Many of these drugs can only be given by injection, are cost prohibitive or both, leaving PO low&#x02010;dose aspirin as one of the most affordable options for prophylactic therapy. In fact, the use of low&#x02010;dose aspirin has been shown to improve survival rates in dogs diagnosed with IMHA.<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Aspirin is a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor that irreversibly inhibits platelet function.

</p><p>Cyclosporine and low&#x02010;dose aspirin often are used concurrently in dogs with IMHA. Currently, however, it is unknown if low&#x02010;dose aspirin counteracts cyclosporine&#x02010;associated thromboxane synthesis and, alternatively, if cyclosporine counteracts the antiplatelet effects of aspirin. Our study was designed to evaluate the effects of cyclosporine and aspirin (both low&#x02010;dose and high&#x02010;dose) given as a sole drug, and of concurrent administration of PO cyclosporine and low&#x02010;dose aspirin, on platelet function and thromboxane synthesis in normal dogs.</p><sec id="jvim13960-sec-0008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jvim13960-sec-0009"><title>Study Design, Animals</title><p>Eight healthy intact Walker hound dogs, 7 females and 1 male, were used in this study. The dogs had not received any medications or vaccines for at least 1 month before initiation of the study. Normal health status was established by detection of no abnormalities on physical examination, CBC (including manual platelet count), serum biochemistry, urinalysis, and heartworm testing. However, during the early phases of the study, 1 female dog was diagnosed with hepatic lymphoma and removed from the study, and results from this dog were excluded from analysis. The median age of the remaining 7 dogs was 3.5 years (range, 2.5&#x02013;10.5 years), and their median body weight was 25.8 kg (range, 19.4&#x02013;31.4 kg). Body weight was obtained at the beginning of the study and used to calculate all subsequent drug doses. Animal use was approved by the Mississippi State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and was in compliance with the requirements of a facility accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.</p><p>In a 4&#x02010;way, randomized, crossover study, the dogs were given either low&#x02010;dose aspirin<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim13960-note-1004">1</xref> (1.0 &#x000b1; 0.03 mg/kg [mean &#x000b1; SD] PO q24h), high&#x02010;dose aspirin (9.9 &#x000b1; 0.3 mg/kg PO q12h), cyclosporine<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim13960-note-1005">2</xref> (9.9 &#x000b1; 0.4 mg/kg PO q12h), or combined low&#x02010;dose aspirin and cyclosporine (1.0 &#x000b1; 0.03 mg/kg PO q24h and 9.9 &#x000b1; 0.4 mg/kg PO q12h, respectively).

For each marker of platelet function measured within a treatment group, a model was fit with fixed effects of day, period, and day&#x02010;by&#x02010;period interaction. Dog was included as a random effect. The repeated measures of dog within period were accounted for in a repeated statement. The distribution of the conditional residuals was evaluated for each marker to ensure the assumptions of the statistical method had been met. Mixed models also were fit that included day, period, group, day&#x02010;by&#x02010;period interaction, day&#x02010;by&#x02010;group interaction, and group&#x02010;by&#x02010;period interaction terms as fixed effects. Differences in least squares means with Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons were determined for markers with significant main effect or interaction terms. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance for all methods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jvim13960-sec-0016"><title>Results</title><sec id="jvim13960-sec-0017"><title>Turbidimetric Aggregometry</title><p>The median turbidimetric aggregometry maximum amplitude for the low&#x02010;dose aspirin group on day 0 was 48.3% (range, 35.3&#x02013;63.5%), whereas the median amplitude on day 3 and day 7 was 38% (range, 2&#x02013;53.8%) and 10.3% (range, 1&#x02013;67.8%), respectively.

Regardless of the source of thromboxane, our study confirms that cyclosporine administration in dogs is associated with increased thromboxane synthesis. Increased thromboxane synthesis would be expected to enhance platelet reactivity in some dogs. Only about 30% of dogs, however, have platelets that are sensitive to the effects of thromboxane,<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> suggesting that drug&#x02010;induced increases in thromboxane synthesis may not reliably increase platelet reactivity in all dogs. Even if platelets do not consistently respond to thromboxane stimulation in dogs, thromboxane still may contribute to vasoconstriction, which may in turn increase the risk of thrombus formation.</p><p>Because IMHA in dogs enhances the risk of thromboembolism, a clinically relevant increase in thromboxane synthesis could predispose these patients to excessive thrombus formation. Antiplatelet therapy such as low&#x02010;dose aspirin is commonly administered to IMHA patients to inhibit platelet function in an effort to prevent thromboembolism. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet function by preventing the synthesis of thromboxane. Low&#x02010;dose aspirin (1 mg/kg PO q24h) in dogs significantly decreased urinary 11&#x02010;dTXB<sub>2</sub>&#x02010;to&#x02010;creatinine ratios within 3 days of starting therapy.<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> In our study, we also identified a numerical decrease in the 11&#x02010;dTXB<sub>2</sub>&#x02010;to&#x02010;creatinine ratio after administration of low&#x02010;dose aspirin, but the decrease was not significant between day 0 and days 3 or 7. One likely explanation for the discrepancy between these 2 studies is that our study enrolled a smaller number of dogs compared to the previous study and therefore may have lacked sufficient power to detect a difference between pre&#x02010; and post&#x02010;treatment results. Measurement of urinary 2,3&#x02010;dinor thromboxane B<sub>2</sub>, a thromboxane metabolite that is more sensitive to the effects of aspirin in dogs than is 11&#x02010;dTXB<sub>2</sub>, may have permitted the detection of more subtle decreases in thromboxane synthesis, but unfortunately this assay was not available at the time of our study.<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>
</p><p>In our study, there was no difference between the 11&#x02010;dTXB<sub>2</sub>&#x02010;to&#x02010;creatinine ratio results in the low&#x02010;dose aspirin group and the combined low&#x02010;dose aspirin and cyclosporine group.

The results of our study suggest that when these 2 drugs are used concurrently, the pharmacological effects of low&#x02010;dose aspirin overcome cyclosporine&#x02010;induced thromboxane synthesis and potentially decrease the risk of thromboembolism created by cyclosporine therapy. A similar phenomenon has been observed in rats that were exposed to both drugs concurrently.<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>

These results suggest that after 1 week of low&#x02010;dose aspirin therapy, the dogs in our study had an aspirin response percentage similar to that of previous studies, but that the dogs in our study required several additional days to become responsive to aspirin. In human and veterinary medicine, both the incidence and mechanism of aspirin resistance is unknown. Unfortunately, there are no established pretreatment diagnostic tests that can reliably predict which dogs will respond to the antiplatelet effects of low&#x02010;dose aspirin therapy. Although the dosage of aspirin in our study was effective at negating cyclosporine&#x02010;induced thromboxane synthesis, it is possible that hypercoagulable patients with hyperactive platelets could require higher doses of aspirin to achieve the same level of thromboxane inhibition.</p><p>In our study, platelet function was evaluated using both turbidimetric aggregometry and the PFA&#x02010;100 platelet function analyzer (collagen/epinephrine cartridge).

Our results were similar to those of a previous study that evaluated the effects of cyclosporine on canine platelet function,<xref rid="jvim13960-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> except that our study also utilized platelet aggregometry to provide an additional assessment of platelet function.</p><p>Hypercoagulable patients with hyperactive platelets may require a higher dose of aspirin to consistently inhibit platelet function. Even though our study demonstrated that cyclosporine&#x02010;induced thromboxane synthesis did not enhance platelet aggregation and that the combination of cyclosporine with low&#x02010;dose aspirin did not counteract the antiplatelet effects of aspirin, both the low&#x02010;dose aspirin group and the combined low&#x02010;dose aspirin and cyclosporine group had variable dog&#x02010;to&#x02010;dog inhibition of platelet function that is not seen with higher aspirin doses. Based on our aggregometry results on day 3, all of the dogs that were classified as responders with low&#x02010;dose aspirin also were considered aspirin responders when low&#x02010;dose aspirin was combined with cyclosporine. Similarly, on day 7, 4 of the 5 dogs that were considered aspirin responders during low&#x02010;dose aspirin therapy also were responders when low&#x02010;dose aspirin was combined with cyclosporine. The 1 dog that was classified as an aspirin responder when treated with low&#x02010;dose aspirin, and classified as a nonresponder when cyclosporine was added to the aspirin therapy, had a decrease in the percentage aggregation at maximum amplitude of 23% when receiving combined low&#x02010;dose aspirin and cyclosporine. In our study, to be considered an aspirin responder, the percentage aggregation at maximum amplitude must have decreased by 25% from the initial baseline. Therefore, this dog may be considered an aspirin responder with a few additional days of aspirin therapy, or a slightly increased aspirin dose. A higher dose of aspirin, but not as high as the anti&#x02010;inflammatory dose used in this study, may provide a more consistent inhibition of platelet function, while still decreasing cyclosporine&#x02010;induced thromboxane synthesis. The ideal antiplatelet dosage of aspirin which provides consistent inhibition of thromboxane synthesis and platelet function, while minimizing any adverse drug reactions, has not been determined in dogs.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. Firstly, this study was conducted in healthy dogs and not hypercoagulable or IMHA patients. It is possible that the thromboxane concentration in hypercoagulable patients treated with cyclosporine would be higher than that reported in this study, in which case a 1 mg/kg daily dosage of aspirin might be insufficient to adequately decrease thromboxane synthesis. Continued thromboxane synthesis, along with a decrease in the antiplatelet benefits of aspirin, still could predispose hypercoagulable patients to thromboembolism and necessitate higher doses of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs. Secondly, despite a sample size calculation indicating that this study had appropriate power if 8 dogs were enrolled, a smaller number of dogs than expected completed the study. Unfortunately, 1 dog had to be removed from the study because of unexpected illness, which could explain why the study failed to detect a statistically significant decrease in thromboxane synthesis during low&#x02010;dose aspirin administration.</p><p>Recently, cyclosporine has been shown to increase thromboxane synthesis in dogs, suggesting that the use of this medication could increase the risk of thromboembolism, especially in hypercoagulable patients. Our study indicates that, in normal dogs, low&#x02010;dose aspirin is capable of inhibiting cyclosporine&#x02010;induced thromboxane synthesis and that the concurrent use of these 2 medications does not significantly alter the antiplatelet effects of aspirin. Therefore, if cyclosporine is used in patients that may be at risk for thromboembolism, the concurrent use of low&#x02010;dose aspirin may be advisable.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim13960-sec-0021"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by the Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine Internal Competitive Research Grant and Dr. Hugh G.
