Previous studies found that effortful encoding benefits episodic memory in older adults. However, to date it is unclear whether this benefit is different for individuals with strong versus weak executive functioning (EF). Fifty-one older adults were recruited and divided into low (N = 26) and high (N = 25) functioning groups, based on their EF capacity. All participants performed a semantic and a perceptual incidental encoding task. Each encoding task was performed under four difficulty levels to establish different effort levels. Encoding was followed by a recognition task. Results showed that the high EF group benefitted from increased effort in both tasks. However, the low EF group only showed a beneficial effect under low levels of effort. Results are consistent with the Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) and suggest that future research directed at developing efficient memory strategies to reduce negative cognitive aging effects should take individual cognitive differences among older adults into account, such as differences in EF.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSC#201306040149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grant number CSC#201306040149, URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.csc.edu.cn/">http://www.csc.edu.cn/</ext-link>.

Several studies have shown that environmental support, for example in the form of providing mnemonic strategies, can alleviate cognitive-aging induced episodic memory decline [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One type of environmental support in a broader sense consists of manipulating task demands to enhance depth of processing of the to-be-learned material, such as in tasks that encourage deep semantic encoding [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a recent study [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] comparing young (YAs) and older adults (OAs), we found that encoding especially enhances later memory retrieval in OAs if encoding takes place under relatively demanding conditions that implicate much cognitive effort. This effect is in accordance with the environmental-compensation view [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which states that high task demands may encourage OAs to use their limited cognitive resources in a more efficient way, thereby compensating for their cognitive deficits. However, the amount of cognitive effort invested in a task, which later benefits episodic memory retrieval, might be highly dependent on the individual&#x02019;s cognitive capacities.</p><p>In principle, two lines of reasoning can be adopted regarding the question of who will benefit most from effortful semantic encoding. The first hypothesis is that OAs who have pronounced cognitive deficits will profit more from this type of environmental support than individuals with relatively intact cognitive abilities. This hypothesis is based on the idea that there is more room for a compensation-based improvement in the former than the latter group of individuals. As shown by Clark et al. [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], elderly with lower education, presumably having a relatively low cognitive reserve, take more benefit from training speed of processing compared to those with higher levels of education. Other supporting evidence is provided by a recent study showing that, compared to young adults, children displayed more positive transfer effects of a cognitive training program, which might also be due to their lower cognitive capacity [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that larger benefits can be expected for individuals with relatively intact as opposed to poor cognitive abilities. This hypothesis relates to the Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. According to this model, OAs may reach a memory performance that is comparable to that displayed by YAs by recruiting more (also: bilateral as opposed to unilateral) prefrontal activation than shown by the YA [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, importantly, especially in OAs with relatively poor cognitive capacity, the cognitive compensatory mechanisms that can be mobilized is limited. It has been shown in working memory studies that, beyond a critical threshold, increasing cognitive demands results in a decreased activation of prefrontal brain areas and corresponding decreased performance (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Hence, this model would suggest that individuals with relatively strong cognitive abilities will reach the critical threshold (i.e., display the CRUNCH effect) later compared to those with poor cognitive abilities. This suggests that the better functioning individuals will show a larger benefit of effortful encoding conditions, as compared to the lower functioning individuals.</p><p>Previous studies report a remarkable variability in cognitive capacity at old ages [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, some OAs exhibit severe memory impairments, whereas others are able to maintain a high level of functioning [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, variability at old age is especially present for one particular class of cognitive processes, namely executive functioning (EF). As a higher-level cognitive process, EF supervises and controls a wide range of more basic cognitive processes, thereby enabling goal-directed operations, such as the inhibition of task-irrelevant information, the implementation of strategies, the switching between tasks, the adjustment of behavior based on feedback, and planning [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The executive functioning decline hypothesis is one of the main theories in the field of cognitive aging [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It postulates that EF decline is a hallmark of cognitive aging and may be the main mediator of age differences in cognitive capacities, especially in episodic memory. The EF decline hypothesis has been found particularly advantageous to explain episodic memory deficits during aging [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. EF is engaged in conscious and strategic aspects of memory performance and the influence of EF on age-related memory differences appears especially prominent in resource-dependent and strategic memory conditions [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>A previous study by Angel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] suggests that high EF may underlie the individual&#x02019;s cognitive reserve capacity, by helping OAs implement efficient strategies as well as making use of environmental support, and consequently maintain a high level of episodic memory performance. In the present study, we aimed to more directly assess the effect of environmental support on OAs&#x02019; episodic memory performance as a function of differences in EF. Specifically, we applied EF as an index of individual differences in cognitive functioning and assessed whether OAs with low EF would benefit more from increasing cognitive effort in encoding than those with high EF, or vice versa.</p><p>In sum, in the current study, we aimed to answer the question concerning <italic>who</italic> benefits more from effortful encoding: OAs with low EF capacities, who have more deficits to compensate for, or OAs with high EF capacities, who can still make use of the provided environmental support. Several neuropsychological tests were applied to assess EF of OAs. High and low EF groups were formed based on their EF scores. We employed both incidental encoding tasks as used by Fu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]: a deep encoding task based on semantic relatedness between words and a shallow encoding task based on word size. Cognitive effort was manipulated by varying decision-making demands in both encoding tasks. Episodic memory performance, indexed by d-prime, was later tested using a recognition task. As shown previously [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], in general, effortful encoding benefits memory performance after both levels of processing (LoP: deep and shallow encoding). If indeed one group benefits more from effortful encoding than another, this differential effect should hold for both encoding tasks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-one OAs, aged 60 to 80 years (M = 66.96, SD = 5.50, 20 women), were recruited by an advertisement in local newspapers.

All words and their relatedness scores were retrieved from the LSA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lsa.colorado.edu">lsa.colorado.edu</ext-link>) and matched on word length and frequency for each difficulty level. Trials proceeded in a self-paced fashion with a 5-s response limit. For the purpose of promoting variations in semantic cognitive effort, each triplet was categorised to one of four difficulty levels determined by the difference between the semantic relatedness score of each top-bottom pair. These difference levels were set at 0.30 (easy, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174217.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), 0.20, 0.10, or 0.05 (hard, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174217.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The smaller the difference between two scores, the more cognitive effort was assumed to be required to make the &#x02018;encoding&#x02019; decision. The resulting 360 triplets were translated from English to Dutch by five independent native Dutch speakers, and presented randomly to each participant.</p><fig id="pone.0174217.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0174217.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Design of the experiment.</title><p>Example of encoding decision-making trials in easy (A, C) and difficult (B, D) deep and shallow encoding tasks, respectively.

However, the latter data are not relevant for the present study and will not be reported or discussed. Similar to the encoding tasks, recognition trials proceeded in a self-paced fashion with a 5-s response limit, with short breaks after every 270 trials (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174217.g001">Fig 1E &#x00026; 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Neuropsychological tests</title><p>Similar to the study by Glisky and her colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], three neuropsychological tests were used to measure EF: 1) Backward Digit Span from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale&#x02013;Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV)[<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 2) Mental Arithmetic, and 3) Mental Control from the Wechsler Memory Scale&#x02013;Fourth Edition (WMS-IV)[<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and two neuropsychological tests were used to evaluate MB (MB: memory binding function, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174217.s001">S1 File</xref> for details): 1) Logical Memory, and 2) Word pairs Association from the WMS-IV.

Neuropsychological tests were administered at the first appointment, together with the MMSE. Participants also practiced the deep and shallow encoding tasks at this session. The actual experiment was conducted during the second session, which took place 2&#x02013;5 days after the first appointment. The experiment comprised two blocks of the deep encoding task followed by two blocks of the shallow encoding task with a 3-min break in between. The recognition task consisted of the four blocks in reverse order to counteract possible floor effects of shallow encoding, which started immediately after participants finished the encoding tasks. Before starting the actual experiment, participants acquainted themselves again with the task by instructions.

Applied cognitive effort was measured by RTs. For each encoding task and participant, four levels of cognitive effort were established using rank-based percentile cuts: Level 1: RT &#x0003c; 25%ile; Level 2: 25%ile &#x02264; RT&#x0003c; 50%ile, Level 3: 50%ile &#x02264; RT &#x0003c; 75%ile; and Level 4: RT&#x02265; 75%ile. For the low EF group, the RT in the deep encoding condition ranged from 1739 ms at effort level 1 to 3179 ms at effort level 4. For the high EF group the corresponding values were 1867 and 3311 ms. For the shallow encoding condition, the RT for the low EF group ranged from 1320 ms at effort level 1 to 2727 ms at effort level 4. For the high EF group the corresponding values were 1365 and 3049 ms. A Group &#x000d7; Encoding condition &#x000d7; Cognitive effort analysis of variance using these RT data failed to reveal a significant effect involving the group factor.</p><p>Memory performance at each cognitive effort level for both deep and shallow encoding tasks was calculated by d-prime [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

[<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we examined whose episodic memory will benefit most from increasing cognitive effort during encoding, OAs with low (low EF OAs), or those with high (high EF OAs), executive function capacity. The results revealed that, with more effort employed during encoding, recognition memory improved in high EF OAs. However, the beneficial effect appeared in the low EF group as a clear CRUNCH effect. Below, we discuss our main findings in separate sections.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>More room more improvement or less capacity earlier CRUNCH</title><p>In answering the question: who benefit most from scaffolded cognitive effort as environmental support for episodic memory enhancement, we tested two possible hypotheses supported by two different lines of reasoning. The first hypothesis stated that OAs who have pronounced cognitive deficits (in this study: the low EF group) will benefit more than individuals with relatively intact cognitive abilities (high EF group in this study). This hypothesis is based on the idea that there is more room for a compensation-based improvement in the former than the latter group of individuals. An alternative hypothesis is that larger benefits can be expected for individuals with relatively intact as opposed to poor cognitive abilities, which is derived from the CRUNCH model. This model is based on neuroimaging studies of working memory, and proposes that cognitive compensation mechanisms that can be mobilized is limited, and OAs with stronger cognitive capacities (high EF group) reach the limitation for these mechanisms (i.e. display the CRUNCH effect) later than OAs with weaker cognitive abilities (low EF group).</p><p>The current results support the latter hypothesis. Consistent with previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], OAs with relatively strong EF capacities are able to make use of the advantage provided, by increasing effort during encoding, to support later retrieval from episodic memory. Critically, older people with relatively poor EF abilities indeed showed a CRUNCH effect. Although memory performance was improved by more cognitive effort at levels 2 and 3, no more improvement occurred at level 4, presumably due to the high processing requirement of the task that went beyond the individual&#x02019;s capacity. Instead, the high EF OAs did not reach this crucial CRUNCH point with the current effort level settings, and therefore these individuals could continuously benefit from increasing effort in memory encoding. This could also explain the result that differences in episodic memory performance between high and low EF OAs only appeared at effort levels 3 and 4. To our knowledge, this is the first study that&#x02013;adding to the previous <italic>working memory</italic> studies [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]&#x02013;reports a CRUNCH effect in an <italic>episodic memory</italic> task with increasing task demands during encoding. It is quite likely that it can also be found in other cognitive domains, but that remains a question for future research.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>The importance of individual differences in aging research and therapeutic measures</title><p>In the past, cognitive aging has primarily been treated as a population-level phenomenon. Our data indicate that investigating individual differences in the cognitive aging process might be important, especially for the purpose of developing effective interventions. There are large differences in the magnitude of aging effects as a function of which specific aspect of cognitive functioning is studied [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, inconsistent results have been reported on the effectiveness of cognitive interventions developed to counter aging deficits on a group level [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. More detailed knowledge about individual differences in aging-related changes in different cognitive abilities will be required to determine factors that contribute to these mixed results [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As shown in this study, the enhancement of episodic memory by environmental support, provided during encoding, is highly dependent on the remaining cognitive resources of the older adult. Although OAs with low EF could still benefit from increasing effort at relatively low task-demand levels of the deep encoding task, they could not benefit from effortful encoding at all in the shallow encoding task. Although including or excluding the MB score in the analyses did not significantly affect the results (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174217.s001">S1 File</xref>), we suggest that this lack of benefit for the low EF OAs might be due to the fact that the age-related memory decline is associated with MB deficits. Indeed, we observed a moderate positive correlation between EF and MB (r = .29, p &#x0003c; .05), similarly as Daselaar et al. [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] found. Accordingly, OAs with low EF also suffer from a relatively low MB, and we hypothesize that they could not automatically form meaningful memory traces in the shallow encoding task, since the instruction of the task directed attentional resources to process shallow/perceptual aspects of the stimuli. Instead, high EF elderly could still internally initiate semantic memory processing during the shallow encoding task since their MB function is relatively intact. Accordingly, this would implicate that possible interventions for OAs should take both EF and MB capacity into consideration for the purpose of developing proper training materials for counteracting their age-related memory decline. More generally, the present findings and considerations fit the conclusion derived from previous work that various task- and person-related parameters play an importantly role in finding or not finding age differences in the effect of environmental support [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174217.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Limitations of the present study and future directions</title><p>The current study had a few limitations. First, a median split approach was used to determine whether a participant belonged to the high or low EF group. Since most of our participants were highly educated, our study sample may not be representative of the general aging population. Future research should include more diverse populations, that is, also include older adults with lower education levels. Second, many studies suggest EF has different components such as inhibition, updating, and task switching. The EF tests we employed in this study might not cover all aspects of executive functioning. While our selection of tasks was based on the work of Glisky et al. [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], who confirmed that these tests all contribute to the EF factor by factor analysis, future studies may also want to include other aspects of EF. Third, the CRUNCH model we used in this study was based on results of neuroimaging studies. Although we observed a CRUNCH-like trend in our behavioral results, it is unclear whether this phenomenon is indeed the same as that observed in neuroimaging studies. Future studies could employ fMRI to investigate the influence of effortful encoding on increasing memory performance in OAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Extending our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0174217.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the current study addressed the question whose memory performance benefits more from effortful encoding, elderly with low or high EF. Results revealed that high EF OAs, putatively possessing optimal cognitive reserve, can take advantage of environmental support in the form of promoting cognitive effort. However, older individuals with low EF could only benefit from this support in a limited way. Our findings support the CRUNCH model and underscore the importance of individual differences in aging research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174217.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>MB as covariate.</title><p>Using memory binding (MB) function as a covariate in measuring the influence of EF on episodic memory.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174217.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174217.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Data.</title><p>Original data set of all measurements mentioned in this manuscript.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174217.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Robin Akkermans, Alina Strehl, and Annemieke Schreur for their assistance in recruitment and assessment of the participants.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0174217.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Kessels</surname><given-names>RPC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>de Haan</surname><given-names>EHF</given-names></name>. <article-title>Mnemonic strategies in older people: a comparison of errorless and errorful learning</article-title>. <source>Age Ageing</source>
