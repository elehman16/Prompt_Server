Data from the double-blind phase of the studies demonstrate significant improvement with onabotulinumtoxinA versus placebo observed over 24 weeks of treatment. During the 32-week open-label phase of the trials, when all patients were receiving onabotulinumtoxinA, headache impact and HRQoL continued to improve both in the O/O and P/O groups. These data demonstrate that the benefits of onabotulinumtoxinA persist over 56 weeks of treatment using measures of impact (HIT-6) and HRQoL (MSQ questionnaires). Patients who made the switch from placebo to onabotulinumtoxinA (P/O) at 24 weeks experienced significant improvements from baseline at a rate of change not that different from what was observed among patients who received onabotulinumtoxinA from the start of the double-blind period. This indicates that the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA persists even if treatment is delayed. However, for several endpoints, statistically significant differences in favor of the O/O group versus the P/O group persisted for months, suggesting that, even in a group with a considerable response to placebo treatment during the double-blind phase, it takes a long time to achieve outcomes equivalent to the O/O group.</p><sec id="sec11-0333102416652092"><title>Headache impact</title><p>By week 16 (and lasting to week 24) of the double-blind phase, the between-group mean difference in the change in HIT-6 score exceeded the between-group MID (2.3 points; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102416652092">Figure 1(a)</xref>) (<xref rid="bibr10-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

At the end of open-label treatment (week 56), changes from baseline in all three domains exceeded the within-group MIDs for both treatment groups, but between-group differences in MIDs were achieved only for the RR functional domain. Therefore, treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in headache impact and HRQoL that persisted and continued to improve throughout the 56-week trial.</p><p>The specific diagnostic criteria and nomenclature for CM have evolved considerably since the condition was first termed &#x0201c;transformed migraine&#x0201d; in the 1980s (<xref rid="bibr23-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). For example, diagnostic criteria for CM in the ICHD-2 (<xref rid="bibr11-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) were stricter than current ICHD third edition beta (ICHD-3b) criteria (<xref rid="bibr25-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), resulting in fewer patients fulfilling CM criteria (<xref rid="bibr26-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and ICHD-3b was created to address these issues. Variation in case definition contributes to the varying estimates of CM prevalence (ranging from 0 to 5%) in epidemiologic studies (<xref rid="bibr27-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Although the PREEMPT studies were conducted using criteria that differ from ICHD-2 and ICHD-3b criteria, the overlap in diagnostic criteria is very high (<xref rid="bibr28-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Baseline demographic data in the PREEMPT trials reported herein are generally similar to those reported for individuals with CM in the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) Study (<xref rid="bibr29-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and the Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes (CaMEO) Study (<xref rid="bibr2-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), a large epidemiologic study that used ICHD-3b diagnostic criteria, suggesting the populations obtained using these criteria are not substantively different.</p><p>Substantial early improvement both in O/O and P/O groups warrants discussion. At the first post-injection assessment (week 4), both O/O and P/O groups showed declines in HIT-6 scores, though there were significant differences between groups favoring onabotulinumtoxinA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102416652092">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102416652092">2</xref>). Similarly, MSQ scores showed marked improvement in both O/O and P/O groups at the first post-baseline assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0333102416652092">Figure 3</xref>) at 12 weeks, with mean changes nearly achieving MID in some domains. At 24 weeks, all patients knew they were receiving active treatment, possibly contributing to the observed HIT-6 decline and MSQ increase from week 24 to the next assessment. Graphically, the gap between the O/O and P/O groups at the end of the double-blind phase narrows more quickly in the open-label phase for HIT-6 and MSQ than the previously reported efficacy endpoints (<xref rid="bibr8-0333102416652092" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), suggesting that patients may achieve improvements in HRQoL before observing improvements in headache-day frequency. Clinically, this may be observed in patients who do not have an immediate reduction in headache days, but return to improved functioning levels after starting treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA.</p><p>CM can be a highly refractory and tremendously disabling disorder. In this pooled analysis, long-term treatment of CM with onabotulinumtoxinA resulted in robust reductions on headache impact, as measured by HIT-6 scores. Approximately one-third of patients had HIT-6 scores indicating the absence of severe or substantial headache impact at the end of the 56-week study. Nevertheless, approximately two-thirds of all patients (O/O, 66%; P/O, 68%) still had HIT-6 scores in the severe or substantial headache impact range at the end of open-label treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA. The results demonstrate sustained reductions in headache impact as well as persistent unmet medical needs. This information can be used by clinicians to help shape realistic patient expectations regarding onabotulinumtoxinA therapy for the treatment of CM.</p><p>An inherent strength of this study is the extended duration of effect both for the HIT-6 and HRQoL measures. This is of particular interest clinically because it shows a consistent long-term benefit, despite the strict dosage and administration guidelines as per the PREEMPT paradigm. It would be of interest to better understand the influence of variations with regard to dosage or injection techniques with onabotulinumtoxinA use.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec13-0333102416652092"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, these findings from the PREEMPT trials highlight the long-term efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA for reducing headache impact and improving HRQoL.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-0333102416652092"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>
