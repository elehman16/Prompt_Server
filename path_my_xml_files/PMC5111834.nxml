<bold>Background and study aims:</bold> Overall, 5&#x0200a;% to 15&#x0200a;% of patients undergoing
cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis have concomitant bile duct stones, and the incidence of
choledocholithiasis increases with age. There is no clear consensus on the best
therapeutic approach (endoscopic versus surgical). </p><p>
<bold>Patients and methods:</bold> A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was
performed to compare three treatment options for patients with choledocholithiasis at the
National Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery in Havana, Cuba from November 2007 to
November 2011. The patients were randomized in three groups. Group I: patients who
underwent intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) to confirm the choledocholithiasis followed
by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) associated with intraoperative endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), group II: patients who underwent preoperative ERCP
followed by LC during the same hospital admission and group III: patients who underwent
IOC to confirm the choledocholithiasis followed by LC associated with laparoscopic common
bile duct exploration (LCBDE). </p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> A total of 300 patients with suspected choledocholithiasis were included
in the trial and were randomized. As a result, a total of 134 patients were diagnosed with
the presence of choledocholithiasis and treated during the study period. There were no
significant differences in success rates of ductal stone clearance, but retained stone,
postoperative complications and length of hospital stay were better in group I.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Intraoperative ERCP/ES shows a higher rate of common bile duct stones
clearance, a shorter hospital stay, and lower morbidity, but further research with a
larger study population is necessary to determine the additional benefits of this
procedure. The results to date suggests that in appropriate patients, single-stage
treatments are the best options. </p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Overall, 5&#x0200a;% to 15&#x0200a;% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis have
concomitant bile duct stones, and a small percentage of patients will develop common duct
stones after cholecystectomy.<xref rid="BR313-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Incidence of choledocholithiasis
increases with age. About 20&#x0200a;% to 25&#x0200a;% of patients older than age 60 with symptomatic
gallstones have stones in the common bile duct and in the gallbladder <xref rid="BR313-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="BR313-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>Thus, bile duct stones and their management constitute an important clinical problem. The
primary goal in management of choledocholithiasis is to obtain complete clearance of the
common duct and cholecystectomy, when indicated <xref rid="BR313-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="BR313-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>Options for management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) are increasing with development of
new technologies for diagnosis and treatment. Management of symptomatic or incidentally
discovered choledocholithiasis is still controversial. There is no clear consensus on the
best therapeutic approach (endoscopic versus surgical) <xref rid="JR313-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="BR313-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="JR313-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="JR313-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="JR313-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic
sphincterotomy (ES) are safe and effective options for removing CBDS in most cases, but even
when clinical, biochemical, and ultrasound criteria are used, only 10&#x0200a;% to 60&#x0200a;% of patients
will have stones on ERCP. As a result, far too many unnecessary ERCP are being performed
<xref rid="JR313-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In fact, one of the best preventive measures to reduce
ERCP complications is not to perform it if it is unnecessary.</p><p>Laparoscopic surgery of CBDS was introduced over 15 years ago and various surgical groups
have shown that it has a high success rate <xref rid="JR313-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="JR313-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and is just as efficient and safe as preoperative or
postoperative ERCP associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), thereby avoiding the
need to perform additional procedures <xref rid="JR313-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Nevertheless, its
technical difficulties, long and difficult learning curve and the need for the allocation of
technical resources (high-quality fluoroscopy and choledochoscopes), which are not available
at many operating theaters, has curtailed its expansion <xref rid="JR313-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>Use of intraoperative ERCP has slowly increased among various endoscopic groups, because
the transition of ERCP from the endoscopy unit to the operating room has a short learning
curve (endoscopic groups with expertise in preoperative and postoperative ERCP) without the
high technical requirements needed by laparoscopic management of the bile duct <xref rid="JR313-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="JR313-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="JR313-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>The aim of this prospective, randomized controlled trial was to compare the efficacy,
safety, and surgical outcomes of the intraoperative ERCP plus LC (ERCP&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;LC), preoperative
ERCP&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;LC and laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) plus LC (LCBDE&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;LC), and
determine the most appropriate approach for patients with choledocholithiasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>A prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial was performed to compare 3 treatment
options for patients with choledocholithiasis. The study was conducted at the National
Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery, Havana, Cuba. This is a tertiary referral
university-affiliated center specializing in endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery
(Multidisciplinary work group). All the procedures were performed by the 5 authors who are
very experienced in both ERCP and laparoscopy. Surgical and endoscopic techniques were
standardized before starting the protocol; 2 experienced biliary endoscopists (J.&#x0200a;R.&#x0200a;T,
R.&#x0200a;B.&#x0200a;Q) performed all ERCP in both groups of patients, while 3 experienced laparoscopic
surgeons (J.&#x0200a;E.&#x0200a;B.&#x0200a;G, R.&#x0200a;T.&#x0200a;P, M.&#x0200a;A.&#x0200a;M.&#x0200a;A) performed LC and LCBDE. The protocol for
anesthesia was the same in all patients.</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from patients before study participation. The study was
approved by our Institution Ethical Committee and by The Cuban Public Registry of Clinical
Trials (Unique ID number: RPCEC00000013). The trial was perfomed in compliance with the
Helsinki Declaration and ICH-GCP (efficacy section).</p><p>The sample size calculation is as follows: With 3 groups and a binary endpoint
(success-failure), we constructed a 3&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;2 contingency table. We used the Grizzle, Starmer,

per group, for a total of 300 patients.</p><p>The primary endpoint was the rate of success in clearing ductal stones.</p><p>From November 2007 to November 2011, 404 patients with suspected CBDS admitted to the
hospital were evaluated prospectively for study eligibility. The intake was restricted to
appropriate patients [American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I, II and III] in whom
choledocholithiasis was suspected on the basis of clinical features (biliary colic with
jaundice and recent acute pancreatitis), liver function tests (elevated bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase), and external ultrasound findings (showing
possible CBDS or a dilated common bile duct &#x0003e;&#x0200a;8&#x0200a;mm).</p><p>Further exclusion criteria included cholangitis or pancreatitis, age &#x0003c;&#x0200a;18 years, ASA IV
and V, suspected common bile duct (CBD) malignancy, previous cholecystectomy, previous ERCP
and/or ES, and contraindications to ERCP or laparoscopic surgery. Moreover, patients treated
with total or partial gastric resection were excluded.</p><p>After obtaining consent, eligible patients were randomized in 3 treatment groups using
computer-generated random number sequences in concealed envelopes with block randomization
design. </p><p>Group I patients underwent intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) to confirm
choledocholithiasis followed by LC associated with intraoperative ERCP, ES and endoscopic
stone extraction (ESE). All patients were placed in the usual supine position for LC. LC
with IOC was always attempted and images were obtained during this step. ERCP and ES were
performed during LC. The surgeon carried out LC without completely dissecting the
gallbladder from its bed. This maneuver facilitated ending LC after ERCP, because bowel
distention during this procedure limits gallbladder dissection. Besides, in case of ERCP
failure, traction of the vesicular bottom facilitated CBD visualization. </p><p>We performed a &#x02018;&#x02018;rendezvous&#x02019;&#x02019; technique only in those patients, in which endoscopic
cannulation of the papilla was difficult (when the papilla is hidden within a diverticulum).
We used a guided wire through the cystic duct into the CBD to facilitate bile duct
cannulation at subsequent endoscopy. </p><p>Group II patients underwent preoperative ERCP, ES with ESE followed by LC (24 to 48 hours
later). All patients were placed in prone position.</p><p>Group III underwent IOC to confirm the choledocholithiasis followed by LC associated with
LCBDE and laparoscopic stone extraction. We performed LCBDE via transcystic, choledochotomy
and a few patients underwent flexible choledochoscopy. First, we performed transcystic
common bile duct exploration but if a patient had an analomous anatomy, proximal stones and
large or numerous stones, we used choledochotomy for common bile duct exploration. LCBDE via
choledochotomy required placement of a T-tube and drain. </p><p>We did not use magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in our institution. </p><p>The following criteria were recorded: success rates (ERCP cannulation rate and surgical
success rate), success rates of ductal stone clearance, conversion rates, morbidity
(complications were defined as any intraoperative or postoperative (30 days) event that
altered the clinical course such as complications of ERCP including pancreatitis,
perforation and bleeding), CBD retained stones, mortality (postoperative mortality was
defined as death within 30 days of surgery) , total operative time in minutes, and length of
hospital stay. </p><p>The level of power for the study was set at 80&#x0200a;% with a 5&#x0200a;% significance level. Categorical
variables were compared by X<sup>2</sup> test, with Yates correction and the Fisher exact
test (two-tailed) when necessary. Continuous variables were compared by the Student
<italic>t-</italic>test or HSD Tukey, depending on distribution. All <italic>P</italic> values were two-sided.
<italic>P&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;</italic>0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference. Data were analyzed on
an intention-to-treat basis. All calculations were performed by using SPSS_ version

symptomatic biliary lithiasis, and its development has favored the appearance of a group of
new endoscopic/surgical therapeutic possibilities for patients with choledocholithiasis,
namely total laparoscopic treatment of choledocholithiasis versus endoscopic treatment using
intraoperative ERCP (both single-stage treatments), or preoperative ERCP and postoperative
ERCP with LC (2-stage treatment) <xref rid="JR313-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>Very few studies are available comparing single-stage treatments (LCBDE and intraoperative
ERCP) and 2-stage treatment (preoperative ERCP)<xref rid="JR313-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Since the
introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our institution in 1993, the standard
treatment for CBDS had been preoperative ERCP/ES, followed by LC and postoperative ERCP/ES.
With the advance in technology and laparoscopic techniques, we started to perform LCBDE
(1995) and intraoperative ERCP/ES (2003), and this randomized trial compares the results
among the 3 preoperative approaches. </p><p>The preoperative and noninvasive tests for predicting CBDS such as clinical examination,
history, laboratory tests and ultrasound have a high negative predictive value
(92&#x0200a;%&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;99&#x0200a;%). However, the positive predictive value is less satisfactory, and in patients
with high suspicion of choledocholithiasis, this is only shown in 13&#x0200a;% to 58&#x0200a;% of cases.
Application of these criteria reveals a high rate of false-positive diagnoses and many
unnecessary ERCPs (40&#x0200a;%&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;50&#x0200a;%) <xref rid="JR313-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Currently MRCP and
endoscopic ultrasound are used routinely before ERCP to prevent unnecessary procedures but

were seen for endoscopic versus laparoscopic approaches to choledocholithiasis.</p><p>We only used the rendezvous technique in some patients, which allows selective bile duct
cannulation and avoids manipulation of the papilla as well as unnecessary injection of
contrast material into the pancreatic duct. Early in our work (first 100 intraoperative
ERCP/ES in 2003) we tried to pass a guidewire through the cystic duct into the CBD to
facilitate bile duct cannulation at subsequent endoscopy (the endo-laparoscopic
&#x02018;&#x02018;rendezvous&#x02019;&#x02019; described by Cavina et al) <xref rid="JR313-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> in all cases, but
we found it technically difficult and encountered additional difficulties during LC (due to
bowel insufflations) and the technique&#x02019;s limitations were related to impacted CBD stones, so
we omitted this step in most cases in the clinical trial, as had ElGeidie et al <xref rid="JR313-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, because the endoscopist and team were very experienced with
ERCP (more than 10&#x0200a;000 ERCP). </p><p>Single-stage treatments facilitate performance of LC simultaneously. Recurrent biliary
complications are more common in patients who do not have elective cholecystectomy after
management of choledocholithiasis by ES <xref rid="JR313-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="JR313-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. When there is a time lag between ERCP/ES and LC, some
patients may develop cholecystitis (5&#x0200a;%-22&#x0200a;%) <xref rid="JR313-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="JR313-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="JR313-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. That difference can d be partially explained by the length
of the interval between the 2 procedures, which is not well defined, as even in the
multicenter trial by the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) the interval
between endoscopic papillosphincterotomy and LC was not specified <xref rid="JR313-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Patients awaiting LC are known to have a high rate of readmission and
complications due to acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, empyema, and cholangitis; others
showed that in case of delayed cholecystectomy, performed over 2 weeks after ES, there is a
higher conversion rate, increasing from 4&#x0200a;% when LC was done within 2 weeks, to 31&#x0200a;% between
2 and 6 weeks, and 16&#x0200a;% after 6 weeks <xref rid="JR313-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Therefore, elective
cholecystectomy is indicated 24 to 48 hours after clearance of CBD. Nevertheless, some
authors report that it is no possible to know whether the acute inflammation is due to
pre-ERCP acute cholecystitis or whether it is induced by ERCP <xref rid="JR313-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>.</p><p>In our study, a significant amount of local inflammation was found in 5 patients and was
associated with pain. We consider that clinically relevant because residual local
inflammation in patients after ERCP may negatively affect operative outcomes and necessitate
a longer hospital stay. Studies have shown that presence of inflammation as an independent
risk factor for bile duct injury during LC <xref rid="JR313-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>.</p><p>At the time of laparoscopic surgery, bile duct stones can be removed with a straightforward
transcystic approach or with technically demanding choledochotomy. LCBDE in all candidates
offers advantages over preoperative ERCP/ES: equivalent removal of duct stones with fewer
procedures, lower cost, and preservation of the biliary sphincter. When laparoscopic bile
duct exploration is used, the operation is longer. Consequently, in elderly patients and
those with significant comorbidity who may not tolerate longer procedures, the advantage may
be lost <xref rid="JR313-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>.</p><p>Several trials have compared clinical outcomes with the 2-stage approach to those with a
single-stage strategy. Rogers and colleagues <xref rid="JR313-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> randomized 122
patients to LC plus LCBDE or to ERCP/ES plus LC. Although the techniques had equivalent
efficacy and safety, length of hospitalization was 2 days shorter for those who underwent
the combined laparoscopic procedure. </p><p>Recently, Lu and colleagues <xref rid="JR313-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> performed a meta-analysis of 9
randomized trials that compared 2-stage ERCP and LC with combined LC and bile duct
exploration. In 787 patients, the approaches were found to have equivalent efficacy and
safety. The longer hospital stay seen in the ERCP group in the individual trials was not
evident; however, significantly more procedures were required in the ERCP group than in the
combined laparoscopic group.&#x0200a;The problem with applicability of these data, however, is that
most surgeons are not trained to perform LCBDE.</p><p>Bin Wang and colleagues <xref rid="JR313-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> concluded that with regard to
stone clearance and overall complication rates, preoperative ERCP is equal to intraoperative
ERCP in patients with gallbladder and common bile duct stones. However, intraoperative ERCP
is associated with a reduced incidence of ERCP-related pancreatitis and results in a shorter
hospital stay. The total hospital stay was signi&#x0fb01;cantly shorter with intraoperative ERCP
than with preoperative ERCP (RR 2.22, 95&#x0200a;% CI 1.98&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;246; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.01). A longer
hospital stay was required for preoperative ERCP as a result of management of complications
and organization of scheduling slots for preoperative ERCP and LC. Also residual local
inflammation in patients after ERCP may negatively affect operative outcomes and demand more
length of hospital stay.</p><p>Use of intraoperative ERCP has slowly increased among various endoscopic groups <xref rid="JR313-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

The average duration of intraoperative endoscopy was 35 minutes and the average duration of
surgery was 104 minutes. The average conversion rate to open surgery was 4.7&#x0200a;% and morbidity
was 5.1&#x0200a;% (0&#x0200a;%-19&#x0200a;%). Mortality is extremely rare, and from the 27 publications reviewed,
only 3 patient deaths were reported, giving rise to a total mortality rate of 0.37&#x0200a;%.</p><p>The 3 types of treatment are effective and the choice of approach depends on a patient&#x02019;s
particular circumstances and on the experience of the different endoscopic and surgical
teams at each center <xref rid="JR313-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that intraoperative ERCP/ES for choledocholithiasis results in a higher rate of

research with a larger study population is necessary to determine the procedure&#x02019;s additional
benefits. Results to date suggests that in appropriate patients, single-stage treatments are
