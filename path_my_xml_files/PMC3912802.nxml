Some of them increase the insulin secretion from pancreas, while others increase peripheral utilization of glucose by increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to utilize glucose. Oral therapy for type 2 DM, when used appropriately, can safely assist patients to achieve glycemic target in the short term to medium term. Issues of safety and tolerability, notably change in weight, often limit the optimal application of antidiabetic drugs such as metformin and thiazolidinediones.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Therefore, there is need for novel oral ADAs with different mechanisms of action from existing oral ADAs. Bromocriptine mesylate quick release formulation has been approved by <italic>Food and Drug Administration</italic> in May 2009 for the treatment of type 2 DM in adults as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Treatment with dopamine agonist bromocriptine has been proposed as a mean to improve glucose and energy metabolism through activation of central nervous system (CNS) dopaminergic pathways responsible for metabolic control. This mechanism of action of bromocriptine tends to address hither to unexplored pathophysiology of hyperglycemia in type 2 DM. The pharmacological activity of bromocriptine occurs mainly through activation of D<sub>2</sub> receptors and inhibition of D<sub>1</sub> receptors in the CNS.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Current treatment guidelines recommend metformin as the first agent to be added to diet and lifestyle changes for the majority of patients. Metformin monotherapy is capable of lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1C</sub>) significantly and is generally well-tolerated with lower risk of hypoglycemia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A study conducted by Ramteke <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] has showed bromocriptine is an effective and safe ADA which can be employed as monotherapy or in conjunction with metformin to achieve and maintain optimal glycemic control in Indian population. Against this backdrop, the present study was planned to compare effectiveness and safety of add on therapy of bromocriptine with metformin in Indian patients with type 2 DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>It was a prospective, randomized, open-labeled phase IV clinical trial. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and conducted according to the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects, 2006, and the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects were recruited in the diabetes outpatient department under the department of endocrinology of a tertiary care teaching hospital and the study was conducted between May and October 2012. The study was registered under Clinical Trials Registry-India (Registration Number-CTRI/2012/05/002659).</p><p>Based on an effect size of one, standard deviation of one, significance level &#x003b1; of 0.05 and power of the study as 80%, the target number of &#x0201c;evaluable&#x0201d; subjects was 20 per group. The sample size was calculated by using primer of biostatistics software (version 5.0). Considering a 20% drop out rate, this translated to a target recruitment of 25 subjects in each group.</p><p>Adults of either gender, aged between 18 and 60 and newly diagnosed cases (as per ADA guidelines)[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] of type 2 DM with HbA<sub>1C</sub> &#x02265; 6.5 and &#x02264; 10, were included in the study.

Randomization was done by computer-generated randomization number. Patients in group A received metformin sustained release (SR) tablet (Lupin Diabetes Care Ltd., Mumbai, Maharashtra, India) 500 mg twice a day after food. Group B was treated with metformin 500 mg SR tablet twice a day after food plus bromocriptine mesylate (0.8 mg) quick release tablet(Lupin diabetes care Ltd., Mumbai, Maharastra, India) after breakfast. Group C was treated with metformin 500 mg SR tablet twice a day after food and bromocriptine (0.8 mg) quick release tablet after breakfast for first 7 days and thereafter continued to take two tablets for further treatment period. Compliance was assessed by pill count method at each follow-up visit and at the end of the study.</p><p>Clinical (body weight) and biochemical (FPG, PPPG) evaluation was done at baseline (day 0) and at subsequent follow-up visits on weeks 4, 8, and 12. HbA<sub>1C</sub> estimation was done at baseline and at the end of treatment (12<sup>th</sup> week).</p><p>Patients with worsening clinical conditions or rising plasma glucose level were withdrawn prematurely from the study. All patients were advised to stop smoking and consumption of alcohol during the study period. Patients were monitored continuously throughout the study for any adverse event (AE).

Hence, there is always need for newer therapeutic targets and newer drugs. Bromocriptine is a dopamine type 2 (D<sub>2</sub>)-receptor agonist that has been approved for the treatment of type 2 DM. Based on animal and human studies, timed bromocriptine administration within 2 h of awakening is believed to augment low hypothalamic dopamine levels and inhibit excessive sympathetic tone within the CNS. This results in decrease in plasma glucose levels due to suppression of hepatic glucose production.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Data from our study suggest metformin alone and in combination with bromocriptine in escalating dose (0.8 mg and 1.6 mg/day) significantly decreased FPG and PPPG levels at weeks 4, 8, and 12 compared with their respective baseline values. HbA<sub>1C</sub> level in all three treatment groups significantly decreased at week 12 from their respective baseline value. Add on therapy of bromocriptine with metformin compared to metformin alone significantly decreased FPG and PPPG levels in a dose-dependent manner. At week 12, HbA<sub>1C</sub> level in groups B and C significantly decreased compared with group A. There was no statistically significant change in weight from baseline in any of the study groups suggesting weight neutrality of bromocriptine. However, the duration of present study was only 12 weeks.</p><p>There are few clinical trials evaluated efficacy and safety of bromocriptine in type 2 DM. In a small study of 12 nondiabetic obese hyperinsulinemic (&#x02265;20 &#x003bc;U/mL) subjects, bromocriptine (1.6 mg/day for 2 weeks) reduced the fasting and postprandial (standardized meals) glucose levels without change in body weight.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In all studies, bromocriptine was administered in the morning within 2 h of awaking. These studies included: 24-week monotherapy trial[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], two 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trials[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and 52-week add-on to various oral ADAs trial.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Results of these studies consistently demonstrated a placebo-subtracted decline in HbA<sub>1C</sub> of 0.5%-0.7%. Efficacy data also are available from a large 52-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which bromocriptine was added to therapy in poorly controlled (HbA<sub>1C</sub> &#x0003e; 7.5%) type 2 diabetic patients who were taking one to two oral ADAs.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In type 2 diabetic subjects who completed 24 weeks of treatment and who took &#x02265;80% of their medication, the placebo-subtracted decrease in HbA<sub>1C</sub> ranged from 0.6% to 0.9% and was consistent in subjects failing any oral ADA, or their combinations.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Data from our study are also in agreement with these studies.</p><p>Safety analysis of our studies shows incidence nausea, vomiting, and dizziness in few patients on bromocriptine.
