We tested this hypothesis by examining endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated radial artery dilatation before and two hours after oral administration of vitamin C or vitamin C plus vitamin E in two groups of patients awaiting coronary artery bypass surgery, compared with the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2a"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 93 patients were randomly divided into three groups: group 1, vitamin C group, <italic>n</italic> = 31; group 2, vitamins C + E group, <italic>n</italic> = 31; group 3, control group, <italic>n</italic> = 31. Patients referred to our clinic were screened for enrolment, and patients with significant coronary artery disease were eligible for the study. In all patients, the presence of coronary artery disease was confirmed angiographically (at least one coronary stenosis &#x0003e; 70%).</p><p>All patients gave informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Education and Planning Committee of our hospital.</p><p>All vasoactive medications were withheld for at least 12 hours before the study, and all long-acting vasoactive medications were withheld for at least 24 hours. Alcohol and caffeine were prohibited within 12 hours of the study. Patients who had a smoking history refrained from smoking at least 48 hours before the study to prevent any relevant effect of smoking.</p><p>Patients with unstable angina, severe cardiac failure, additional cardiac (valvular, congenital, etc) or peripheral vascular disease, renal and hepatic dysfunction, uncontrolled hypertension, or any other condition that would preclude withholding vasoactive medications, and patients taking antioxidant vitamin supplements, oestrogen replacement therapy or allopurinol were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study protocol and radial artery image with ultrasound studies</title><p>The vasodilator response in the radial artery was determined from two-dimensional ultrasound images by an evaluator blinded to the study. The images were obtained with the use of a 7.0-MHz linear-array transducer (model SSA-770A Ultrasound System; Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Examination was performed with the patient resting supine for at least five minutes in a quiet setting. For each patient, radial artery images were obtained 2 and 5 cm above the radial styloid. This location was marked, and all subsequent images were obtained at the same location.</p><p>Images were recorded on a super-VHS videocassette recorder and radial artery diameters were measured from the tape with ultrasonic calipers. Measurements of radial artery diameter were taken from the anterior to the posterior interface between the media and adventitia at end-diastole, incident with the R-wave, on a continuously recorded ECG. The measurements were performed by one observer who was blinded to the details. At the moment of measurement, arterial blood pressures were checked for the safety of the study and were found normal (120/80 mmHg) in all patients.</p><p>In all patients, first, baseline Doppler ultrasound images were obtained (measurement 1: D1, FV1, A1). The radial artery of the non-dominant arm was scanned in transverse section and the lumen diameter (D1) was measured. Then, flow volume (FV1) and lumen area (A1) were measured in longitudinal section and all measurements were recorded.</p><p>Second, a blood pressure cuff, placed at the proximal portion of the arm, was inflated to occlusive pressure (200 mmHg), and occlusion was maintained for five minutes to induce hyperaemia. The cuff was then rapidly deflated and pulsed Doppler signals and measurements were recorded at the moment of cuff deflation for 15 seconds (measurement 2: D2, FV2, A2). Finally, two-dimensional and pulsed-Doppler measurements were again obtained and recorded 60 seconds after cuff deflation (measurement 3: D3, FV3, A3).</p><p>In group l, patients were then given 2 g oral vitamin C (Redoxon, Bayer, Germany, 1 000-mg tablets) and a repeat radial ultrasound study was performed two hours after oral administration to evaluate its effect on radial artery vasodilation in the first 31 patients. These measurements were accepted as study measurements for group 1 (measurements 4, 5, 6 for group 1: D4, 5, 6; FV4, 5, 6; A4, 5, 6).</p><p>In group 2, the next 31 patients were given orally 2 g vitamin C and 600 IU vitamin E (Ephynal, Roche, France, 300 IU, oral capsules), and a repeat radial ultrasound study was performed two hours after oral administration to evaluate their effects on radial artery vasodilation. These measurements were accepted as study measurements for group 2 (measurement 4, 5, 6 for group 2: D4, 5, 6; FV4, 5, 6; A4, 5, 6). In group 3, patients took no medication and the measurements were repeated.</p><p>Finally, the increasing values of D, FV and A of the two study groups were compared and the mean difference of their increasing values was measured <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">(Table 1)</xref>.

Vitamin C is water soluble, and is present in most body fluids. However, vitamin E is a lipidsoluble antioxidant.</p><p>The primary antioxidant mechanisms of these antioxidants are also distinct. The important antioxidant properties of vitamin C are its abilities to scavenge superoxide anions and to preserve reduced intracellular glutathione concentrations. Also, vitamin C is required for the regeneration of vitamin E.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Vitamin C may thus prevent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, either through the recycling of vitamin E or by scavenging free radicals directly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> We therefore observed the beneficial effects of vitamins C and E on endothelial function in our study.</p><p>In a recent double-blind trial, Brown <italic>et al.</italic> studied simvastatin&#x02013;niacin and antioxidant vitamin therapy, alone and together, for cardiovascular protection in patients with coronary disease and low plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The baseline levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides decreased when antioxidant vitamins were added to the simvastatin&#x02013;niacin regimen. The HDL level increased by 18% in those treated with simvastatin&#x02013;niacin and antioxidant vitamins. With simvastatin&#x02013;niacin and antioxidant vitamin therapy, the levels of HDL2 and apolipoprotein A-I [Lp(A-I)] increased by 81%. The resistance of LDL to oxidation increased by 35%.</p><p>In an another study, Behrendt et al. showed that vitamin C and E combinations reduced cardiac transplant-associated arteriosclerosis in patients with normal or abnormal endothelial function. The magnitude of benefit was larger in patients with endothelial dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that oral administration of the antioxidants vitamins C and E in physiological doses may enhance endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in the radial artery of patients with coronary artery disease. However, the combination was not more effective than vitamin C alone. This finding suggests that in this setting, increased oxidative stress may be an important mechanism for impaired endothelial function. Combination of vitamins C and E may show beneficial effects on graft patency due to improved vasomotor function of the endothelium (as on radial artery or internal mammarian artery conduits) in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R01"><label>1</label><element-citation
