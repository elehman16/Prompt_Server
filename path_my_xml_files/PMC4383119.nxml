Pain relief is, therefore, essential to facilitate coughing and deep breathing and to promote early mobilization. Shallow breathing and impaired coughing, resulting from thoracotomy pain are a major cause of atelectasis and retention of secretions, both of which can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory failure, especially in patients with preexisting lung disease.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It has been demonstrated that poor analgesia is associated with increased intensive care unit admissions and longer hospital stay. For this reason, different analgesic methods such as thoracic epidural analgesia, paravertebral blocks, and systemic analgesics have been tried. However, epidural analgesia is considered to be the gold standard for postthoracotomy pain relief.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The use of neuraxial opioids traditionally as adjuvants to local anesthetics is associated with quite a few side effects, so various options including &#x003b1;-2 agonists such as clonidine, dexmedetomidine, and magnesium are being extensively evaluated as an alternative with emphasis on opioid-related side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, urinary retention, and pruritus besides improving quality and duration of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The addition of magnesium to epidurally administered bupivacaine in patients undergoing elective cesarean section with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia helped to improve the quality of postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] To our knowledge, no previous clinical studies with epidural magnesium sulfate for thoracotomy pain have been reported. However, epidural clonidine for postthoracotomy pain has been tried.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Therefore, we conducted this clinical study to determine and compare the effects of adding a single dose of magnesium sulfate and clonidine to epidural bupivacaine in patients undergoing an elective thoracotomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After Institutional Ethical Committee approval, 60 patients with physical status American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-III between 20 and 60 years admitted for elective unilateral thoracic surgery were enrolled for the study. Sealed envelope method was used for randomization and the patients undergoing an elective unilateral thoracotomy were divided into three groups (Group A, Group B, and Group C). Patients with ASA score of intravenous (IV) or more, body mass index &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, hypersensitivity to drugs in the study, severe renal, hepatic, or neurologic disease and those using opioid or systemic analgesic preoperatively were excluded from the study. At the preoperative visit, patients were instructed about pain evaluation using visual analog scale (VAS) of 0-10 cm (0 cm = no pain and 10 cm = the worst pain). On arrival to the operating room, all patients were preloaded with 500 ml of crystalloid. In the operating room, electrocardiography, oxygen saturation, and continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring were started. Epidural catheter (20G) was inserted through 18G Tuohy needle at T5-T8 intervertebral space in lateral decubitus position depending on the type of thoracotomy. The epidural space was identified using loss of resistance to saline technique. Epidural catheter was inserted and fixed at 4 cm inside the space. A test dose of 3 ml of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 was given to rule out intravascular or intrathecal placement of the catheter. Catheter was covered with a sterile transparent dressing.</p><p>Propofol (1.5-2.5 mg/kg) and fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) were used intravenously for induction of anesthesia. After the administration of 0.5 mg/kg of rocuronium, patients were intubated with a double-lumen tube. Anesthesia was maintained with equal volumes of oxygen and nitrous oxide in isoflurane (0.5-1.5%). Intraoperative rescue analgesia with fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg was used. Toward the end of the surgery, approximately 20 min prior to anticipated extubation, patients were divided into three groups to receive following drug mixtures epidurally:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group A: Bupivacaine 0.25% 8 ml + saline 0.9% 1 ml (control group)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group B: Bupivacaine 0.25% 8 ml + magnesium sulfate 50 mg in 1 ml 0.9% saline</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group C: Bupivacaine 0.25% 8 ml + clonidine 150 mcg 1 ml 0.9% saline.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Patients received ondansetron hydrochloride 0.1 mg/kg toward the end of the surgery. Epidural infusion with 5 ml/h of 0.1% bupivacaine was started 15 min after the bolus dose, and it was continued during the postoperative period via epidural catheter using an infusion pump. After extubation, patients were shifted to the post anesthesia care unit for 2 h and then shifted to the postoperative ward for 24 h. The intensity of postoperative pain was measured using VAS. Pain scores and sensory level was assessed every 30 min for 2 h and then every 2 h for 12 h and every 4 h, thereafter till 24 h. Patients complaining of pain in the postoperative period with VAS score &#x02265;4, received tramadol 50 mg IV as rescue analgesia and time to the first request for analgesia was noted. The total number of rescue analgesic doses were noted in the 24 h period.</p><p>Postoperative monitoring included heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oxymetry, respiratory rate, and sensory block using pin prick sensation (T2-T12 dermatome). A decrease in mean arterial pressure of &#x0003e;20% below the baseline preanesthetic value or &#x0003c;60 mmHg was treated by incremental doses of 6 mg ephedrine IV. A decrease in heart rate of &#x0003e;15% below the baseline or 50 beats/min, whichever was lesser, was defined as bradycardia and was treated by atropine 0.5 mg IV. The degree of sedation was assessed after admission to the recovery room every 30 min for 2 h using modified Ramsay sedation scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Side effects such as hypotension, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and shivering were recorded.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Modified Ramsay sedation scale*</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-9-15-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS forwindows versions 15.0, Chicago, SPSS Inc.

Throughout the first 24 h postoperative period, all patients requested rescue analgesia. About 17 patients (28.3%) requested it once, 24 patients (40%) requested it twice, 13 patients (21.7%) requested it thrice, and six patients (10%) requested it &#x0003e;3 times [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].

The faster onset of both sensory and motor blockade, prolonged duration of analgesia, dose-sparing action of local anesthetics and stable cardiovascular parameters makes these agents a very effective adjuvant in regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The present study was undertaken to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy and safety of clonidine and magnesium as adjuvants to bupivacaine in thoracic epidurals in patients undergoing an elective thoracotomy. Three main results emerged from this clinical study. First, magnesium and clonidine had a beneficial effect on postoperative pain intensity and analgesic requirements in the postoperative period. Second, magnesium treatment decreased the incidence of postoperative shivering. Third, epidural clonidine 2 &#x003bc;g/kg causes postoperative sedation without respiratory depression.</p><p>In concordance with our study, Ghatak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also observed nonsignificant association in the hemodynamic parameters after epidural administration of clonidine and magnesium for lower abdomen surgery. However, Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in their study, however, experienced significant fall in mean arterial pressure at 30 min postepidural block in the clonidine group. Similar results were obtained by Nishikawa[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who concluded that epidural administration of clonidine induces hypotension and bradycardia secondary to decreased sympathetic nerve activity.</p><p>Nociceptive transmission in thoracotomy is via C and A&#x003b4; fibers and can be considered in three discrete routes. Intercostal nerves carry impulses from the skin and intercostal muscles. Stimuli from lung and mediastinum are carried by the vagus nerve. Thoracotomy for lung resection, usually, involves a skin incision at the 5<sup>th</sup> intercostal space, a variable degree of muscle cutting and either excision or division of a rib. A posterolateral thoracotomy incision usually traverses around six dermatomal levels, starting at the 3<sup>rd</sup> thoracic dermatome posteriorly extending to the 7<sup>th</sup> or 8<sup>th</sup> thoracic dermatome anteriorly. Chest wall muscles involved are latissimus dorsi, serratus anterior, pectoralis major, and the intercostal muscles.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Furthermore, patients may well be extremely anxious after major thoracic surgery, exacerbating the perception of postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Noxious stimulation leads to the release of neurotransmitters, which bind to various subclasses of excitatory amino acid receptors, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Activation of these receptors leads to calcium entry into the cell and initiates a series of central sensitization such as wind-up and long-term potentiation in the spinal cord. NMDA receptor signaling may be important in determining the duration of acute pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Magnesium, a major cation in the human body, blocks calcium influx and noncompetitively antagonizes NMDA receptor channels. Magnesium ions and NMDA receptors are involved in the modulation of pain. Magnesium is also a physiological antagonist at various voltage-gated channels which may be important in the mechanism of antinociception.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Clonidine is a centrally acting &#x003b1;2 agonist which inhibits which inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels. It induces dose-dependent spinal cord antinociception, mainly through stimulation of &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors in the dorsal horn, mimicking the activation of descending inhibitory pathways.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the time gap between the initial epidural dose and the first dose of rescue analgesia was the longest in the clonidine group followed by the magnesium group, and it was the shortest in the control group. The association in duration of analgesia was statistically significant between clonidine and control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Our results are also in concordance with Ghatak <italic>et al</italic>. (180.3 &#x000b1; 29.97 min) and Gupta <italic>et al</italic>. (334.2 &#x000b1; 38.6) who observed a maximum prolongation of analgesia with epidural clonidine. We observed both epidural magnesium and clonidine reduced the need of postoperative rescue analgesia. The results of our study correlate with Bilir <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who observed that co-administration of magnesium in lumbar epidural analgesia results in a reduction in fentanyl consumption without any side effects in patients undergoing hip surgery. Ehab et al[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] observed similar results of decrease in postoperative meperidine requirements in patients receiving epidural clonidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) for postthoracotomy pain relief.</p><p>In the magnesium group, no patient had shivering during this study, whereas shivering occurred in four patients (20%) belonging to clonidine group and eight patients (40%) in the control group. The difference among groups was statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Perioperative magnesium supplementation has been seen to prevent the postoperative hypomagnesaemia and decrease the incidence of postoperative shivering.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Jeon <italic>et al</italic>. observed that intrathecal administration of clonidine 150 mcg fails to prevent post spinal shivering.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Sedation is a side effect frequently associated with the use of clonidine for postoperative analgesia, often in conjunction with opioids.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In this study, a dose of 150 &#x003bc;g clonidine caused sedation (Ramsay sedation score &#x0003e;3) in eight patients (40%) of Group C. While no patients in Group A or B developed sedation. The observation was found to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The results of our study were contradictory to Gupta <italic>et al</italic>. who did not observe sedation in their study subjects. This is attributed to lower the dose of epidural clonidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) in their study. Studies conducted in women in labor have shown that boluses of epidural clonidine at doses larger than 100 &#x003bc;g may cause significant sedation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In this study, we used a small dose of magnesium sulfate that would not cause any side-effects. Additional side effects such as pruritus, hypotension, bradycardia, and nausea were statistically insignificant between the three groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Comparison of side effects in the three groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-9-15-g008"/></table-wrap><p>Our study concluded that thoracic epidural analgesia using bupivacaine with clonidine is an efficient therapeutic modality for postthoracotomy pain. Magnesium as an adjuvant provided quality postoperative analgesia decreasing the need for postoperative rescue analgesia and incidence of postoperative shivering without causing sedation. However, larger studies are required before establishing magnesium as a strong adjuvant to local anesthetics for thoracic epidural analgesia.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitation</title><p>Our study is limited by the absence of dose-response of epidural magnesium for postoperative analgesia. In the absence of the literature regarding body weight-based dosage of epidural magnesium, we had used a fixed dose of epidural magnesium in our study. The result of present randomized controlled trial raises the need for more clinical studies regarding the dosage regimen of epidural magnesium.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
