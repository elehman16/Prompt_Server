Smokers in each group were randomized to receive 12 weeks of varenicline plus bupropion treatment versus varenicline plus placebo. The primary outcome was continuous smoking abstinence at weeks 8&#x02013;11 after the target quit date.ResultsFor smokers with a high level of dependence, judged by having a baseline Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score &#x02265; 6 and cigarette consumption &#x02265; 20/d, combination varenicline/bupropion treatment increased the abstinence rate relative to varenicline alone: 71.0% versus 43.8% (odds ratio = 3.14; 95% confidence interval = 1.11&#x02013;8.92, p [one tailed] = .016). In contrast, less dependent smokers did not show a benefit of combination treatment relative to varenicline (abstinence rates of 32.1% vs. 45.6%, respectively); there was a significant interaction of treatment and dependence level. Patch nonresponders tended to benefit the most from combination treatment, which was well tolerated overall.ConclusionsCombination varenicline/bupropion treatment proved significantly more efficacious than varenicline alone among highly dependent male smokers. These results, together with prior studies, support an adaptive treatment paradigm that assigns smoking cessation treatment according to baseline smoker characteristics and initial response to nicotine patch treatment.ImplicationsThis study replicated, in a prospective manner, an important and surprising retrospective finding from a previous clinical trial, which showed that a specific subpopulation of smokers benefited substantially from receiving a combination treatment of varenicline plus bupropion, relative to varenicline plus placebo. Specifically, male smokers having high baseline nicotine dependence (FTND score &#x02265; 6 and cigarette consumption &#x02265; 20/d), showed a marked increase in smoking abstinence rate on combination pharmacotherapy. The present study likewise found an enhancement in end-of-treatment abstinence rate in this subgroup, from 43.8% to 71.0%. The adaptive treatment paradigm, which classifies smokers based on initial dependence level and response to prequit nicotine patch treatment, may be used to identify target populations of smokers whose success can be enhanced by intervening with combination pharmacotherapy before the quit-smoking date.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01806779.National Institute on Drug Abuse10.13039/100000026) --><volume>19</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>999</fpage><lpage>1002</lpage><history><date date-type="received"><day>01</day><month>9</month><year>2016</year></date><date date-type="accepted"><day>22</day><month>10</month><year>2016</year></date></history><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; The Author 2016.

In this approach, nicotine patch treatment is initiated 2 weeks prior to a target quit date, and based on the reduction in ad libitum smoking during the first week of prequit patch treatment, smokers are classified as patch &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;nonresponders,&#x0201d; according to whether their expired-air carbon monoxide (CO) decreases by &#x0003e;50% or &#x02264;50%. Responders are allowed to remain on the patch, while nonresponders are switched to an alternative treatment, such as bupropion and varenicline.</p><p>In one study, we found that approximately 10% of nicotine patch nonresponders who would have failed to quit smoking could be rescued by switching them from nicotine patch treatment to varenicline or augmenting their nicotine patch treatment with bupropion sustained-release.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In a follow-up study using a similar adaptive treatment algorithm,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> combination varenicline/bupropion proved more efficacious than varenicline alone as a rescue treatment for subpopulations of patch nonresponders, specifically male smokers and highly dependent smokers (assessed by a baseline Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence [FTND] score &#x02265; 6 or baseline cigarette consumption &#x02265; 20/d).

Prior to randomization, all participants received precessation nicotine patch treatment and were instructed to smoke as little or as much as they wished during the first week. Participants were categorized as patch responders or nonresponders based on whether their end-expired-air CO concentrations showed a &#x0003e;50% decrease at the end of this week.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>The study was approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Adult smokers were eligible if they were 18&#x02013;65 years of age, reported smoking an average of &#x02265;10 cigarettes/d for three cumulative years, and displayed end-expired-air CO &#x02265; 10 ppm. After a history, physical exam and laboratory evaluation, written informed consent was obtained from participants, who were compensated up to $350 for study participation.</p><p>After screening and enrollment, participants visited the research center weekly for 2 weeks before the quit date and at four sessions held 1, 3, 7, and 11 weeks after the quit date. Brief (&#x0003c;15 minutes) support was provided at each session. At each session, clinical trial materials were dispensed, smoking diaries were collected, and expired-air CO were measured.</p><p>After the first week of prequit nicotine patch treatment, all patch nonresponders received varenicline pills and were additionally randomized to taking either bupropion sustained-release tablets or placebo tablets that were identical in appearance. The recommended dosing titration schedule was used for both varenicline (0.5 mg once daily on days 1&#x02013;3, 0.5 mg twice daily on days 4&#x02013;7, followed by 1 mg twice daily through 12 weeks) and for bupropion (150 mg daily for 3 days, followed by 150 mg twice daily through 12 weeks).</p><p>Initial nicotine patch dosing was based on initial expired-air CO reading; participants with CO &#x0003e; 30 ppm at baseline received 42 mg/d (two 21 mg/d patches, the first applied in the morning and the second at noon), and the remaining participants wore a single 21 mg/d patch applied each morning.

We speculate that nicotine patch nonresponders may show a greater benefit from the addition of bupropion to varenicline treatment because both nicotine and varenicline act on high-affinity nicotinic receptors, whereas bupropion and its metabolites have an additional mechanism of action that includes enhancing dopaminergic and noradrenergic transmission through blocking neurotransmitter reuptake at the synapse.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This speculation is tempered by the absence of a statistically significant three-way interaction between Treatment, Dependence, and Patch responder status in the relatively small sample of the current study.

However, the decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked per day also shows a strong relationship to abstinence outcomes.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Thus, the present findings may be translated into clinical environments where CO monitoring may not be feasible, using a simple self-report of cigarettes smoked per day.</p><p>In summary, the present results, along with previous studies, reinforce the conclusion that combination varenicline/bupropion treatment can substantially benefit specific subpopulations of smokers, particularly smokers who exhibit high levels of nicotine dependence. For these smokers, the enhancement in abstinence rate was substantial, from 43.8% to 71.0% (averaging across patch responders and nonresponders). In our previous study<sup>4</sup> of patch nonresponders, a substantial enhancement in abstinence rate was also seen for the subgroup with a high level of dependence. Thus, a readily identifiable fraction of the smoking population seeking treatment could potentially obtain a substantial benefit from combination varenicline/bupropion treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>Nicotine &#x00026; Tobacco Research</italic> online.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by grant 1P50 DA027840 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a grant from Philip Morris, USA.
