Because rehydrated glucagon is unstable (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., has developed a ready-to-use, stable, nonaqueous liquid form of glucagon.

A unique dose of glucagon (75, 150, or 300 &#x003bc;g) was used on each study day, and the order of doses was randomized across study days. The night before the study, subjects maintained their normal routine. At &#x0223c;4:00 to 5:00 <sc>a.m.</sc>, the subjects reported their blood glucose concentration to one of the investigators. If their blood glucose concentration was &#x0003e;140 mg/dL, subjects were instructed to administer a small dose of insulin in a bolus, and, if the concentration was &#x0003c;70 mg/dL, to treat with a small amount of oral glucose. Subjects arrived at the study unit at &#x0223c;7:00 <sc>a.m.</sc></p><p>At &#x0223c;9:00 <sc>a.m.</sc>, the subjects received the assigned dose of glucagon using an insulin syringe. Each injection site was graded at +30 and +120 min using the scale of Draize et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), a subjective ranking (0 to 4+) of skin erythema and edema. Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature measurements were performed at 30, 60, and 120 min after each dose. At 180 min, the subjects received a subcutaneous insulin bolus using an insulin syringe, equivalent to cover 30 g of glucose to induce mild hypoglycemia, and blood glucose concentration was monitored until it decreased to &#x0003c;70 mg/dL or for 2 h, whichever occurred first. At &#x0223c;60 min, the second glucagon dose was administered (same as the previous dose). Serial blood samples (&#x0223c;4 mL) were obtained prior to and after both doses of glucagon. At the end of the study, subjects were fed, and when their glucose concentration was stable, they were discharged.</p><p>Standard methodologies were used to measure plasma concentrations of glucose (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH), glucagon (Glucagon RIA Kit, catalog #GL-32K; Millipore, Billerica, MA), and insulin (Mercodia Iso-Insulin Kit, catalog #10&#x02013;1128&#x02013;01; Mercodia Inc., Winston-Salem, NC).</p><p>All statistical testing was two-sided. SAS version 9.3 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used throughout. All data are presented as the mean &#x000b1; SE. The derivations for glucagon (PK) and glucose (PD) efficacy variables included the following: maximal glucagon concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) between 0 and 180 min, the time to maximal concentration (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>), the area under the curve from 0 to 120 min using the trapezoidal rule (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;120</sub>), and baseline adjusted AUC<sub>0&#x02013;120</sub> with negative values set at 0. The glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations were compared using ordinary Sidak analyses (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Pairwise comparison of the least squares arithmetic mean of each dose was performed by applying a mixed model (dose, sequence, dose period, and subject). The PK/PD parameters were analyzed using the Schuirmann (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) two one-sided tests for equivalence. The two one-sided tests from the SAS <italic>t</italic> test procedure were applied to test the bioequivalence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Dose-dependent increases in glucose were observed after an overnight fast and mild hypoglycemia, but were more robust after an overnight fast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

The initial injection of glucagon (Dose 1) was administered after an overnight fast. The second injection of glucagon (Dose 2) occurred between 10 and 30 min after a subcutaneous injection of insulin equivalent to what each subject would use to cover 30 g of carbohydrate using their insulin/carbohydrate ratio.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dc152124f1"/></fig><p>After insulin-induced mild hypoglycemia, glucagon administration increased (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) blood glucose concentrations at 20 min, although changes were not as robust as in the morning fasted state. The change in blood glucose concentrations from baseline to 20 min was 4.6, 1.8, and 6.9 mg/dL for the 75-, 150-, and 300-&#x003bc;g doses, respectively.</p><p>Increases in glucagon <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;120</sub> were dose dependent and statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

The glucagon <italic>C</italic><sub>max,</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;120</sub>, and <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> were similar between the fasted and post&#x02013;insulin administration states.

The most common adverse event (AE) reported was a burning sensation at the injection site, and it was similar across doses. The majority of these AEs were a mild (68%) or moderate (30%) burning sensation. The median duration was similar among the doses (&#x0223c;3.0 min). One subject reported burning for 4 h after one dose (but not after other doses) that was administered at the infusion site from which she had just removed her insulin pump; this event was excluded as an outlier from the analysis of duration. Four subjects reported transient nausea without vomiting on a single occasion after the 300-&#x003bc;g dose (17% of the total), but none after the 75- or 150-&#x003bc;g dose. All other AEs were reported in two or fewer subjects and had a similar incidence across doses, and the vast majority were mild.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the suboptimal response with the 75-&#x003bc;g dose of glucagon and the occasional mild nausea with the 300-&#x003bc;g dose, the 150-&#x003bc;g dose of glucagon appears to be optimal. This is similar to the dose we have used in older adolescents using aqueous glucagon (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The glycemic response after an overnight fast was greater than that after mild hypoglycemia, perhaps because of the known effects of insulin on glycogen metabolism (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Because most hypoglycemia occurs some hours after the last insulin bolus, we anticipate that the glycemic response to mini-dose glucagon would be similar to that observed after the overnight fast in this study. However, hypoglycemia occurring immediately after an insulin bolus could dramatically blunt the response to glucagon; therefore, rechecking blood glucose concentrations will always be recommended, and repeating the dose may be necessary (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Two areas of concern are mild transient nausea, which appears to be dose related, and injection site discomfort after some injections. This may be related to the DMSO used in the Xeris glucagon formulation. However, the discomfort was inconsistent in each individual and unrelated to the site or dose.</p><p>Mini-dose glucagon in a ready-to-use form would provide an alternative to the current management of mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-requiring diabetes of all ages. Fear of progression to severe hypoglycemia and a general sense of not &#x0201c;feeling good&#x0201d; cause many to avoid even mild hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The current American Diabetes Association recommendations (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) are to treat mild hypoglycemia with 15 g of oral carbohydrate. Patients frequently repeat the recommended treatment several times, resulting in dramatic hyperglycemia (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Treatment with mini-dose glucagon may provide a more precise therapeutic option for mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia, avoiding the consumption of additional calories and the resulting hyperglycemia. In addition, the liquid, stable, and ready-to-use glucagon circumvents the complexities and the potential failure to reconstitute and administer lyophilized glucagon correctly that interfere with timely treatment. We believe that mini-dose glucagon administration using stable, ready-to-use G-Pen Mini glucagon (Xeris) will be a clinically attractive and cost-effective tool that patients with type 1 diabetes can use to help manage their disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
