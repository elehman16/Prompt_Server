IR is a pathological state where the human body cells in muscles fail to respond appropriately to the hormone insulin (sensitivity).</p><p>IR often remains undetectable, but it produces impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or T2DM, leading to systemic complications. Clinically it is known as IR syndrome and it produces multi-systemic signs and symptoms including, high blood sugar, loss of concentration, sleepiness, intestinal bloating, weight gain, elevated triglycerides level, hypertension, and depression.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Risk factors associated for IR are genetic predisposition, age 40-50 or older, central obesity, physical inactivity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL level and previous diabetes. Certain pathologies like obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, infections like hepatitis C and certain liver pathologies also contribute along with steroids and other medications to the occurrence of IR.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>IR is directly related to &#x003b2;-cell function and its decreased insulin secretory response and inability to overcome the state of chronic hyperinsulinemia. High resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and hyperinsulinemia increase the possibility of three major interrelated diseases including T2DM, hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD).<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Obesity is one of the key risk factors which increase the possibility of IR and T2DM due to increased secretions of non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other factors from the adipose tissues in obese person&#x02019;s body. Increased IR causes dysfunction of pancreatic islet -cells, which leads to uncontrolled level of blood glucose, and it is considered a great risk factor in the development of T2DM in obese individuals.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Physical inactivity is highly associated with the development of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and impaired micro-vascular function in healthy population. The long and short term physical inactivity causes metabolic and vascular changes, which lead towards IR and ultimately to T2DM.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A vigorous and non-vigorous physical activity programs produced positive impacts on insulin sensitivity and reduction in IR in mild to moderate type of T2DM patients and supports the recommendation of moderate physical activity in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Ageing has no correlation with the development of IR, while physical inactivity and obesity has a direct relation with IR occurrence.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Managing certain modifiable factors such as diet, exercise, smoking and stress are thought to contribute to the control of IR. Lifestyle intervention to address these factors appears to be a valuable part of any therapeutic approach.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A positive impact of mild to moderate exercise intervention on IR in young patients has been reported.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The current study (<italic>Trial No:</italic> (Trial ID ISRCTN16466697) was designed to determine the effects of a 25 weeks supervised structured aerobic exercise training (SSAET) program on fasting blood glucose level (FBGL), plasma insulin level (PIL), glycemic control (GC), and insulin resistance (IR) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Riphah Rehabilitation and Research Centre (RRRC) located at Pakistan Railways General Hospital (PRGH), Rawalpindi, Pakistan was the clinical setting for the current randomized controlled trial.

The blood samples were taken on baseline and at the completion of 25 weeks. the investigation of fasting blood glucose level, plasma insulin level, and glycaemic control was conducted to calculate IR.</p><p>Fasting blood glucose level was recorded directly by glucometer. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood sample (2ml in purple tube) was taken for glycemic control (HbA1c) and HbA1c kit of Tianjin MD Pacific Technology Company of China was used. The blood sample (2ml in yellow tube) was taken centrifuged for 10 minutes and serum was separated for plasma insulin level by using microlisa human insulin kit made by Amgenix USA. IR was calculated by homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) by using the formula: IR= (insulin mU/L x glucose mg/dl) / 405. All the laboratory investigations were done at postgraduate research lab at Islamic International medical college, Riphah International University, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.</p><p>Medically graded treadmill was used in SSAET program along with telemetric monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and ECG. The 25 week SSAET program was divided into five phases of five weeks each. In phase-1, the duration of single session was 10 minutes and the total duration per week was 30 minutes. Thirty minutes increase per week was followed in the subsequent 4 phases. Normal speed of each participant was used as a treadmill speed and was determined by 20 meter distance test at baseline. Phase-1 was conducted at zero degree inclination with the ground, phase-2 at 3 degree, while 3 degree increase was followed in the subsequent three phases.

They reported both acute and chronic effects of exercise on insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and blood pressure and blood lipids, but the intensity, duration, and energy expenditure required to produce these effects are not clearly defined in the literature.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The current study also showed improvements in FBGL, PIL, and glycemic control in experimental (exercise) group.</p><p>Adams (2013) carried out a meta-analysis on the impact of brief high-intensity exercise on blood glucose levels and foundsix studies of non-diabetics (51 males, 14 females) performing 7.5 to 20 minutes/week of high intensity exercise were reviewed. The six studies that were reviewed suggested that sprint interval training of two weeks duration increased insulin sensitivity up to three days. Maximal interval running of two weeks with total duration of 40 minutes per week positively influenced blood glucose level. The same effects are also produced by running with 65% VO<sub>2max</sub> for a duration of 150 minutes/week. In addition to that it was also suggested that a single exercise session of 44 seconds to 13 minutes of high intensity exercise also improved blood glucose level in patients with T2DM.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The present study also demonstrated positive effects on PIL in exercise (experimental) group.</p><p>Another meta-analysis conducted by Boule and team (2001) to review the effects of exercise on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and body mass in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

These two lipids act as fuel during exercises. In male subjects the contribution of IMTG was low covering 10% of the energy provision during fasting exercises. In female subjects the IMTG met a large proportion of energy requirement. Thus contributed positively in reduction of adipose tissue and leads to decrease insulin resistance.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Bollinger and team (2011) conducted a review study on exercise and insulin resistance.
