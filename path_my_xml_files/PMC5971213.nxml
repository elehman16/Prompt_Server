Primary outcomes were comparative pathogen yield between sputum induction and cough swab for stage 1, and between sputum induction, and single-lobe, two-lobe, and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage for stage 2.

We searched PubMed for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2010, and updated the search on Dec 6, 2014. We used the following keywords: &#x0201c;induced sputum&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;sputum induction&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;bronchoalveolar lavage&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cough swab&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;oropharyngeal&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;children&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;child&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;infant&#x0201d; &#x0201c;childhood&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;young&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cystic fibrosis&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;CF&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;hypertonic saline&#x0201d;. Few adequately powered studies were found. Six studies assessed sputum induction in children with cystic fibrosis and these were generally in older children who could perform spirometry reliably. Taken together, these studies included 211 patients and reported a 92&#x000b7;5% success rate in obtaining a sputum sample. Four studies compared sputum induction with oropharyngeal samples in children with cystic fibrosis. The two larger studies identified additional organisms on sputum induction in 30% and 42% of cases, but these studies mainly recruited school-age children and teenagers, many of whom could spontaneously expectorate sputum. One small study compared sputum induction with bronchoalveolar lavage in ten children with cystic fibrosis. During the period of recruitment to the present study, one study was published that showed sputum induction to be superior to oropharyngeal sampling in 32 children younger than 5 years, with an approximately two-fold increase in pathogen detection. A further single study compared sputum induction to gold-standard two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage in children, but paired samples were not necessarily taken at the same visit. That study found sputum induction sensitivity to be 37% and specificity to be 69%, compared with gold-standard two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage, but discounted any pathogens isolated exclusively on sputum induction as false negatives.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of the study</bold></p><p id="para60">To our knowledge, this is the first time a study has compared concomitant cough swab, sputum induction, and the gold-standard two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage to comprehensive six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage to systematically define the relative contribution of each approach. Our data establish sputum induction as superior to cough swab and as a credible approach to sampling the lower airway in symptomatic children with cystic fibrosis when compared with bronchoalveolar lavage. This study shows that both sputum induction and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage contribute independent, sizeable gains in pathogen detection over and above two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage, and challenges two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage as an adequate gold-standard approach to understanding lower airway microbiology. Sputum induction is uniquely placed to sample the large intrathoracic airways, a compartment inadequately considered in the current paradigm of lower airway sampling. In symptomatic patients, doing sputum induction before bronchoalveolar lavage will correctly describe the lower airway pathogen environment in most patients, thereby markedly reducing the number of bronchoscopy procedures required.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">Our study supports the recommendation that sputum induction and six-lobe lavage should be done together as a new standard of care for comprehensive assessment of the lower airway pathogen environment in children with cystic fibrosis. If sputum induction is done before bronchoalveolar lavage, a substantial number of bronchoscopies could be avoided in symptomatic children with cystic fibrosis. The inclusion of sputum induction as a regular contribution to cystic fibrosis care in children is supported by the tolerability of the procedure in all age groups, the ease of repeatability, the acceptability to parents and patients, the high success rates, the additional pathogens identified, and the clear economic savings.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para90">Bronchoalveolar lavage is considered to be the gold standard for sampling lower airway microbiology.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Although the international community is interested in bronchoalveolar lavage-based microbiology-surveillance programmes, little evidence supports recommendation of this invasive approach in routine cystic fibrosis care.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Bronchoalveolar lavage is generally reserved for children with cystic fibrosis who have not responded to appropriate or empirical antibiotic treatment and in whom oropharyngeal cultures do not offer an explanation for the persistence of symptoms. No consensus exists on methods for bronchoalveolar lavage, and practice varies.

The study was subject to Institutional Review by the Cardiff and Vale Research Review Service (CaRRS&#x02014;Project ID 11-RPM-5216) and approved by the South Wales Research Ethics Committee (11/WA/0334).</p><p id="para130">We prospectively recruited children with cystic fibrosis aged between 6 months and 18 years, from the South, West and Mid-Wales Children's Cystic Fibrosis Network. All children attending the Children's Hospital for Wales for clinically indicated bronchoscopy, those attending for routine surgery under general anaesthetic, those admitted for treatment of a chest exacerbation, or those attending for annual review in the outpatient clinic were eligible. Children on treatment antibiotics at the time of sampling were excluded, to maximise the chances of successful bacterial culture.</p><p id="para140">The study was structured in two stages, each designed to test different hypotheses. In stage 1, sputum induction as a diagnostic intervention was tested against cough swab. Children were recruited for this stage of the study at any point when they would otherwise have a cough swab taken: in the outpatient clinic or as an inpatient before receiving intravenous antibiotics. In stage 2, sputum induction as a diagnostic intervention was tested against bronchoalveolar lavage. This was done in a subgroup of patients who had been recruited into stage 1, and who were also attending for a clinically indicated bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Specifically, sputum induction was compared to single-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage, two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage, and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage.</p><p id="para150">Children could volunteer to take part on more than one occasion if the occasions were more than 3 months apart. Sputum induction was done immediately after cough swab and within the 24 h before bronchoscopy if paired with bronchoalveolar lavage. Children were classified as symptomatic at the time of recruitment if they had an increase in respiratory symptoms, defined as a wet or dry cough, wheeze, or coryzal symptoms. The cough was defined as wet if it sounded wet before the procedure. Data on pathogen isolates from the preceding 12 months before the procedure and new treatments commenced because of microbiology results from the procedure were recorded for all children.</p><p id="para160">Informed consent was taken by trained clinicians on the delegation log. Data for recruitment, clinical observations, and primary and secondary outcome measurements were collated by trained clinicians and research staff on the delegation log and managed by the chief investigator.

A combination of percussion, vibration, positive expiratory pressure, and active cycle of breathing compatible with the patient's normal physiotherapy regimen was used. Oropharyngeal suction using a size 6, 8, or 10F suction catheter was used to obtain a sputum sample in children who could not spontaneously expectorate after the procedure. Duration of the procedure was limited to 30 min. Success of the procedure was defined as the ability to obtain a mucoid sample, per visual inspection. The physiotherapist documented heart rate, respiratory rate, and FEV<sub>1</sub> where applicable before and after the procedure as objective measures of tolerance (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p id="para180">All bronchoscopy was done under general anaesthetic. Suction of secretions was avoided before bronchoalveolar lavage to preserve localised sampling without contamination. Samples were taken from all six lobes specifically in the following order: right middle lobe (RML), left lingular (LLi), right lower lobe (RLL), right upper lobe (RUL), left lower lobe (LLL), and left upper lobe (LUL). RML bronchoalveolar lavage was done using three aliquots of 1 mL/kg normal saline (maximum 20 mL per aliquot) with low-level suction through the scope used to retrieve the sample between aliquots. A single aliquot of 1 mL/kg bodyweight (maximum 20 mL) was used for all other lobes. This aliquot was retrieved by light suction on the syringe used for instillation before the liquid column was broken. A second instillation of 1 mL/kg (maximum 20 mL) was used for all lobes in which the initial aliquot did not return 40% volume or greater using syringe back-suction.</p><p id="para190">Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from each individual was processed as three samples. All three aliquots from the RML were combined to form bronchoalveolar lavage sample 1. The single aliquot from the LLi was used as sample 2. Fluids from the remaining four lobes (RLL, RUL, LLL, and LUL) were combined to form sample 3. These three samples were sent to the microbiology lab where they were processed independently.</p><p id="para200">Because bronchoalveolar lavage samples 1, 2, and 3 were taken in strict sequential order in all bronchoscopy procedures, we were able to combine the pathogens isolated to describe pathogen detection from increasingly extensive bronchoalveolar lavage.

In particular, we tested sputum induction as an infection diagnostic technique. We compared pathogen yield from sputum induction with concurrent cough swab, single-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage, two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage, and comprehensive six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage to identify the relative contribution of each approach.</p><p id="para500">Most patients recruited to both stages of the study were unable to spontaneously expectorate before the sputum-induction procedure irrespective of whether they had a wet cough or not. We found the sputum-induction procedure to be well tolerated and equally successful in all age groups, in the inpatient or outpatient setting, in those who were asymptomatic or symptomatic, and in children with or without a wet cough.</p><p id="para510">In stage 1 of this study, sputum induction was compared with paired cough swab. Cough swab pathogen positivity in this study was equivalent to that reported in similar populations in other studies.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Almost three times as many pathogens were identified on sputum induction compared with cough swab, and this benefit was reflected to a broadly similar degree in all age groups. More pathogens were identified on both sputum induction and cough swab in children aged 6 years or older, reflecting the greater pathogen prevalence in the older age group. The benefits of sputum induction over cough swab were seen in symptomatic and asymptomatic children, supporting the use of sputum induction over cough swab in all situations. Sputum induction was positive for a pathogen in 38% of paired samples, positive for a pathogen not identified on paired cough swab in 31% of cases, and positive for a new pathogen not isolated on repeated cough swabs from the preceding 12 months in 24% of cases. Sputum induction had a considerable effect on patient care, with new treatment implemented as a consequence in 31% of cases.</p><p id="para520">In stage 2 of the study, sputum induction was compared with single-lobe, two-lobe, and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage in a group of children who were largely symptomatic. Sequentially higher proportions of pathogens were detected by single-lobe, two-lobe, and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage. The proportion of pathogens isolated by sputum induction and two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage were largely equivalent. Six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage only identified 85% of pathogens isolated from all approaches, since some important pathogens were uniquely isolated on sputum induction. Patient age did not affect the ability for sputum induction to correctly describe all lower airway pathogens.</p><p id="para530">By using multi-approach concurrent sampling from upper and lower airways in the same patient, we estimated whether pathogens identified by sputum induction were upper or lower airway residents. A large proportion of pathogens identified by sputum induction were identified on bronchoalveolar lavage, confirming that sputum induction does effectively sample the lower airway. We found that with sequentially wider bronchoalveolar lavage sampling, more pathogens that were isolated on sputum induction were also identified on bronchoalveolar lavage, indicating that sputum induction is capable of sampling very widely from the lower airway. Using DNA RISA profiling we showed that sputum induction can capture the diversity of bacteria associated with multiple bronchoalveolar compartments.</p><p id="para540">A proportion of pathogens (13%) were identified on sputum induction but not on six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage or cough swabs. With the assumption that concurrent cough swab and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were true negatives,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> this finding suggests that sputum induction can identify pathogens from compartments of the respiratory tract not sampled by the other methods, and raises the question as to where these pathogens reside. Bacterial bronchitis is common in young children with cystic fibrosis who are symptomatic, suggesting the predominant focus of acute infection might often be the large intrathoracic airways rather than the alveolar bed. The large intrathoracic airways together constitute a lower-airway compartment that is most easily sampled by the sputum-induction procedure, is largely bypassed by even the most extensive approach to bronchoalveolar lavage, and is a compartment perhaps inadequately considered in the current paradigm of lower airway sampling. In this study, sputum induction was more successful at isolating the important Gram-negative pathogens, <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>B cepacia</italic> complex species, compared with concurrent six-lobe lavage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>). This raises the possibility that for some pathogens the large intrathoracic airways might be the optimal lower airway environment for early infection.</p><p id="para550">We generated a sensitivity analysis against a combined gold standard consisting of all pathogens identified by sputum induction and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage. Sputum induction is shown in these data to be marginally more sensitive than the current gold-standard two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage (0&#x000b7;63 <italic>vs</italic> 0&#x000b7;59). Six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage has a higher sensitivity at 0&#x000b7;81. However, sputum induction and two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage combined have a sensitivity of 0&#x000b7;93. These data highlight independent, sizeable gains in pathogen detection from both sputum induction and extended six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage, over and above the current gold-standard two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage. This in turn questions whether two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage can be considered adequate as a standalone approach to understanding lower airway microbiology. We advocate from the present data that sputum induction and six-lobe lavage should be done together as a new standard of care for comprehensive assessment of the lower airway pathogen environment in children with cystic fibrosis.</p><p id="para560">The present data also support sputum induction as a non-invasive surrogate for bronchoalveolar lavage. We propose that in symptomatic patients, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage should be reserved for those who have not responded to appropriate or empirical antibiotic treatment and whose sputum-induction cultures do not explain the persistence of symptoms. From our data, a successful sputum-induction sample taken before bronchoscopy and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage correctly identified all lower airway pathogens in 63% of patients who had one or more pathogen present. The routine use of sputum induction followed by appropriate treatment for those pathogens isolated could therefore substantially reduce the need for bronchoscopy in symptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis. This has notable implications both for quality of care and cost.</p><p id="para570">Limitations of the study include the fact that study investigators were not blinded to outcome, recruitment was not randomised, and some patients contributed on more than one occasion. However, the study is likely to be representative because 70% of the patients who attend the South, West, and Mid-Wales Children's Cystic Fibrosis Service were recruited into this study. We adjusted statistical outcomes for repeated measures in those patients that were recruited on more than one occasion. The bronchoalveolar lavage data apply to a cohort of patients who were largely symptomatic, because patients were recruited when bronchoscopy was clinically indicated. The outcomes of stage 2 of the study therefore relate to symptomatic patients and might not be directly applicable to surveillance programmes in asymptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis.</p><p id="para580">In conclusion, we have established sputum induction as superior to cough swab, and as a credible approach to sampling the lower airway in symptomatic children with cystic fibrosis. We showed benefit in patients of all ages, and in those who are unable to spontaneously expectorate. We suggest that the large intrathoracic airways constitute an important lower airway compartment that is inadequately sampled by standard approaches to pathogen surveillance in children with cystic fibrosis. We have shown that both sputum induction and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage contribute important independent gains in pathogen detection compared with the current gold-standard two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage, and advocate sputum induction and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage combined as a new standard of care in the assessment of the lower airway pathogen environment in children with cystic fibrosis. In symptomatic patients, doing sputum induction before bronchoalveolar lavage will correctly describe the lower airway pathogen environment in almost two-thirds of patients, and if used routinely, could substantially reduce the number of bronchoscopy procedures required. We recommend implementation of sputum induction as a regular contribution to cystic fibrosis care in children. This recommendation is supported by the tolerability of the procedure in all age groups, the ease of repeatability, the acceptability to parents and patients, the high success of obtaining samples, the high proportion of pathogens identified, the applicability to both the inpatient and outpatient setting, and the clear economic savings compared with bronchoscopy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
