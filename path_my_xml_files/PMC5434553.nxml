Mental health comorbidity is common. Stress can increase the risk of depression, reduce quality of life (QOL), and possibly exacerbate disease activity in MS. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) may help, but has been little studied in MS, particularly among more disabled individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The objective of this study was to test the feasibility and likely effectiveness of a standard MBSR course for people with MS. Participant eligibility included: age &#x0003e; 18, any type of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) &#x0003c;/= 7.0. Participants received either MBSR or wait-list control. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and three-months later. Primary outcomes were perceived stress and QOL. Secondary outcomes were common MS symptoms, mindfulness, and self-compassion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifty participants were recruited and randomised (25 per group). Trial retention and outcome measure completion rates were 90% at post-intervention, and 88% at 3 months. Sixty percent of participants completed the course. Immediately post-MBSR, perceived stress improved with a large effect size (ES 0.93; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), compared to very small beneficial effects on QOL (ES 0.17; <italic>p</italic> = 0.48). Depression (ES 1.35; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), positive affect (ES 0.87; <italic>p</italic> = 0.13), anxiety (ES 0.85; <italic>p</italic> = 0.05), and self-compassion (ES 0.80; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) also improved with large effect sizes. At three-months post-MBSR (study endpoint) improvements in perceived stress were diminished to a small effect size (ES 0.26; <italic>p</italic> = 0.39), were negligible for QOL (ES 0.08; <italic>p</italic> = 0.71), but were large for mindfulness (ES 1.13; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), positive affect (ES 0.90; <italic>p</italic> = 0.54), self-compassion (ES 0.83; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), anxiety (ES 0.82; <italic>p</italic> = 0.15), and prospective memory (ES 0.81; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recruitment, retention, and data collection demonstrate that a RCT of MBSR is feasible for people with MS. Trends towards improved outcomes suggest that a larger definitive RCT may be warranted. However, optimisation changes may be required to render more stable the beneficial treatment effects on stress and depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02136485">NCT02136485</ext-link>; trial registered 1st May 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12883-017-0880-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a stressful condition, with unpredictable relapses and disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], problematic comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], complex drug regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and manifold social and role difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Stress may contribute to disease activity in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], is burdensome, can negate health-promoting behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], may contribute to the development of anxiety and depression and impair quality of life (QOL) in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Anxiety and depression are common in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Evidence to support the use of pharmacological treatments for mental health comorbidities in MS is limited, with problematic side effects noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Amongst psychological interventions, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches are often used, but evidence is limited and reviews consistently highlight a need for further high quality research to identify other effective and acceptable interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. CBT has the strongest evidence for treating depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] in MS, but effective treatments for anxiety are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are increasingly used to manage mental health problems and stress in long-term conditions (LTCs), with meta-analytic studies reporting comparable efficacy to both CBT and antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. MBIs are multicomponent complex interventions that teach a variety of meditation skills to facilitate the development of &#x02018;mindfulness&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The term mindfulness is often defined as; &#x02018;<italic>paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally</italic>&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. How MBIs work is not fully understood, but improved executive skills and enhanced emotion regulation are thought key mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was the original model for MBIs, first used for people with chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. MBIs have since been applied to a wide range of other LTCs, with existing evidence supporting their use in anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], recurrent depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and somatisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In people with MS, a recent systematic review found limited evidence that MBIs may improve anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, balance, and QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Since then, further evidence suggests potential cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, how best MBIs should be delivered to diverse MS populations remains unclear. Differing demographic factors such as age, sex, socio-economic status (SES), ethnicity, comorbidity, and greater levels of disability could conceivably impact on effectiveness. Prior studies have largely focused on distinct disease phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], or less disabled individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], meaning that previous findings suggesting benefit from MBSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] may not apply to the wider spectrum of people with MS. Only one prior study has reported detailed feasibility findings for the use of MBIs in people with MS, where data is limited to people with progressive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Very little is thus known about the feasibility, acceptability, accessibility, and implementability of standard MBSR for people with MS.</p><p>The aim of the study described in this paper was to determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive phase-3 randomised controlled trial (RCT) of standard MBSR and to obtain initial estimates of likely effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design and participants</title><p>This was a phase-2 exploratory RCT to assess the feasibility (engagement and retention), and likely effectiveness of MBSR in people with MS. It was conducted in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom (UK). Acceptability, accessibility, and implementability were also assessed via nested qualitative semi-structured interviews (recently submitted for publication) and will be reported elsewhere.</p><p>The study employed a wait-list control design, meaning that all study participants eventually received MBSR. We aimed to recruit 50 adults with MS within 3 months. Between June and August 2014, participants were recruited from National Health Service (NHS) sites in Greater Glasgow. Participants were recruited directly by clinical staff on NHS sites providing MS services; by alerting all GPs in this health board area by email; advertising via NHS/third-sector bodies (MS Revive); through internet adverts (MS Society UK), and the University of Glasgow Twitter/Facebook social media outlets. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided below (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study eligibility criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Inclusion</td><td>1) Over 18&#x000a0;years of age;<break/>2) Neurologist confirmed diagnosis of MS (Poser or McDonald criteria depending on year of diagnosis);<break/>3) Able to understand spoken and written English;<break/>4) A score of less than or equal to 7.0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Exclusion</td><td>1) Life-threatening physical or mental health comorbidities (i.e. suicidal ideation, active psychosis, or terminal/life threatening inter-current medical illness), or such conditions expected to significantly limit participation and adherence (eg dementia, pregnancy, on going substance abuse);<break/>2) Those currently receiving another form of psychological intervention (non-pharmacological).</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>A priori stopping criteria were for trial discontinuation in the occurrence of any adverse event(s) strongly suggesting harm from the intervention.</p><p>Recruited participants had baseline measures and informed consent collected face-to-face, prior to randomisation. All measures were self-completed; firstly with a researcher present, then on subsequent iterations by the participant alone. Follow-up measures were collected by post, at intervention completion (2 months), and then again 3 months later (at 5 months). Those who did not return postal measures within 14&#x000a0;days were telephoned to confirm ongoing participation. After waiting 2 weeks for response, the average number of reminder calls required was 4.4. Participants received a &#x000a3;5 gift voucher as a gesture of appreciation for completing each questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>An independent, blinded statistician from the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics (RCB) at the University of Glasgow undertook randomisation and sequence generation, once all baseline measures had been collected. Block sizes of two were generated, to prevent over-allocation to either group. Blinded staff at the University of Glasgow with no prior knowledge of participants handled treatment allocation. Questionnaire data was identifiable only by a random study number, and data entry for all outcome measures was done by a researcher blinded to group allocation. It was impossible to blind participants or MBSR instructors to their treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patient involvement</title><p>The trial protocol was prospectively reviewed by three patient members of the UK MS Society research network who provided favourable feedback for the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention was based on standard MBSR, including home practice materials, but without the day retreat at week six; excluded for pragmatic, space-constraint reasons, as well as empirical evidence contesting its necessity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). All MBSR classes were led by two experienced physician facilitators and took place at the NHS Centre for Integrative Care (NHS CIC), in Glasgow.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>MBSR instructors</title><p>The MBSR instructors were used to working together. Over the previous 3 years they had regularly taught weekly mindfulness groups to multimorbid people with a variety of LTCs (including MS) as part of their routine clinical responsibilities. However, neither instructor had taught groups exclusively for people with MS.</p><p>The first MBSR instructor had a clinical background in General Practice since 1983 and worked full time as a Specialty Doctor at the NHS CIC. She had completed teacher training in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in 2005, via the University of Bangor, and had been teaching mindfulness regularly since then. She had also completed residential MBSR training in with Jon-Kabat-Zinn, in the USA in 2011, and regularly attended training retreats in MBCT and Vipasana meditation. She had a teaching qualification in Pranayama and Iyengar Yoga. She regularly attended one-to-one mindfulness clinical supervision and had a longstanding daily practice.</p><p>The second MBSR instructor also came from a General Practice background, completing her clinical training in 1994. She qualified as a mindfulness teacher in 2011 via the University of Bangor.

</p><p>However, the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] suggests that any such measures should be flexible during the early stages of evaluation of a novel intervention/context.

Nevertheless, taking the findings from the current study into account, there is now a growing body of evidence to suggest likely effectiveness of MBIs for treating anxiety in MS. The interim benefits reported on depression following MBSR in this study and one other high quality RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] are also encouraging, but the decline in effect seen at study endpoints suggest that there may be scope for judicious tailoring of MBSR to render beneficial treatment effects more stable. One such measure that has worked in MBCT for depression is the provision of post-completion &#x02018;drop-in&#x02019; sessions, where beneficial effects have persisted for up to 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>We also measured mindfulness and self-compassion, thought key components in how MBIs work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. No previous studies in people with MS have assessed the impact of MBI training on levels of mindfulness. Meta-analysis suggests that improvements in mindfulness may mediate improved mental health in non-MS populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

Having more self-compassion is associated with a greater resilience to anxiety, depression and stress in other LTCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and may also make a small contribution to better mental health in people with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>We followed the MRC guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The small size of the study is a limitation, but is acceptable in feasibility work. The high proportion of female patients in this study (92%) is notable when compared with previous research in this area (range 69&#x02013;100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). This could reflect the higher incidence of stress-related mental health comorbidities in women with MS in Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], a greater stigma among men towards reporting mental health concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], or that men may be less willing to participate in research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>We adjusted for common confounding variables in this study, along with those found to differ significantly at baseline. As this study was not powered to detect significant baseline differences, the findings from our analyses must thus be treated with caution (for example other variables such as baseline between group differences in diagnoses of anxiety and depression, antidepressant usage, disease activity and/or disease modifying drug (DMD) therapy could conceivably also impact on stress levels and effectiveness and should thus be considered in a future definitive study, powered to detect significant differences on these variables).</p><p>Evidence of effectiveness cannot be reliably determined in a small, unpowered sample. In this scenario, significance levels are unreliable, and observed beneficial treatment effects on stress, mood, and cognition can, at best, only be seen as an indication of likely effectiveness in a future phase three trial. Further, the novel findings of subjective improvements in cognitive function could be better contextualised if combined with a more objective neuropsychological assessment. Criticisms of commonly used objective measures of cognitive function are that they are either too short, too long, too generic, fail to detect deficits, or require to be administered by an expert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) is an internationally validated, standardised assessment tool with good reliability and validity, with the added advantage over other neuropsychological tests that it can be administered by a non-expert and could thus be used in a definitive phase three study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>The follow-up period post MBSR was relatively short in this study i.e. 3 months, and a future phase three trial could assess whether MBIs might have more lasting effects. Further optimisation work will help with the creation of a bespoke MBI for people with MS, which may improve recruitment and render beneficial treatment effects more stable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Delivering MBSR to people with MS in a NHS setting is feasible. We achieved our recruitment target of 50 people within the specified time limits. Levels of retention i.e. completion rates for outcome measures were good post-intervention, and at follow-up. Encouraging improvements were noted on various outcome measures, in particular anxiety, with most measures having acceptable levels of missing values. However, initial beneficial effects on stress and depression were greatly diminished at study endpoint and only 60% of participants completed MBSR, suggesting that further optimisation is required before proceeding to a phase-3 definitive trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
