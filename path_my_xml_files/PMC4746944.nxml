Children in the control group were selected from outpatients without appreciable cardiovascular risk factors who were referred for routine annual checkup or from healthy brothers and sisters of selected patients.</p><p>All subjects were nonsmokers, non-pregnant and without any history of systematic disease.</p><p>This work complies with the ethical standards of the relevant national guidelines on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008, and has been approved by the Regional Bioethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Written informed consent was obtained from all selected patients or their parents.</p><p>Basal characteristics of the studied patients were recorded from their medical files. Selected patients recalled, a pediatric cardiologist examined them clinically. Endothelial function of studied subjects during the first visit was evaluated by FMD and IMT measurement using vascular Doppler ultrasonography (Eko 7 machine by Samsung Medison Company and by a 7 MHz vascular transducer).</p><p>Vitamin C (Osvah Pharmaceutical Company, Tehran, Iran) was administrated for all studied groups with a dose of 250 mg, daily for 1 month. After that period studied subjects underwent vascular Doppler ultrasonography for the second FMD and IMT measurement. Mean of studied endothelial parameters before and after vitamin C administration was compared in each studied groups.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Endothelial function measurement</title><p>Weight, height and blood pressure of the studied children was measured before procedure. The subjects were recommended to do not exercise or use caffeine, acid folic, nitrate, high fat diet, for at least 24 hours before the procedure and do not take vitamin C (as supplement).</p><p>The procedure was performed in the morning after 8 hours of fasting, in a temperature-controlled room at 25&#x000b0;C in a supine position.</p><p>All subjects were examined by the same physician, who was blinded to their clinical conditions at the time of examination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>FMD measurement</title><p>The measurement was assessed based on the guidelines of the International Brachial Artery Reactivity Task Force. Studied subjects were examined in the supine position with their forearm placed in a semi open splint. The high-frequency (7 MHz) vascular transducer (EKO 7 by Samsung Medison Company) was fixed with a stereotactic probe-holding device. In order to make a flow stimulus by reactive hyperemia a pediatric BP cuff was fixed on the wrist of the subjects and radial artery was imaged in a longitudinal plane 5 cm distal from the antecubital fossa. After performing a baseline rest image, the blood flow velocity was estimated by time averaging the Doppler signal from a mid artery sample volume. Cuff deflation was followed by a brief high-flow state after a 5-minute interval of ischemia. After cuff deflation, the image of the radial artery and the Doppler signal recorded alternatively for 5 minutes with 20-second intervals. After the procedure, obtained images saved on the EKO 7 hard disk and analyzed. Distance measurements of radial artery were made at maximum systolic extension. FMD was analyzed by a pediatric cardiologist.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>IMT measurement</title><p>Carotid arteries were imaged using a high-frequency (7 MHz) vascular linear transducer. Subjects were in the supine position with the head turned 45&#x000b0; away from the scanner. Two segments including the distal 1 cm of the common carotid artery and its bifurcation were evaluated on each side. Measurements of the two segments were performed at 2-mm intervals at near and far wall and maximum and mean of IMT were calculated for them. Sonography and reading were assessed by a pediatric cardiologist.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Obtained data analyzed using SPSS version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software and paired t-test and ANOVA tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study 18 patients with CRF and 19 normal children as the control group were studied.

Our findings indicated that vitamin C have significantly proper effect on reducing IMT in both patients and control group. FMD increased in two studied groups but it was only significantly different in the control group.</p><p>Several studies reported ED among patients with CRF. Hussein <italic>et al</italic>. in Egypt and Civilibal <italic>et al</italic>. in Turkey indicated that pediatric patients with CRF have impaired endothelial function and are at higher risk of CVD.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Ece <italic>et al</italic>. in Turkey investigated markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and early cardiovascular damage in 29 children with CRF. Their results showed that studied population had increased LVM and IMT values. They concluded that children with CRF have increased oxidative stress and inflammation and early cardiovascular abnormalities.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In this study patients with CRF had lower FMD and higher IMT than control group. Though it was not statistically significant, it may be due to small sample size but the differences especially for IMT had trend to be significant.</p><p>On the other hand, there are evidences which indicate that renal dysfunction is associated with a decreased level of plasma vitamin C. Takahashi and colleagues in Japan have reported that children with CKD have lower level of vitamin C which could lead to ED by increasing oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Deicher <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that decreased vitamin C level in hemodialaysis patients is associated with CVD.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>There are evidences which support the effectiveness of vitamin C administration on improving ED and decrease the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Though the pathophysiological role of vitamin C in this field and in this group of patients was not completely determined, but it is suggested that vitamin C could improve endothelial function through two possible mechanisms. First as an antioxidant agent, it could increase nitrous oxide (NO) bioavailability and reduce oxidative stress. It could restore cellular uptake of L-arginine and consequently improve endothelial-dependent relaxation.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In this study we evaluated the effect of vitamin C on ED of children with CRF using IMT and FMD measurement. IMT and FMD measurements are reliable, reproducible and noninvasive technique to assess endothelial function as well as detecting and monitoring progression of atherosclerosis.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>There were few studies on the effectiveness of vitamin C in patients with CRF and there was not similar study in pediatrics population.</p><p>Cross <italic>et al</italic>. in the UK have reported that acute intra-arterial use of vitamin C increased endothelial-dependent dilation in the resistance vasculature of predialysis and hemodialaysis renal failure patients.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Dupont <italic>et al</italic>. in the USA showed that cutaneous vasodilation impairment, which is found in stage 3-4 of CKD, normalized by local infusion of ascorbic acid.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>In our study, IMT decreased significantly in children with CRF after vitamin C use and FMD increased but it was not statistically significant. It may be due to small sample size or shorter duration of vitamin C administration.</p><p>ED was more significant in CRF patients with AV fistula. In addition, IMT changes were more significant among CRF patients with AV fistula. The findings could be justified that the effect of vitamin C administration would be more appropriate in CRF patients with higher grade of CRF. Significant changes of IMT and FMD among hemodialysis patients than others also could be a confirmatory explanation for the above-mentioned justification.</p><p>The limitation of current study was small sample size specially for evaluating different subgroups of CRF patients i.e. hypertensive, with and without fistula, anemic and non-anemic and on different treatment strategies. Another limitation is that we did not measured baseline vitamin C in the studied population.</p><p>The findings of this interventional trial have demonstrated that vitamin C could have protective effect on ED of patients with CRF possibly in those with severe form of the disease but for obtaining more conclusive results larger sample size is needed. It is recommended to study the effectiveness of vitamin C on different markers of renal failure and their relationship with endothelial markers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>The Isfahan University of Medical Sciences supported financially this study.
