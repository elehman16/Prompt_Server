Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been proven to be effective in improving quality of life, psychological functioning and physical activity, and national guidelines recommend that PR should be offered and made available to all those with COPD.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The standard provision of PR is a supervised package of exercise and education usually twice a week for a minimum of 6&#x02005;weeks, which is either hospital or community based, and supported by a home exercise programme.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, the barriers to uptake of a PR programme have previously been reported<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which included transport, the perceived benefits of PR, disruption to usual routine and the timings of programmes. These factors play some contribution as to why programmes have poor attendance and adherence resulting in many of the programmes reporting dropout rates as high as 50%.</p><p>Ongoing changes and challenges means that the National Health Service (NHS) and the services it provides need to adapt to take advantage of and capitalise on the opportunities that new technologies and treatments can offer to patients.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is a growing evidence base for the use of the internet in the management of many chronic conditions in areas as diverse as the management of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, depression, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, chronic pain and epilepsy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;11</xref> Computer-tailored interventions have been shown to effectively improve health behaviours such as physical activity<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and be cost-effective.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The provision of a menu-based and patient-centred service is said to be essential to improve uptake and completion rates within cardiac rehabilitation (CR).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, at present there is no choice within PR. A web-based PR programme has the potential to be a novel and effective approach to increasing patient choice in the mode of delivery and setting of rehabilitation (especially to those patients who decline the offer of conventional PR) while simultaneously increasing the capacity of PR.</p><p>We have previously developed and described &#x02018;Active Your Heart&#x02019; (AYH)<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> which is an interactive web-based CR programme that has proved to be very popular with patients. Brough <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> reported a significant improvement in exercise capacity and quality of life in patients that completed the web-based programme. Following the success of AYH, we have developed a prototype website based on the educational content of the &#x02018;SPACE for COPD&#x02019; self-management workbook. SPACE (Self-management Programme of Activity, Coping and Education) for COPD<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> is a structured programme of exercise, education and psychosocial support which has been developed by our institution as a collaboration between experts, patients and carers and has been awarded a Crystal Mark for Clarity by the Plain English Campaign.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The aim of this feasibility study was to provide quantitative, economic and technical data to see if an interactive web-based PR programme was a feasible alternative compared with conventional PR. This included:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Gathering information regarding the recruitment rate of patients who were eligible and willing to be randomised to either the web-based programme or the conventional rehabilitation programme, and to monitor retention and dropout through all stages of the programmes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comparing a variety of clinical outcomes between a web-based programme and a conventional rehabilitation PR programme in order to test out the various components of the intervention and identify any technical or other difficulties that may be inherent in the delivery of a web-based PR programme.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Eligibility criteria for participants</title><p>Eligible participants had an established diagnosis of COPD defined as a forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>), postbronchodilation of &#x0003c;80% and a predicted ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub> to forced vital capacity of 0.70 and a Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> of between 2 and 5. Patients had to be willing to partake in either arm of the study. Access to the internet for more than 3&#x02005;months, the ability to navigate around a variety of websites (eg, uses online shopping or banking websites) and regular use of email was required. Patients also had to be able to read and write in English.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they were unable to participate in the exercise component of the rehabilitation programme due to other comorbidities or had done PR in the previous 12&#x02005;months.

The exercise programme consisted of aerobic and strength training. The intensity of the walking was based on their performance on the baseline maximal shuttle walking exercise tests and prescribed at 85% of baseline performance. An exercise target was set by the patient to achieve and work towards each week. Strength training consisted of upper and lower limb resistance training with hand-held weights. Patients recorded how difficult they found the walking and strength training using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Both the walking time and strength were progressed maintaining a VAS rating of 4&#x02013;7. Throughout the duration of the web-based programme the patient's progress was reviewed online and there was weekly contact between the patient and the rehabilitation specialist via email or telephone using a standardised proforma. Motivational interviewing techniques were used by the healthcare professional to ensure that patients were helped to progress their exercise programme in the aerobic and strength training appropriately and to answer any queries that arose.</p><p>The educational content of the web-based programme was based on the &#x02018;SPACE for COPD&#x02019; manual. Patients worked through the website content at their own pace; however, certain milestones needed to be completed or achieved before further content could be accessed in order to ensure appropriate progress through the programme (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material</xref> for description of the different stages on the website). It was anticipated from previous work<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> that it would take &#x0223c;6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks to work through the online programme.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013682.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary material</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-013682supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Standard care group&#x02014;conventional PR programme</title><p>Patients randomised to standard care started conventional rehabilitation according to the standard care at their referred site which was either hospital or community based. The hospital programme consisted of 7&#x02005;weeks (4&#x02005;weeks supervised; 3&#x02005;weeks unsupervised) in total. Patients were advised to not attend if they were having an exacerbation. Any sessions missed could be completed later due to it being a rolling programme. In the community-based programmes, patients could attend a maximum of 12 sessions within the closed programme.</p><p>Conventional PR programmes at either referral site consisted of twice weekly sessions each lasting 2&#x02005;hours which were divided into an hour for exercise training and an hour for an education session covering a variety of relevant self-management topics. The exercise training consisted of aerobic and resistance training. A training walking speed was prescribed from the incremental (ISWT)<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and endurance (ESWT)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> shuttle walk tests performed at baseline. Walking time was progressed maintaining a moderate-to-severe breathlessness as defined by the BORG dyspnoea scale.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Patients were instructed to walk daily at their PR class training speed. Strength training consisted of upper and lower limb resistance training with dumbbells which was based on 1 repetition maximum. Progression was achieved by maintaining a BORG perceived exertion<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> rating of 13&#x02013;15. Static cycling was completed, if tolerated, and intensity was prescribed on the basis of the patient's breathlessness and perceived exertion symptom scores. Patients were encouraged to also complete a home exercise programme on the days when they did not attend rehabilitation classes and to fill in an exercise diary. This enabled the patients' progress to be monitored. The educational sessions were conducted as group sessions and delivered by experts in their field. Topics included medication, relaxation skills, chest clearance and breathlessness management, and energy conservation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>All the measures used and collected in the trial including clinical (ISWT and ESWT; Chronic Respiratory disease Questionnaire-Self-Reported (CRQ-SR),<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> COPD Assessment Tool (CAT),<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> PR Adapted Index of Self-Efficacy (PRAISE),<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire (BCKQ),<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Euro-QOL (EQ-5D-5L),<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> patient cost questionnaire<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and non-clinical have previously been described in the study protocol.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Clinical measures were performed at baseline and repeated again at the discharge assessment following completion of either rehabilitation programme (usually &#x0223c;6&#x02013;7&#x02005;weeks after starting the programme) and were conducted by a research physiotherapist who was blinded to treatment group allocation. Patients were classed as a completer if they had reached stage 3 or above of the web programme, achieving 75% of the programme which is standard in clinical practice for those attending classes.

Any serious adverse events were reported to the sponsor. A serious adverse event was defined as an acute exacerbation of their COPD that resulted in a hospital admission. In order to assess the patients' ability to exercise safely, an exercise safety quiz was completed online before being able to progress onto stage 2 of the programme which involved exercising. Patients were then monitored online and through the weekly contacts.</p><p>Qualitative and physical activity data are to be presented in future publications.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Quantitative data analysis</title><p>Data were entered and stored on a secure web-based system (REDCAP) which has discrepancy management features.

Issues such as transport and locality still persist for many patients some of which could be addressed by improving accessibility. Data from a recent national COPD audit<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> suggest that the capacity of PR programmes is inadequate to meet the demand or need. Alternative or more flexible provisions of PR programmes therefore need to be considered.</p><p>Voncken-Brewster <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> tested the effectiveness of a web-based computer-tailored COPD self-management intervention on physical activity and smoking behaviour. There were no statistically significant effects on health-related behavioural or clinical outcomes. They state this may have been attributed to the low exposure to the application and engagement with the programme has been shown to be crucial for the effectiveness of computer-tailored interventions.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Another randomised controlled trial by Pinnock <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> found telemonitoring to not reduce hospital admission or improve patients' quality of life. The data from this feasibility study aimed to evaluate the application of an exercise intervention as well as promoting self-management.</p><p>The data from this study suggest that an interactive web-based programme has the potential to be a feasible and acceptable alternative when compared with conventional PR. Although both groups improved in the ISWT, the change was not significant and did not meet the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) of 48&#x02005;m.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The baseline ISWT scores in both groups were higher in these patients compared with those seen normally in our clinical service and therefore may account for the small change in the ISWT score. More patients were MRC 2 in the PR group than are normally referred to the PR service. The change in ISWT may also have been affected due to the structure of the PR programme which was 7&#x02005;weeks (4&#x02005;weeks supervised; 3&#x02005;weeks unsupervised) for the majority of the patients and did not meet the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> of a minimum of 12 supervised sessions. These guidelines were not published until after the trial had started. Similar improvements in time (3&#x02005;min) were seen in the ESWTs for both groups. Health-related quality of life, measured by the CRQ-SR, appeared to improve significantly, both groups exceeding the MCID for the CRQ-D of 0.5. High dropout rates in the web arm of the study may have influenced the outcome measures of exercise capacity. The study would suggest, like other rehabilitation studies that using a health-related quality of life measure is a feasible primary outcome measure. However, despite recruiting a large number of participants, the high dropout rate and challenges experienced around a technology-based intervention based on the findings of this study, would potentially make future non-inferiority trials using the CRQ harder; a larger sample size of patients in each group would be required. The use of preference-based randomised controlled trials could be more appealing to patients, therefore improving recruitment and retention rates.</p><p>Adherence to web-based programmes can vary due to many reasons ranging from lack of time, to refusing to complete the programme. Several features have been identified that could help to improve adherence to a web-based programme: making the programme tailored to the user and interactive<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> as well as allowing users to set personal goals.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>Initial withdrawals in this study appeared to have been at the exercise stages of the web programme as there was a higher dropout at stage 2. This component of the web programme was simplified based on participant feedback. Both the length of time to complete stage 2 (aerobic training) and 3 (strength and aerobic training) were shortened and completion rates improved. Similar numbers withdrew after this modification; however, these were due to exacerbations, other problems from comorbidities and technology problems meaning patients did not even register or come for their introduction. Although more patients withdrew from the web arm of the study (12 from the PR group vs 29 from the web group), there were no significant differences between the groups in any outcome; those that did complete the website, as well as those that had completed conventional PR.</p><p>Priorities around the use of technology within the NHS are changing<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but this will not be without its challenges. A previous evaluation to explore the use of technology within a COPD population which was carried out by our institution found although patients owned a computer or mobile phone, usage was limited and was predominantly within the younger age range.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Seventeen per cent of interested participants in this study did not have access to the internet and highlights the need to assess access as well as the competency of patients being able to use the web prior to starting the web programme. The majority of patients that entered the study expressed a preference for randomisation to the website arm of the study, showing that there is a desire for this type of intervention. Although a greater proportion of patients withdrew from the classes, stating that they would have preferred the web-based programme, it is not known if they would have engaged with and completed the programme. The study showed a lack of engagement in technology in this particular population despite a great deal of patient-user involvement in the site development.</p><p>The trial design meant that patients needed to be willing to be randomised to either group, whereas in clinical practice it is more likely that patients will have a preference due to genuine choice or practical difficulties that precludes access to supervised rehabilitation programmes. This patient choice or preference may improve uptake and completion of a PR programme. By exploring alternative forms, such as a web-based programme, patients that potentially would decline standard PR are provided with an alternative form of intervention. Alternative formats of CR, including home-based CR such as the Heart Manual and the Angina Plan,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> have been shown to be an effective alternative to conventional CR. In both randomisation groups, when patients were asked, the highest per cent stated their preference was the web programme. Those randomised to the conventional PR classes who were less disabled (MRC 2) and younger would have preferred the web programme, whereas the older patients preferred to attend the classes. Studies have shown that most patients with coronary heart disease who are still working prefer to follow a home-based rehab programme instead of conventional supervised classes.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>Web-based rehabilitation may inform the design of future trials. The data collected in this study appear to have a role in the delivery of PR. However, a stratified approach may be needed based on patient need and choice of delivery to achieve the best outcomes for patients and deliver a cost-effective model of rehabilitation for a wider population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) Programme (grant reference number PB-PG-0711-25127).
