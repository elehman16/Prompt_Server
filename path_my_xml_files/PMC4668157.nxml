weight distribution and stability of the elderly. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty elderly
persons were randomly divided into an experimental group which performed core
strengthening exercises, and a control group which performed standard strengthening
exercises for 8 weeks. A Tetrax Interactive Balance System was used to evaluate the weight
distribution index (WDI) and the stability index (SI). [Results] The experimental group
showed a significant improvement in terms of WDI and the SI. However, the control group
showed no significant improvement in either. [Conclusion] Core muscle stability training
should be considered as a therapeutic method for the elderly to improve their WDI, and SI,
and as a fall prevention measure.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Core muscle stability training</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Weight distribution</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>As the human body gets older, proprioception and muscle strength weaken, and reflexes in
reaction to sudden changes decline due to the physiological effects of aging. These
phenomena affect the body&#x02019;s balance ability and increase the likelihood of bruising and
injury from falls<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A person&#x02019;s ability to
balance remains stable until the age of 40 but declines gradually thereafter<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, in order to maintain or increase
muscle strength and improve balance and gait velocity, elderly people should engage in
various forms of exercise, such as muscle strengthening exercises, stretching exercises,
aerobic exercises, and walking<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among
these exercises, core strengthening exercises are often used as a rehabilitation exercise
for athletes. In Europe, they are used as an intervention to prevent and treat stroke, and
spine and posture revision, and to address lumbar and cervical pain. Core strengthening
exercises are helpful muscle strengthening exercises, joint exercises, and equilibrium
training, because they help the development of flexibility and stability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, core strengthening exercises are
effective for lumbar stabilization and motor control training, so they are widely used as a
key exercise for maintaining body balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the case of elderly people, bruising from a fall can increase the death rate related to
fracture, immobility, and injury. The death rate associated with a bruise caused by a fall
is eight times higher in the elderly than in children; the resulting hospitalization rate is
also 10 times higher<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In Korea, the incidence rate of accidents or injuries involving the elderly is increasing
every year. Among the elderly people who experience bruising, 56.7% are aged over 65. The
average period an elderly bruising victim spends in hospital ranges from 8 to 15 days<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. An experiment involving elderly people
living in a nursing home showed that the risk factors for bruising include the following:
decreased flexibility, low extremity strength and visual function, lower muscle tension, and
weakened knee joints. In general, the issue of bruising in the elderly as a result of falls
is a subject of interest for many researchers, but there is a need for more studies offering
various perspectives on exercises aimed at preventing elderly bruising.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study subjects were thirty elderly people who were inpatients at C University
Hospital. The experiment was conducted after the study objectives and methods had been
explained to the subjects and they had signed a consent form agreeing to participation in
the study in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. In
general, the participants were free of musculoskeletal system problems, capable of
independent walking, had no vestibular sense problems, and had sufficient cognitive
ability. The physical characteristics of the subjects were as follows. The experimental
group had a mean age of 75.2&#x02005;years, an average height of 160.1&#x02005;cm, and an average weight
of 58.7&#x02005;kg. Seven of the patients were female and three were male. The control group had a
mean age of 74.7&#x02005;years, an average height of 161.8&#x02005;cm, and an average weight of 60.2&#x02005;kg.
Six patients were female and four were male.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The control group performed standard strengthening exercises. Specifically, the subjects
were asked to alternately perform upper and lower strengthening exercises. The
experimental group performed co-contractions of the transverse abdominis, multifidus, and
pelvic floor muscle exercises to make a bridging position. This position was maintained as
a cross-extended knee joint. They were then asked to lie face down and maintain a crawling
position while co-contracting the transverse abdominis, multifidus, and pelvic floor
muscles. After that, they were requested to stretch one arm and the opposite leg, and
repeat this exercise using the opposite arm and leg. Each position was practiced for five
minutes per set, and there were a total of three sets. The total exercise time was 30
minutes a day, 5 times per week and the intervention lasted for 8 weeks. It appeared that
the fluctuation of the weight % on the force plate increased as the weight distribution
increased and that the degree of imbalance increased as the stability index increased. In
this study, SPSS V 17.0 was used for the statistical analysis of the data. The paired
t-test was used to examine within group differences, and the differences in values between
the groups were analyzed with the independent t-test. A significance level of &#x00251;=0.05 was
chosen.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The WDI score of the experimental group improved from 6.54&#x000b1;1.48 to 4.04&#x000b1;1.12 and the SI
score improved from 15.85&#x000b1;2.10 to 13.07&#x000b1;1.78 (p&#x0003c;0.05). The WDI score of the control group
decreased from 6.58&#x000b1;3.17 to 6.68&#x000b1;1.80 and the SI score decreased from 15.81&#x000b1;3.35 to
16.61&#x000b1;3.58 (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>The change in the WDI score was &#x02212;2.14&#x000b1;0.36 in the experimental group and 0.22&#x000b1;1.37 in the
control group. The change in the SI score was &#x02212;2.78&#x000b1;0.32 in the experimental group and
0.8&#x000b1;0.23 (p&#x0003c;0.05) in the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A study was carried out of the effect of exercises in addressing bodily changes due to
aging, and it was concluded that the physical condition and ability of elderly people should
be assessed and exercises assigned accordingly<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies found that regular exercises, lumbar muscle
strengthening exercises, and balance exercises are effective at preventing injury in the
elderly<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and enhance the sensory motor
system functions needed to maintain body safety<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For elderly people to enjoy a healthy and happy life free from worries about accidents
resulting in bruising, they need both muscle strength and balance ability. There is a
considerable volume of existing research on posture and balance control, as well as related
disorders<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Core strengthening
exercises recover the postural control function of the body and increase the range of
motion, and they can therefore be considered appropriate exercises for the elderly. Among
the exercises that prevent bruising, posture training and dynamic balance training were
found to be the most effective at decreasing the incidence of bruising<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, it was found that the weight support and
balance of the treatment group who went through the core strengthening exercises showed a
statistically significant improvement (p&#x0003c;0.05). The lumbar muscle is crucial in daily
life, allowing the body to maintain various positions; therefore, maintaining enough lumbar
muscle strength and stamina is very important. In this regard, it has been reported that
lack of co-contraction of the lumbar muscle is strongly related to lumbar instability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. To prevent dysfunction of the trunk
muscle, which causes lumbar instability, core strengthening exercises must be practiced<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Motor learning improves muscle reflexes
and accelerates proprioception, which affects balance control, so core strengthening
exercises are particularly important for improving balance ability. In this study, the
elderly participants who practiced core strengthening exercises showed statistically
significant improvements in balance ability. Thus, it is evident that core strengthening
exercises are effective at improving balance ability. In summary, this study conducted core
strengthening exercises to improve the balance ability of elderly subjects. Its aim was to
identify an effective exercise method which prevents elderly people from getting bruises as
a result of falling.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by Wonkwang Health Science University in 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Steinweg</surname><given-names>KK</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The changing approach to falls in the
