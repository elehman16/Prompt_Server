After propofol administration, the IOP decreased markedly in the control group below the baseline values to a level comparable to that level attained in the magnesium groups. The IOP measurements were increased after endotracheal intubation by 2 and 5 min in all groups. These values of IOP in the control group were significantly higher than that of the magnesium groups and greater than the baseline value of the control group; meanwhile, the rise of IOP in the magnesium groups limited below its baseline values, and there was no significant difference between both magnesium groups. The MgSO<sub>4</sub> premedication attenuated the pressor response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation as evident by significantly decreased MAP and HR after endotracheal intubation at 2 and 5 min after intubation as compared to the control group without significant differences between both of the magnesium groups.</p><p>Up to our best acquaintance and research, there are no adequately designed clinical trials evaluated the effect of intravenous infusion of MgSO<sub>4</sub> premedication on IOP, especially before the induction of general anesthesia and after endotracheal intubation.

They attributed these effects to significantly shorter onset time of muscle relaxation as compared to other groups by decreasing presynaptic acetylcholine release. Onset time of muscle relaxation of MgSO<sub>4</sub> group was significantly shorter than that of other groups and equivalent only with that of large-dose rocuronium group (0.9 mg/kg).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Many studies have shown that 30&#x02013;60 mg/kg of MgSO<sub>4</sub> can be used safely without critical manifestations of hypermagnesemia after extended time MgSO<sub>4</sub> infusion.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>A regimen of intravenous MgSO<sub>4</sub> infusion at a dose of 50 mg/kg as a bolus followed by 15 mg/kg/h intravenous infusion for hours until the end of surgical procedures was used by Ryu <italic>et al</italic>. to test the therapeutic effects of magnesium and the possibility of symptomatic hypermagnesemia.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] They prove the efficiency of this regimen to attain the desired therapeutic effect with an acceptable level of safety as serum magnesium level did not exceed the therapeutic level (2.5&#x02013;5 mEq/L) determined by Wacker and Parisi.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Our data support these findings as 50 mg/kg MgSO<sub>4</sub> used safely without any reported signs and symptoms of MgSO<sub>4</sub> toxicity; however, these results should be accommodated cautiously as the current trial was not designed or powered for this purpose.</p><p>In a brief clinical report, De Vore and Asrani concluded that fasciculation caused by succinylcholine administration were very unlikely to occur in pregnancy-induced hypertension patients who were pretreated by MgSO<sub>4</sub>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Four decades ago, Meyers <italic>et al</italic>. reported that IOP rise that accompanies succinylcholine injection was not related to the existence or absence of muscle fasciculation.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] They attributed the succinylcholine-induced rise of IOP to its slow tonic effect on extraocular muscles dissimilar to its effects on skeletal muscles and vasodilatation of choroidal vessels. Their data demonstrated that the pretreatment with nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers was not efficient in preventing the succinylcholine-induced rise of IOP contrary to the findings of Miller <italic>et al</italic>. a decade earlier.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The conclusions suggested by Meyers <italic>et al</italic>. were reinforced by the work of Bowen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>IOP changes observed in both MgSO<sub>4</sub> groups were similar in the current trial. Hence, both the doses are equally effective in attenuating the rise of IOP by succinylcholine and endotracheal intubation and produced significant fall in MAP and HR. Although the comparable effects in M1 and M2 groups regarding MAP and HR changes, two patients in Group M2 (5.13%) developed excessive hypotension, treated by ephedrine, and excluded from the final analysis. Hence, the use of 30 mg/kg MgSO<sub>4</sub> could be more appropriate as it has the same effect as 50 mg/kg on IOP with probably better preservation of MAP and without the risk of excessive hypotension.</p><p>Considering the current findings, it is wise to avoid succinylcholine administration in open eye trauma patients due to its unfavorable effects on IOP that could endanger the eye integrity, but fair clinical judgment may occasionally necessitate succinylcholine administration in emergency situations compromising life where the eminent risks outweigh possible clinical benefits. We suggest that pretreatment with MgSO<sub>4</sub> has many advantages over the other agents used for the same purpose, as it is a cheap, available drug with short-onset time, has extending effect with broad therapeutic range level, and could be used in emergency safely. MgSO<sub>4</sub> has a general anesthetic and central nervous system depressant abilities that could decrease anesthetic consumptions and has analgesic potentials that could limit opioid use. In addition, hasten-onset time of neuromuscular blocking drugs potentiate muscle relaxation and could reduce the required dose of intraoperative muscle relaxants. Pretreatment with MgSO<sub>4</sub> could induce controlled hypotension without reflex tachycardia, devoid opioid-related side effects and has a simple self-limited very unlikely adverse reaction.</p><p>As a limitation to the current trial, we have not determined magnesium serum level and serum catecholamine level to do a correlation with IOP changes and other hemodynamic variables. We recommend doing so in the future trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Intravenous administration of MgSO<sub>4</sub> before induction of anesthesia at doses 30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg was equally effective in preventing IOP upsurge accompanying the administration of succinylcholine and endotracheal intubation. MgSO<sub>4</sub> 30 mg/kg may be preferred for the prevention of rising in IOP to avoid possible undesirable detrimental hemodynamic effects.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and
