Some studies show the positive effects of spiritual intervention on postmenopausal women and depressed patients. However, there is inadequate experimental data for supporting the effectiveness of such interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives:</title><p>This study investigated the effect of a spiritual intervention on postmenopausal depression in women referred to urban healthcare centers in Isfahan, Iran.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on postmenopausal women referred to the healthcare centers of Isfahan. Sixty-four women with postmenopausal depression were assigned randomly into an experimental group (n = 32) and a control group (n = 32). The experimental group received eight sessions of spiritual intervention while the control group received two sessions of training on healthy diet for postmenopausal women. All subjects in the experimental group and the control group responded to the Beck&#x02019;s depression inventory at the start of the study, at the end of the fourth week, and a month after the last educational session. In addition to descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, independent samples t-test and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Before the intervention, the study groups did not differ significantly in terms of mean depression scores (20.76 &#x000b1; 4.61 vs. 19.58 &#x000b1; 5.27, P = 0.33). However, immediately after intervention and after one month, the mean depression scores of 11.01 &#x000b1; 7.85 and 11.21 &#x000b1; 9.23 in the experimental group were significantly lower than the control group (19.22 &#x000b1; 4.94 and 19.34 &#x000b1; 4.92, respectively) (P = 0.001). In repeated measures analysis of variance, Mauchly&#x02019;s test of sphericity was not significant (P = 0.672), and in the test of within-subjects effects, a significant interaction was found between the spiritual intervention and time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Spiritual intervention effectively could reduce the severity of postmenopausal depression. Considering the high prevalence of depression in postmenopausal women and the effectiveness, simplicity, and affordability of spiritual intervention, using such interventions in postmenopausal women is recommended.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Spirituality</kwd><kwd>Women</kwd><kwd>Menopause</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec146260"><title>1. Background</title><p>Menopause is of the most critical event in middle-aged women (<xref rid="A32990R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Due to hormonal changes at this time, women are confronted with several physiological, psychological, and social changes (<xref rid="A32990R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). These changes result in significant impacts on women&#x02019;s quality of life (<xref rid="A32990R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Depression is not only common after menopause (<xref rid="A32990R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), but also affects women more than men. It is estimated that lifetime incidence of major depressive disorder is 1.5 to 3 times more common in women than men (<xref rid="A32990R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The risk of depression in postmenopausal women is 3 to 4 times more than women before menopause (<xref rid="A32990R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The prevalence of postmenopausal depression is different in different parts of the world (<xref rid="A32990R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). No exact information is available on the prevalence of postmenopausal depression in Iran. However, a recent study in Babol estimated that 60% of postmenopausal women had symptoms of depression (<xref rid="A32990R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Although depression is a side effect of menopause, if not treated, it can cause serious complications (<xref rid="A32990R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Many strategies are available for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal depression including medicinal treatments and cognitive-behavioral therapies. Although chemical and synthetic antidepressants are the basis for the treatment of depression (<xref rid="A32990R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), they have numerous side effects including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, insomnia, blurred vision, dizziness, anxiety (<xref rid="A32990R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), decreased libido, gynecomastia, drowsiness, palpitations, headache, and skin rashes (<xref rid="A32990R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These side effects increased people&#x02019;s tendency toward using nonpharmacological therapies (<xref rid="A32990R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For many years, nonpharmacological methods such as family therapy, cognitive therapy, physical therapy, and complementary medicine have been used in the treatment of depression along with antidepressant medications (<xref rid="A32990R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Spiritual intervention is a branch of complementary medicine that seems to be useful in the treatment of psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety. According to mental health professionals, spirituality is one of the most important components and predictors of hope and psychological well-being (<xref rid="A32990R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Spirituality is a multidimensional concept that includes metaphysical dimensions, meaning and purpose of life, having a mission in life, sanctity of life, underestimation of worldly values, altruism, idealism, awareness of the tragedy, and spiritual rewards (<xref rid="A32990R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These dimensions play a major role in the treatment of despair, frustration, and depression. Despair is defined as the ability to deal with stressful situations. Depression is also characterized by the inability to enjoy. Focusing on control, meaning, identity, and communications, spirituality could strengthen the current psychotherapeutic methods (<xref rid="A32990R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and could increase hope, happiness, and optimism in depressed people through direct and indirect effects on his or her thoughts and attitudes (<xref rid="A32990R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It is believed that spiritual interventions not only help people select new purposes in life, such as growth, self-actualization, spiritual transcendence, and altruism, but also improve the mood of depressed patients through strategies such as prayer and meditation (<xref rid="A32990R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Evidence suggests that spiritual intervention has positive effects on people&#x02019;s mental health. In a study on the effect of spiritual intervention, Lotfi et al. have shown the positive effects of such interventions on improvement of the quality of life and reduction of distress in mothers of children with cancer (<xref rid="A32990R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In another study, Fallah et al. found that spiritual intervention significantly could promote the hope and psychological well-being in women with breast cancer (<xref rid="A32990R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Steffen et al. also have reported that spirituality is a strong factor in helping women deal with menopausal symptoms (<xref rid="A32990R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Several other studies also have confirmed the positive effects of spiritual intervention on postmenopausal women (<xref rid="A32990R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and depressed patients (<xref rid="A32990R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Although not studying postmenopausal women, Ghahari et al. investigated the effects of cognitive-behavioral and spiritual-religious interventions on anxiety and depression in women with breast cancer and reported that such interventions had no effect on depression (<xref rid="A32990R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Moreover, in a critical review of the effects of spiritual intervention, it was reported that there is inadequate experimental data for supporting the effectiveness of such interventions (<xref rid="A32990R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Considering the increase in women&#x02019;s life expectancy in recent decades, more women experience the menopause period and its consequences such as postmenopausal depression. Therefore, depressed patients would expend higher costs for their medical treatments.</p></sec><sec id="sec146261"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>Due to the controversies about the effects of spiritual intervention on postmenopausal depression, this study investigated the effect of spiritual intervention on postmenopausal depression in women referred to urban healthcare centers in Isfahan, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec146264"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><p>This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on 64 postmenopausal women referred to the healthcare centers of Isfahan from December to March 2014.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were an age range of 45 - 60 years, the ability to speak, read, and write in Farsi, a belief in Islam, nonsmoking, having no aphasia, no recognized psychological disorder (other than depression), lacking any communication problem, receiving no hormone therapy and no antidepressant medication, cessation of menstruation for at least a year, having no history of hysterectomy and ovariectomy, receiving no formal education on spirituality, and gaining a score higher than 13 from the Beck&#x02019;s depression inventory (BDI). Exclusion criteria included a participant&#x02019;s decision to withdraw from the study, absence from more than one educational session, experiencing any major psychosocial crises such as death of close relatives, divorce, and hospitalization, and getting a serious illness during the study.</p><p>The sample size was calculated based on a previous study by Aghajani et al. who investigated the effect of spiritual counseling on anxiety and depression and reported that after the intervention, the mean and standard deviation of depression in the control and intervention groups were 10.87 &#x000b1; 4.62 and 6.43 &#x000b1; 3.04, respectively (<xref rid="A32990R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Then, based on the mentioned study and considering &#x003b2; = 0.10, &#x003b1; = 0.01, S<sub>1</sub> = 4.62, S<sub>2</sub> = 3.04, &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub> = 10.87, and &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub> = 6.43, 24 subjects were estimated to be needed in each group. However, we recruited 32 subjects in each group to compensate for possible attrition.</p><p>A multistage sampling was performed to select the required subjects. In the first stage, a list of the governmental healthcare centers in Isfahan was prepared, and using a random-numbers table, two centers (the Imam Ali and Navab centers) were selected randomly among a total of 58 healthcare centers. Then, all existing files were examined to find families with menopausal women. In each center, 60 menopausal women initially were selected and invited to the clinic for eligibility assessment (including depression screening). Finally 32 women with inclusion criteria were selected from each healthcare center and through telephone were invited to attend a briefing session in the concerned center. If a woman did not participate in this session or decided to withdraw from the study, another eligible one was chosen randomly as a replacement. At the briefing session, all women completed the demographic questionnaire and were informed that they would be under investigation for two months, their psychological well-being would be assessed at least three times during the study, and after a short time they would be called to attend a few educational sessions. At the end of the briefing session, the 32 subjects in each healthcare center were allocated randomly into two groups. To this end, numbers from 1 to 32 were written on small pieces of papers and put in a cup, and everybody was asked to select a piece of paper and write her name on it. Accordingly, the subjects in each healthcare center were divided into two equal groups. Then, the subjects with odd and even numbers were allocated in the experimental and control groups, respectively.</p><p>Two days after the briefing session, the subjects in the experimental group were called and invited to participate in the spiritual intervention sessions. The spiritual intervention was conducted in eight sessions based on the model proposed by the American psychological association. However, the content of the sessions were modified according to Iran&#x02019;s Islamic culture (<xref rid="A32990R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The content of spiritual intervention sessions was prepared through consultation with 10 faculty members in the nursing school and five religious experts in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl37556">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl37556" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> The Outline of the Spiritual Intervention Implemented in Postmenopausal Women<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="fn40285">a</xref></sup></title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th style="vertical-align: bottom;text-align: left;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session</th><th style="vertical-align: bottom;text-align: left;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Title</th><th style="vertical-align: bottom;text-align: left;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description of the Meeting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr style="vertical-align: top;"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Discussion</title><p>At the end of this study, a significant difference was observed between the mean depression scores of the experimental and control groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that spiritual intervention was effective in reducing the severity of depression in postmenopausal women. This finding was consistent with results of several previous studies in Iran and overseas (<xref rid="A32990R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, the current study&#x02019;s finding was in contrast with results of Ghahari et al. who investigated the effects of spiritual intervention on a sample of women with breast cancer (<xref rid="A32990R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Such inconsistencies might be attributed to the great difference between the study populations because Ghahari et al. studied women with cancer, whereas the participants in the current study were postmenopausal women without any known organic disorders. Perhaps, many physical and psychological aftermaths of cancer significantly decreased the effects of the spiritual intervention.</p><p>Consistent with the current study, Moritz et al. (<xref rid="A32990R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and Rickhi et al. (<xref rid="A32990R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) also have reported that spiritual interventions not only expand peoples&#x02019; attitudes toward life but also improve the mood of depressed patients through a range of religious practices and beliefs (<xref rid="A32990R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). It is believed that spirituality and spiritual interventions will expand peoples&#x02019; awareness of the existential and metaphysical forces in the world and lead them to feel a profound harmony and unity with the universe, which consequently promote their hope and psychological well-being (<xref rid="A32990R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Spirituality seems to affect postmenopausal depression through direct and indirect mechanisms. In the direct mechanism, spirituality and spiritual interventions provide women the energy needed for adaptation with postmenopausal changes through strengthening or re-establishing the broken relationships between the person and God and other supportive resources. In indirect mechanism, spiritual interventions help the postmenopausal women make good choices in their present situation, choose a positive viewpoint toward the events, make optimistic interpretations, discover new meanings, and select new goals in their life, such as prosperity, spiritual growth, and altruism. Such new approaches to life would increase a sense of control over the crisis and restore the person to a condition of spiritual wholeness and psychological well-being (<xref rid="A32990R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="A32990R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It also has been shown that spirituality and spiritual interventions will empower people to cope with life issues (<xref rid="A32990R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), help them express the anger, frustration, and fears that often are experienced during a crisis (<xref rid="A32990R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), reduce their feelings of guilt, depression, anxiety, and anger, and consequently increase their inner peace, hope, and sense of health (<xref rid="A32990R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>People&#x02019;s spirituality is not separate from their physical and psychological aspects. Spirituality, as a shield, protects a person against stress and crisis and prevents the development of mental dysfunction (<xref rid="A32990R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="A32990R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, the positive effects of spiritual interventions are not limited to psychological well-being; it also is effective in prevention and improvement of a wide range of physical health problems and coping with chronic pain (<xref rid="A32990R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Therefore, nurses&#x02019; and midwives&#x02019; familiarity with such interventions would be helpful and enable them to help their clients such as postmenopausal women effectively cope with physical and psychological symptoms of menopause.</p><p>The small sample size and relatively short time follow-up might be considered as limitations to generalize the findings of this study. Therefore, replication of similar studies with larger sample sizes and longer periods of follow-up is recommended.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study showed the effectiveness of spiritual prevention on the severity of postmenopausal depression. Considering the high prevalence of depression in postmenopausal women and the effectiveness, simplicity, and affordability of spiritual intervention, using such interventions in postmenopausal women would be helpful in prevention and treatment of postmenopausal depression. Integration of the spiritual intervention implemented in this study in the routine healthcare services of postmenopausal women is recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This manuscript is part of a thesis for fulfillment of a master&#x02019;s degree in public health nursing.
