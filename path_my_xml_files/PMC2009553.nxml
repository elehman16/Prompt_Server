All patients were monitored sequentially for immunological competence and tumour-directed immunity, using a wide range of techniques, and the results were compared retrospectively with their clinical course. Three months after surgery, there was a trend towards inhibition of PHA-induced lymphocyte transformation by autologous serum in patients who developed recurrent tumour within 12 months after treatment. Serum from patients who remained tumour-free for 12 months did not inhibit stimulation of autologous lymphocytes by PHA. Apart from this test, no other immunological parameters correlated either with clinical course or with the type of treatment received.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00162-0009.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="497" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00162-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="498" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00162-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="499" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00162-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="500" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00162-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="501" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00162-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="502" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00162-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="503" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00162-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="504" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
