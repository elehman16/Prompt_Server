However, measurement-based care is underutilized in community mental health with data suggesting fewer than 20&#x000a0;% of behavioral health providers using this practice to inform treatment. It remains unclear whether standardized or tailored approaches to implementation are needed to optimize measurement-based care fidelity and penetration. Moreover, there is some suggestion that prospectively tailored interventions that are designed to fit the dynamic context may optimize public health impact, though no randomized trials have yet tested this notion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

There are now many evidence-based practices (EBPs) for the treatment of depression, but these practices remain largely unavailable to clients receiving services in community mental health centers (CMHCs). One reason for this paucity of EBPs is that CMHCs have few resources available for the intensive training plus consultation opportunities that appear necessary to retrain therapists in complex EBPs such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). Moreover, CMHC therapists bring unique values, attitudes, and skill sets that often misalign with EBPs such as CBT (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). The traditional approach to improving client care&#x02014;integrating a complex, multi-component EBP like CBT into care delivery&#x02014;is faced with significant challenges.</p><p>Conversely, measurement-based care (MBC) is a relatively simple evidence-based intervention framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. MBC, by definition, is the practice of using routine symptom measurement to inform treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. MBC is an evidence-based framework that has established effectiveness, broad reach, and multifaceted utility for enhancing usual care. In terms of effectiveness, MBC has been shown to improve depressed client outcomes with medium-effect size improvements over usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A meta-analysis indicated that MBC is particularly effective for improving outcomes when depressed clients are not demonstrating progress and by reducing client deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In terms of reach, MBC has greater reach potential than complex EBPs (e.g., CBT) that involve multiple theory-specific components targeted at single disorders. MBC has transtheoretical (relevant for use by clinicians regardless of background) <italic>and</italic> transdiagnostic (effective in enhancing usual care for numerous disorders) relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We conceptualize MBC as a minimal intervention needed for change (MINC; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) as it may optimize diverse usual care offerings for depression by enhancing the clinician&#x02019;s ability to target session interventions to clients&#x02019; unique symptom profiles and needs without requiring clinicians undergo months of retraining or shed their established theoretical orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In terms of utility, MBC aligns with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111&#x02013;148) by focusing on monitoring outcomes and satisfying meaningful use requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MBC presents a systematic approach for selecting and adapting interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] by flagging clients who are not improving and highlighting treatment targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The National Institute of Mental Health&#x02019;s (NIMH) nationwide public health clinical trial, the STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression), demonstrated MBC&#x02019;s utility for guiding both medication and psychotherapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. MBC also has established utility for promoting care coordination across disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Finally, MBC provides the basis for evaluating subsequent EBP implementation efforts through a foundation of outcome monitoring, which can be built into the soon to be ubiquitous electronic health record technologies.</p><p>Despite MBC&#x02019;s demonstrated effectiveness, reach, and utility, recent estimates suggest that fewer than 20&#x000a0;% of PhD level clinicians, master level clinicians, and psychiatrists routinely measure mental health symptoms prior to each session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. MBC has great potential for implementation success by design, yet barriers such as attitudes and feasibility exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and a gap remains between documented MBC effectiveness and use in practice. Previous attempts to integrate MBC into real world settings have focused on the development of standalone feedback systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Few studies have investigated the strategies necessary to integrate MBC into community mental health while (1) interfacing MBC with existing system requirements and clearly delineating the necessary implementation strategies and (2) taking into account stakeholder perceptions and needs when building the implementation approach.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Current study</title><p>The long-term goal of this research project is to provide generalizable and practical recommendations about strategies that promote MBC implementation, fidelity, and sustainment in CMHCs. To realize this goal, this study will test a standardized versus a tailored approach to implementing MBC at Centerstone, the largest provider of community-based mental health services in the USA. In this study, MBC will center on administration of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The PHQ-9 contains nine items that map directly onto the symptoms of a major depressive episode (DSM-IV TR; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) (e.g., trouble sleeping, little interest) and one item pertaining to impairment. The PHQ-9 thus provides a depression severity score capturing the previous 2 weeks. The PHQ-9 is one of the best-validated depression measures used in over 1000 research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The PHQ-9 has depression severity cutoff scores, is sensitive to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and is useful for weekly administration as an indicator of treatment effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Three diagnostic meta-analyses and a recent review have confirmed the good sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-9 in making a major depressive disorder diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Although touted as superior, tailored implementations have rarely been compared to standardized approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated a need to adapt EBPs to fit the specific context in which they are being implemented, particularly if they are to be sustained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This proposal reflects a movement in the field of implementation science to compare planned EBP adaptations to standardized EBP approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This study is a mixed methods implementation-effectiveness hybrid evaluation of a standardized versus tailored approach to MBC implementation on both clinician-level (e.g., MBC fidelity) and client-level (depression symptom change) outcomes. Central to this investigation is the need to identify contextual factors (e.g., attitudes, resources, process, etc.) that mediate MBC fidelity and optimize client outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary guiding model</title><p>The <italic>Framework for Dissemination</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] is the study&#x02019;s guiding conceptual model as it is derived from the best available implementation research and includes a three-phase evaluation process for use with academic-community partnerships (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The context of diffusion within this model highlights six domains theorized to determine successful implementation (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Box 1): (1) norms and attitudes, (2) structure and process, (3) resources, (4) policies and incentives, (5) networks and linkages, and (6) media and change agents.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Framework of dissemination</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2015_313_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The first three domains affect the willingness and ability of stakeholders to implement and sustain new interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Norms and attitudes represent the knowledge, expectations, beliefs and values of stakeholders (e.g., beliefs about a novel practice&#x02019;s value for an organization). Organizational structure and process reflect the way an organization is structured and operates to deliver services, including sets of characteristics such as organizational mission, size, governance and decision-making processes, and types of services offered. Resources include the varied forms of financial, physical, human, social, and political capital necessary to implement, spread, and sustain new practices. The other three domains relate to sources of information and influence through which potential adopters learn about and assess innovations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Policies and incentives constitute rewards or sanctions embedded in regulatory, funding, and organizational rules and programs that alter the costs and benefits of adopting a new service offering (e.g., financial bonuses, opportunities for enhancing training). Networks and linkages reflect the conduits among organizational and community participants that enable the flow of information and social support around potential adopters (e.g., communication with other sites or provider organizations, staff relationships). Finally, media and change agents represent specifically active sources of information with credibility related to new practices or services (e.g., external trainers, consultants, or internal champions, experts, and cheerleaders).</p><p>Taken together, the context of diffusion within the <italic>Framework for Dissemination</italic> organizes the evaluation of key contextual factors that may promote or hinder the implementation and sustainment of EBPs in CMHCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As such, this model will not only allow for an examination of contextual mediators of implementation success, but it will also be used to guide the tailored approach to implementation. Finally, the model will drive the three-phased evaluation process (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Row 2): (1) Capacity/Needs Assessment, (2) Implementation/ Process Evaluation, and (3) Outcome/Impact Evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Complementary testable model</title><p>This study will also test a recently proposed model, the <italic>Dynamic Sustainability Framework</italic> (DSF; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). The <italic>DSF</italic> promotes testing the longstanding hypothesis that program drift from &#x0201c;EBP fidelity&#x0201d; leads to a voltage drop in client outcomes when results are compared to effect sizes observed in efficacy trials. Chambers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] contend that an alternative hypothesis is important to consider, intentional prospective EBP adaptations informed by stakeholders and that account for relevant multilevel contextual factors may optimize implementation, sustainment, and client outcomes, particularly when adaptations are made iteratively to fit the dynamic context. The present study will test this model by comparing a standardized condition to a tailored condition. The standardized condition requires (via an implementation guideline) that MBC be integrated prior to each and every psychotherapy session according to its documented efficacy (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]), whereas the tailored condition will encourage implementation teams (comprised of CMHC clinicians, staff, administrators, and research staff) to adapt the MBC guideline and implementation by taking into account site-specific contextual factors. Consultation in the standardized condition will be offered to clinicians with the goal of achieving and maintaining MBC fidelity, whereas consultation in the tailored condition will support contextual and intervention changes to best fit the particular site. This study will address three specific aims.</p><p><italic>Aim 1</italic>: To compare the effect of standardized versus tailored MBC implementation on clinician-level (<italic>1a</italic>) and client-level (<italic>1b</italic>) outcomes. We hypothesize that tailored implementation will outperform standardized in terms of (<italic>H1a</italic>) MBC fidelity and (<italic>H1b</italic>) reducing client depression severity.</p><p><italic>Aim 2</italic>: To identify contextual mediators of MBC fidelity. We hypothesize that contextual mediators (e.g., structure, norms, etc.) will be leveraged in the tailored condition, but serve as barriers in the standardized condition.</p><p><italic>Aim 3</italic>: To explore the impact of MBC fidelity on client outcomes as a preliminary test of the Dynamic Sustainability Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We hypothesize that adapted MBC protocols (tailored condition) will outperform weekly administration of PHQ-9s (standardized condition) with respect to clinically significant change in depression severity from intake to week 12.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study context</title><p>Centerstone is the largest provider of community-based mental health services in the USA &#x02013; delivering psychotherapy, social work services, psychiatric services, and health promotion/disease prevention interventions to over 140,000 children, families, and adults each year. Centerstone has a physical presence in five-states (Tennessee, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Florida) and hosts the Knowledge Network (a national collective of mental health agencies focused on evidence-based care). Centerstone also maintains the largest repository of community mental health data in the USA&#x02014;containing data from over 350,000 patients, 20 million service records, and 2 million prescriptions. This &#x0201c;data warehouse&#x0201d; exists to facilitate mental health services research and populates an innovative analytics platform (Enlighten Analytic) to guide clinical decision-making and agency management. The clinical research, program evaluation, informatics, and grant writing arm of Centerstone&#x02014;Centerstone Research Institute (CRI)&#x02014;works with the clinical enterprise to prioritize the standardization of care through EBP delivery. Centerstone initiated a partnership with the principal investigator (CCL) in 2011 to develop clinical pathways for depression. A workgroup, comprised of three regional directors from clinics across Indiana and Tennessee and the CRI Director of Clinical Research, convened for monthly meetings over the course of 2 years. MBC was identified as the EBP of focus given its relevance and potential utility for improving client outcomes across diagnoses&#x02014;a necessary feature given the highly complex and comorbid presentations of Centerstone clientele.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conditions</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Overview of the blended implementation protocol</title><p>Both conditions (standardized and tailored) will employ the same blended protocol of implementation strategies (i.e., combination of discrete strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]) to remove time and resource confounds (e.g., ensure differences across conditions are not due to one having more training). The blended protocol of implementation strategies was defined using the guiding model (<italic>Framework for Dissemination</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]), the best available literature on promoting MBC implementation (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]), the MBC intervention framework, the partnership goals, and the pilot study results. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> depicts and describes the protocol and unique focus of the implementation strategies across conditions. The order of strategies will proceed as follows within each site&#x02019;s active implementation period: (1) embed PHQ-9 in electronic health record; (2) conduct needs assessment; (3) offer initial training; (4) set guidelines; (5) form implementation team; (6) conduct triweekly group consultation meetings. Following the active implementation phase, the implementation team will be encouraged to continue to meet to promote sustainment. A similar blended protocol of implementation strategies led to successful MBC implementation using the PHQ-9 with 90&#x000a0;% completion with over 30,000 clients each quarter at Group Health Cooperative, a consumer-governed, non-profit, health care system in Washington and Idaho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Standardized versus tailored protocol and focus</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Contextual factor</th><th>Implementation strategies</th><th>Standardized focus</th><th>Tailored focus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Resources</td><td>Paper-based PHQ-9 with score entered in EHR for clinician review</td><td>Client completion of PHQ-9 on paper and score entered in EHR for review by the clinician</td><td>Client completion of PHQ-9 on paper and score entered in EHR for review by the clinician</td></tr><tr><td>Networks and linkages</td><td>Form implementation teams for each site consisting of the site administrator, a clinician identified as an opinion leader, a self-nominated MBC champion, an office professional staff member, and research staff using data from the initial needs assessment.

Tailored implementation refers to the <italic>responsive application of implementation strategies and content matched to determinants of practice</italic> (i.e., barriers) <italic>identified via a needs assessment and formative evaluations</italic>. The same strategies outlined in the standardized condition will be employed in the tailored condition (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); however, the content will be tailored to the context of each site. The needs assessment will employ rapid ethnography methods to reveal contextual factors that may serve as barriers to the implementation process. The results of the needs assessment will be shared with a site&#x02019;s implementation team, which will convene to adapt and define the site-specific guidelines for PHQ-9 completion and other intervention components. For instance, it may be that Site X decides that monthly PHQ-9 administration is optimal with respect to feasibility and clinical utility. Conversely, Site Y may prefer to have clients complete the PHQ-9 every other session. As described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, training will be offered to all enrolled clinicians using tailored materials that will target the identified barriers from the needs assessment. For instance, if clinicians at a particular site perceive the PHQ-9 to be irrelevant to clients, training content will incorporate client perspectives on its utility. If clinicians indicate that lack of time is a barrier, then training will incorporate experimentation to streamline review and discussion of scores. Different members of the investigative team will lead training and consultation in the two conditions to ensure differentiation. A contamination interview and analysis will occur at the end of the active implementation to determine what, if any, crossover occurred between conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Phases and procedures</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Phase 1: randomized trial, implementation and sustainment</title><p>The dynamic cluster randomized implementation trial will be completed across 30 months and include 12 sites in four cohorts.

The Pre-Implementation phase (Phase 0) of the study was completed in May 2015, and Phase 1 subject recruitment and data collection began in June 2015 with the first cohort of clinic sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec40"><title>Innovation</title><p>This study is innovative in at least three ways. First, our focus on testing strategies to implement MBC in community mental health is innovative because this simple MBC framework may be the minimal intervention needed for significantly reducing the burden of depression on society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For the treatment of depression, we opted to focus on MBC rather than a complex, theoretically driven EBP like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy not only because of the MBC implementation gap, but also because the simplicity and accessibility of the MBC framework will likely reduce the number of implementation barriers. Moreover, MBC has been isolated as a core component of many EBPs. Therefore, identifying effective implementation strategies for MBC would build the case for a phased or staged approach to full package EBP implementation to determine whether later EBP implementations enhance outcomes beyond improvements observed with MBC.</p><p>Second, we will modify the electronic health record system to provide clinically relevant data to providers who use MBC, such as symptom trajectory graphs, alerts when suicidality is endorsed, etc. With electronic health record prevalence increasing, this approach presents a generalizable and cost-effective method for engaging in systematic outcome monitoring that maximizes therapeutic benefit and aligns with meaningful use requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p>Third, the majority of existing implementation research has focused either on descriptive studies that explore barriers and facilitators (determinants of practice) or on comparisons of <italic>a priori</italic> selected implementation strategies that generally neglect contextual tailoring of the interventions. A qualitative analysis of 22 implementation studies revealed that few focused on matching strategies to determinants of practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. A critical research agenda has emerged seeking to identify, &#x0201c;how and why implementation processes are effective&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] by experimentally evaluating implementations that are tailored to the context. Recent findings support the need to adapt evidence-based practices during the implementation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], but no studies, to our knowledge, have directly compared this approach to standardized EBP implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Limitations</title><p>In addition to these and other strengths, this approach to implementation of MBC has limitations. First, this implementation effort focuses on outcomes for standardized and tailored MBC as implemented within multiple sites of a single behavioral health organization. While it is anticipated that many of the strategies necessary to facilitate MBC implementation will align with previous research efforts, the degree of generalizability of the standardized and tailored approaches to other sites and settings is unknown. Second, clinician and client turnover across participating clinic sites may limit the sample size obtained, despite researcher efforts to exceed recruitment targets. Fortunately, literature suggests that participatory approaches to organizational change in practice patterns result in lower clinician attrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Third, the tailored approach to implementation is site-specific by design and does not allow for the evaluation of the effectiveness of specific tailored implementation protocols. Instead, the study approach seeks to evaluate the effect of tailoring more broadly. However, the mixed methods component of the study will explore the variety of MBC tailoring approaches and protocols utilized by the sites in this study that can be more closely tested in future research to determine which may be most effective with respect to implementation and client outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Expected impact</title><p>Measurement-based care aligns with priorities delineated in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111&#x02013;148), notably systematic evaluation of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and meaningful use requirements of electronic health records; however, systematic monitoring of client/consumer outcomes remains a challenge for providers of community-based mental health services. This study has the potential to impact public health through identification of practical and generalizable approaches to implementing MBC into CMHCs. Moreover, the evaluation of contextual mediators across 12 diverse Centerstone sites may reveal common barriers to be directly addressed in future research. Evidence-based intervention frameworks, such as MBC, are rarely the focus of implementation efforts. Thus, uncovering unique or previously identified contextual factors impacting implementation is critical to advancing implementation science. Finally, exploring MBC fidelity and its relation to client outcomes may reveal a &#x0201c;minimal intervention needed for change&#x0201d; (MINC; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) and the mechanisms through which MBC has an effect.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec43"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13012_2015_313_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
