In this present study, there was an inverse relationship between the level of compliance with wearing an N95 respirator and the risk of CRI; and the MCL was shown to be 50%. A previous analysis of data from this prospective cluster randomized clinical trial demonstrated that N95 respirators have efficacy in protecting against CRI.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0300060516665491" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, this present analysis has demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the rates of CRI in compliant and non-compliant N95 users by ward, with each ward being a closed environment for transmission of infection, which suggests that a herd protection effect for the non-compliant users was conferred by the compliant users. This present analysis also showed that non-compliant N95 users had a significantly lower rate of infection than the control subjects who did not use any masks (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.26; 95% CI 0.08, 0.82; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.022), again suggesting a benefit of herd protection from the complaint users.</p><p>In contrast to non-communicable diseases, it is the unique contagious nature of infections that results in the potential for herd protection. Transmission of infection within a closed setting is dynamic, with chains of transmission from one infected person to the next being established.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0300060516665491" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> As such, interruption of transmission below a critical threshold by any means, whether it is vaccination or personal protective equipment, can reduce the chains of transmission and result in &#x02018;herd protection&#x02019;. As shown in this present study, even though not 100% of participants of each ward wore N95 respirators above the MCL (50% compliance rate), the reduction of incidence of CRI still occurred in the non-compliant users due to the intervention by N95 respirators. To date, herd protection has been discussed only in the context of immunization programmes. However, this present study suggests that a herd effect as a result of interventions other than vaccinations are possible.</p><p>This study had a number of limitations. First, the data from the convenience control arm may have been a source of bias.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0300060516665491" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The control arm was not randomized because mask use was widespread in Chinese healthcare settings and it was unethical to ask HCWs to not wear a mask during the influenza season. Most subjects in the control arm wore medical masks at some stage, but not N95 respirators. Secondly, the sample size within each compliance level for the rates of CRI and for the analyses based on variables such as sex, handwashing and vaccinations was relatively small (mostly &#x0003c;10), which might reduce the power of the study. Thirdly, community exposure cannot be ruled out and participants may have contracted CRI in the community.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that herd protection from respiratory infections was provided by N95 respirators. The benefits of respirator use within a closed setting such as a hospital ward may extend beyond the individual who is wearing it. Future studies on the herd effects of other interventions that interrupt transmission of infections, and larger scale studies, are required to confirm the herd effect and implications for hospital infection control.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Our sincere thanks go to the staff at the Beijing Centre for Disease Control, Beijing, China, the staff at the hospitals involved in the prospective cluster randomized clinical trial and 3M's help in fit-testing during the trial.</p></ack><sec id="sec12-0300060516665491"><title>Declaration of conflicting interests</title><p>The authors declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Professor Raina MacIntyre has held an Australian Research Council Linkage Grant with 3M as the industry partner for investigator-driven research. 3M have also contributed supplies of masks and respirators for investigator-driven clinical trials.
