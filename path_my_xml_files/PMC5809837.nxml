Globally, the rapid development of mobile technology has generated new ways to address public health challenges and shifted the paradigm of health care access and delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the health care system of developing countries, mobile-phone technology is used to report health information and health care is delivered through telemedicine, to populations otherwise deprived, to improve adherence to treatment and appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. m-health also plays a major role in sexual and reproductive health care and is seen as a key area in achieving the global strategy for women&#x02019;s and children&#x02019;s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Evidence has shown that m-health minimizes time barriers and facilitates urgent care during emergency obstetric referrals and maternal health care use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Developing regions accounted for approximately 99% of global maternal deaths in 2015, of which sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) alone accounted for about two thirds, followed by one third in Southern Asia. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of a maternal mortality rate (MMR) below 70 per 100,000 live births will require a 7.5% reduction of MMR every year between 2016 and 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This will need more than three times the annual rate of global maternal mortality reduction that was observed between 1990 and 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, three million babies die every year before they are a month old, and a similar number are stillborn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Most of the deaths are due to lack of quality maternal and neonatal health care service provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">At the moment, many countries, including Ethiopia, are working to meet the recommendation of having skilled birth attendants for all births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the maternal health problem is still very serious; every year about 350,000 maternal deaths occur because of pregnancy and its related complications. The problem is more serious in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In Ethiopia, the mortality rate increased from 673 per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 676 per 100,000 live births in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Since 2003, Ethiopia has had increasing access to primary health care services through the Community Based Health Extension Program (CBHEP). Between 2003 and 2010, about 34,000 health extension workers (HEWs) were trained and deployed in 15,000 kebeles (villages), each of which had one newly constructed health post (HP) and about 3000&#x02013;5000 dwellers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Regardless of all these efforts, according to the Ethiopian Demographics Health Survey (EDHS) 2011, the number of women who received antenatal care (ANC) (34%), institutional delivery (10%) and postnatal care (PNC) (6%) services by skilled workers was very small, and this has resulted in high maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To tackle this problem more effectively, practicing innovative ways of health care service delivery, which will be integrated with the existing health care system is crucial, and thus mobile technology is being used. Despite the widespread use of mobile technologies in the health care system, there is limited evidence on the efficacy of mobile-phone-based interventions, or m-health, on maternal health care service utilization. In Ethiopia, no study has been conducted on the topic. To fill the gap, this study, through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), examines the effects of m-health on maternal health care service use in Eastern Ethiopia. It is hypothesized that m-health will increase maternal health care service provision in limited-resource and -literacy settings. In this RCT, two districts that are 34&#x000a0;km apart will be selected to reduce the possible risk of contamination between the intervention and control arms and to evaluate the barriers of implementation. The outcomes of this investigation will be analyzed for both intervention and control arms separately. Examining challenges and outcomes at this stage will provide insight into m-health implementation for improved maternal health care service use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par44">A single-blind, cluster-RCT study design will be employed on districts and their respective health centers (HCs).

Therefore, based on the maternal enrollment framework criteria for this study, any mother with a GA of &#x0201c;<italic>16&#x000a0;weeks-w</italic>,&#x0201d; where &#x0201c;<italic>w</italic>&#x0201d; is any number of weeks less than 16, then the first voice message, which consists of reminders for the first ANC visit and information about advantage of this visit, will be sent. This voice message will be continued every 2&#x000a0;weeks until the end of the time frame for the first ANC visit which is 24&#x000a0;weeks of GA. Thus, a total of eight plus four voice messages will be sent as reminders for the first ANC visit and information about its advantages. Based on the time frame for the second ANC visit (24&#x02013;28 weeks of GA), the 13th voice message from the initial message will be a reminder for the second ANC visit and information about its advantages. In this time frame, a maximum of two voice messages will be sent. The third stage of the voice message will be about reminders for the third ANC visit and its advantages. This stage of messaging will start from the 15th voice message and a total of two messages will be delivered. The last stage of voice messaging for ANC visit reminders and about its advantages will be started from the 17th voice message and this will consist of three parts (reminders for the fourth ANC visit, EDD and advantages of the fourth ANC and institutional delivery). A maximum number of voice messages from the date of enrollment and until the 42nd week of GA will be 21 voice messages. After the 21st voice message, the message will be changed to reminders for PNC follow-up and about its advantages. A total of three voice messages will be sent for PNC follow-up reminders and its advantages. Hence, an overall number of voice messages which will be sent for the intervention purpose will be 24. The content of all the messages will be first prepared in English and translated into the local language, &#x0201c;Afan Oromo,&#x0201d; and scripted to a female voice through a smart phone recording. Finally, these messages will be loaded on the mobile phone in voice message form to be sent regularly every 2&#x000a0;weeks at 7:00&#x000a0;a.m. to the intervention group:<disp-quote><p id="Par69">&#x0201c;Hello, this is voice message from a health center.

All the participants in the trials will be interviewed about their ANC visits and place of delivery by using a structured questionnaire. Antenatal care service use is defined as maternal health care service use during pregnancy. The participants will be considered as an ANC service user if they have at least one ANC visit.

Related with this, few studies focusing on adherence to maternal health care service use have been done in sub-Saharan African (SSA). In previous studies, participants have been selected from health facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], whereas the current study will focus on the intervention of mobile-phone-based voice messages for early initiation of maternal health care service use and its uptake. In this investigation, the study subjects will be recruited from the community by using a pregnancy screening test (HCG urine test) and portable U/S to include only those mothers with a GA of less than 16&#x000a0;weeks. This GA is preferred because it is recommended that all pregnant mothers should have their first ANC visit within first 12&#x000a0;weeks of GA, otherwise before 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p id="Par124">More specifically, this investigation may uncover concerns regarding poor maternal health care service utilization unique to low-resource settings and will influence m-health program implementation, assuming that this trial demonstrates effectiveness.</p><p id="Par125">There is also limited evidence which shows the effectiveness of m-health on maternal health care service use in low- and middle-income countries. Thus, mobile-phone-based voice message trial study is carefully designed with the assumption of achieving high maternal care service utilization among treatment group as compared to control. In turn, the intervention should reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p><p id="Par126">Randomized controlled trial studies, which were conducted in Zanzibar, Kenya and Nigeria at different times to evaluate the effect of m-health on maternal health care service utilization, have shown a promising outcome on maternal health care service utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, in all aforementioned investigations the study participants were recruited from health facilities which may not show the effect of m-health on early initiation of maternal health care service use. Thus, for the current study, recruitment and enrollment of the study participants will be conducted at the community level. In addition, this investigation will enroll only those mothers at less than 16&#x000a0;weeks of GA to test the effectiveness of m-health on early initiation of maternal health care service use and its uptake. It is also recognized that m-health is a dynamic issue with the fast transfer in both technology and information literacy for developing countries. Hence, there is a need to examine what works or does not work yet and to establish a standard in this area. Therefore, this mobile-phone-based voice message trial study should generate strong evidence on maternal health care service utilization in resource-limited settings with poor literacy, which can be generalizable to similar populations in various settings.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par127">Implementation of the study will be started in August 2017.
