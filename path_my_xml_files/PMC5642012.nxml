A single-blind randomized crossover design was used. Performance with Bernafon Acriva 9 hearing aids was compared with Fcomp off and Fcomp on. Participants wore the hearing aids in each condition in a counterbalanced order. Data were collected after at least 8 weeks of experience with a condition. Outcome measures were audibility, scores from the speech perception tests, and scores from a questionnaire comparing self-perceived hearing ability with Fcomp off and Fcomp on. Ten adults with mild to severe high-frequency hearing loss (seven with extensive DRs, one with patchy or restricted DRs, and two with no DR) were tested. Fcomp improved the audibility of high-frequency sounds for 6 out of 10 participants. There was no overall effect of Fcomp on consonant identification, but the pattern of consonant confusions varied across conditions and participants. For word-final /s, z/ detection, performance was significantly better with Fcomp on than with Fcomp off. Questionnaire scores showed no differences between conditions. In summary, Fcomp improved word-final /s, z/ detection. No benefit was found for the other measures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>frequency lowering</kwd><kwd>frequency transposition</kwd><kwd>dead regions</kwd><kwd>hearing aids</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-2331216517734455"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="sec2-2331216517734455"><title>The Importance of Amplification at High Frequencies</title><p>It is well known that speech sounds characterized by high-frequency components carry a significant proportion of speech information (<xref rid="bibr5-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">American National Standards Institute, 1997</xref>).

For a review, see <xref rid="bibr63-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Moore (2016)</xref>.

Access to high-frequency speech components also has long-term effects that can affect development. For children, adequate high-frequency amplification is important for the development of grammatical morphemes in speech (<xref rid="bibr42-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Koehlinger, Van Horne, Oleson, McCreery, &#x00026; Moeller, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr54-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">McGuckian &#x00026; Henry, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr58-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Moeller et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Electroacoustic limitations of the receivers or the microphones of hearing aids and the shape of the long-term average spectrum of speech, which falls progressively with increasing frequency above 0.5 kHz (<xref rid="bibr69-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Moore, Stone, F&#x000fc;llgrabe, Glasberg, &#x00026; Puria, 2008</xref>), often make it difficult to restore the audibility of high frequencies. For people with severe high-frequency hearing loss, it may be difficult to achieve the required gains and output levels without introducing distortion or encountering problems with acoustic feedback. Even when audibility is achieved, it does not always improve sound quality (<xref rid="bibr83-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Ricketts et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) or speech intelligibility (<xref rid="bibr9-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Baer, Moore, &#x00026; Kluk, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Hogan &#x00026; Turner, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr103-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Vickers, Moore, &#x00026; Baer, 2001</xref>).

Hearing-impaired listeners often fail to obtain benefit from the provision of amplification at frequencies between 3.2 and 6.4&#x02009;kHz, unlike normal-hearing control listeners (<xref rid="bibr6-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Amos &#x00026; Humes, 2007</xref>), and this cannot be completely accounted for by the high presentation levels used, which decrease intelligibility even for normal-hearing listeners (<xref rid="bibr35-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Hogan &#x00026; Turner, 1998</xref>). Most likely, the impaired ability to use audible information is related to a reduced ability to discriminate sounds, in some cases caused by the presence of regions of the cochlea with damaged or completely nonfunctioning inner hair cells, synapses, or neurons (<xref rid="bibr35-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Hogan &#x00026; Turner, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr83-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Ricketts et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).

This is called frequency composition (Fcomp) by the manufacturer (Bernafon AG). The operation of Fcomp (<xref rid="bibr46-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Kuriger &#x00026; Lesimple, 2012</xref>) is illustrated by the bottom-right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2331216517734455">Figure 1</xref> and is illustrated in more detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2331216517734455">Figure 2</xref>. The SB has three adjacent and equally wide subbands. Each of these subbands is transposed into a single DB whose bandwidth in Hertz equals that of each subband. Thus, information about spectral shape within the SB is partially lost, but information about the overall short-term energy within the SB and the temporal envelope within the SB is preserved. The relative level of the transposed components can be modified in the programming software. All other frequency components, including those originally falling within the DB, are preserved. Fcomp is enabled all the time, but its effects are usually only perceivable if the energy in the SB is greater than the energy in the DB. The calculations required for the implementation of Fcomp are made in parallel to the calculations that are needed for gain control and other functions, so the activation of Fcomp does not lead to any additional delay between the input and output of the hearing aid.

In addition, there is little published research evaluating FL for participants with diagnosed DRs. <xref rid="bibr27-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Glista et&#x000a0;al.

To date, the study of <xref rid="bibr85-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et&#x000a0;al. (2009)</xref> is the only one for which the settings of the FL were selected based on the characteristics of the DRs of the participants. For people with extensive high-frequency DRs, the available range for the DB may be rather limited. Fcomp allows the use of a relatively wide SB even when the DB is relatively narrow. This potentially allows provision of high-frequency cues in speech that would otherwise be inaudible or unusable. In contrast, both FC and FT have limitations in the width of the SB. For FT, the SB cannot be wider than the DB. For FC, a wide SB would require SF to be very low and the FC ratio to be high, both of which can impair sound quality and intelligibility (<xref rid="bibr3-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Alexander, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr87-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Salorio-Corbetto, Baer, &#x00026; Moore, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr98-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Souza, Arehart, Kates, Croghan, &#x00026; Gehani, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Most previous studies of FL have used experimental designs that might lead to confounding effects.

However, there are problems with this design. The initial A scores may be adversely affected by lack of familiarity with the tasks, and the final A scores may be adversely affected by inappropriate use of cues learned during the more prolonged exposure to the FL condition, leading to systematic errors in the control condition. Some participants tested by <xref rid="bibr28-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Glista et&#x000a0;al. (2012)</xref> showed these patterns.

However, with this approach, frequent switching between programs could prevent participants from learning the novel cues provided by FL.</p><p>To avoid such confounding effects, we used a crossover design. There were two conditions, Fcomp-on and Fcomp-off, which had, respectively, Fcomp enabled and disabled, but were otherwise identical. Each participant wore the hearing aids using one condition for at least 9 weeks and then the other condition for at least 9 weeks. The order of conditions was counterbalanced across participants. Outcome measures were obtained at the end of each period of using a specific condition. A questionnaire to compare real-world performance with the two conditions was administered at the end of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec4-2331216517734455"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec5-2331216517734455" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Ten adults (median age: 72 years, range: 66&#x02013;85) with bilateral postlingual high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss completed the study.

Each hearing aid had three programs: (a) <italic>Multi-environment</italic>, (b) <italic>Noisy situations</italic>, (c) <italic>Telecoil</italic> that kept the microphone of the hearing aid active but with a 6-dB gain reduction. For participant P09, the telecoil program was set to &#x0201c;loop only,&#x0201d; as she used this program in church and found the voices of children to be very distracting. This meant that Fcomp was never active when she used the telecoil program, although that program was not used frequently.</p><p>Real-ear aided gain targets calculated using the CAM2A method (<xref rid="bibr64-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Moore, Glasberg, &#x00026; Stone, 2010</xref>) were matched as closely as possible using an Interacoustics Affinity real-ear measurement system. The stimulus used for verification was a speech-shaped noise with a level of 50, 65, and 80&#x02009;dB SPL. All the advanced features of the hearing aids were switched off during these measurements. The gains were kept constant after the first fitting, except for some participants for whom it was necessary to modify the gains to ensure listening comfort. P03 requested an increase in volume after the first week of wearing the hearing aids. A gain increase of 2&#x02009;dB at all frequencies was implemented. For P04, the gains were decreased 2 days after fitting, by 2&#x02009;dB at 2 and 3&#x02009;kHz, and by 3&#x02009;dB at 4 and 6&#x02009;kHz. Nine weeks later, an additional overall reduction of 3&#x02009;dB for the right hearing aid and 5&#x02009;dB for the left hearing aid was implemented to avoid the need for him to manually adjust the volume each time he switched the hearing aids on. For P07, a 3-dB reduction of gain at all frequencies was implemented 1 week after fitting. For P09, a 3-dB reduction of gain at 3 and 4&#x02009;kHz was implemented 1 week after fitting.</p><p>For Fcomp, there are three possible SBs (3.8&#x02013;7.2&#x02009;kHz, 5.3&#x02013;9.6&#x02009;kHz, 6.5&#x02013;10&#x02009;kHz), each linked to a different DB (1.5&#x02013;2.9&#x02009;kHz, 2.9&#x02013;4.6&#x02009;kHz, 4.6&#x02013;6.5&#x02009;kHz, respectively). The edge frequencies are defined as the &#x02212;15-dB points. The manufacturer recommends that the center frequencies of the SB and DB should be reduced as the severity of high-frequency loss increases. We started by following this recommendation. The audibility achieved in this way was assessed by estimating the center frequency of the 1/3-octave band in which the root-mean-square (RMS) output of the hearing-aid intersected the hearing threshold (<italic>Thr<sub>f</sub></italic>); see later for details. If <italic>Thr<sub>f</sub></italic> was close to or below the lower edge of the DB or if the DB fell well within a DR, a lower range was used if available, provided that the participant did not report poor sound quality of his or her own voice or the experimenter&#x02019;s voice. The default combinations of SB and DB were used for most participants but (P07) was fitted with a lower SB or DB combination. The manufacturer would not recommend the use of Fcomp for P05, P10, P14, but nevertheless it was activated for them. It should be noted that the setting with the highest SB and DB was not used here, as the DB was outside the range of audibility of the participants.</p><p>A parameter in the fitting software determines the relative level of the transposed components. The settings are called <italic>weak</italic>, <italic>medium</italic>, and <italic>strong</italic>, and each differs from its neighbor by 6&#x02009;dB in level. This parameter was initially set to <italic>strong</italic> for all participants, but one-step reductions were made for P05 and P09 because they complained about the sound quality of their own voice or the voices of others. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2331216517734455">Table 2</xref> shows the Fcomp settings for each participant.

The participant looked to the front (0&#x000b0; azimuth) during the test. The soundcard output was routed to the loudspeakers via Tucker Davis PA4 programmable attenuators and Tucker Davis SM3 mixers. For the colocated case, the target speech and babble were played out either from the right loudspeaker or from the left loudspeaker. For the spatially separated case, the target speech was played out from one loudspeaker, and the babble was played out from the other one. This gave four combinations of talker and masker locations (both from the right, both from the left, talker from right and masker from left, talker from left and masker from right) whose order was randomized across participants. Each sentence was presented with a randomly selected segment of the background babble. The babble started 500&#x02009;ms before the sentence and ended 500&#x02009;ms after the sentence. The level of the speech was fixed at 65&#x02009;dB (A). The signal-to-babble ratio (SBR) was selected for each participant, based on practice runs, so as to achieve mid-range performance. This was done separately for each spatial configuration. For each spatial configuration, two lists of practice sentences were presented, followed by two test lists. Practice lists were drawn from the BKB corpus (<xref rid="bibr10-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Bench &#x00026; Bamford, 1979</xref>). Each list consisted of 16 sentences.

A feature matrix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2331216517734455">Table 3</xref>) was specified for each of the 21 consonants used in the VCV test. The confusion matrices were analyzed using the software FIX, developed by Mike Johnson (Department of Phonetics, University College London) and available at <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.phon.ucl.ac.uk/pub/fix/">ftp://ftp.phon.ucl.ac.uk/pub/fix/</ext-link>. SINFA allows determination of the contribution of each of a selected set of features to the total information transmitted. An iterative process is used to obtain the independent contribution of each feature to the transmission of information. For each iteration, the features carrying most of the information in previous iterations are held constant. FIX returns three results: the total information transmitted (in bits of information), the proportion of information transmitted by each of the selected features relative to the input, and the proportion of information transmitted relative to the total information transmitted. Here we focused on the first two. SINFA was carried out for each condition separately, for each participant and for the group as a whole. When performing SINFA, if too many features are used at the same time, the information transmitted for the features that carry less information (and therefore are analyzed later in the process) may not be reported. To avoid this situation, SINFA analyses were performed separately for two submatrices obtained from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2331216517734455">Table 3</xref>. One submatrix contained the features of place of articulation, and the other contained the features of manner of articulation. The feature of voicing, which is robust and largely unaffected by FL, was added to the smallest of the matrices, the manner matrix.

Differences across the two conditions were very small. The total information transmitted was 3.18 bits for Fcomp-off and 3.17 bits for Fcomp-on. For individual participants, there were some differences in the transmission of features across conditions. These differences tended to balance each other, giving only small differences in the total information transmitted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2331216517734455">Table 4</xref>). The largest differences occurred for P07, P10, and P13. For P07 and P10, the total information transmitted was slightly greater for Fcomp-on than for Fcomp-off. For P07, the difference arose mainly from increases in the transmission of the affricate manner of articulation and for most places of articulation, especially the palatoalveolar and palatal places. For P10, information transmission was lower for Fcomp-on for the fricative and affricate manners of articulation but was higher for Fcomp-on for the bilabial, labiodental, and dental places of articulation. For P13, information transmission was lower for Fcomp-on for manner of articulation and some places of articulation (especially for dental and alveolar places of articulation).

This was also the case for most individual participants. However, for some participants, scores were better for one of the two conditions only for some questions in each subscale. Sometimes the direction of the difference between conditions was not consistent within a given scale. This explains the fact that the individual standard deviations were large in some cases. For example, for the speech subscale, P05 rated Fcomp-off as better (with scores of &#x02212;2 or &#x02212;3) for most situations involving interaction with a group or communication partner, or when a competing talker was present, but she reported no difference or Fcomp-on being slightly better for other situations. Similarly, P13 rated Fcomp-off as being better (with scores of &#x02212;1.2 to &#x02212;1.8) in conversational situations with competing speakers but rated Fcomp-on as better when listening to speech in places where there was reverberation (score of 2.2). For the spatial subscale, P13 rated Fcomp-on as being better for localization of a lawnmower outdoors and for the externalization of sounds (scores of 2 and 2.2, respectively), but he rated Fcomp-off as better for localizing a dog barking (score of &#x02212;2), for estimating the direction of the displacement of a moving source (score of &#x02212;2.35), and for estimating the distance of a source (scores ranging from &#x02212;1.2 to &#x02212;2). For the qualities of speech subscale, P05 rated Fcomp-on as better (scores of 2 or 3) for the sound quality of everyday sounds, her own voice and the voices of others, while showing no clear difference across conditions in other situations. P13 reported that with Fcomp-on environmental sounds seemed more separate from one another and he needed to concentrate less and put less effort into speech understanding (scores of 2.4 for environmental sounds and 2.0 and 1.8 for understanding speech). However, he rated Fcomp-off as better when listening to music and judging the naturalness of sounds (scores between &#x02212;2.1 and &#x02212;3.1, and &#x02212;1.9, respectively). Similarly, P04, who is musically trained, reported better sound quality with Fcomp-off for music, naturalness of own voice and environmental sounds (score of &#x02212;2.0) with no difference between conditions in other situations. It is worth mentioning that in normal usage, problems with music are unlikely to arise, as by default Fcomp is switched off for the music program.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec23-2331216517734455"><title>Discussion</title><p>We evaluated Fcomp with a single-blind crossover design using a control condition for which Fcomp was switched off. Ten participants with high-frequency hearing loss completed the study. Participants were not informed of the condition being tested, but some of them (P01, P04, P07, P09, P14) reported that they could hear the effect of Fcomp.</p><p>The estimated audibility of the high-frequency components of speech improved for 6 out of 10 participants. For P04, estimated audibility was not improved by the use of Fcomp but he nevertheless showed better detection of word-final /s, z/ with Fcomp-on and reported worse sound quality for music in the SSQ-C questionnaire with Fcomp-on. This suggests that the stimuli used to estimate audibility were not ideal. Audibility with Fcomp-on could have been underestimated because (a) the width of the high-frequency bands used in the Verifit system is smaller than the bandwidth of fricative or affricate consonants such as /s/ and /d&#x00292;/, (b) Fcomp was effectively active only occasionally during the presentation of the stimuli, as strong high-frequency components in speech are not present all of the time, (c) the Verifit bands have a width that is slightly greater than the width of each of the SB subbands. When using natural speech, the stops, fricatives, and affricates will simultaneously produce inputs from more than one subband, and often from all three, which would lead to greater audibility than estimated by the Verifit system.</p><p>It seems likely that the increase in audibility provided by Fcomp was underestimated in our measurements and that an audibility increase was provided for almost all of the participants. However, participant P03 had a value of <italic>Thr<sub>f</sub></italic> that was below the lower edge of the DB. This means that for sounds within the DB, audibility was probably very poor or zero. To assess whether this affected the study outcomes, we repeated all of the statistical analyses excluding the results for P03. This did not lead to any changes in the significance of any effects or interactions.</p><p>A reliable method of estimating the audibility of the FL sounds may help to avoid extreme settings of FL in attempts to reach audibility (<xref rid="bibr56-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>) and may also help to avoid weak settings that do not increase access to high-frequency sounds. Stimuli consisting of simulated /s/ and /&#x00283;/ sounds have been proposed for this purpose (<xref rid="bibr89-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Scollie et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Fcomp did not significantly improve overall consonant identification. There was a significant effect of vowel context, with context /a/ leading to the highest scores, and /i/ to the lowest scores. This effect is most likely related to the use of formant transitions as a cue for consonant identification. The vowel /i/ has second and third formants that are higher in frequency than those for /a/ and /u/ (<xref rid="bibr75-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Peterson &#x00026; Barney, 1952</xref>). Hearing loss at high frequencies could adversely affect the use of formant transition information by reducing audibility or impairing the spectral and temporal analysis mechanisms used to extract this information. There was a significant interaction between condition and vowel context. There was a trend for the difference between Fcomp-on and Fcomp-off to be greater for the vowel context /u/. However, when a separate ANOVA with factor condition was performed for the vowel context /u/, the effect was deemed not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.</p><p>There was a trend for confusions of /s/ with /&#x00283;/ to increase and for confusions of /s/ with /f/ to decrease with Fcomp-on. This may be explained by changes in the audibility of the frication noise of /s/. Listeners tend to identify high amplitude ratios between the frication noise and the vowel in the F3 region as /&#x00283;/ rather than /s/ (<xref rid="bibr32-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Hedrick &#x00026; Ohde, 1993</xref>). Also, hearing-impaired listeners rely on the amplitude-ratio cue to a greater extent than normal-hearing listeners, who use both spectral cues and relative-amplitude cues (<xref rid="bibr31-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Hedrick &#x00026; Jesteadt, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Hedrick, Schulte, &#x00026; Jesteadt, 1995</xref>). For our participants, spectral analysis is likely to have been poor, especially for those with extensive DRs, probably making them more reliant on relative amplitude cues. If Fcomp made the frication noise more audible, then the effective noise-vowel ratio would have increased, leading the participants to label /s/ as /&#x00283;/. A similar explanation may account for the finding that, with Fcomp-off, /s/ was often identified as /f/, whose frication noise is weaker than that of /s/ (<xref rid="bibr39-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Jongman et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). It is possible that fine tuning the gain applied to the transposed sound would decrease /s, &#x00283;/ confusions, but that was not attempted here. It is also possible that this confusion increased because of the three subbands of SB being delivered to the same narrow DB. This could have made /s/ and /&#x00283;/ sound more similar after the application of Fcomp.</p><p>Changes in the pattern of confusions have been reported for many studies of FL, improvements in the identification of some sounds being offset by worsening in the identification of other sounds (<xref rid="bibr3-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Alexander, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Ellis &#x00026; Munro, 2015b</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Kokx-Ryan et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr80-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Posen, Reed, &#x00026; Braida, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bibr84-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bibr85-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It is possible that changes in the pattern of confusions have an impact on the effort required in everyday life listening situations, even when the overall identification score remains roughly constant. For example, it is not known how specific changes in the pattern of confusions affect subjective preference and performance in environments where visual (lip reading) and contextual information are available. However, the results of the SSQ-C (discussed later) suggest that any such effects of Fcomp in everyday life were small.</p><p>The outcomes of SINFA suggest that, overall, the transmission of acoustic features did not change across conditions. This is consistent with the findings of <xref rid="bibr84-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et&#x000a0;al. (2007)</xref> for the FT hearing aid evaluated by them. At the individual level, there were some differences in the transmission of acoustic features in both our data and those of <xref rid="bibr84-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et&#x000a0;al. (2007)</xref>. <xref rid="bibr94-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et&#x000a0;al. (2006)</xref> did not report individual data, but they reported differences in the amount of transmitted information across groups of participants classified according to whether they obtained benefit from FC or not. Effects of the FL processing may be obscured by averaging across participants. Consistent with the consonant-confusion matrices, for most of our participants for whom the transmission of information varied across conditions, improvements in the transmission of one feature were offset by worsening in the transmission of another feature.</p><p>Fcomp did improve the detection of word-final /s, z/. This ability is based on sound detection rather than discrimination. Thus, this outcome is consistent with the improvement in estimated audibility achieved with Fcomp for most of the participants. Inspection of the data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-2331216517734455">Figure 8</xref>) suggests that those participants who did not seem to obtain benefit from Fcomp for this task were those for whom the estimated audibility of the frequency-lowered signals was low or zero, except for P04. Word-final detection of /s, z/ has been shown to improve with other FL schemes, such as FC (<xref rid="bibr27-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Glista et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr107-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bibr108-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and FT (<xref rid="bibr84-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, a few studies (<xref rid="bibr38-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">John et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr106-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) showed no benefit of FC for final /s, z/ detection. The participants in the studies that did not show a benefit had mild high-frequency hearing loss and thus probably had reasonable audibility of the cues used for detection of word-final /s, z/ even without FL.</p><p>The intelligibility of speech in background babble was assessed for six of the participants. Increasing the audible frequency range of speech improves sentence intelligibility for frequency ranges up to at least 7.5&#x02009;kHz (<xref rid="bibr9-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Baer et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr63-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Moore, 2016</xref>), especially for speech in babble noise that is spatially separated from the target voice (<xref rid="bibr48-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Levy, Freed, Nilsson, Moore, &#x00026; Puria, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr64-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Moore, F&#x000fc;llgrabe, &#x00026; Stone, 2010</xref>). Thus, we expected that the improved audibility provided by Fcomp might improve performance, at least for the spatially separated configuration. However, there was no effect of Fcomp for either spatial configuration. <xref rid="bibr64-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Moore et&#x000a0;al. (2010)</xref> recorded their stimuli via a KEMAR dummy head (<xref rid="bibr15-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Burkhard &#x00026; Sachs, 1975</xref>) and presented them to participants via headphones, thereby preserving pinna cues. We used hearing aids with microphones located above the pinna. Therefore, no pinna cues were available. The hearing aids had an algorithm that was intended partly to reproduce pinna cues (<xref rid="bibr47-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Launer, Zakis, &#x00026; Moore, 2016</xref>). However, this may not have been enough to preserve the benefit of increasing the audible bandwidth (<xref rid="bibr48-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Levy et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). The FL itself and the recoding of a large frequency range in the SB to a smaller range in the DB may also have limited the benefit of increasing the audible bandwidth. Finally, it could be that the speech material used here was not sensitive enough to allow detection of differences across conditions. The adaptive sentence list sentences contain contextual information, which makes them easier to identify. The use of lower context sentences, such as the IEEE corpus (<xref rid="bibr86-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Rothauser et&#x000a0;al., 1969</xref>), might have led to different outcomes.</p><p>At the time of performing this study, there were no published studies evaluating Fcomp. Recently, a version of Fcomp implemented in Oticon hearing aids (<xref rid="bibr7-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Angelo, Alexander, Christiansen, Simonsen, &#x00026; Jespergaard, 2015</xref>) was evaluated for a group of adults and children (<xref rid="bibr40-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Kirby et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). No benefit of Fcomp-on was found for speech intelligibility (monosyllabic words and sentences, VCV test in background noise), plural detection, or listening effort, although the participants preferred the sound quality with Fcomp-on, at least in some situations. Several factors could account for why they found no benefit for plural detection while we found a benefit for /s, z/ detection. These include the use of different hearing aids, different methods for prescribing gain, different methods for scoring plural detection (percent correct as opposed to <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; for /s, z/ detection), and the degree of hearing loss of the participants. This last factor is probably the most important. Our participants had more severe hearing loss, and their values of <italic>Thr<sub>f</sub></italic> (mean of 2.65&#x02009;kHz for the ears with better audibility) were much lower than the values of the &#x0201c;maximum audible frequency&#x0201d; reported by <xref rid="bibr40-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Kirby et&#x000a0;al. (2017)</xref>. Their values of the maximum audible frequency were close to 4 kHz for the adults and 5.5&#x02009;kHz for the children. Thus, the audibility of high-frequency information in the control condition was higher for the group tested by <xref rid="bibr40-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Kirby et&#x000a0;al.

Differences in FL algorithms, settings of the FL, hearing loss of the participants, type of background noise, and experimental design are likely to underlie the differences across studies.</p><p>We obtained a measure of subjective benefit using the SSQ-C questionnaire. We hoped that if any consistent patterns emerged from the outcomes of the SSQ-C, they could be used to guide the selection of outcome measures in future studies. The group average results did not show a preference for Fcomp-on versus Fcomp-off. However, some participants reported that the sound quality of music was adversely affected by Fcomp. The sound quality of music has been shown to be affected by the use of some FL algorithms, such as FC (<xref rid="bibr70-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Mussoi &#x00026; Bentler, 2015</xref>), especially for musically trained listeners and moderate or strong settings of the FC. Despite the inharmonicity produced by FC, there appears to be a range of FC settings that leads to acceptable sound quality for music for hearing-impaired participants (<xref rid="bibr70-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Mussoi &#x00026; Bentler, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr72-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Parsa, Scollie, Glista, &#x00026; Seelisch, 2013</xref>).

Fcomp does not preserve the harmonic structure of sounds, but despite this most participants did not rate music as having a lower quality with it. In any case, as noted earlier, FL is usually switched off in the music program that is provided with many hearing aids.</p><p>Individual variability in the effect of Fcomp was observed for all of the speech tests used in this study.

The prevalence of cognitive impairment increases with increasing age. One could argue that, if a high proportion of the participants had cognitive impairment, this might have decreased the likelihood of measuring a benefit of Fcomp. However, cognitive ability has been found not to predict the benefit of FC for normal-hearing listeners (<xref rid="bibr20-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Ellis &#x00026; Munro, 2013</xref>) or hearing-impaired listeners (<xref rid="bibr21-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Ellis &#x00026; Munro, 2015a</xref>). It is also possible that older adults are less able to learn to use novel acoustic cues than younger adults or children (<xref rid="bibr27-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Glista et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The presence of DRs was found previously not to be correlated with performance in a sentence-in-noise intelligibility task with and without FC (<xref rid="bibr21-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Ellis &#x00026; Munro, 2015a</xref>). However, for all but two participants, the DRs of the participants tested by Ellis and Munro had relatively high <italic>f<sub>e</sub></italic> values of 3 or 4&#x02009;kHz.

Thus, the participants of Ellis and Munro would have been able to use information from frequency components over the total bandwidth of the hearing aids used. It is difficult to evaluate the impact of DRs on the performance of our participants, as most of the participants had DRs, and the two with no DRs had much better hearing thresholds than the rest. A study assessing the impact of DRs on the benefit of Fcomp would require an experimental design different from the one used here.</p><sec id="sec24-2331216517734455"><title>Limitations of the Current Study</title><p>There are some limitations of the present study. One is that the number of participants was small, especially for the speech-in-noise test, for which only six participants could be tested. Another limitation is that although most participants had very similar durations of experience with the two conditions, there were a few who had a slightly longer duration with one than with the other, mainly due to scheduling difficulties. In addition, the total duration of the two test periods varied across participants, which may have contributed to the variability of outcomes across participants. However, <xref rid="bibr36-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Hopkins et&#x000a0;al.

Their participants had durations of experience ranging from 1 to 121 months. Conversely, <xref rid="bibr22-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Ellis and Munro (2015b)</xref> found that acclimatization to FC did occur for VCVs in noise. Our stimuli were similar to those of <xref rid="bibr36-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Hopkins et&#x000a0;al.

However, there was no control group in these studies, so it is possible that the changes observed were simply due to maturation and general learning, especially for the children tested by <xref rid="bibr108-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et&#x000a0;al.

Acclimatization could be different for children and adults because it depends partly on previous experience.</p></sec><sec id="sec25-2331216517734455"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Fcomp improved the audibility of high-frequency sounds for most participants. The pattern of consonant confusions changed with Fcomp, with improvements being offset by new confusions. Future research should address the fine tuning of the Fcomp algorithm to reduce the number of new confusions while keeping the improvements. Fcomp led to a modest but significant improvement in the detection of word-final /s, z/. The intelligibility of speech in noise was not affected by Fcomp, and ratings of everyday experience did not differ between Fcomp-on and Fcomp-off. Although the evidence for benefits of Fcomp was restricted to the detection of word-final /s, z/, Fcomp did not lead to worse performance for any of the outcome measures. Fcomp, in common with other FL methods, may be useful for clinicians when reductions in high-frequency gain are needed to avoid acoustic feedback. Feedback problems are likely to be reduced both because lower gains are needed with FL stimuli and because frequency shifting is well known as a method of reducing feedback. In addition, the lower output levels that are required when FL is used may help avoid hearing damage and distortion (<xref rid="bibr17-2331216517734455" ref-type="bibr">Ching, Johnson, Seeto, &#x00026; Macrae, 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to Neil Hockley, Martin Kuriger, Barbara Simon, and Bernadette Fulton for technical assistance and to Brian Glasberg for insightful discussions on statistical analysis.
