Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 (&#x0003c;1 year), group 2 (1&#x02013;6 yrs), and group 3 (6&#x02013;14 yrs). The vital signs were closely monitored 1 hr before biopsy, and then 1, 2, 6, and 24 hrs after biopsy. Twenty-four hours pre- and post-biopsy complete blood counts, liver enzymes, prothrombin time (PT), and abdominal ultrasonography, searching for a biopsy-induced hematoma, were done for all patients.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>No mortality or major morbidities were encountered after BPLB. The rate of minor complications was 17.5% including irritability or &#x0201c;pain&#x0201d; requiring analgesia in 10%, mild fever in 5%, and drowsiness for &#x0003e;6 hrs due to oversedation in 2.5%. There was a statistically significant rise in the 1-hr post-biopsy mean heart and respiratory rates, but the rise was non-significant at 6 and 24 hrs except for group 2 where heart rate and respiratory rates significantly dropped at 24 hrs. No statistically significant difference was noted between the mean pre-biopsy and the 1, 6, and 24-hrs post-biopsy values of blood pressure in all groups. The 24-hrs post-biopsy mean hemoglobin and hematocrit showed a significant decrease, while the 24-hrs post-biopsy mean total leucocyte and platelet counts showed non-significant changes. The 24-hrs post-biopsy mean liver enzymes were non-significantly changed except the 24-hrs post-biopsy mean PT which was found to be significantly prolonged, for a yet unknown reason(s).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outpatient BPLB performed by the Menghini technique is safe and well tolerated even in infants and young children.

Under local infiltration anesthesia by lidocaine hydrochloride, the intercostal right midaxillary approach was used in most patients (70 patients), whereas the subcostal midclavicular approach was used in 10 patients only. The needle was introduced in the right midaxillary line above the rib, just 1 intercostal space below the maximum liver dullness (in the intercostal approach) or below the costal margin in the midclavicular line (in the subcostal approach).

At 1 hr post-biopsy follow-up, there was a significant rise in the mean HR in the three groups with P value 0.002, 0.001, and 0.000, respectively. All patients in group 1, 42 of 48 patients in group 2 and 14 of 16 cases in group 3 had an increase in HR by &#x0003c;20 beats/minute. In contrast, the mean HR counted at 6 and 24 hrs post-biopsy showed no statistically significant difference from the pre-biopsy HR in all three groups. The 1-hr post-biopsy mean RR showed a significant rise in the three groups with P value 0.000, 0.022, and 0.000, respectively. The 6-hrs post-biopsy mean RR showed no statistically significant difference from the pre-biopsy mean RR in all three groups.

At 24-hrs post-biopsy, the mean TLC was decreased, but this decrease did not reach a statistically significant difference. Fifty-two patients (65%) showed a decrease in the TLC and 28 patients (35%) showed an increase in the TLC. The pre-biopsy platelets count ranged from 140,000 to 584,000. The overall 24-hrs post-biopsy mean platelets count decreased but did not reach a statistically significant difference.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Pre- and post-biopsy laboratory tests values and significances</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJG-18-26-g003"/></table-wrap><p>Regarding the LFTs, the pre-biopsy TSB ranged from 0.2 to 11.5 mg/dl and DSB 0.0 to 10.3 mg/dl. At 24-hrs post-biopsy, there was a non-statistically significant rise in the mean TSB and the mean DSB. ALT level before biopsy was between 9 and 508 U/l (normal value up to 20). Twenty-four hours after biopsy, the mean ALT showed a non-statistically significant increase. AST levels before biopsy ranged from 14 to 812 U/l (normal value up to 20), while 24 hrs after biopsy, the mean AST showed a non-statistically significant increase. Pre-biopsy serum Alk Phos level range was 118 to 1586 U/l (normal 120&#x02013;400), and 24 hrs after biopsy, the mean serum Alk Phos was increased but did not reach a statistical significance.</p><p>In this study, liver biopsy was not performed if PT was prolonged by more than 3 sec above the control. In the 80 cases, the pre-biopsy prolongation of PT above the control ranged from 0.0 to 2.5 sec. The 24-hrs post-biopsy PT was significantly increased in 50 patients (65.5%, <italic>P</italic> 0.000).</p><p>As regards the intra- and post-procedure problems, two needle passes were needed in 10 pateints (12.5%). Among two of these cases, the liver was not palpable below the costal margin. Irritability or pain requiring medication (paracetamol) was observed in 8 cases (10%), drowsiness for more than 6 hrs probably due to oversedation in 2 patients (2.5%), and mild fever managed by cold compresses in 4 patients (5%). No mortality or major morbidity such as bile leak, pneumothorax, and bleeding requiring transfusion were detected (in spite of the significant drop in both Hb% and Ht and the significant prolongation of the PT 24 hrs after biopsy). In those with irritability or pain, CXR was done to rule out the possibility of small pneumothorax and it was normal in all of the eight patients.</p><p>Abdominal ultrasonograhy was done 24 hrs after biopsy in all patients (both by convex linear and sector probes) with no detectable complications particularly hematomas and intraperitoneal bleeding.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Liver biopsy is a well-established procedure in the diagnosis and follow-up of liver diseases. It is indicated in various clinical settings, to establish a diagnosis, to assess prognosis, and to monitor therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] It can change the clinical diagnosis in 8&#x02013;14%, the management in 12&#x02013;18%, and the frequency of LFT monitoring in 36% of cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Although the liver has a rich vascular supply, complications associated with percutaneous liver biopsy are rare. Sixty percent of complications occur within 2 hrs and 96% within 24 hrs after the procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In a large study in adults, only 4% of complications occurred late (1&#x02013;6 days after the procedure).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] However, still BPLB is an invasive technique that carries a risk of complications. Although the rate of major complications is low, minor complications may occur, though not frequently.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we kept our patients fasting for the first 4 hrs after biopsy for proper monitoring and early detection of complications. In the study carried out by Lichtman and his colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] on 174 infants, nearly all their babies were active and eating within 1&#x02013;2 hrs after the procedure.</p><p>Follow-up of our patients after biopsy revealed a significant increase in the mean HR in the three study groups 1 hr after biopsy, while no significant change 6 hrs post-biopsy. There was a significant drop in the mean HR of the second group 24 hrs after biopsy. In the adult study conducted by Minuk and his colleagues,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] there was a highly significant increase in the mean HR of their cases 24 hrs after biopsy.</p><p>The arterial BP showed a non-significant drop in the mean systolic and diastolic readings in the three age groups at 1, 6, or 24 hrs after biopsy. None of our cases suffered from drop of BP by more than 20 mm Hg. Similarly in another study, the investigators reported that only 1 out of 184 biopsies (0.5%) in children less than 1 yr old showed a drop of more than 20 mm Hg in the systolic BP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Others reported a highly significant drop in both mean systolic and mean diastolic pressures in the 6-hrs period after biopsy. Their study included 40 adult patients, 31 patients diagnosed as cirrhosis and 5 neoplasia. In addition, 11 patients (27.5%) had a post-biopsy drop in systolic and diastolic BP &#x0003e;20 mm Hg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] The difference between our results and theirs may be attributed to the difference in age of the two studied groups as well as the difference in their histopathological findings. The higher incidence of cirrhosis and neoplasia among their groups might predispose to more post-biopsy blood loss which may account for the more significant drop in BP.</p><p>Regarding the mean Hb% and Hct, we detected a significant drop 24 hrs after biopsy with 5% showing a decrease by more than 2 g/dl. Other authors reported a decrease in Hb% of more than 2 g/dl among 3 children out of 184 (1.6%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The TLC in our study did not change significantly all through the 24 hrs after biopsy except in one patient; 65% showed a drop in the TLC, whereas 35% showed an increase in the TLC with one case showing an increase of more than 10,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. In this case, infection was suggested as the patient had fever of 38.5&#x000b0;C, but cultures were negative. Reddy and Schiff[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] stated that transient bacteremia occurs in 5.8&#x02013;13.5% of patients after liver biopsy, and although such bacteremia is generally inconsequential, septicemia and shock can develop on rare occasions in patients with biliary obstruction and cholangitis. Currently, there are no recommendations for the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing liver biopsy including those with prosthetic valves or joints.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>As regard the platelet count, there was a nonsignificant change in the platelets count 24 hrs after biopsy in this study with 70% of patients showing a drop of platelets and 30% showing a rise. This rise may be a reactive thrombocytosis. As regards the LFTs, this study showed a non-significant rise of liver enzymes (AST, ALT Alk Phos) at 24 hrs after the biopsy, whereas PT showed a highly significant prolongation which has a yet unknown reason(s) and needs to be validated in a bigger study.</p><p>Regarding the ultrasonographic findings, no intrahepatic or subcapsular hematomas were detected in the 80 cases at 24 hrs after the biopsy. In the study of Lichtman and his colleagues, hematoma at the biopsy site was reported in only 1 out of 148 cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Actually, BPLB has been adopted as a procedure in children without the same extensive examination of its safety as in adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In this study, no major complications were reported. Only minor complications such as irritability or pain requiring analgesia, oversedation, or drowsiness for more than 6 hrs, and mild fever occurred. Reports from the late 1940s of large numbers of children being investigated for malnutrition suggested that BPLB by a subcostal approach was safe.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Early reports of small series in children using the Menghini technique showed no major complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Walker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] reported no life-threatening complications in a series of 210 biopsies performed in 166 patients, of whom 67 were of age 1 yr or less and 24 were of age 1 week to 2 months. In a study of the risks of complications of the different pediatric gastroenterology procedures in 1981,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] a rate of 4% in 584 liver biopsies performed at 25 centers was found. These complications included bleeding, pneumothorax, and pain. However, the clinical details including ages of the patients, number of infants with and without complications, condition of patients, and biopsy technique were not given in that study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]</p><p>Ultrasound was done to all our patients prior to biopsy to exclude the presence of liver cysts or huge dilatation of the bile ducts likely to be punctured by the biopsy needle. Any highly vascular mass such as a hemangioma, arterio-venous malformation, or vascular liver tumour were considered not suitable for BPLB; however, liver congestion <italic>per se</italic> was not a contraindication. Three patients were excluded based on the ultrasonographic findings; one with hepatic cyst and two with liver hemangiomas. Presence of infection of the adjacent lung, pleura, or skin, or peritonitis was also considered a contraindication for biopsy. Serious complications of liver biopsy can be avoided if patients at high risk of bleeding are excluded. Despite claims that hepatic bleeding after biopsy is a random event[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] patients with abnormal clotting studies seem to be at risk. In our series, no patients underwent biopsy if the PT was &#x0003e;3 sec above the control or platelet count less than 70,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. In the study of Litchman and his coworkers,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] no patients underwent biopsy if the PT was &#x0003e;15 sec or the partial thromboplastin time was &#x0003e;49 sec. The platelet count was &#x0003e;60,000/mm<sup>3</sup> in all but one in their series.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Although these criteria are considered &#x0201c;absolute&#x0201d; contraindications by most hepatologists, they can be corrected by transfusions of platelets or fresh-frozen plasma and are therefore not truly absolute.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>Investigators in adults encountered other minor complications as transient, localized discomfort at the biopsy site; pain requiring analgesia; and mild, transient hypotension (due to a vasovagal reaction). Approximately one fourth of patients had pain in the right upper quadrant or right shoulder after liver biopsy. The pain was usually dull, mild, and brief.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Ongoing, severe pain in the abdomen should alert the physician to the possibility of a more serious complication, such as bleeding or peritonitis. Although very rare, clinically significant intraperitoneal hemorrhage is the most serious bleeding complication of BPLB; it usually becomes apparent within the first 2&#x02013;3 hrs after the procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] Free intraperitoneal blood may result from laceration caused by deep inspiration during the biopsy or may be related to a penetrating injury of a branch of the hepatic artery or portal vein. Risk factors for hemorrhage after liver biopsy are older age, more than three passes with the needle during biopsy, and the presence of cirrhosis or liver cancer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Findings of free intraperitoneal fluid on ultrasonography or computed tomography should be correlated with the clinical assessment of the patient.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] If hemorrhage is suspected, immediate arrangements for blood, platelets, and plasma should be made, and a surgeon and an angiographer should be alerted. Measures to improve the patient's hemodynamic status by the administration of intravenous fluids, blood products, or both may be sufficient. If hemodynamic instability persists for a few hours despite the use of aggressive resuscitative measures, angiography and embolization or surgical exploration are indicated. Small intrahepatic or subcapsular hematomas can be noted after liver biopsy even in asymptomatic patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] Large hematomas may cause pain associated with tachycardia, hypotension, and a delayed decrease in the hematocrit. Conservative treatment of hematomas is generally sufficient.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] A study by Lebensztejn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] conducted on 250 patients aged 1&#x02013;17 yrs with the use of Menghini needles reported complications in 3 patients (1.2%).</p><p>We did all our BPLBs as an outpatient or as day cases. Currently, 4&#x02013;70% of liver biopsies are performed as outpatient procedure, with a reported frequency of 30% in Romania, 29% in France, and 70% in the United States.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] The complication rate is similar for inpatients and outpatients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] The safety of BPLB in adults has been discussed in numerous reports;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>] the most recent large study reported a mortality of 0.005% with the Menghini technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Other investigators found the mortality rate among patients after BPLB approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 12,000.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>] Mortality is highest among patients who undergo biopsies of malignant lesions. Cirrhosis is another risk factor as it might lead to fatal bleeding after liver biopsy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The least common of the hemorrhagic complications is hemobilia,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>] which usually presents with the classic triad of gastrointestinal bleeding, biliary pain, and jaundice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] approximately 5 days after the biopsy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>] Other rare complications of BPLB include biliary ascites, bile pleuritis, bile peritonitis, pneumothorax, hemothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumoperitoneum, pneumoscrotum, subphrenic abscess, carcinoid crisis, anaphylaxis after biopsy of an echinococcal cyst, pancreatitis due to hemobilia, and breakage of the biopsy needle.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] None of these complications were encountered in our series.</p><p>We used the modified aspiration (suction) Menghini needles in all patients. Some investigators found that the Tru Cut needle produce has more complications than Menghini needle (3.5/1,000 versus 1/1,000).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>] This may be related to the shorter stay of the needle in the hepatic parenchyma in the Menghini technique, which allows short time for the patient to move minimizing the risk of tearing the capsule.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] However, some authors believe that the risks for both needles are about the same.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>]</p><p>An important question regarding the percutaneous liver biopsy that should be addressed is <italic>blind or ultrasound-guided techniques?</italic> The answer depends on the skills of the gastroenterologist (hepatologist) and on the technical possibilities (accessibility to the ultrasound machine). However, it is still debatable whether ultrasound-guided LB has an advantage over the blind one or not.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>] In a prospective study in France, Cadranel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] showed that from 2084 liver biopsies, only 56% were echo-guided. Also, many studies showed that the complications of LB seem to be related to the type of the technique, blind, or echo-guided, respectively: (1) Younossi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>] showed that the complications appeared in 4% of the cases with &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d; biopsies and in 2% of the cases with &#x0201c;ultrasound-guided&#x0201d; biopsies (the study revealed the cost-effectiveness of echo-guided biopsy); (2) Farrell <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>] showed complications in 1.8% of the cases with &#x0201c;ultrasound-guided&#x0201d; biopsies and in 7.7% of the cases with &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d; biopsies (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05); and (3) Pasha <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>] showed that severe complications occurred in 0.5% of the cases with &#x0201c;ultrasound-guided&#x0201d; biopsies and in 2.2% of the cases with &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d; biopsies (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The same author revealed that the pain appeared more often (50% of the cases) in the &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d; biopsy group as compared with the &#x0201c;ultrasound-guided&#x0201d; biopsy group (37% of the cases, <italic>P</italic>=0.003).</p><p>We believe that BPLB is a safe procedure with some acceptable minor complications. It is not time consuming. No special skills of the gastroenterologist (hepatologist) regarding performing and interpreting ultrasound or technical difficulties (accessibility to the ultrasound machine) are needed. This is of special value in centers where ultrasonography is not readily available all the time or where its use in invasive procedure is limited by the availability of experienced radiologist. The outpatient BPLB is also of great value in saving hospital resources and limiting hospitalization.</p><p>We obtained important histopathological information in 85% of our patients and no significant information in 15%. This finding is nearly similar to that reported by other studies who obtained diagnostically important data in 83% of cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Actually the theoretical risk of liver biopsy in adults has been determined by pooling individual series of liver biopsies. Data on infants from other studies in which the Menghini method was used are difficult to interpret because of insufficient information, and if these are added to our series they raise the total number of patients, which is still too small to eliminate the &#x003b2; error entirely. Our data from one center with only one biopsy technique suggest that BPLB is safe in infants and children. The decision about whether to perform a liver biopsy in an infant should be based on the usefulness of the histological information to be gained as well as on technical considerations. Delay in diagnosis of CLD in infants and children can have serious consequences, and we strongly recommend biopsy without undue delay or hesitation from the pediatrician or the family side.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that BPLB performed by the aspiration Menghini technique is safe even in infants and small children. The patients should have normal coagulation, and there should be no other major contraindications to the procedure. Ultrasound examination of the liver should be performed before liver biopsy. Although the ease and safety of outpatient liver biopsy has been established, the procedure is not trivial. The 24-hrs-post-biopsy significant prolongation of PT needs to be looked into. Close, frequent monitoring of the patient undergoing BPLB is necessary to achieve optimal safety.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
