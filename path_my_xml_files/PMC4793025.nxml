provided by educational institutions for children in their growth phase. We analyzed the
heart rates of children during ski simulator exercise and the Harvard step test to
evaluate the cardiopulmonary endurance by calculating their post-exercise recovery rate.
[Subjects and Methods] The subjects (n = 77) were categorized into a normal weight and an
overweight/obesity group by body mass index. They performed each exercise for 3 minutes.
The cardiorespiratory endurance was calculated using the Physical Efficiency Index
formula. [Results] The ski simulator and Harvard step test showed that there was a
significant difference in the heart rates of the 2 body mass index-based groups at each
minute. The normal weight and the ski-simulator group had higher Physical Efficiency Index
levels. [Conclusion] This study showed that a simulator exercise can produce a cumulative
load even when performed at low intensity, and can be effectively utilized as exercise
equipment since it resulted in higher Physical Efficiency Index levels than the Harvard
step test. If schools can increase sport durability by stimulating students&#x02019; interests,
the ski simulator exercise can be used in programs designed to improve and strengthen
students&#x02019; physical fitness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cardiorespiratory endurance</kwd><kwd>Ski simulator</kwd><kwd>Harvard step test</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human body develops rapidly during childhood and adolescence. During this period,
physical fitness directly affects one&#x02019;s health state and becomes the basis of healthy
adulthood<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, suitable physical
activity in children and adolescents contributes to the development of their physique,
strength, and balance. Many developed countries have national projects designed to encourage
students to enhance their physical fitness, e.g., FITNESSGRAM in the United States, Trimming
130 in Germany, ParticipACTION in Canada, EUROFIT in Europe. Health-related physical fitness
measures were first developed in 2009 in Korea to evaluate students&#x02019; physical strengths
(cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body
fat). The Physical Activity Promotion System (PAPS) is used for continuous management of the
degrees of improvement in physical fitness and activities among elementary, middle, and high
school students through systematic evaluation of their physical fitness as well as the
recommendation of desirable physical activities to the students via their parents and
teachers. A cardiorespiratory endurance test includes stepping, running, and walking, and
its evaluation results are classified into five grades using the heart rate to evaluate
heart function<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The current study focuses
only on the measured physical fitness levels and lacks follow-up management. Efficient
management by exercise programs that provide various benefits should be offered to
elementary school children. In the recent years, studies have been conducted on exercise
machines, such as the simulator, that are used to enhance the muscle strength and
cardiorespiratory endurance, improve flexibility, and reduce body fat<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. These exercises
improve the balance and effectively reduce sports-related injuries<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ski simulator exercises in particular are designed to
mimic snow surface repulsion; hence, they have the advantage of providing resistance. Such
resistance exercises enhance the muscle mass and stimulate muscle strengthening, thus
efficiently aligning the body parts and maintaining good posture. They also improve one&#x02019;s
ability to perform various exercises requiring muscle strength, endurance, and energy; thus,
they can positively influence basic health functions such as metabolism and cardiovascular
functioning<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study on the effects of simulator-based exercises on injury
prevention, Lee et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
training with a ski simulator contributes to increased range of motion and improved
hamstring strength, which help to prevent sports-related injuries. However most previous
studies analyzed the skier&#x02019;s posture<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and some differences were noted between
individuals depending on the exercise intensity and the simulator type. Due to continuous
demand for research in this area, in this study, the heart rate was measured and analyzed
after a ski simulator exercise and the Harvard step test. These exercises have various
effects that can be used to evaluate the cardiopulmonary endurance by calculating the
post-exercise recovery rate. The body mass index (BMI) analysis can provide useful
information. Because simulator exercises improve the muscle strength and endurance, this
study aimed to assess the exercise performance capacity improvements of elementary school
students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Participants included 77 elementary school students (normal weight, 40 students; overweight
and obesity, 37, based on the Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity standards)
with no previous or current foot injury. This study was approved by the ethics committee of
the institutional review board of Pukyong National University. The cohort size was
calculated using the G*power 3.1 version program by Faul et al<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The specifications of the sample calculated by this
analysis was 70 participants with a 0.05 significance level, 0.95 power, and 0.8 effect size

participants and their parents and teachers. The study was conducted at the S Elementary
School in B City. The ski simulators (Pro ski simulator; Slovenia) were fixed onto a flat
surface consisting of a platform on wheels that moved left and right on two bowed parallel
metal rails. Rubber belts fastened the platform to the rails and ensured that it regained
its resting position in the middle of the apparatus. The ski simulator&#x02019;s band elasticity had
a rotation radius of 1&#x02013;6 levels; larger the rotation radius, weaker was the band elasticity.
This study conducted the experiment with two elasticity strength levels. To ensure accuracy,
sufficient time was given to each subject for practice, and then the actual skiing was
performed for 3 minutes. Each subject held a strap in each hand to maintain balance, and a
low intensity ski simulator setting was used for the study. Each participant performed the
Harvard step movements for 3 minutes and then rested in a chair for 3 minutes. The height of
the step box for Harvard step test was 20.3&#x02005;cm, and the steps were performed at a rate of 24
steps per minute. To ensure postural accuracy, each subject was given sufficient time to
practice. A heart rate monitor and a stopwatch were used in this study, and
cardiorespiratory endurance was calculated by the Physical Efficiency Index (PEI) formula
described below.<disp-formula>PEI = D/(2 &#x000d7; P) &#x000d7; 100</disp-formula><disp-formula>D: Duration

groups and the 2 exercises were computed through analysis of the biomechanical factors. Each
subject rested for 10 minutes between the conditions, which were performed in a random order
to avoid compromising the results. The data were statistically processed using the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 23.0. The independent t-test and paired
t-test were used to examine the differences, which were considered statistically significant
at p values &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Using the aforementioned methods, the movement-dependent cardiorespiratory endurance
factors of heart rate and PEI were calculated. There was a significant difference among the

with regard to health over physical strength in terms of motor skills based on the fact that
a decline in the capacities of body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular
strength, and muscular endurance and flexibility significantly increases the probability of
lifestyle diseases and health impairments. One of the most critical elements of physical
fitness is cardiorespiratory endurance. Relying on the kinetic functions of the heart and
lungs, cardiorespiratory endurance refers to the body&#x02019;s ability to continue supplying energy
to the human circulatory system and muscles over extended periods. There have been positive
reports<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> about how advanced
cardiorespiratory endurance not only enables one to engage in aerobic exercises, such as
walking and jogging for a longer time, but also enhances one&#x02019;s academic accomplishments by
improving concentration levels. There are many methods to evaluate cardiorespiratory
endurance considering various aspects such as assessment purpose, targets, and social
influences. A certain method may or may not be superior to another; however, the PAPS
evaluation method is currently considered an optimal standard method. Continued
research<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that a solution is
required to reduce the gaps among the different methods evaluating cardiorespiratory
endurance. In this regard, skiing has developed as a popular health-improving sport that can
facilitate students&#x02019; physical fitness development and provide great exercising benefits. The
ski simulator exercise is a training machine that uses a band to simulate an environment of
reduced resistance force between the snow surface and ski plates. Due to these mechanical
features, the ski simulator exercise is considered to have an effect similar to that of the
elastic resistance exercises. Anderson et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that elastic resistance exercises are more effective for
training small muscle groups, such as the muscles of the neck, shoulders, and arms, as
compared to the strength training exercises using free weights. Elastic bands undergo a
linear increase in tension from the beginning of the contraction to the full range of
motion<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The tension generated may
make it difficult to maintain a balanced posture, thus facilitating the transition to the
next movement with a different heart rate as evident from the PEI data difference between
two groups and exercises. O&#x02019;Loughlin et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> emphasized on the absolute lack of physical activities due to
increased time spent on video games and computers. On the other hand, Kim et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> claimed that the interest in sports can
promote the development of physical fitness by increasing the level of participation in
exercises. The importance of adequate exercising applies to both obese and normal weight
children; therefore, as mentioned in this study, skiing as an ideal sport can be practically
utilized in real-life settings. Taking BMI, physical fitness level, and sport durability
into consideration, this study showed that the ski simulator exercise could produce a
cumulative load even when performed at low intensity. Furthermore, the ski simulator
exercise can be effectively utilized as exercise equipment since it resulted in higher PEI
levels than the Harvard step test. If the schools can increase sport durability by
stimulating students&#x02019; interests, the ski simulator exercise can be practically used in
programs designed to improve and strengthen students&#x02019; physical fitness.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Physical strength analysis of middle school students in
