Background</title><p>Fall is a worldwide health problem among elderly people (<xref rid="A26340R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Approximately 30% of community dwellers aged 65 and older fall annually (<xref rid="A26340R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Falls are not only associated with morbidity and mortality in the older population (<xref rid="A26340R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), but are also linked to poorer overall functioning, low quality of life and early admission to hospitals and long term care facilities (<xref rid="A26340R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Fall prevention programs have been implemented in various forms (<xref rid="A26340R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, most of the previous fall prevention programs are costly and require a lot of time and effort (<xref rid="A26340R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Moreover, they are implemented by trained personnel at luxurious settings. This means that public availability of most programs is not possible (<xref rid="A26340R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="A26340R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Researchers have applied different approaches and strategies to prevent falls among vulnerable elderly people in the community (<xref rid="A26340R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). To meet this public need, the necessity for a home-base exercise program has been proposed by some researchers (<xref rid="A26340R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="A26340R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). For those homebound elderly, application of a home-based exercise training can be an alternative option to prevent falls (<xref rid="A26340R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, there is growing attention towards the application of home-based exercise programs for the elderly (<xref rid="A26340R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="A26340R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Despite obvious advantages of home-base exercise programs, surprisingly, only a few randomized controlled intervention studies on falls have investigated the effects of home-base training intervention for community-dwelling elderly (<xref rid="A26340R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="A26340R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In addition, there have been some drawbacks in previous home-base programs. Most previous home-base interventions still rely on expert personnel who closely supervise their clients (<xref rid="A26340R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and provide them with high standard care at their homes (<xref rid="A26340R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) is one of the most recent home-based exercise training programs. The OEP was first introduced in New Zealand (<xref rid="A26340R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The program is a strength and balance retraining program, combined with walking, known as the OEP (<xref rid="A26340R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The program was designed for three times a week and progressed over time. Four randomized controlled trials, with different settings and timings, disclosed the effects of the program on the elderly.</p><p>The first Otago trial addressed female elderly community dwellers, over the age of 80, who were grouped in exercise and control groups. Physiotherapists who were responsible to attend four home visits over the first two months conducted this OEP. They scheduled the program for 30-minute sessions to be conducted three times a week, plus walking outside the home three times a week. For monitoring purposes, regular telephone contacts were done. In the control group, usual home visits were done and usual home visit care was provided for the clients. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the control and experimental groups in Instrumental Activity of Daily Life (IADL) or the physical self-maintenance scale (<xref rid="A26340R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>In the second trial of the OEP, researchers continued telephone contacts to motivate the subjects in the experimental group to keep up the program (<xref rid="A26340R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). At this time, the researcher merely measured incidence of falls, falls-induced injuries and subjects&#x02019; compliance to the exercise program (<xref rid="A26340R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). According to the results of this study, 44% of the subjects continued the program for two-years (<xref rid="A26340R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). They reported significant reduction in the incidence of falls, although the rate of falls in the first and second year in experimental group was unchanged (<xref rid="A26340R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). One of recommendations of this trial was a booster home visit at the end of the sixth month (<xref rid="A26340R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the third and fourth trials, the OEP was altered to a different model and researchers tried to look at the cost-effectiveness of the program. At this stage the program was delivered by trained district nurses (<xref rid="A26340R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and also included male senior citizens. Moreover, they included subjects of 75 years old and over (<xref rid="A26340R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The content of the exercise program was intact, yet they increased the home visits frequency to weeks one, two, four and eight. Moreover, they planned a booster visit at the end of the sixth month (<xref rid="A26340R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The results of the study revealed that the OEP is beneficial for elderly people. The program failed to decrease the rate of falls in elderly people under 80; however, it successfully reduced the rate of falls among the elderly community dwellers 80 years old and above (<xref rid="A26340R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Moreover, the researchers concluded that the OEP can be cost-effective, especially if trained practice nurses conduct the program (<xref rid="A26340R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec154787"><title>2.

All subjects were 60 years old and above, able to walk at least 10 meters long, had permanent residency in an urban area in the last 12 months and had previous experience of falls. Moreover, they had a female family member (to maintain homogeneity) as a caregiver (aged 18 - 50) who had health literacy. Health literacy was tested by reading an instructional booklet and explaining the content to the researchers. </p><p>Exclusion criteria were acute or chronic disease, which may restrict exercise for subjects. A physician&#x02019;s approval letter was filled by GPs working at the district health centers. Other reasons for exclusion from the study were being unable to walk independently for 10 m, having previous hip replacement surgery or previous history of lower extremities fracture in the last 12 months, severe articular involvement limiting physical activity and recommendations discouraging participation for any reason by an orthopedic surgeon. In addition, elderly people with high vigorous level of activity in the last 12 months were excluded from the study.</p><p>In this study, 12,315 elderly individuals were registered at district health centers, under the health services of Shahroud Medical University (SHMU), IR Iran, from January 2012 to January 2013. Of all registered elderly people, 2,223 subjects attended the district health centers and were interviewed and examined by GPs. However, 1,772 subjects were excluded for different reasons, such as being unwilling to participate in the project, which was either the decision of the client (n = 461) or their caregivers (n = 284), having experience of vigorous activity during the last 12 months (n = 13), not having an eligible caregiver (n = 573), suffering from an acute disease or not approved to participate in the exercise training by the panel doctor (n = 441). The final number of subjects who were selected to participate in the program was 451.</p><p>The number of subjects in both groups who rejected to complete the program at any stage of the program was 144 individuals, of whom 115 were from the experimental group and 119 were from the control group. The total number of subjects who participated in the study for six months was 157 individuals in the control group and 160 in the experimental group, giving a total number of 317 elderly people.</p><p>To recruit and train the executive team, public health Deputy of Dean at SHMU, mobilized general practitioners, nurses and chief health officers in all district health centers participated in a workshop on &#x0201c;Fall in Elderly&#x0201d;. The workshop was run by the same instructor and a package of instructions was provided for the participants. The package included a CD with video clips to instruct on how to do all the clinical exams and interview with the clients and how to fill up the forms and questionnaires. All medical tests were performed by a GP, blinded about the program and subjects in both groups. The inter-rater reliability between the two examiners with the same knowledge and skills was conducted and revealed strong reliability (r = 0.94).</p><p>Subjects in the experimental group received the OEP for six months in the presence of their family caregivers. All training sessions were held at the client&#x02019;s home. In addition to face-to-face education, participants were given a pictorial booklet of all training exercises. They were instructed on how to use the training booklet. A flexible timetable (based on participants&#x02019; preference) in a logbook was arranged for the subjects to allocate 45 to 60 minutes for exercise three times a week. Each OEP session consisted of a five- to ten-minute warm-up, 30- to 40-minute strength training, and five- to ten-minute cool-down training. They were instructed to strictly follow sequences of the training as warm up, exercise and cool down. In order to confirm accuracy of the participants and caregivers performance (monitoring and recording), an orientation session and regular home visits (once a month) were planned. The control group received a booklet on general health for elderly people published by the &#x0201c;Iranian Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education&#x0201d;. All participants&#x02019; family members were allowed to call the researcher during the programme to ask their questions. In addition, the researcher called them frequently to assure if they are using their booklet properly.</p></sec><sec id="sec154789"><title>3.2. Ethics</title><p>The proposal of this study was approved and supervised by the research committee and medical ethic committee of Shahroud University of Medical Sciences. In addition, this randomized control trial was registered with the following ID, IRCT2014012016285N1. All participants, elderly people and their family caregivers, filled the informed consent. They were visited by a panel of doctors to approve safety of training for their clients. Participants were encouraged to call their doctors or researcher in case of any query. Moreover, they were assured that any injury during pre and post-tests at the rehabilitation center would be supported by the university hospital. Moreover, they were assured that all the information would be kept confidential and would not be revealed unless for research purposes and in an anonymous form. Participants were allowed to decline participation at any stage of research, yet they were not allowed to switch from either group to another.</p></sec><sec id="sec154790"><title>3.3. Study Intervention</title><p>This study followed the standard OEP to prevent falls. The Otago university formally validated and approved the study to be conducted in Iran via email. The procedure started with five-minute gentle warm up, continued by 30- to 45-minute exercise activity and finished with a 5 - 10 minute cool down exercise. The exercise protocol included strengthening and balance exercises.</p></sec><sec id="sec154791"><title>3.4. Measurement Outcomes</title><p>Demographic characteristics&#x02019; of the subjects were collected from their health records at the health centers. The outcome measures included &#x0201c;functional capacity&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;physical performance&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;incidence of falls&#x0201d;. All these outcome variables were examined before and after the exercise training program. The functional capacity included, the Berg balance scale (BBS) and the timed up and go test (TUGT). Chair stand test (CST) and arm curl test (ACT) assessed physical performance for each subject.</p></sec><sec id="sec154792"><title>3.5. Berg Balance Scale</title><p>The BBS contains 14 static and dynamic activities (e.g. transfers, standing unsupported and sit-to-stand) and more difficult tasks (e.g. tandem standing, turning 360&#x000b0; and single-leg stance). For scoring, a five-point scale, ranging from 0 - 4 was used. Zero indicated the lowest level of function and four indicated the highest level of function. The total score varied between 0 and 56. In interpretation of BBS, three levels of low, medium and high risk of falls were categorized. Low risk of falls corresponded to scores 41 to 56; medium risk of falls corresponded to scores 21 to 40 and high risk of falls corresponded to scores 0 to 20 (<xref rid="A26340R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec154793"><title>3.6.

A client with normal ability is expected to accomplish the task in less than 12 seconds. A longer time needed to finish the test is considered as impaired TUGT results (<xref rid="A26340R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The client is instructed to start with the following sentence; &#x0201c;When I say &#x02018;go&#x02019; I want you to stand up and walk to the line, turn and then walk back to the chair and sit down again. Walk at your normal pace&#x0201d; (<xref rid="A26340R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec154794"><title>3.7. Chair Stand Test</title><p>The Chair Stand Test, or 30 seconds Chair Stand Test, is a physical performance test used to assess the clients&#x02019; lower-extremity function, which has been shown to predict subsequent development of disability, because it reflects the effects of chronic disease, coexisting conditions and overall physiologic decline. A five-repetition test is a measure of strength while a ten-repetition test is a measure of strength and endurance (<xref rid="A26340R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec154795"><title>3.8. Arm Curl Test</title><p>The ACT is used to measure upper extremity strength, which is assessed by the number of times a weight (0.5 Kg for females and 1 Kg for males) can be lifted (on their dominant hand) in a 30-second time period. The goal of this test is to have the client to perform as many biceps muscle curls as possible in 30 seconds (<xref rid="A26340R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This test should be performed on the dominant arm side (or stronger side). The subject sits on the chair, holding the weight in their hand using a suitcase grip (palm facing towards the body) with their arm in a vertically down position beside the chair. The upper arm against the body should be immobilized, so that only the lower arm is moving (<xref rid="A26340R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).

In addition, in this study, cognitive status was measured by the Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS). This test is routinely applied for elderly people (<xref rid="A26340R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In this study neither of the subjects had severe cognitive impairment. This is because of the exclusion criteria, which excluded subjects with severe dementia and very low cognitive status.

The findings of this study regarding TUGT indicated that more than 85% of the subjects in both groups were suffering from moderate to severe gate disturbances. In addition, the P value for TUGT was 0.39, which rejects differences between baseline results of TUGT in control and experimental groups. In addition, the results of the study regarding BBS indicated that 70 to 75 percent of the subjects were at intermediate to high risk of falls due to balance impairment. The P value result for BBS was 0.16, which rejects there being differences between pre-intervention results of BBS in the control and experimental groups. All outcome variables were not significantly different between subjects in the control and experimental group, indicating that these groups were well matched.</p><p>To ensure fulfilment of the research objectives regarding the effects of exercise training on physical performance, the chi-square test was applied.

Discussion</title><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of OEP to decline the incidence of falls among elderly community dwellers. The main advantage of this study was that the investigation was conducted on a normal community population covering all elderly people from both sexes and both rural and urban communities. The study followed standardized procedures for recruitment of participants, sampling, data collection and baseline assessment for clinical tests and follow-up of the outcomes, using trained research staff. The other advantage of this study was that the study was conducted in a developing country. There are scarce data regarding elderly people in developing countries. Moreover, the key subject of this study was falls. Based on the current knowledge, this is the first RCT on falls prevention in Iran.</p><p>Subjects of the study were recruited from a population of elderly people with experience of at least one episode of fall. Previous falls is a risk factor and predisposing variable for falls among elderly community dwellers (<xref rid="A26340R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The OEP as a home-based exercise designed to be applied for elderly people (<xref rid="A26340R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), can be used for those senior citizens who cannot benefit from luxurious institutional rehabilitation instruments (<xref rid="A26340R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The OEP is a combination of muscle strengthening, balance training, and walking programs for the reduction of falls among senior citizens (<xref rid="A26340R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>The results of this study add to the evidence on the effectiveness of the OEP for senior citizens in Iran. In other words, the results of this study support the hypothesis that a six-month home-based exercise training program, with supervision of a trained family member as a caregiver, can improve physical functioning and functional balance among elderly community-dwellers with a previous history of falls. The findings of this study are in accordance with the results of the systemic review and meta-analysis of Thomas et al. This study was six months in duration; however, the results are consistent with the study of Campbell et al. (<xref rid="A26340R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), which showed that the benefits of OEP can last at least for two years.</p><p>In this study, the OEP was conducted by trained nurses and health officers. Robertson et al. (2001) recommended that OEP should be delivered by nurses (<xref rid="A26340R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It can be as effective as when conducted by physiotherapists yet more cost-effective when nurses deliver the program to the community (<xref rid="A26340R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="A26340R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Moreover, this study did not report any major and/or sever complaint due to exercise. The findings of this study were similar to a research conducted by Matsuda et al. (<xref rid="A26340R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) which showed that home-based exercise training was completely safe.</p><p>Balance as an important outcome of the study improved in subjects of the experimental group (<xref rid="A26340R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). It is likely that impaired balance is a stronger risk factor for falls (Sherrington et al. 2011) (<xref rid="A26340R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This was confirmed by Steadman et al. (2003) (<xref rid="A26340R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), indicating that exercise improves balance and mobility and prevents falls among senior citizens. This study showed that OEP as a home-based exercise can improve functional capacity (BBS and TUGT), as a good predictor for balance. In addition, this study confirmed that OEP can increase subjects&#x02019; physical performance, which is measured by ACT and CST. Rikli and Jones (1999) (<xref rid="A26340R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) stated that CST is a valid instrument for predicting falls among elderly community dwellers, and concluded that strength in lower extremities (measured by CST) is more important than upper extremities in prevention of falls in elderly people. This study measured both upper and lower extremities before and after OEP and the results suggested that OEP can improve physical performance in elderly people.</p><p>There were some limitations that may affect the outcome of this study. The primary limitation of the study was the application of falls self-report profiles. In the data collection, self-reported data are condemned to be reluctant regarding their validity. In some cases, in order to validate falls, the researcher asked the clients&#x02019; caregivers to approve occurrence of falls. In addition, the health condition of the majority of the subjects played a deterrent role for participation in the program.</p><p>This study supports the effectiveness of OEP to improve balance and prevent falls among elderly people. The findings of this study can be more applicable for homebound senior citizens and especially feasible as an alternative for costly high-tech exercises.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We hereby acknowledge the sincere contribution of the deputy for research of Shahroud University of Medical Sciences for financial support of this work and all colleagues, without the participation of whom this study would not have been conducted.
