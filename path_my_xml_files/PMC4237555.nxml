Eligible patients were 18&#x02013;80&#x02009;years of age, had body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;22 to &#x02264;45&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and were inadequately controlled on a stable dose of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) for at least 12&#x02009;weeks prior to the screening visit. Acceptable background therapy prior to enrollment included metformin &#x02265;1500&#x02009;mg as monotherapy [haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &#x02265;8.5 and &#x02264;11%] or dual combination of metformin &#x02265;1500&#x02009;mg with SU, thiazolidinedione (TZD) or glinide (HbA1c &#x02265;7.5 and &#x02264;11%). Eligible patients continued their current metformin treatment &#x02265;1500&#x02009;mg throughout the study. Patients were excluded if they had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &#x02265;15.0&#x02009;mmol/l; significant hepatic, renal or cardiovascular medical conditions; significant laboratory abnormalities; and pregnant or lactating females.</p><p>The study consisted of a 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;week screening period, an up to 12-week titration and/or stabilization period (depending on the type and dose of background OAD at study entry) and a 24-week double-blind treatment period. After screening, eligible patients who were (i) on metformin &#x02265;1500&#x02009;mg plus glimepiride &#x02265;4&#x02009;mg for at least 12&#x02009;weeks proceeded directly to randomization; (ii) on metformin monotherapy &#x02265;1500&#x02009;mg entered a titration and stabilization period for glimepiride up to 4&#x02009;mg; (iii) on any other combination with metformin discontinued their SU, TZD or glinide therapy, and entered titration and/or stabilization for glimepiride up to 4&#x02009;mg. Patients were discontinued from the study if they could not tolerate the prescribed dose of metformin &#x02265;1500&#x02009;mg or glimepiride &#x02265;4&#x02009;mg during stabilization period. Eligible patients with HbA1c &#x02265;7.5 and &#x02264;11% at the end of stabilization period were randomized (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to receive either vildagliptin 50&#x02009;mg bid or placebo in addition to their metformin &#x02265;1500&#x02009;mg plus glimepiride &#x02265;4&#x02009;mg therapy for 24&#x02009;weeks.</p><p>After randomization, the dose of metformin (&#x02265;1500&#x02009;mg) was kept stable. The dose of glimepiride, however, could be adjusted downward for safety reasons at the investigators&#x02019; discretion. Rescue medication (insulin or pioglitazone, per investigator discretion) was prescribed if the patient had FPG &#x0003c;13.3&#x02009;mmol/l between week 6 and 12, FPG &#x0003e;11.1&#x02009;mmol/l between week 12 and 24 or symptoms of worsening of hyperglycaemia at any visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Assessments and Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 or to the final visit. Secondary efficacy assessments included change in FPG from baseline to week 24 endpoint and responder rates achieving HbA1c targets of &#x0003c;7 or &#x02264;6.5%. Safety assessments included recording and monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs); biochemistry and haematology laboratory test results; electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and vital signs. Hypoglycaemia was defined by symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia and a self-monitored plasma glucose measurement &#x0003c;3.1&#x02009;mmol/l. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode that required assistance of another person or hospitalization with or without a plasma glucose measurement &#x0003c;3.1&#x02009;mmol/l.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A sample size of 246 completed patients (123 per arm) would ensure 90% power with a one-sided significance level of 2.5% to declare superiority of vildagliptin 50&#x02009;mg bid over placebo in HbA1c reduction (%) from baseline after 24&#x02009;weeks of treatment, assuming a clinically relevant difference of 0.5 absolute units between treatments and a standard deviation of 1.2%. Assuming a drop-out rate of 15%, about 290 patients (145 patients per arm) were to be randomized with an equal randomization ratio 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to the two treatment groups.</p><p>The adjusted mean changes in HbA1c and FPG from baseline to week 24 were compared between vildagliptin and placebo using an analysis of covariance model with treatment and pooled centre as a classification factor and baseline HbA1c as a covariate. This comparison was performed on full analysis set (FAS) consisting of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had at least one post-randomization efficacy parameter measurement. In addition, responder rates (percentage of patients achieving endpoint HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0 or &#x02264;6.5%) were compared between treatments using a chi-squared test.</p><p>Efficacy data used in the analyses were censored at the start of rescue medication. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to handle missing data because of early discontinuation or data censoring. Safety data were summarized descriptively by treatment. All data of patients who received at least one dose of study medication were included in analysis for safety assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Statement</title><p>This trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. An independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each research site reviewed the study protocol.

The reduction in HbA1c observed in this study is similar to the reductions seen with vildagliptin when used in dual combination with metformin or SU from similar baseline <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. About 30% of vildagliptin-treated patients (almost five-fold greater than in the placebo group) achieved HbA1c of &#x0003c;7% demonstrating that a significant proportion of patients who failed on broadly used dual combination could reach treatment target when vildagliptin was added as a third OAD. Other DPP-4 inhibitors have been studied as well in the combination with metformin and glimepiride. Both sitagliptin and linagliptin in combination with metformin and glimepiride decreased HbA1c by 0.6% compared with placebo from a similar baseline HbA1c of 8.3 and 8.2%, respectively <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, which appears slightly lower than the 0.8% difference versus placebo seen in our study.</p><p>Considerable uncertainty exists regarding optimal treatment for patients in whom glycaemic targets cannot be met with metformin and a SU in combination. Recent meta-analyses conducted to evaluate the benefits of the third antihyperglycaemic agent added to metformin and SU in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on dual therapy demonstrated statistically significant reductions in HbA1c with different drug classes, including insulin (basal, biphasic and bolus), DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogues and TZDs (&#x02212;0.89 to &#x02212;1.17%), but not with meglitinides and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. In light of relatively minor differences in terms of the glucose lowering efficacy between these drug classes, tolerability and absence of weight gain are key factors in the choice of the drug to be added to existing metformin plus SU therapy.</p><p>The addition of a third glucose lowering agent to existing dual therapy with metformin and SU has been associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. This has been demonstrated for TZDs, and GLP-1 analogues. Insulin in triple combination even doubled the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Although DPP-4 inhibitors typically do not increase the risk of hypoglycaemia; in triple combination with metformin plus SU, sitagliptin and linagliptin reported more hypoglycaemic events than placebo, 16.4% versus 0.9% and 22.7% versus 14.8%, respectively. Thus, a slightly higher rate of hypoglycaemia with vildagliptin (5.1%) compared to placebo (1.9%) in our study is consistent with the experience with other DPP-4 inhibitors <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p><p>The risk of hypoglycaemia seen in this study slightly differs from the data recently reported with vildagliptin in combination with insulin. In patients with advanced T2DM not adequately controlled with metformin plus insulin, the addition of vildagliptin 50&#x02009;mg bid provided robust reduction in HbA1c with an incidence of hypoglycaemia similar to placebo <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. The generally low risk of hypoglycaemia in triple combinations might be due to vildagliptin&#x02019;s effect to increase GIP levels between meals and overnight when hypoglycaemia is most likely to occur <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, thereby increasing glucagon levels in hypoglycaemia <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. The slightly greater risk of hypoglycaemia versus placebo with vildagliptin added to metformin plus SU compared to similar incidence of hypoglycaemic events with vildagliptin in combination with metformin and insulin might be due to uncoupling of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 in the presence of SU <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.</p><p>Consistent with other findings from the DPP-4 inhibitors <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> the glucose-lowering effect of vildagliptin was not associated with an increase in weight. In contrast, TZDs or insulin added to metformin plus SU have been associated with an increase in body weight <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p>Ultimately, the clinical objective of treatment intensification is to achieve glycaemic control in as many patients as possible. We were therefore interested which patient group might get closest to this goal and analysed the efficacy and safety in patients having baseline HbA1c &#x02264;8%. The results showed that approximately 40% of patients receiving vildagliptin responded to treatment demonstrating the benefit of triple therapy for this subgroup.</p><p>One limitation of our study is its relatively short 24-week duration. Longer study will be required to assess the durability effect of vildagliptin in triple combination as well as its potential in delaying the time to permanent use of insulin. However, durable glycaemic control with vildagliptin as monotherapy has been demonstrated previously <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, vildagliptin in triple combination with metformin and SU demonstrated robust glucose-lowering efficacy and good safety with low risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. This makes vildagliptin an attractive treatment option for patients with T2DM failing on metformin and SU who require a third antihyperglycaemic agent and are not candidates for an insulin therapy, especially in patients with baseline HbA1c &#x02264;8% as a substantial number of patients in this subgroup achieved treatment targets.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of all the investigators and medical staff at the participating centres.
