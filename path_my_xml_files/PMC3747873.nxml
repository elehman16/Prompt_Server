Strong evidence from our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and that of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) has established that a combination of aerobic and resistance training is effective in reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub>, whereas still others have reported that this combination is more effective than aerobic training or resistance training alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, only few studies specifically address what changes in cardiometabolic factors of exercise training (i.e., changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, body composition) are associated with improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have found that reductions in fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and central adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and increases in fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and muscle strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) are associated with reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after exercise training. In a large (<italic>n</italic> = 251) randomized trial, Larose et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) found that change in cardiorespiratory fitness was the strongest predictor of change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after aerobic and aerobic combined with resistance training. However, with resistance training only, the change in muscle strength was the strongest predictor of the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. In a smaller sample (<italic>n</italic> = 40), Bacchi et al.

Of note, previous studies evaluating the effects of body fat distribution, muscle strength, and fitness on long-term glucose control generally are limited by the absence of a control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), a small sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), or a homogeneous study population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Herein, we performed secondary analyses based on data from the Health Benefits of Aerobic and Resistance Training in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes (HART-D) trial, which investigated the contribution of 9 months of aerobic training, resistance training, or a combination of both interventions on changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Although the purpose of the original HART-D trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) was to evaluate the effect of exercise, the current study expands on the previous findings by investigating the predictors of change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Demographic information was collected by self-report questionnaire.

Additionally, the data suggest that a decrease in central adiposity and an increase in fitness increase the likelihood of achieving a favorable HbA<sub>1c</sub> response (&#x0003e;0.5% decrease) or reducing the number of medications required for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These findings have clinical implications for the design of exercise training programs used to treat individuals with type 2 diabetes because they suggest that a concomitant reduction in central adiposity and increase in fitness should be the main focus of an exercise intervention aiming to improve glycemic control.</p><p>The relationship between the change in central adiposity and change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> is supported by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Bacchi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) found that change in trunk fat mass was the strongest predictor for change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 4 months of aerobic or resistance training alone in patients with type 2 diabetes. Castaneda et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) investigated the impact of resistance training on body composition and glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes and found that a decrease in trunk fat mass was accompanied by a reduction of 1.1% in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after resistance training. Doyon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) reported an association between trunk fat mass measured by DEXA and visceral fat mass measured by CT scan before (<italic>r</italic> = 0.61, <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01) and after (<italic>r</italic> = 0.67, <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01) an intervention of weight loss with or without resistance training in a cohort of obese postmenopausal women. Therefore, loss in visceral fat may, at least in part, be responsible for the reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> observed in the current study because previous research suggests that a reduction in visceral fat improves glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, a study by Giannopoulou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) suggested that exercise is mandatory to decrease visceral fat in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This decrease in visceral fat mass would decrease free fatty acid flux and improve glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), which would improve glycemic control. Secondary analyses revealed that trunk fat mass measured by DEXA was significantly associated with waist circumference (<italic>r</italic> = 0.87, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), which supports that waist circumference is an appropriate surrogate measure to evaluate the improvement in central adiposity from exercise training because trunk and visceral fat mass are not evaluated in most clinical and exercise settings. We also found that a reduction in central adiposity (measured by trunk fat mass or waist circumference) was associated with a reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Additionally, when this reduction in central adiposity occurred with an improvement in estimated METs, it was associated with a greater odds of improving glucose control or decreasing the number of diabetes medications. Therefore, the current results suggest that a reduction in central adiposity is associated with an improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, which is optimized by the concomitant increase in fitness, in individuals with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Of note, the results show an association between the change in fitness (measured by estimated METs) and change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> but not <italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2peak</sub>. The change in cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with a change in estimated METs (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), but the variability between the measures was surprisingly low (&#x0223c;31%, <italic>r</italic> = 0.56). In contrast, in a similar study, Larose et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) showed that cardiorespiratory fitness measured by a <italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2max</sub> treadmill test was a strong predictor of change in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, whereas treadmill time to exhaustion was only marginally associated with a reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. This result is controversial because the current study found a strong association between changes in treadmill time to exhaustion and change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (data not shown [<italic>P</italic> = 0.01 for trend]). The discrepancy between the current results and those of Larose et al. may lie on the statistical analysis strategy used (per group versus combined groups), differences in exercise dose in the combined group (full aerobic and full resistance training versus a reduced dose in HART-D for the combined group), and overall intervention design. Although the specific rationale explaining the lack of a relationship between <italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2max</sub> and HbA<sub>1c</sub> is unknown, the estimated METs and workload on a treadmill are associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Furthermore, other exercise training studies found that reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> are associated with an increase in treadmill time to exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Considering that treadmill time to exhaustion and estimated METs were associated with changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, the current findings may have relevant clinical applications because these fitness measures typically are evaluated in clinical settings. However, the fitness results are especially relevant to exercise clinicians, who should prescribe training programs that can safely promote the greatest reduction in central adiposity and improvement in fitness in individuals with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In the current study, improvement in muscle strength was not related to reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, which is in contrast with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) that found that the combination of resistance and aerobic training were the most beneficial for improvement in glucose control. Perhaps resistance training contributes either to the improvement in fitness or the reduction in central adiposity. In HART-D, the combined training group had the greatest reduction in trunk fat mass, even when compared with the aerobic group, and a significant improvement in treadmill time to exhaustion. In contrast to the current results, Larose et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) reported that change in muscle strength was associated with change in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The observed disparity may be explained by the different muscle limb measurement (upper versus lower) or methodology used to quantify change in muscle strength (one repetition maximum versus Biodex). It has been reported that using dissimilar training and testing modalities might compromise the capability to quantify muscle strength changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Nevertheless, previous studies performed in individuals with type 2 diabetes support our observation. For example, Ishii et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and Iba&#x000f1;ez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) did not observe an association between changes in muscle strength and changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, despite a 16 and 17% increase in muscle strength, respectively.</p><p>A potential limitation of our study is the lack of gold standard measures for visceral fat mass and oral glucose tolerance test, which could have given insight into the mechanism underlying the improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Strengths of our study were the large sample size and the standardized and tightly supervised exercise training session. Another strength was that HART-D participants had excellent compliance (&#x0003e;80%) to exercise training, and we adjusted the analyses for potential confounding variables that may affect HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Finally, the sample was diverse in terms of age, sex, and race/ethnicity (39.3% African American), which makes the findings generalizable, although the overall study group was generally middle-aged, obese, and with relatively poor baseline fitness.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that trunk fat mass and estimated METs are both associated with changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. From a clinical standpoint, the goals behind physical activity programs in individuals with type 2 diabetes should be to maximize the increase in fitness and decrease in central fat mass (especially waist circumference) to reduce HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Future research should investigate the specific mechanisms by which exercise training&#x02013;related increases in fitness and central adiposity reduction improve HbA<sub>1c</sub> in individuals with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
