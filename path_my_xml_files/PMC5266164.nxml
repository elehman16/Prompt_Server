PCOS is characterized by amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, polycystic ovary, infertility, and hyperandrogenemia.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> In addition, the PCOS women, even with regular menstrual cycles, have higher androgen and insulin levels than normal women. The clinical manifestations of PCOS have the characteristics of diversity and complexity, and large number of studies suggest that PCOS could be a combination of environmental factors and multiple genetic abnormalities. Presently, researches have not yet found the determinative gene which determines the pathogenesis and progression of PCOS.</p><p>Methylation modification of DNA is affected by plenty of environmental factors, which regulate the gene expression without altering the primary DNA sequence code.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Methylation modification is a portion of epigenetic mechanism, which is heritable and invertible. Epigenetic includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small-noncoding microRNAs (miRNA).<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> DNA methylation provides the most rigorous demonstration that epigenetic factors could obviously affect the biological characteristics. PCOS pathogenesis and progression are regulated by both genetic and epigenetic factors. That is, the genesis of PCOS is not only related to genetic alterations but also intimately connected with epigenetic changes. Although lots of factors have been proved play a vital role in PCOS progression by scholars and plentiful literatures have explained the mechanism, the DNA modification of ovary granulosa cell (GC) remains unclear.</p><p>Yes-associated protein (YAP1) is known as a pivotal transcriptional co-activator of Hippo pathway, which participates in regulation of tumor pathogenesis, for example, kidney, ovarian cancers, and breast.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Further, YAP1 participates in many signaling pathways that regulate organic morphology, including ovary enlargement that is one of the major manifestations of PCOS. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) showed that the single nucleotide polymorphisms of YAP1 (rs11225161, rs11225138, and rs11225166) were significantly different between PCOS and controls and it appears to be a new susceptibility gene for PCOS.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> YAP1 could combine with a series of transcription factors and act as a modulator through phosphorylation. The potential function of YAP1 on regulating PCOS is reported rarely. Our study aims to elucidate the difference of YAP1 promoter methylation between PCOS patients and health controls.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients and granulosa cells collection</title><p>All the patients and samples were collected from the Reproductive Medical Center of People's Hospital of Henan Province and Zhengzhou University People's Hospital. The study has obtained approval and supervision of Ethics Committee of Henan Provincial People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University. All patients involved in this experiment have signed the informed consent and agreed the research purposes of clinical data and blood samples for our research. All patients enrolled in the study would be recorded general information, including age, height, weight, and gynecologic examination would be done by the same gynecologist. The BMI value of PCOS patients and healthy controls were in the normal range. Women in PCOS group were selected in strict accordance with the Revised 2003 Consensus on Rotterdam Diagnostic Criteria.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Since there were other etiologies for hyperandrogenemia and ovulatory dysfunction, we rigorously selected the PCOS samples as exclusion criteria, including Cushing syndrome, thyroid disease, congenital, hyperprolactinemia, etc. PCOS patients were consistent with healthy controls in the indicators of age and BMI. Reproductive endocrine indexes were detected from peripheral blood at 2nd to 4th days of menstruation by chemiluminescence immunoassay through Cobas e411 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), prolactin (PRL), progesterone, and testosterone.</p><p>GCs were collected from PCOS patients and controls that undergo their first in vitro fertilization embryo transfer. Collection and purification of GCs were mainly based on the density gradient centrifugation which was modified according to the experiment need. When the diameter of 3 or more follicles were above 17&#x0200a;mm, ovulation was induced by administering 4000 to 10,000&#x0200a;UI of human chorionic gonadotrophin (Pregnyl, Organon, Holland). After 35.5 to 37.5&#x0200a;hours, oocytes were obtained through transvaginal ultrasound guided aspiration. After oocyte was retrieved for insemination, the residual follicular fluid was collected and centrifuged as centrifugal separation processes.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> After centrifugation (200&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;g, 10 minutes), precipitate was mixed with hyaluronidase (80&#x0200a;U/mL, SAGE, USA). After incubation (37&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for 30 minutes, cell masses were pipetted and then underlayered with Ficoll-Paque Premium (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT) and were centrifuged (450&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;g, 20 minutes) to separate. Finally, GCs were separated and washed with PBS and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for subsequent using.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>DNA extraction and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP)</title><p>The extraction of DNA was operated through DNA extraction kit (TianGen, Beijing, China) from freezing and thawing GCs in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. Then, bisulfite conversion of DNA (1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g) was manipulated with EZ DNA methylation-gold kit (Zymo, Orange, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After bisulfite treated, the DNA was diluted into concentration of 20&#x0200a;ng/&#x003bc;L. Primers sequence of YAP1 was designed by the MethPrimer,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> which was as following: forward, 5&#x02032;-TAATG TTGAAAATAATGGATTT TT-3&#x02032;, reverse, 5&#x02032;-CCCTT AACTACAAAAAATTCT TC-3&#x02032;. Then, 1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L DNA sample in 15&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L amplification reaction system, including 2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L TaKaRa Taq Hot Start (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), was amplified with PCR. The amplification mode was touchdown PCR and the content was as following: an initial heat-start at 96&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes, 10 cycles (including 95&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x0200a;seconds, 65&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 60&#x0200a;seconds, and 72&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x0200a;seconds for elongation), 30 cycles (including 95&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x0200a;seconds, 65&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 25&#x0200a;seconds, and 72&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 35 minutes for elongation). PCR products were purified by gel electrophoresis separation (Promega, Madison, WI). Purified PCR then was linked into PMD 18-T vectors (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Primer of PMD 18-T plasmid was as following: AGCGG ATAACAATTTCACACAG GA-3&#x02032;. Bigdye sequencing system was as following: 96&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 60&#x0200a;seconds, 25 cycles (including 96&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x0200a;seconds, 50&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x0200a;seconds, and 60&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 4 minutes). Plasmid DNA was extracted and sequenced using DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA).</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA from GCs was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentration was identified by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. The OD value at 260 to 280&#x0200a;nm was measured and the appropriate value was 1.8 to 2.0, which represented that the purity and concentration of RNA samples were up to standard. The reverse transcription reaction total system was 15&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L (containing 1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g RNA). The reaction procedures were 42&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 60 minutes for elongation and 95&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes for enzyme inactivation. Then, cDNA was synthesized and placed on ice for subsequent using. The preliminary primers were synthesized (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). The PCR primer pairs were as following: YAP1, forward: 5&#x02032;-GCTCA GATCCTTTCCTTA AC-3&#x02032;, reverse: 5&#x02032;-GCAGG GTGCTTTGGT TG-3&#x02032;. &#x003b2;-actin, forward: 5&#x02032;-CGACA GTATGCAGAAG GAG-3&#x02032;, reverse: 5&#x02032;-ACATC TGCTGGAAGGTG GA-3&#x02032;. The PCR reaction condition was as following: a pre-denaturation was at 95&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x0200a;minutes and following by at 95&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x0200a;seconds, 60&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x0200a;seconds, 72&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x0200a;seconds and a final elongation step at 72&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x0200a;minutes. The amplification was 40 cycles. The dissolution curve was drawn at 65 to 95&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C. The internal reference was &#x003b2;-actin and the relative expression levels were expressed relative to it, which was calculated with the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Western bloting</title><p>GCs were splited by RIPA Lysis Buffer System (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX). The liquid was transferred into sterile EP tube by Eppendorf and placed on the ice for 15 minutes. Then, it was centrifuged 10,000&#x0200a;rpm for 15 minutes. Protein concentrations were measured by comparison with a known concentration of BCA. A mixture of equal parts of protein and sample buffer was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated protein then was transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Blocking buffer was prepared with TBST and 5% fat-free milk. The PVDF membrane was blocked in blocking buffer for 1&#x0200a;hours on shaking table at room temperature. Primary antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, no. 4912) were diluted (1:1000). &#x003b2;-actin acted as the internal reference. Primary antibodies were diluted by 2% fat-free milk. The PVDF membrane was incubated in the diluted primary antibodies 4&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C overnight and washed with TBST 3 times for 10 minutes. Then, the PVDF membrane was diluted in secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, sc-33732, 1:1000) 4&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C overnight. Finally, the PVDF membrane was washed again with TBST 3 times for 10 minutes. The PVDF membrane was displayed by Image Pro-Plus system (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were expressed as a mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard deviation and analyzed using SPSS software version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

GWAS has showed that the single nucleotide polymorphisms of YAP1 are significantly different between PCOS and controls and it appears to be a new susceptibility gene for PCOS.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Our study aims to detect the methylation status of YAP1 promoter in ovary GCs of PCOS patients and explores the epigenetic factors that motivate the pathogenesis.</p><p>A randomized controlled trial was adopted in our study. Patients who were diagnosed PCOS were enrolled into an experimental group, and an age-matched and BMI-matched control samples were arranged. Endocrine parameters examination shows that these 2 groups have statistic difference on the index of FSH, LH, and testosterone (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). FSH, although the comparison is mildly significant, is lower in PCOS than control group. Combining with clinic manifestation and pathogeny, we conceive of the impact of hormonal in the inducement of PCOS, which will be verified in our subsequent experiments.</p><p>BSP, an efficient methylation detection means, was applied to sequence the methylation status of YAP1 promoter. Results reveal that overall methylation level of YAP1 promoter region from PCOS group is significantly lower than that from control women. Besides, there are 12 CpG sites (&#x02212;443, &#x02212;431, &#x02212;403, &#x02212;371, &#x02212;331, &#x02212;120, &#x02212;49, &#x02212;5, +1, +9, +15, +22), which are significantly hypomethylated in women with PCOS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Furthermore, transcription and translation of YAP1 are elevated in women with PCOS compared with that in control women (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Protein and mRNA of YAP1 are synchronously increased in testing of western blotting and real-time quantitate PCR. The consequence is consistent with the decreased YAP1 methylation status associated with PCOS.</p><p>Our comparative study of different concentration of FSH, LH, and testosterone reveal that LH and FSH concentration variations do not have an obvious effect on YAP1 methylation status. Instead, increasingly concentration of testosterone could alleviate the methylation status and demonstrate obvious dose&#x02013;dependent relation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It has reach a consensus that overproduction of ovarian androgen is a pivotal pathologic feature of PCOS.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Series of intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways involved in PCOS pathogenesis have been impressed by steroidogenesis and androgen.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Prenatal androgen exposure and adolescent studies suggest that early androgen excess acts as an initiating factor of PCOS, but it still needs to confirm these hypothesis relying on convictive evidences.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Scholars have reported long-term interventional studies that lower androgen levels in women with hyperandrogenism might protect against metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> The results suggest that methylation modification of YAP1 is an interaction factor that affects hormone level changes and PCOS. On the basis of our research, we realize that promoter methylation level of YAP1 could be affected by genetic factors and the hormone level of endocrine. The above findings connect the distribution of genetic markers with pathological physiology, which indirectly evidence that the intrauterine origin theory of PCOS.</p><p>Purpose of GWAS is to determine the candidate genes of disease and provide the possible locus of pathogenesis. The effect of locus determined by GWAS lasts a lifetime, but the epigenetic changes are dynamic during growth process.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Studies have suggested that DNA methylation regulation exists in ovarian follicle growth and atresia.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> YAP1, known as a pivotal transcriptional co-activator of Hippo pathway, participates in many signaling pathways that regulate organic morphology, including ovary enlargement that is one of the major manifestations of PCOS.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> YAP1 could combine with a series of transcription factors and act as a modulator through phosphorylation. We examined genetic and epigenetic factors associating YAP1 with PCOS, which have representative significance. We attribute this limitation to our limited sample size and a larger samples research need to explore. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of YAP1 methylation remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>The interaction relationship suggests that hypomethylation of YAP1 is a potential factor susceptibility to PCOS. It should be given more attention and investment to evaluate whether a causal relationship exists between YAP1 hypomethylation status and nosogenesis of PCOS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: This study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81571407) and supported by Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Zhengzhou University.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BSP = bisulfite sequencing PCR, GC = granulosa cell, GWAS = genome-wide association studies, PCOS = polycystic ovary syndrome, YAP1 = yes-associated protein.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: This study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81571407) and supported by Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Zhengzhou University.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Teede</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Deeks</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Moran</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group>
