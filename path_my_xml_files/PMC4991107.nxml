While rehabilitation is typically postoperative, the phase before surgery &#x02013; termed <italic>prehabilitation</italic> &#x02013; is reportedly an ideal time to prepare the patient. There are presently no guidelines for prehabilitation before lumbar fusion surgery. Physical activity has well-known health benefits, and staying physically active despite pain is a major principle in non-pharmacological chronic low back pain treatment. Psychological factors such as fear of movement, pain catastrophizing and low self-efficacy are known to be barriers to staying active. No studies have investigated prehabilitation protocols that promote physical activity and target psychological risk factors before lumbar fusion surgery. The aim of our proposed randomised controlled trial is to investigate whether patients who undergo lumbar fusion surgery for degenerative disc disease experience better functioning with a physiotherapeutic prehabilitation program (PREPARE) based on a cognitive behavioural approach compared to conventional care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We will recruit 110 patients between 18&#x02013;70 years of age with degenerative disc disease who are waiting for lumbar fusion surgery. These patients will be randomly assigned to receive either PREPARE or conventional care. PREPARE uses a person-centred perspective and focuses on promoting physical activity and targeting psychological risk factors before surgery. The primary outcome will be disability measured using the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0. Secondary outcomes will include functioning (patient-reported and performance-based), physical activity (accelerometer), health-related quality of life, back and leg pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, satisfaction with treatment results and health economic factors. Data will be collected at baseline (preoperatively) after the intervention (preoperatively), 3 and 8&#x000a0;weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 60&#x000a0;months postoperatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We hypothesise that the focus on promoting physical activity and targeting psychological risk factors before surgery will decrease disability and help the patients to be more active despite pain both before and after surgery. We will use a combination of outcome measures both patient-reported and performance-based, as well as accelerometer data. This will provide a more comprehensive picture of the patient&#x02019;s functioning than just patient-reported outcomes alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN17115599">ISCRTN17115599</ext-link>, Retrospectively Registered 18 May 2015.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Prehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Spinal fusion surgery</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Cognitive behavioural approach</kwd><kwd>Person-centred</kwd><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Eurospine Research Grants</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Swedish Research Grants</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Health and Medical Care Executive Bord of the V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;&#x000e4;taland</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a subgroup of chronic low back pain (CLBP). When pain and disability are severe, lumbar fusion surgery can be an option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The frequency of lumbar spinal fusion surgery is increasing worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In 2008, DDD was the most common diagnosis prior to spinal fusion surgery in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In 2013, the Swedish Spine Register recorded 8144 patients with degenerative lumbar spine disorders, of which approximately 10&#x000a0;% had a primary diagnosis of DDD or isthmic spondylolisthesis and underwent lumbar fusion surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The DDD group is an interesting study group for several reasons. They are relatively young [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and their lack of functioning has hence a large impact on their life and on society. Clinical experience dictates that most patients choose fusion surgery to enable them to continue to work and to live an active life.</p><p>While rehabilitation traditionally starts postoperatively, the phase before surgery &#x02013; termed <italic>prehabilitation</italic> &#x02013; is suggested to be an ideal time to prepare patients for an optimal outcome of surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A small number of studies of low-quality suggest that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions before and after lumbar fusion, and hence best practice remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We lack guidelines for the pre and post-operative phase for this patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but there are national and international guidelines for conservative or non-pharmacological treatment for patients with CLBP. These guidelines incorporate major treatment principles, such as to stay active despite pain along with supervised exercise therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and multidisciplinary treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is no reason to believe that patients with DDD would not benefit from the same treatment principles.</p><p>The benefits of staying or becoming more physically active are manifold. The major underlying rationale is the effect of physical activity on general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. On a global level physical inactivity is one of the global burdens, leading to premature death and non-communicable diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is hence important to promote physical activity in all conditions, patients with CLBP alike. Patients with DDD who choose to undergo surgery have experienced pain for several years, and 52&#x000a0;% of them reported that they are able to walk less than one kilometre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, there are presently little data regarding physical activity levels in this patient group. In addition to its general health benefits, physical activity has an analgesic effect that likely involves several partially overlapping mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The hypoalgesic effect of exercise on pain is usually reduced in patients with &#x0201c;more general&#x0201d; chronic pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the exercise-induced hypoalgesic effects in patients with CLBP are reportedly similar to those in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It would hence be of value to promote physical activity for patients with DDD.</p><p>There are various reasons for not being physically active. One factor is the perception and attitude towards exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Another factor is fear of movement. This factor has been identified as an important mediator in combination with catastrophizing thoughts regarding disability, disuse and depression in patients with CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It appeared that 70&#x000a0;% of the patients with CLBP who visited an orthopaedic department in Sweden for a potential fusion surgery reported kinesiophobia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Even though the prevalence of kinesiophobia among patients with DDD is unknown, research suggests that the prevalence of kinesiophobia in patients with specific CLBP is similar to that in patients with non-specific CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, pre-surgical psychological status such as pain catastrophizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], negative outcome expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and fear-avoidance beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] have been found to be significant predictors of pain and function up to 2&#x000a0;years after lumbar surgery. Hence, we hypothesise that the majority of persons who are waiting to undergo surgery for DDD suffers from a high degree of pain, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing and low self-efficacy &#x02013; and all of these factors may contribute to a low physical activity level. Hence, an intervention using a cognitive behavioural approach could be appropriate to target these risk factors. Given the multidimensional nature of pain, rehabilitation programs based on cognitive-behavioural therapies (CBT) have been specifically recommended for patients with CLBP and are often used in addition to other therapies such as exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Although the importance of post-lumbar surgery rehabilitation programs targeting the above-mentioned psychological factors have been emphasised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], so far only two programs have yielded successful outcomes following lumbar fusion surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Abbott et al. compared postoperative psychomotor therapy with exercise therapy in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that included 107 patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery for spinal stenosis, spondylosis, degenerative/isthmic spondylolisthesis or DDD. The psychomotor therapy program combined motor control exercises for lumbopelvic stabilisation with a cognitive behavioural intervention immediately after surgery. This treatment was more effective compared to exercise therapy in reducing disability and fear-avoidance beliefs and in increasing self-efficacy and outcome expectancy at 2 and 3&#x000a0;years post-surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Another recent RCT compared a rehabilitation program including active exercise alone with a treatment combining active exercise with the management of catastrophizing and fear of movement among 130 patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery for degenerative spondylolisthesis and/or lumbar spinal stenosis. The combined rehabilitation program showed superior disability reduction measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at the 1-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>These prior investigations have been performed after lumbar fusion surgery. However, some authors hypothesise that further optimisation of lumbar fusion surgery outcomes may be possible by initiating an intervention <italic>before</italic> surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Nielsen et al. found their intervention to be superior to conventional care with regards to postoperative functionality assessed by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, faster recovery and shorter hospital stay. The content of the intervention was an individualised preoperative training program that focused on improvement of muscular back strength as well as cardiovascular conditioning before spinal fusion surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, at the start of our trial (2014), no prior study had assessed the use of a prehabilitation program with individual sessions to target psychological risk factors &#x02013; such as fear-avoidance beliefs and low self-efficacy &#x02013; to maintain or increase physical activity both before and after surgery. Therefore, we initiated an RCT to evaluate a physiotherapeutic prehabilitation program called PREPARE (<italic>Pre</italic>habilitation, <italic>P</italic>hysical <italic>A</italic>ctivity and exe<italic>R</italic>cis<italic>E</italic>).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The overall aim of the trial is to investigate whether PREPARE &#x02013; a physiotherapeutic prehabilitation program based on a cognitive behavioural approach &#x02013; will improve functioning after lumbar fusion surgery in patients with DDD compared to conventional care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypotheses</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Patients who receive PREPARE &#x02013; a physiotherapeutic person-centred prehabilitation program based on a cognitive behavioural approach &#x02013; before spinal fusion surgery will experience decreased disability levels, improved functioning, increased physical activity level, better health-related quality of life, decreased leg and back pain intensity, less pain catastrophizing, less pain-related fear, increased self-efficacy to exercise and less depressed mood after surgery compared to patients who receive conventional care.

Participants will be randomised to one of the two arms of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Theoretical Framework</title><p>The PREPARE program combines different philosophical standpoints, theoretical models and treatment principles.</p><p>Pain is defined as <italic>&#x0201c;an unpleasant and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and is hence to be considered a subjective phenomenon. As PREPARE rests on the assumption that pain is subjective, we will apply the principles of person-centred care (PCC). In PCC, emphasis is placed on recognising the patient as a human being with reason, will, feelings, and need, and on engaging the patient as an active partner in his/her care and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The most important parts in PCC is the partnership between the patient and the therapist and to formulate a health plan together with the patient which includes both short-and long-term goals along with the actions needed to reach each goal.</p><p>Modern pain research has led to a shift in treatment strategies, from pain reduction to pain management with a focus on teaching patients to manage their thoughts (cognitive component) and feelings (affective component), which are both pain-related components. PREPARE will target fear-avoidance beliefs, as well as self-efficacy, which are regarded as important for a person&#x02019;s ability to stay active despite pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For patients of working age with LBP, evidence suggests that treatment should include cognitive behavioural techniques combined with physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Self-efficacy is a concept that explains a person&#x02019;s confidence in their ability to perform a specific activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In patients with LBP, both self-efficacy and fear-avoidance beliefs are possible predictors of disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, since it remains unclear how these two constructs differ in predicting disability, it is suggested that therapists measure and consider both constructs when treating patients with LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. To achieve this, the physiotherapist will use a combination of techniques based on a cognitive behavioural approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents an overview of the fear-avoidance model including the mediating role of self-efficacy.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The fear-avoidance model with the mediating role of self-efficacy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2016_1203_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants</title><p>We will recruit a total of 110 patients of 18&#x02013;70 years of age, who have major complaints of DDD: CLBP of motion-elicited type degenerative changes of 1-3 segments of the lumbar spine, reproducible pain in clinical examination assessed to originate in the same segment as demonstrating degenerative changes, and on the waiting list for lumbar fusion surgery.

The trial will exclude patients who have undergone previous decompression surgery for spinal stenosis or who have spinal malignancy, dominating radiculopathy, a confirmed neurological disorder or rheumatic disorder, deformities in the thoracolumbar spine (e.g. idiopathic scoliosis), or a poor understanding of the Swedish language.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment and randomization</title><p>Trial participants will be recruited from two private spine clinics and one university hospital.

To this date, two studies have been published within the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We would like to clarify the similarities and differences in order to argue for the added value of our planned trial, PREPARE. All three of the studies were set up with RCT designs, and disability was one of the primary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Disability is however measured somewhat differently in the various studies. Nielsen et al. used the term functionality, which was assessed by the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and two performance-based outcome measures (the Sit-to-stand test and the Timed-up-and-go test) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Rolving et al. used the ODI as the primary patient-reported outcome measure but did not use any performance-based outcome measures of functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In PREPARE we use a combination of outcome measures (patient-reported and performance-based outcome measures as well as accelerometer data). We would argue that this will provide a more comprehensive picture of the patient&#x02019;s functioning as reflected in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p>The intervention programs in the three studies mentioned above vary somewhat in the underlying theoretical models and content. PREPARE is being performed from a person-centred perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In concrete terms, it means that we have set up person-centred treatment sessions on a one-to-one basis. This is in line with the trial from Nielsen et al. in which the healthcare professional met the patient on an individual basis before surgery. In their intervention program, the patient met with the physiotherapist on two occasions, at the day of inclusion and two weeks before surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In order to gradually challenge the patient&#x02019;s cognitive beliefs and to facilitate the patient&#x02019;s self-efficacy in relation to staying active despite pain, we have included four sessions and one booster session.</p><p>As argued for in the introduction section, the main principle of our prehabilitation program is to help the patients to stay active despite pain. Both Nielsen et al. and Rolving et al. seem to have built their prehabilitation program on the same principle. Nielsen et al. investigated the effect of an individualised preoperative training program that focused on improvement of muscular back strength as well as cardiovascular conditioning before surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Rolving et al., on the other hand, had a stronger cognitive behavioural focus of their intervention program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The relevance of the pre-surgical psychological status is an important determinant of surgical outcome in PREPARE. In accordance with the modified fear-avoidance model, we hypothesise that by trying to influence catastrophizing thoughts and patient&#x02019;s self-efficacy beliefs to exercise the patients in the intervention group will increase their level of functioning and physical activity level. In addition, in PREPARE we combine cognitive behavioural techniques with physical activity goal setting which we argue is a major strength that will further help the patients to be more active despite pain both before and after surgery.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>Participant recruitment started in April 2014 and is planned to continue until December 2016.
