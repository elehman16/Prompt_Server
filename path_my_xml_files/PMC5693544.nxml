However, the design of preload studies is complex, with many methodological considerations influencing appetite responses. The aim of this pilot investigation was to determine acceptability, and optimise methods, for a future satiety preload study. Specifically, we investigated the effects of altering (i) energy intake at a standardised breakfast (gender-specific or non-gender specific), and (ii) the duration between mid-morning preload and ad libitum lunch meal, on morning appetite scores and energy intake at lunch.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Participants attended a single study visit. Female participants consumed a 214-kcal breakfast (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) or 266-kcal breakfast (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), equivalent to 10% of recommended daily energy intakes for females and males, respectively. Male participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) consumed a 266-kcal breakfast. All participants received a 250-ml orange juice preload 2&#x000a0;h after breakfast. The impact of different study timings was evaluated in male participants, with 10 males following one protocol (protocol 1) and 10 males following another (protocol 2). The duration between preload and ad libitum lunch meal was 2&#x000a0;h (protocol 1) or 2.5&#x000a0;h (protocol 2), with the ad libitum lunch meal provided at 12.00 or 13.00, respectively. All female participants followed protocol 2. Visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaires were used to assess appetite responses and food/drink palatability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Correlation between male and female appetite scores was higher with the provision of a gender-specific breakfast, compared to non-gender-specific breakfast (Pearson correlation of 0.747 and 0.479, respectively). No differences in subjective appetite or ad libitum energy intake were found between protocols 1 and 2. VAS mean ratings of liking, enjoyment, and palatability were all &#x0003e;&#x02009;66 out of 100&#x000a0;mm for breakfast, preload, and lunch meals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The findings of this pilot study confirm the acceptability of this methodology for future satiety preload studies. Appetite scores increased from preload to ad libitum lunch meal; however, no specific differences were found between protocols. The results highlight the importance of considering energy intake prior to preload provision, with a gender-specific breakfast improving the correlation between male and female appetite score responses to a morning preload.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Appetite</kwd><kwd>Preload</kwd><kwd>Satiety</kwd><kwd>Study design</kwd><kwd>Optimisation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Roquette Freres</institution></funding-source><award-id>n/a</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hobden</surname><given-names>Mark R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">There is appreciation for the importance of intervention development, and pilot/feasibility, studies in scientific research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Until recently, much of this preliminary work, including decision-making processes, methods optimisation and formal testing prior to a full-scale study, has gone unreported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, data generated from such studies is of interest to the scientific community, most notably for those individuals undertaking similar research. Pilot studies provide data to promote scientific rigour and ensure that future study protocols are optimised to best investigate their aims and objectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Illnesses associated with lifestyle factors, such as unhealthy eating habits and behaviours, are estimated to be responsible for 40% of all deaths in the UK and cost the National Health Service in excess of &#x000a3;11 billion each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Accordingly, the effects of food and food ingredients on satiety and weight management are a key focus in nutrition research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Preload study designs, in which the food or ingredient of interest is consumed a fixed duration before the provision of an ad libitum meal, are often used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Satiety, defined as &#x02018;the feeling of fullness that persists after eating, potentially suppressing further energy intake until hunger returns&#x02019;, can be measured using subjective ratings and ad libitum meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. When designing preload studies, researchers must decide on the most suitable fixed duration between preload and the ad libitum meal. This decision is influenced by previous knowledge of the satiating effects of the test product and/or an understanding of the theorised physiological mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, another important consideration is what time the ad libitum meal is provided in relation to habitual intake and circadian body clock, with subjective appetite ratings and plasma ghrelin concentrations known to correlate with habitual meal timings and rise in anticipation of eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Researchers must also consider what foods and/or drinks are to be consumed by participants before the preload. Not all study designs involve food/drink consumption before preload provision, however, in certain study designs a standardised meal is given before preload. For example, if the preload is consumed mid-morning then a standardised breakfast is often provided. Many previous studies have used the same breakfast for all participants, irrespective of gender or individual differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, recommended dietary energy intakes are higher for males (adult men, 2605&#x000a0;kcal/day) than females (adult women, 2079&#x000a0;kcal/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, post-prandial appetite responses to a standardised meal have been shown to differ between men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Accordingly, it can be postulated that altering the amount of energy provided at a fixed meal prior to preload provision, to reflect recommended energy intakes by gender, may improve the correlation between men and women for appetite and energy intake responses. Indeed, this might be especially important for breakfast, with evidence that breakfast meal choice and specifically, differences in energy/macronutrient content and physical size, may impact on subsequent appetite and ad libitum energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To our knowledge, no studies to date have investigated the comparative effects of providing a gender-specific or non-gender-specific energy intake at breakfast on appetite responses and ad libitum energy intake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par15">The current pilot study was conducted to optimise methods for a future human intervention study investigating the effects of a non-digestible carbohydrate on satiety.

Participants provided informed written consent before enrolment on the study. Inclusion criteria were body mass index (BMI) 21&#x02013;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; free of disease and currently not taking any medication (excluding contraceptives), no antibiotic usage for &#x0003e;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;months prior to beginning the study, and resting blood pressure (&#x0003c;&#x02009;160/90&#x000a0;mmHg). Participants were non-smokers and bodyweight stable. Female participants self-reported as non-pregnant. Participants had no self-reported history of alcohol or drug misuse.

Participants were also provided with two chocolate sandwich bars (125&#x000a0;kcal each) and were given the option to eat both, one, or none of these. Per 100&#x000a0;g, the ready meal provided 160&#x000a0;kcal, 15&#x000a0;g carbohydrate, 6&#x000a0;g protein and 8&#x000a0;g fat, and the chocolate bars provided 435&#x000a0;kcal, 51&#x000a0;g carbohydrate, 5&#x000a0;g protein and 23&#x000a0;g fat. Participants were asked to consume exactly 300&#x000a0;ml of water, but no other food or drink, following the evening meal and before going to bed. On the morning of the study visit, participants were asked to consume exactly 200&#x000a0;ml of water, but no other food or drink, before arrival. Participants refrained from strenuous exercise and alcohol consumption the day prior to the study visit, as both are evidenced to modify appetite regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Participants were asked to arrive for the study visit in plenty of time to start at 07.15 (group 1) or 07.45 (groups 2&#x02013;4). A standardised breakfast was then provided at precisely 07.45 or 08.15, respectively.

A breakfast of toast and jam was chosen for this pilot study as it is a popular breakfast choice, was likely to be well tolerated by participants, and was a quantity that, according to the researchers, could ensure that participants would be suitably hungry at the ad libitum lunch meal. Two hours after receiving the breakfast meal, all participants consumed a 250-ml preload drink of commercially available orange juice (117&#x000a0;kcal). A pasta-based lunch meal was served ad libitum to the participants 2&#x000a0;h (group 1) or 2.5&#x000a0;h (groups 2, 3 and 4) after the preload<italic>.</italic> Per 100&#x000a0;g, the lunch meal provided 141&#x000a0;kcal, 22&#x000a0;g carbohydrate, 5&#x000a0;g protein and 3&#x000a0;g fat. The pasta meal was cooked in batches of dry farfalle pasta (500&#x000a0;g), microwavable tomato and basil sauce (760&#x000a0;g), olive oil (40&#x000a0;ml) and grated parmesan cheese (50&#x000a0;g). Participants consumed the lunch meal in a laboratory controlled isolated eating environment. Whilst this is not a normal eating environment, eating in the company of other people is known to influence eating behaviours, which would increase the variability in food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Before commencing the meal, the researcher instructed the participant to &#x0201c;continue eating until you feel comfortably satisfied&#x0201d;. Pasta (approximately 400&#x02013;500&#x000a0;g) was served warm in weighed bowls. Every 5&#x000a0;min a fresh bowl of pasta was provided to the participant and the bowl containing the leftover pasta was removed.

The questionnaire assessed hunger, desire-to-eat, satiety, fullness and prospective food consumption (PFC) through the following questions: how hungry do you feel?; how strong is your desire to eat?; how satiated (i.e. pleasantly satisfied) are you?; how full do you feel?; how much food do you think you can (or would want to) eat?

Following each study meal (breakfast, preload and lunch), participants also completed a VAS questionnaire on the palatability of the study meal/preload provided. This included questions on perceived taste, palatability and enjoyment. For each VAS question, a numerical score of between 0 and 100&#x000a0;mm was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par25">A sample size of 10 participants per group was chosen based on guidelines for pilot studies by Isaac and Michael [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; however, a formal a priori power calculation was not performed. All data were analysed using Predictive Analytics Software version 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Somers, NY, USA). Data were checked for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test.

Segmental AUC values were analysed by a one-way ANOVA, with pre-breakfast values, BMI category (normal weight or overweight) and stage of menstrual cycle (females only) used as covariates. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation analysis was used to determine (i) the correlation between the different VAS measures of satiety and motivation-to-eat, and the correlation in appetite score ratings between the groups.

Whilst no data was collected specifically to test study acceptability, we believe that fundamental aspects of the study protocol, including questionnaires, clinical environment, and study logistics, were well accepted by both the researchers and the participants. Moreover, all study meals were well received, with mean scores of food/drink enjoyment, palatability and liking, all &#x0003e;&#x02009;66 out of 100. These meals are therefore suitable for future studies. The palatability and liking of ad libitum meals is especially important to ensure that true satiation is reached rather than a cessation of the meal due to a disliking of the foods provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The study investigated the satiety effects of altering energy intake at breakfast (gender-specific compared to non-gender specific) and study timings on subjective satiety and ad libitum energy intake at the ad libitum lunch meal. Neither energy intake at breakfast nor the different study timings, significantly altered any of the subjective measures of appetite (hunger, satiety, desire-to-eat, prospective food consumption, fullness or appetite score) or ad libitum intake at lunch.</p><p id="Par34">As previously reported, there were strong correlations between the VAS measures of appetite used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, appetite score ratings were more closely correlated between male and female participants when female participants consumed a gender-specific energy intake at breakfast of 214&#x000a0;kcal compared to a non-gender-specific energy intake at breakfast of 266&#x000a0;kcal. Thus, it might be desirable in future mixed-gender studies to adjust the energy provision at the study meals, notably the breakfast meal, to reflect differences in recommended dietary intakes of men and women. An alternative option, and something that was not investigated in the current study, is to provide an energy intake and type of breakfast food that reflects individual differences in habitual intake. Indeed, some studies have accounted for differences in habitual breakfast energy intake, and thus potential gender-specific variations, by asking the participants to self-select their own breakfast portion at the first study visit and then standardise this across all other study visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Provision of a standardised meal the day before each study visit provides greater control of nutritional intakes of the participants prior to each visit; however, it does mean that intakes may not be reflective of habitual intake. Here, energy content of the evening study meal was not adjusted for gender differences. In future investigations, the provision of a gender-specific energy intake at the evening meal may further improve the correlation in appetite measures between males and females during the study visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the current study, participants were given the option of 2, 1 or none chocolate bars with the ready meal. This choice should be removed in future studies to standardise this meal across study visits.</p><p id="Par36">The authors are aware of several limitations of this pilot study. Firstly, the low number of participants (10 in each arm) and the parallel study design, meant that the study lacked statistical power. Importantly, the number of participants required to achieve the same statistical power is considerably less with a within subject (paired) study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, cross-over design studies have their own potential drawbacks in satiety research. Most notably, in an ad libitum meal scenario, it has been shown that participants consume more food at a second study visit when compared to the first study visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This carry-over effect is likely due to familiarity with the food/eating environment. Another limitation of the current study, is that while it investigated the effects of the different protocols (1 and 2) on appetite responses, it is probable that the preload to lunch durations investigated here were too similar (only 30&#x000a0;min different) to observe any significant differences in subjective measures or ad libitum energy intake. Nevertheless, the main objectives of this pilot study were to test logistics and assemble data for optimisation of future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">The current pilot study was an important step in the development of a future satiety preload intervention study. In conclusion, the methods utilised in this pilot study are acceptable for future use. Moreover, a gender-specific energy intake at breakfast improved correlation in appetite scores between male and female participants, which is especially important if mixed populations are being investigated. Accordingly, a gender-specific, or individual-specific, energy intake at breakfast will be utilised in future investigations. Preload to ad libitum meal duration, and time of ad libitum meal provision, were not found to alter satiety or ad libitum energy intake; however, this is not surprising given the close similarities in protocols used and a lack of statistical power.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p id="Par5">Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p id="Par6">Area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par7">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFC</term><def><p id="Par8">Prospective food consumption</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par9">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TFEQ</term><def><p id="Par10">Three-factor eating questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par11">Visual analogue scales</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par38">The research project was funded by Roquette.
