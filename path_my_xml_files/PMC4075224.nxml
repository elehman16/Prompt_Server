Conforming to the established practice, we tried various early mobilization protocols after zone II flexor tendon repair. As these protocols demanded a level of understanding and a degree of dedication from the patients, our results were suboptimal, with a high incidence of proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) joint flexion contractures and tendon ruptures.</p><p>Hence, in our Institute &#x0201c;Immobilization&#x0201d; became the norm for patients who were not expected to be compliant. To improve the results in such patients, we thought of implementing a new rehabilitation protocol that could entirely be under the control of the therapist, without the active participation of the patient.</p><p>Ultrasound therapy is being used safely after tendon repair, during the remodeling phase (after three weeks) as an adjunct to mobilization to improve the tendon gliding. We thought of using this mode of treatment during the earlier phase of tendon healing.</p><p>The effects of ultrasound on tissues were demonstrated in many <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Such findings formed the basis, for the use of ultrasound to accelerate tendon healing and to prevent adhesions.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Though many clinical trials on animals are reported in the literature, there is no clinical study in the humans regarding the use of ultrasound during the early healing phase of the repaired tendons.</p><p>Encouraged by the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] we conducted the trial by selecting the patients at random and administered pulsed ultrasound therapy of different frequencies and intensities.

After surgery, patients were allocated to ultrasound therapy, as demonstrated in the CONSORT guideline flowchart [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The patients were asked to draw a card indiscriminately from an envelope containing a pack of cards labeled as ultrasound or immobilization in 2:1 ratio. This was to ensure more number of patients for our interventional ultrasound therapy. Thus, the treatment groups were randomized and the therapists had no control over the selection of the patients.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPS-47-85-g001"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Immobilization protocol</title><p>After surgery, hands were immobilized for 3 weeks using dorsal slab with wrist kept in neutral position, MP joints in 70 degrees flexion and IP joints in extension.

The ANOVA test was performed using the statistical tools available in Origin 8.5.1 scientific data analysis software. This test compares the mean values of the distribution assuming equal variance for all the data [Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">b</xref>]. The result of this analysis shows that there is statistically significant improvement of score (using <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 criteria) in ultrasound protocols compared to immobilization. However, when only the three ultrasound methods are compared, the <italic>P</italic> value is 0.066, which is slightly larger than the 0.05 criteria. Hence, there is a 6.6% probability that the difference in the mean value between the ultrasound Group 1 method and the other two methods may be due to chance factor. Since the <italic>P</italic> value is only slightly larger than the 0.05 level, further investigations with a larger data set and more variation in parameters such as ultrasound intensity, duration of exposure, etc. may reveal their beneficial effects on the improvement of outcome.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3a</label><caption><p>One-way mean anova (F test)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPS-47-85-g005"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 3b</label><caption><p>One-way mean anova (F test)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPS-47-85-g006"/></table-wrap><p>The <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3a</xref> reveals that the best mean score of 78.4 &#x000b1; 16.6 was achieved in ultrasound Group 1 protocol.</p><p>The mean scores of Group 2 and Group 3 protocols are 70.8 &#x000b1; 14.38 and 70.8&#x000b1;13.39, respectively, which are more or less identical. A significant finding in the ultrasound (Group 1) treated patients was that, extensor lag was minimal in all cases, and only 2 patients required passive stretching after six weeks. The percentage of patients left with residual PIP joint flexion contracture in all the ultrasound groups, is much less compared to the immobilization group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 4</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Incidence of PIP JOINT flexion contracture</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPS-47-85-g007"/></table-wrap><p>The scars became soft and supple in the ultrasound-treated patients much earlier than patients treated with the immobilization protocol [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The scars in the fingers and palm became soft and supple as early as 3 weeks.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPS-47-85-g008"/></fig><p>Wound dehiscence was observed in 3 patients in ultrasound (Group 3) protocol and for 1 patient in ultrasound (Group 2) protocol.

No further ultrasound therapy was given.</p><p>Tendon rupture was observed in 2 patients in ultrasound therapy (Group 3) protocol after 3 weeks. Both attained good results as early as, at the commencement of the mobilization. After this experience, in cases showing good results at 3 weeks itself, we did not increase the intensity further and adjusted the intensity according to the patient's response.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The therapeutic effects of ultrasound are many folds. Various studies have proved that ultrasound enhances healing.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Gan, Huys <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effects of ultrasound on repaired flexor tendons of the chicken limbs. They found that administration of ultrasound resulted in increased range of movement, advancement of scar maturation and reduction of the amount of inflammatory infiltrate. There was no adverse effect on tensile strength and that early administration was more beneficial than late.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Though high-intensity ultrasound has tissue destructive effects, low intensities may enhance the healing process of the surgically repaired tendons.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Its effects on decreasing peritendinous adhesions,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and enhancement of collagen fibrils maturation independent of the intensity applied[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] can explain the improved results obtained in this study.</p><p>The factors that determine the ultrasound energy delivered at the tissue level are the frequency, the pulse ratio, the intensity of the ultrasound and the duration of therapy. Appropriate titration of these factors as done in this study will ensure the safety of this modality of treatment. The results of ultrasound therapy (Group 1) are better compared to other ultrasound therapy groups. Starting of the ultrasound therapy from the seventh day is safer, as the tensile strength of the wound increases from the seventh post operative day and the repaired skin wound will be strong enough to withstand the effects of ultrasound.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In our study, wound dehiscence was noticed in the other two groups, when ultrasound was started on the third or the fifth day.</p><p>It has been reported by Gelberman and his associates that peak fibronectin concentration and development of adhesions start by the seventh day.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Administration of ultrasound at this time would be ideal and safe to break down early adhesions before they get organized. Nil percentage of extensor lag in this group adds strength to this statement.</p><p>Relatively reduced percentage of excellent results was observed in the ultrasound therapy (Group 2) protocol. This can be explained by the fact that, lesser the frequency and intensity the lesser will be the absorption of ultrasound energy by the tissues. As the intensity was reduced to 0.3 w/cm<sup>2</sup>, the effective energy delivered to the repaired flexor tendons might be less than optimal.</p><p>The results of 3-MHz ultrasound (Group 3) are worse compared to 1-MHz (Group 1 and Group 2) with nil percentage of excellent results and 7% of ruptures. When the frequency of ultrasound is high, there will be rapid absorption of ultrasound energy in the superficial tissues. Ultrasound energy absorption is highest for tissues with high collagen content. The absorption coefficient of tendon is 1.12 decibels/cm for 1 MHz and 3.36 decibels/cm for 3 MHz. The repaired flexor tendon, being superficial and highly collagenous, might have been unable to withstand high energy absorption and concentration during the early phase of healing. This could result in tendon ruptures and gap formation. Nil excellent results in the ultrasound therapy (Group 3) protocol might be due to gap formation.</p><p>Tim Watson (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.electrotherapy.org">www.electrotherapy.org</ext-link>) suggested ideal frequencies and intensities of ultrasound for various anatomical regions and pathological conditions.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] But the safe dose of ultrasound therapy for recent surgical wounds has not been specified in the literature. Merrick <italic>et al</italic>. (2003) demonstrated that ultrasound machines, delivering apparently the same treatment energy, give rise to different amounts of tissue heating and therefore the effects of ultrasound at the tissue level may not be accurately predictable.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In this context, we like to stress that the optimal frequency and intensity of pulsed ultrasound can be determined only by clinical experience. But once the optimal parameters are defined, the intensity and duration can be well controlled by the therapist. As the patient's active participation is less, the desired effect on the tendon healing can be achieved with minimal chance of rupture.</p><p>Tang[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] after a 15 years review of reports of clinical outcomes associated with flexor tendon repair noted that the best functional results of 75% excellent to good results were reported after early active mobilization. The rupture rate ranged from 4% to 10%. He concluded that adhesion formation and stiffness of fingers remain frustrating problems and suggested modern biologic approaches as one of the means of improving the outcome.</p><p>We suggest that early ultrasonic therapy can be one such approach as our results of 75% excellent to good results with rupture rate of 2% is comparable to mobilization protocols.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>
