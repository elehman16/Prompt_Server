This study aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of ATX-101 for SMF reduction through a post hoc pooled analysis of two large phase 3 studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with unwanted SMF were randomized to receive 1 or 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> of ATX-101 or a placebo injected into their SMF during a maximum of four treatment sessions spaced approximately 28&#x000a0;days apart, with a 12-week follow-up period. The proportions of patients with reductions in SMF of one point or more on the Clinician-Reported SMF Rating Scale (CR-SMFRS) and the proportions of patients satisfied with the appearance of their face and chin [Subject Self-Rating Scale (SSRS) score &#x02265;4] were reported overall and in subgroups. Other efficacy measures included improvements in the Patient-Reported SMF Rating Scale (PR-SMFRS), calliper measurements of SMF thickness, and assessment of skin laxity [Skin Laxity Rating Scale (SLRS)]. Adverse events and laboratory test results were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Significantly greater proportions of the patients had improvements in clinician-reported measures (&#x02265;1-point improvement in CR-SMFRS: 58.8 and 63.8&#x000a0;% of the patients who received ATX-101 1 and 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and 28.6&#x000a0;% of the placebo recipients; &#x000a0;<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 for both ATX-101 doses vs. placebo) and patient-reported measures (&#x02265;1-point improvement in PR-SMFRS: 60.0 and 63.1&#x000a0;% of the patients who received ATX-101 1 and 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, vs. 34.3&#x000a0;% of the placebo recipients; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 for both), analyzed alone or in combination, with ATX-101 versus placebo.

This preplatysmal subcutaneous fat that accumulates in the submental compartment leads to loss of mandibular line definition and a perception of an aging or overweight appearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Unwanted SMF can be effectively addressed by liposuction or as part of a surgical procedure such as a face-lift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, not all patients are suitable for surgery, and others may be concerned about undergoing an invasive procedure. For these patients, a nonsurgical alternative is warranted.</p><p>Nonsurgical techniques for localized fat reduction comprise nonsurgical energy devices such as external laser, radiofrequency, cryolipolysis, and ultrasound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and injectable fat-reducing formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The latter have been investigated for the reduction of subcutaneous fat in small studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but no injectable pharmacologic treatment is currently licensed for the reduction of SMF. Overall, robust clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of nonsurgical methods for the reduction of SMF is lacking.</p><p>Studies have shown the endogenous molecule deoxycholic acid to be the active lytic agent in previous injectable formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As a proprietary, synthetically derived, purified formulation of deoxycholic acid, ATX-101 causes localized adipocytolysis when injected into subcutaneous fat. Histologic evidence indicates that disruption of adipocyte membranes by deoxycholate/deoxycholic acid prompts a mild inflammatory tissue response, which is responsible for clearing the cellular debris through macrophage recruitment and subsequent phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In healthy subjects, ATX-101-induced adipocytolysis was not associated with a significant increase in plasma lipid levels over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, ATX-101 showed no accumulation at the injection site because of rapid clearance into the enterohepatic circulation. Nonspecific protein binding of deoxycholic acid was found to limit cellular membrane breakdown in protein-rich tissues such as muscle and skin, thus favoring lysis of fat cells, which are protein poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Currently, ATX-101 is under investigation as a novel nonsurgical intervention for the reduction of unwanted SMF through a rigorously evaluated and comprehensive clinical trial program. In two pivotal European randomized phase 3 clinical studies, ATX-101 was effective and well tolerated for the reduction of unwanted SMF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A post hoc analysis of the pooled data from these studies was conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety outcomes in the large combined patient population. The large number of patients also allowed for exploratory analysis of outcomes in relevant subgroups. The results are presented in this report.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study Design</title><p>Two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies (NCT01305577 and NCT01294644) designed to test the superiority of ATX-101 over a placebo were conducted in 57 centers in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and the UK. The studies were conducted with the overview and approval of ethics boards and under the terms of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline E6: Good Clinical Practice. All the patients provided written, informed consent to participate in the study, and all local legal and regulatory stipulations were followed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and Enrollment Criteria</title><p>The patients were screened at the first study visit and considered eligible to participate in the studies if they had moderate or severe submental convexity and prominent to marked localized SMF, as judged by the investigator. This corresponded to Clinician-Reported SMF Rating Scale (CR-SMFRS) grade 2 or 3 on a scale of 0 (no submental convexity or evidence of localized SMF) to 4 (extreme submental convexity; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Clinician-Reported Submental Fat Rating Scale (CR-SMFRS)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="266_2014_364_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>In addition, the patients were included if their degree of satisfaction with the appearance of their face and chin corresponded to a score of 0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 3 (neither satisfied nor dissatisfied) on a scale of 0 to 6 (extremely satisfied) on the Subject Self-Rating Scale (SSRS). The patients also were required to be 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years of age inclusive, to have a body mass index (BMI) of 30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or less, and to have demonstrated stable body weight for at least the previous 6&#x000a0;months. The principal exclusion criteria were a history of SMF treatment or other recent aesthetic treatment of the chin or neck, the presence of loose skin or previous trauma in the neck or chin area, or prominent platysmal bands. In addition, the patients were required not to change dietary or exercise practices or start a weight-reduction regimen during the course of the study. All patients with concomitant disease that could potentially interfere with the study treatment or its outcomes were excluded from the study. Women of reproductive potential were required to practice birth control during the study and were excluded if pregnant or lactating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomization and Treatment</title><p>After screening at study visit 1, baseline evaluations and randomization were performed in a 1:1:1 ratio at visit 2. Patients were allocated a unique randomization number via a computerized Web/voice-response system that corresponded to an ATX-101 (1 or 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) or placebo treatment kit, each of which had an identical appearance and a blinded label. The computerized system was provided by a third party, and both the patients and the investigators were unaware of the random allocation sequence, which was stratified by center.</p><p>The patients received one of two ATX-101 dosing regimens (1 or 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) or a placebo (sodium phosphate and sodium chloride in water for injection) administered in an identical fashion in up to four treatment sessions separated by approximately 28&#x000a0;days (visits 2&#x02013;5). At each treatment session, the patients received not more than 50 injections of ATX-101 or placebo into the preplatysmal SMF. The injections were spaced evenly at 1-cm intervals by use of a grid, and a maximum of 0.2&#x000a0;ml per injection was administered up to a maximum of 10&#x000a0;ml per treatment session. Topical anesthesia could be given if judged necessary. The patients could receive fewer than the maximum of four treatment sessions for safety reasons, at the patient&#x02019;s request, or because the clinician or patient judged that therapeutic success had been achieved. The patients returned for two follow-up visits 4&#x000a0;weeks (visit 6) and 12&#x000a0;weeks (visit 7) after the final treatment session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>Efficacy outcomes were evaluated in the intention-to-treat population, which comprised all randomized patients who had at least one efficacy assessment (CR-SMFRS or SSRS) at baseline (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The co-primary efficacy end points were an improvement of one point or more from baseline rated by the clinician using the CR-SMFRS and a final score of 4 (slightly satisfied) to 6 (extremely satisfied) rated by the patient using the SSRS, indicating satisfaction with the appearance of the face and chin.

Patient-reported secondary and other outcomes included an improvement of one point or more from baseline using the Patient-Reported SMF Rating Scale (PR-SMFRS), which assessed SMF severity from a patient perspective. These scales were used in phase 2 and 3 studies of ATX-101 treatment in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In these and other observational studies (data on file), psychometric properties were found to be appropriate for assessment of the outcomes.

The proportions of patients with an improvement of two points or more from baseline on the CR-SMFRS and improvements of at least one point and of at least two points from baseline on the PR-SMFRS also were recorded.</p><p>In the pooled analysis, the proportions of patients for whom a clinician-rated improvement of at least one point or at least two points (CR-SMFRS) was simultaneously accompanied by an equivalent improvement in patient rating (PR-SMFRS) also were analyzed. In addition, the correlations between the clinician- and patient-reported ratings of SMF severity (CR-SMFRS and PR-SMFRS) and the patient-reported ratings of satisfaction with the appearance of their face and chin after treatment (SSRS) were investigated.</p><p>The safety population included all the patients who received at least one treatment. Adverse events, recorded at each visit and approximately 7&#x000a0;days after each treatment session, were characterized descriptively in terms of association with treatment, by the day of onset and cessation, and by severity and intensity. Changes in clinical laboratory parameters and other tests as well as variations in vital signs, body temperature, and body weight, were evaluated throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The two phase 3 studies had an identical design and were conducted in parallel at different centers, which allowed for post hoc pooling of the data. This was done by adding the data sets without further modification. Each individual study was designed with a 90&#x000a0;% power to detect differences between the ATX-101 treatment groups and the placebo group. Due to a greater number of patients, the pooled analysis had an increased statistical power compared with each study alone. The results of these post hoc analyses are for exploratory purposes only.</p><p>Full statistical methods have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Statistical comparisons of efficacy between ATX-101 and placebo were made using a two-sided test with a type 1 error rate of 0.05, and missing values were imputed by carrying the last observation forward. The proportions of responders, as assessed by CR-SMFRS, PR-SMFRS, and SSRS, were analyzed by binary logistic regression, with posttreatment and baseline values as cofactors.</p><p>Conclusions for the percentage of responders in the subgroups (gender, age, BMI category) were drawn using odds ratios (ORs) derived directly from the response rates, with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs). Changes in calliper measurements from baseline were analyzed at each post-baseline visit as the dependent variable by a repeated measurement analysis of covariance. Demographic and clinical parameters were analyzed descriptively. Adverse events (number of patients and number of events) were categorized by association with treatment, study withdrawal, death, severity, intensity, system organ class, and preferred term. Statistical summaries were based on adverse events emerging after the start of treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Patient Demographics</title><p>Of the 723 patients randomized across the two studies, 716 were treated with either ATX-101 or placebo and formed the safety population for the pooled analysis.

As in each individual phase 3 study and consistent with efficacy and tolerability observations in previous phase 1 and 2 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the outcomes for the primary efficacy end points with both ATX-101 doses tested were clinically and statistically superior to the placebo outcomes. The response to treatment with the ATX-101 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> dose overall was empirically better, and a greater proportion of the patients who received this higher dose required fewer than the maximum of four treatment sessions to achieve an improvement of one point or more in CR-SMFRS score compared with those who received the lower dose (ATX-101 1&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>). Efficacy was broadly consistent across the subgroups of gender, age and BMI category studied, suggesting that ATX-101 may be suitable for a broad population of patients.</p><p>Although a trend toward a treatment effect was observed, the statistical significance with ATX-101 1&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> compared with the placebo was not achieved for male patients or patients 18&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years of age. This could simply be the result of the relatively low patient numbers in these subgroups, could reflect the presence of other confounding factors, or could suggest a need for more intensified treatment of these patients. In terms of the primary end points in both of these subgroups, ATX-101 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> was superior to the placebo.</p><p>The results of the secondary efficacy outcomes were consistent with those from the individual phase 3 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The pooled analysis allowed for comparison between ATX-101 and the placebo for other end points, such as an improvement of two points or more in the clinician and patient rating scales of SMF severity (CR-SMFRS and PR-SMFRS). The ATX-101 treatment at both 1 and 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> was associated with a significantly greater proportion of patients who achieved this level of response on either scale.</p><p>When the CR-SMFRS and PR-SMFRS scales were considered in tandem, the findings showed that both ATX-101 doses were associated with a significantly greater proportion of improvements of one point or more in both scales compared with the placebo. This also was the case for improvements of two points or more with the ATX-101 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> dose. Clinician-reported improvements in SMF convexity and severity (CR-SMFRS) had moderate positive correlations with patient evaluations of SMF severity (PR-SMFRS) and satisfaction with the appearance of the face and chin after treatment (SSRS), indicating that the patient-reported outcome measures provided an important and valid means of assessing ATX-101 treatment efficacy and comprehensively complemented the clinician-reported outcome measures.</p><p>The ATX-101 treatment was well tolerated and mainly associated with transient reactions in the treatment area of the type that might be expected with an injectable adipocytolytic therapy and the subsequent tissue response. The most common reactions (pain, swelling, bruising, numbness, erythema, and induration) generally resolved in the 28-day interval between treatment sessions. For ATX-101, the median duration of adverse events was shorter for the second, third, and fourth treatment sessions than for the first session. This may reflect increased patient familiarity with the injections as well as a decrease in the amount of cell lysis and tissue response with later treatments because of diminished SMF.</p><p>Most of the adverse events with ATX-101 were mild or moderate in intensity. Injection-site pain was more commonly rated as moderate or severe but resolved within a median time of 1&#x000a0;day. Of the few nerve injury adverse events reported, only one was considered a serious adverse event related to treatment, and all such events resolved without sequelae. These events were possibly the result of injections administered too deeply into the platysma muscle or too close to the marginal mandibular nerve, emphasizing the importance of proper injection location and technique and of good knowledge concerning the relevant anatomy and anatomic landmarks.</p><p>From the patient&#x02019;s perspective, the overall recovery period associated with ATX-101 injections appears to be acceptable compared with currently available interventions for SMF reduction and may be similar to that for localized liposuction. The normal recovery period for the latter is 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, for some liposuction procedures in exceptional circumstances, full recovery can take up to 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Currently, liposuction, with or without the use of an accompanying energy device, is the most commonly used intervention for SMF reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Liposuction is suitable for patients who require localized fat removal. Those who desire more comprehensive facial remodeling are likely to be candidates for face-lifts or other more specialized surgical techniques. However, although liposuction is considerably less invasive than surgery, some patients may still be disinclined to undergo this procedure. For others, the surgeon may be concerned about the potential for unfavorable aesthetic results, such as postoperative anterior platysmal banding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. For such patients, whose treatment goal is to improve the submental profile without further facial remodelling, ATX-101 may provide a minimally invasive option that offers a clinically meaningful improvement in chin profile and is well tolerated.</p><p>This pooled analysis was associated with some limitations. In a previous phase 2 study of ATX-101, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for objective assessment of reductions in SMF and demonstrated a significant treatment effect compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, it was not considered practical to use MRI in these large, clinic-based phase 3 trials. Therefore, calliper measurements were used as an objective tool to measure reductions in SMF thickness. A further limitation was the post hoc nature of this analysis, although this must be considered in the light of the prospective and robust nature of the two individual studies, their positive results, and the increased statistical power of the pooled data set.</p><p>The injectable adipocytolytic drug ATX-101 is the first nonsurgical treatment for SMF reduction to undergo comprehensive clinical evaluation in a large sample of patients. The results of two phase 3 studies, as confirmed by this pooled analysis, demonstrated that ATX-101 was effective based on clinician, patient, and objective measures and was well tolerated. For patients for whom a minimally invasive procedure is appropriate, ATX-101 may provide a relatively simple, injectable approach to the reduction of unwanted SMF.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the investigators who contributed to and recruited patients for either of the phase 3 European studies, including Hugo Boonen, Joan Vandeputte, Karen Vermeersch (Belgium), Benjamin Ascher, Isaac Bodokh, Hugues Cartier, Bruno Halioua, Philippe Humbert, Daniel Interligator, Jean-Michel Mazer, Jean-Paul Ortonne, Bernard Rossi, Gilles Rostain (France), J&#x000fc;rgen Bauerschmitz, Thomas Dirschka, Tanja Fischer, Yvonne Frambach, Klaus Fritz, Beatrice Gerlach, Andrea Graefe, Marc Heckmann, Klaus Hoffmann, Bernd Kardorff, Sigrid Karrer, Martina Kerscher, Martin Miehe, Ernst Magnus Noah, Tatjana Pavicic, Maurizio Podda, George Popp, Welf Prager, Anita R&#x000fc;tter, Berthold Rzany, Gerhard Sattler, Michael Sebastian, Margrit Simon, Rolf-Markus Szeimies, Diamant Thaci, Torsten Walker, Ridwan Weber, Roland Weisser, Uwe Wollina (Germany), Nicol&#x000f2; Scuderi (Italy), Jaume Masia Ayala, Gerardo Moreno Arias, Pedro P&#x000e9;rez Escariz, Andres Marcos Vivas (Spain), Joshua Berkowitz, Tahera Bhojani, David Eccleston, Tamara Griffiths, Harryono Judodihardjo, Ross Martin, Stephanie Ogden, John Tanqueray, and Shahida Ullah (UK).
