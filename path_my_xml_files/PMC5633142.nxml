Current guidelines recommend treating children with acute non-bloody diarrhea with oral rehydration solutions and zinc, but not antimicrobials. However, in many resource-limited settings, infections with treatable enteric bacterial and protozoan pathogens are common. Probiotics have shown promise as an adjunct treatment for diarrhoea but have not been studied in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a pilot, factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of children aged 2&#x02013;60 months hospitalized in Botswana for acute non-bloody diarrhoea. A rapid test-and-treat intervention, consisting of multiplex PCR testing of rectal swabs taken at enrolment, accompanied by targeted antimicrobial therapy if treatable pathogens were detected, was compared to the reference standard of no stool testing. Additionally, <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> DSM 17938 x 60 days was compared to placebo treatment. The main objective of this pilot study was to assess feasibility. The primary clinical outcome was the increase in age-standardized height (HAZ) at 60 days adjusted for baseline HAZ.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Seventy-six patients were enrolled over a seven-month study period. We judged that the recruitment rate, lab processing times, communication protocols, provision of specific antimicrobials, and follow-up rates were acceptable. Compared to the reference arm (no stool testing and placebo treatment), the combination of the rapid test-and-treat strategy plus <italic>L</italic>. <italic>reuteri</italic> DSM 17938 was associated with an increase of 0.61 HAZ (95% CI 0.09&#x02013;1.13) and 93% lower odds of recurrent diarrhoea (OR 0.07, 95%CI 0.01&#x02013;0.61) at 60 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrated that it was feasible to evaluate the study interventions in Botswana.

Furthermore, gastrointestinal infection predisposes to the development of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which itself increases risk of further infections, cognitive maldevelopment, and mortality (from both infectious and noninfectious causes) [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185177.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. New strategies to diminish the impact of diarrhoeal disease in children are sorely needed [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Current World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the treatment of gastroenteritis involve prompt delivery of rehydration solutions and zinc therapy [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Fluid rehydration is of prime importance regardless of the aetiology of infection to reverse dehydration and treat hypovolaemic shock. The provision of antimicrobials is recommended only if blood is observed in the stools; this recommendation is probably linked to the assumption that the majority of children presenting with acute non-bloody diarrhoea are infected with viral pathogens, for whom no specific treatment is available. However, we have previously found that up to one-third of children in Botswana admitted to hospital without dysentery harboured a potentially treatable pathogen in their stool [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and other investigators have observed similar findings in other low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185177.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although it is not possible to reliably distinguish treatable bacterial or protozoal gastroenteritis from non-treatable gastroenteritis on clinical grounds in the absence of bloody stools, the use of rapid enteric diagnostics at the time of patient presentation could permit the use of targeted antimicrobial treatment. Some have suggested that timely antimicrobial use in children with treatable gastroenteritis could improve symptoms and prevent subsequent growth deficits and/or mortality [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There has been substantial interest in the use of probiotics as adjunctive therapy for children with acute gastroenteritis, predominantly in the context of viral infection. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted, predominantly in upper-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; a systematic review of 3 randomized treatment trials done in Turkey and Italy showed that <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. <italic>reuteri</italic> (a commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract) administration, as compared to placebo or no intervention, reduced the duration of diarrhoea by 24.8 hours (95% CI 38.8 hours to 10.8 hours) [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, no trials have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden of diarrhoeal disease is very high and both mortality and morbidity are much more substantial, due in part to co-existing malnutrition and/or environmental enteropathy. Additionally, there are almost no data on the use of probiotics for the adjunctive treatment of bacterial or protozoan gastroenteritis.</p><p>We hypothesized that rapid diagnostic testing followed by specific targeted antimicrobial therapy, alone or in combination with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>reuteri</italic> DSM 17938, would improve linear growth and reduce other morbidity and mortality, in children admitted to hospital because of gastroenteritis in a high-burden setting. We chose linear growth as a primary outcome because of its close association with overall health and cognitive development [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185177.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In order to investigate these interventions simultaneously, a factorial randomized controlled trial was designed. To allow us to explore the practicality of operationalizing these interventions in Botswana and ascertain the variance of treatment effects, we undertook a pilot trial that would determine the later feasibility of a formal, adequately-powered randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>A pilot, multi-centre, randomized, controlled, factorial, clinical trial was conducted at Princess Marina Hospital (Gaborone, Botswana) from March-December 2014; Bamalete Lutheran Hospital (Ramotswa) and Scottish Livingstone Hospital (Molepolole) were added as study sites in September 2014. Children aged 2 to 60 months admitted to the paediatric wards of the study hospitals because of acute diarrhoeal disease were eligible. (The original inclusion criteria stated 3&#x02013;60 months; the relevant amendment was submitted prior to commencement of enrolment.) &#x02018;Diarrhoeal disease&#x02019; was defined as the passage of at least 3 watery stools in a single 24-hour period preceding hospitalization; &#x02018;acute&#x02019; referred to illness less than 14 days in duration. Children with HIV infection/exposure were not excluded. Children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), defined as weight less than 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean, or weight-for-length less than 3 SD below the mean, were eligible to participate in the study but were not randomized to one of the interventions (<italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> DSM 17938 or placebo, see below). Their outcomes were analysed separately, owing to the fact that these children&#x02019;s baseline prognosis was substantially worse than children without malnutrition. Children with the following conditions were excluded: visibly bloody diarrhoea by history or at presentation, medical comorbidities (ie. inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, cystic fibrosis), suspected bacterial sepsis or meningitis leading to the initiation of a 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporin, suspected primary urinary tract infection and a urinalysis with positive leukocytes or nitrites, or suspected primary pneumonia with a chest radiograph showing a focal consolidative process. Additionally, children were excluded if they had a household member with an identified bacterial or parasitic enteric infection, were transferred from another health facility with treatment with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy already begun (ie. cefotaxime, nalidixic acid, or ciprofloxacin), or developed nosocomial diarrhoea in hospital. Children living outside the hospitals&#x02019; catchment areas were excluded, as were those whose caregivers did not have access to a telephone (either landline or mobile), or those without a fixed address.</p><p>Written informed consent was completed by all caregivers. The trial protocol was approved by the research ethics boards of the Botswana Health Research and Development Committee, the Princess Marina Hospital, the University of Pennsylvania, USA, and McMaster University, Canada.

The Vesikari score, an index of gastroenteritis severity [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], was calculated for all participants. Height, weight, and middle upper arm circumference were measured using standard protocols and source documentation was entered on paper forms, which were kept in a secure office.

We experienced few recruitment difficulties, probably owing to the fact that both caregivers and clinicians were receptive to the interventions under study and thus motivated to participate, and there was minimal loss to follow up. In addition, we demonstrated the practicality of obtaining enteric specimens in a timely way through the use of rectal swabs, coordinating multiplex PCR testing in a local laboratory, and delivering these results promptly to the participants&#x02019; physicians to facilitate the initiation of antimicrobial therapy within a clinically relevant interval. Despite the fact that acute diarrhoeal disease causes a staggering amount of mortality and morbidity in young children globally [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and bacterial and protozoan enteropathogens are common causes of paediatric gastroenteritis in resource-limited settings [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185177.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185177.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185177.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we know of no other randomized trials that have evaluated the benefits of rapid test-and-treat algorithms to manage acute diarrhoea in low- or middle-income countries. We are also unaware of any randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness of probiotic preparations as treatment for acute gastroenteritis in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The trial did not meet all pre-specified feasibility outcomes. Only 76 participants were enrolled; however, the overall study period was limited to seven months rather than the intended twelve. More than half of the study participants&#x02019; swabs were delivered to the testing laboratory greater than 18 hours after admission, falling short of our expectation. It should be noted, however, that we had originally planned to enroll children only within 24 hours of hospitalization; subsequent protocol modifications permitted the recruitment of children &#x0003c; 48 hours after admission. Though we were not able to provide 85% of participants with test results within 24 hours of enrolment, results were still available within a clinically relevant time-frame, and only one child had treatment delayed past the first post-enrolment day. Despite not all feasibility outcomes having been achieved, we feel that a follow-up trial will be possible in southern Botswana, especially if faster next-generation assays were available; more reliable diagnostics with shorter turn-around times would probably maximize the number of participants receiving actionable test results on the day of enrolment.</p><p>The clinical outcomes observed were encouraging and deserve further study in a larger, adequately powered trial. As noted before, the combination of rapid diagnostics/targeted therapy <underline>and</underline>
<italic>L</italic>. <italic>reuteri</italic> treatment was associated with a considerable decrease (OR 0.07) in recurrent diarrhoea as well as a dramatic 0.61 Z increase in standardized height (adjusted for baseline) at 60 days, both statistically significant outcomes. Furthermore, there were encouraging signs that the rapid test-and-treat approach alone (ie. in combination with placebo) may also lead to clinically relevant increases in height and decreases in recurrent diarrhoea. Our results are consistent with a meta-analysis of RCTs that observed a small increase in height associated with antibiotic therapy in children living in resource-limited settings [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; we would hypothesize that this benefit may have been mediated through the treatment of clinical or subclinical intestinal infections, lending support for our approach. It may well be that the decrease in recurrent diarrhoea was an important factor contributing to height preservation in this cohort, though the study design precludes any definitive statements about mechanism of action of the interventions under study.</p><p>One of the major strengths of the study design is the relevance of the primary clinical outcome measure, which makes it easier for relevant stakeholders to appreciate the benefits of the interventions of interest. Key limitations include the small size of this pilot study and lack of statistical power, which precludes making definitive conclusions about the magnitude of effect associated with the interventions of interest, given how frequently exaggerated estimates of effect have been found in small studies [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There were randomization issues that were primarily due to internet connectivity issues. Furthermore, we were unable to recruit a large number of participants with severe acute malnutrition in this pilot study. As these are the children who are the most vulnerable and the most likely to experience poor outcomes, they may have the most to gain from these interventions, and so including them in greater numbers in future studies will be crucial.</p><p>The theory behind rapid test-and-treat methodology is simple: providing antimicrobials to children with severe gastroenteritis caused by treatable pathogens can reduce associated morbidity and mortality by 52&#x02013;99% [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185177.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Indeed, many travel medicine guidelines recommend providing broad-spectrum antibacterials to travellers visiting resource-limited countries <italic>in the event</italic> that they develop diarrhoea, even without confirmation of infection with a treatable bacterial or protozoan pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185177.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Children from resource-limited settings are at higher risk of longer-term neurodevelopmental sequelae or fatal outcomes resulting from diarrhoeal disease [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which provides a rationale for empiric antibiotics for acute diarrhoea in high-burden settings [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Resistance to the broad-spectrum antimicrobials in use currently for the treatment of many bacterial enteropathogens is a concern, so a diagnostic-driven strategy is a reasonable compromise between the unacceptable mortality and morbidity associated with untreated bacterial/protozoan gastroenteritis and the widespread development of drug resistance that could result from universal antimicrobial treatment.</p><p>The mechanisms by which probiotics can diminish the impact of enteric infections are unknown, but may include competition with enteric pathogens for binding sites and nutrients within the intestine, modification of the composition of the intestinal microbiome, stimulation of the host immune response, and/or improvement of intestinal barrier function [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185177.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It seems logical to suppose that the main mechanism of probiotic action is though effects on the gut microbiome; a previous RCT did not find significant differences between the intestinal microbiota of participants who received <italic>L</italic>. <italic>reuteri</italic> DSM 17938 and those that received placebo, but only 29 infants were enrolled and analysis was restricted to 16S rRNA profiling [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Probiotics&#x02019; beneficial effects may be mediated through the formation of biofilms in the intestinal environment, as <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species have been observed to do; biofilms formed by <italic>L</italic>. <italic>reuteri</italic> strains related to DSM 17938 have been shown to produce large quantities of reuterin, a molecule that can inhibit the growth of many different putative intestinal pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our study is the first randomized trial to our knowledge that has assessed the effect of probiotic therapy in children with gastroenteritis in sub-Saharan Africa, and the results suggest that there may be benefit associated with probiotic treatment of severe gastroenteritis in children. We provided probiotic therapy for a full 60 days; in practice, it may be difficult to ensure adherence to this long of a regimen. Further work needs to be done to establish the true magnitude of effect associated with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>reuteri</italic> supplementation, as well as how much the treatment course can be shortened without losing benefit [<xref rid="pone.0185177.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we believe a large, adequately powered randomized controlled trial is warranted, to further gauge the impact of rapid diagnostic testing and/or the use of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>reuteri</italic> DSM 17938 for the treatment of acute diarrhoeal disease in children hospitalized with diarrhoea in Botswana.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185177.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185177.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185177.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Protocol.</title><p>Original trial protocol.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185177.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Copan Italia S.A. provided flocked swabs and transport medium.
