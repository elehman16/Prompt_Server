Our secondary hypotheses were that the psoas valley would be larger in the male population and larger in the older population, which could help future studies to explain the increased incidence of labral tears seen in older populations. The increase in size of the psoas valley could be due to a number of factors, including bone erosion over time from the iliopsoas tendon or as a result of persistent microtrauma from day-to-day physical activity.

We also investigated the location of the psoas valley in an effort to link this loss of bony support in the acetabulum to acetabular labral tears. Congruent with our hypothesis, the psoas valley was similar in depth and width across races, but the male population showed a deeper and wider psoas valley than the female population. Contrary to our hypothesis, the depth and width of the psoas valley did not change with the age of our specimens. The location of the psoas valley varied only between males and females, and only at the anterior boundary.

However, in another study performed by Vandenbussche et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> there was a significant sex-related variance in the depth of the acetabulum.</p><p>The prevalence of labral tears in the older population led us to hypothesize that there could be changes in the morphology of the psoas valley overtime. Our findings were contrary to our hypothesis and showed that the dimensions of the psoas valley did not vary with the age of the specimens. These findings coincided with a study by Vandenbussche et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> which found that the dimensions of the psoas valley were not related to age. The posterior boundary of the psoas valley was not affected by the sex of the specimen, but the anterior boundary of the psoas valley was located more anteriorly in males. Our study showed that the male psoas valley was in fact larger, but this does not account for the results showing that it is only in the anterior direction. Previous work by Vandenbussche et al<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> showed that the female acetabulum is on average more retroverted when compared with that of males. The orientation of the female acetabulum causes the iliopsoas muscle to fall more posteriorly on the acetabulum, and as a result, the reactive formation of the acetabular rim lies more posterior on the acetabulum. The more anteriorly facing male acetabulum causes the opposite effect on the psoas valley. The orientation of the acetabulum could be the underlying cause of the different anterior locations of the acetabulum that are seen when comparing males and females.</p><p>The cause of acetabular labral tears in the human hip joint is still much debated. The anterosuperior quadrant of the labrum has been described as the most common area for acetabular labral tears due to multiple contributing factors. This area has been shown to have inferior mechanical properties, higher mechanical demands, and relative hypovascularity.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Studies have shown that the anterior aspect of the labrum has a rather marginal attachment to the acetabular cartilage with an intra-articular projection, compared with the continuous attachment seen in the posterior aspect of the labrum. The anterior chondrolabral transition zone is sharp and abrupt compared with the gradual posterior transition. This abrupt transition increases the risk of labral tear in this area and has been described to some extent as the so-called &#x0201c;watershed lesion.&#x0201d; The acetabular rim morphology in this area could give clues to a patient&#x02019;s risk of developing a labral tear. Lage et al<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> described 4 categories of labral tears, most notably traumatic injuries. Recent studies have shown that labral tears are commonly due to traumatic events (range, 19%-55%) of varying intensity.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Traumatic injuries have been reported to involve traction injuries of the labrum by the intra-articular portion of the iliopsoas tendon as it transverses the psoas valley.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The variation of the dimensions of the psoas valley could increase a patient&#x02019;s risks of labral tears. All specimens in our population were observed to have a psoas valley in this area of the acetabulum. This trade-off for stabilization of the iliopsoas muscle could result in weakening of the labrum in this area.</p><p>The goals of our study were to describe the psoas valley and compare our findings across different sexes, ages, and races. We were still limited by the availability of subjects for our study. All subjects were from northern Ohio and had died in the early 19th century. More studies need to be done on a wide variety of populations to either strengthen or refute our findings. Our data were also collected by multiple measurements by a single individual, which could be a cause of bias in the data collected. However, the results of our study confirmed the results of previous studies about the dimensions and location of the psoas valley.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2325967114551328" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> We showed that studies using imaging on in vivo specimens achieve the same results as measurements on ex vivo specimens. The psoas valley dimensions and location only varied between sexes, and the version of the acetabulum could be the underlying cause. Acetabular labral tears occur in the same area of the acetabulum, and this possible lack of bone support could be the underlying cause, but future studies relating the dimensions of the psoas valley of patients presenting with labral tears to those without labral pathologies and the biomechanics of psoas valley are necessary to fully understand labral tear etiology.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-2325967114551328" fn-type="conflict"><p>One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: Funding for this study is provided by the University of Michigan Biomedical Science Research Program.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Lyman M.
