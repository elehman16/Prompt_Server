Interestingly, some recent comparative studies showed that these exercise modalities, if maintained over a period of several months, are similarly effective in reducing HbA1c levels in diabetic patients <xref rid="pone.0049937-Sigal1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049937-Bacchi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, it is unknown whether the acute blood glucose changes induced by each single session of aerobic or resistance exercise are also similar. As a consequence, it is still unclear whether medication dosage and/or dietary carbohydrate adjustments to exercise should differ according to the scheduled type of physical activity.</p><p>A single bout of exercise increases skeletal muscle glucose uptake. Nevertheless, plasma glucose is normally maintained constant by increased hepatic glucose production and mobilization of alternate fuels <xref rid="pone.0049937-Suh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In subjects with type 2 diabetes performing moderate aerobic physical activity, glucose uptake generally rises more than hepatic glucose production, and therefore blood glucose tends to fall <xref rid="pone.0049937-Minuk1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Muscle glucose uptake remains high in the post-exercise period, with the contraction-mediated pathway persisting for several hours and insulin-mediated uptake for longer <xref rid="pone.0049937-Boul1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This phenomenon is usually beneficial in these patients and, in the absence of pharmacological interference, concurrent reduction of insulin levels avoids the risk of hypoglycaemia. However, the synergistic effects of exercise and antidiabetic medications may provoke a more pronounced reduction of glucose concentrations <xref rid="pone.0049937-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This interaction may still be helpful in improving the metabolic control. Nevertheless, it increases the risk of hypoglycaemia, which may occur either during or several hours after the exercise.</p><p>In clinical practice, assessment of short-term changes in glucose concentrations is primarily based on self-monitoring of blood glucose. However, most hypoglycaemic episodes may be missed <xref rid="pone.0049937-Cheyne1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049937-Boland1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, particularly during the night. A recently introduced tool to assess blood glucose changes, available during exercise and free-living, is the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS), which can record blood glucose concentrations for several days.</p><p>In the present study, using CGMS, we have compared the effects on blood glucose of a single bout of aerobic exercise or resistance exercise in a group of type 2 diabetic patients included in a regular training programme. Our hypothesis is that aerobic exercise and resistance exercise, despite similar effects on long-term metabolic control in these subjects, may differently affect glucose concentrations during and for several hours after the exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, Italy, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Glucose concentrations were measured by CGMS for 48 hours, comprising a day with an exercise session and the following non-exercise day. The exercise programmes were of moderate intensity and designed according to current recommendations for physical activity for these subjects <xref rid="pone.0049937-Colberg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Our results showed that, although the aerobic and the resistance training induced similar long-term improvements in HbA1c levels, there were different behaviours between the groups in blood glucose readings during and for several hours after a single exercise session. In particular, there was a significant reduction of glucose concentrations during the aerobic exercise but not during the resistance exercise, and similar differences between groups were also found in the nocturnal period following the training session. Again, glucose concentrations were lower during the night subsequent to an aerobic exercise session, whereas this phenomenon did not occur after resistance exercise.</p><p>Our findings are of speculative and practical interest. Previous research showed that after a single bout of physical activity the contraction-mediated increase in muscle glucose uptake persists for several hours and the insulin mediated uptake for up to 48&#x02013;72 h <xref rid="pone.0049937-Colberg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049937-Boul1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049937-Koopman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These observations suggested that the beneficial effects of exercise on long-term glycaemic control can be ascribed to the cumulative effects of the succeeding bouts of exercise. In our study, the lack of significant differences in both groups between the 24-h glucose AUCs of the exercise and non-exercise days is consistent with previous evidence of a prolonged metabolic effect of either aerobic or resistance regular training. Furthermore, the comparable 48-h glucose profiles between the two exercise groups is consistent with an analogous long-term metabolic effect of aerobic and resistance exercise, confirmed by the similar HbA1c improvement observed in these subjects after 4 months of intervention <xref rid="pone.0049937-Bacchi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Nevertheless, the two groups showed significant differences during and for several hours after exercise. In this regard, the observed time course suggests that differences between training types in the acute glucose changes are more likely due to differences in the contraction-mediated pathway than in the insulin mediated uptake. Accordingly, improvements of insulin mediated glucose uptake were similar after 4 months of aerobic or resistance training <xref rid="pone.0049937-Bacchi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Differences between groups in the counterregulatory hormone response to exercise may also be hypothesized. Interestingly, it was reported that exercise-induced GH secretion could be greater after resistance exercise <xref rid="pone.0049937-Goto1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In our study counterregulatory hormones were not assessed. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that possible differences in secretion of these hormones might account for the differences in blood glucose between groups observed in the nocturnal period, 6&#x02013;12 hours after exercise.</p><p>From a practical point of view, the recent consensus statement about exercise in type 2 diabetes, by the American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) <xref rid="pone.0049937-Colberg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, recommended combining aerobic and resistance training in these subjects, in order to lower HbA1c levels <xref rid="pone.0049937-Umpierre1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and guarantee the specific benefits of both these exercise modalities <xref rid="pone.0049937-Garber1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, the lack of information about possible differences in the acute effects of aerobic and resistance training on glucose concentrations did not allow the ACSM/ADA experts to suggest whether there should be any differences in medication dosage and dietary carbohydrate adjustments to physical activity in relation to the scheduled type of exercise. In this regard, it is noteworthy that our experimental design explored the effects of exercise sessions included in a training programme, to assess whether each single exercise bout causes acute changes of blood glucose over the chronic effects of a long-term training. In terms of clinical practice, this may be even more interesting than comparing an exercise day with a true non-exercise day, which is a somewhat artificial model.</p><p>Interestingly, in our study the LBGI index, which summarizes the severity and duration of hypoglycaemic episodes and is a reliable predictor of severe hypoglycaemia risk <xref rid="pone.0049937-Kovatchev2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, increased significantly during the night following aerobic exercise, whereas it did not change after resistance exercise. It should be underlined that the risk of hypoglycaemia, as estimated by the LBGI index, was low in these diabetic patients and mildly increased after the aerobic exercise session. Nevertheless, most subjects in our study were given metformin alone, which carries a very low risk of hypoglycaemia and might even blunt the post-exercise blood glucose reduction <xref rid="pone.0049937-Malin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, whereas a small number of them were given insulin secretagogues, i.e. received medications which substantially increase hypoglycaemia risk. Therefore, these differences in the LBGI index observed during the night after exercise, even if small, merit attention.</p><p>Some previous studies assessed the acute effects of exercise on blood glucose in type 2 diabetic subjects not involved in structured training programmes, reporting that physical activity lowered the time spent in hyperglycaemia, as compared to a non-exercise day <xref rid="pone.0049937-Manders1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049937-Praet1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, only one recent study has compared, using a CGMS, the acute effects on blood glucose of a single session of aerobic or resistance exercise in these patients. Van Dijk et al <xref rid="pone.0049937-VanDijk1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> reported, in a crossover study, similar reductions in the prevalence of hyperglycaemia over a 24-h period after aerobic or resistance exercise, as compared to a non-exercise day. Moreover, in this study, a greater time spent in hypoglycaemia was reported in the evening after exercise, and this figure was somewhat higher after aerobic activity, although the study did not provide analysis of differences between the exercise types in this time frame. In our study the exercise session was undertaken in the late afternoon, when many subjects could train more easily, after work or family activities. In contrast, in the van Dijk study, exercise was carried out in the late morning. This difference may likely explain why in our study hypoglycaemia risk was higher in the nocturnal period, whereas in the van Dijk study this phenomenon occurred earlier, in the evening.</p><p>Interestingly, all recorded hypoglycaemias were asymptomatic in our subjects. It is worth noting that in subjects with long-standing type 2 diabetes, the hypoglycaemia rate is substantially higher than commonly thought, as most episodes remain undiagnosed <xref rid="pone.0049937-Amiel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and that hypoglycaemias are considered the most likely candidate responsible for the lack of beneficial effects or even the increased risk of mortality observed during intensive glucose-lowering therapy <xref rid="pone.0049937-Gerstein1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049937-Zoungas1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Unlike the findings of previous studies, in our subjects the 24-h blood glucose AUC and the 24-h HBGI value, which summarizes duration and extent of hyperglycaemia, were unaffected by either aerobic or resistance exercise. Differences in the experimental design probably explain these different results. In particular, we assessed what effects a single bout of exercise has over the sustained effects of training, whereas the other studies compared exercise with a non-exercise condition.</p><p>Interestingly, findings consistent with our data were reported in a preliminary study <xref rid="pone.0049937-Yardley1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> carried out in trained individuals with type 1 diabetes submitted to continuous glucose monitoring during and after aerobic or resistance exercise. Aerobic exercise caused greater reduction of blood glucose and a greater need for carbohydrate supplementation during aerobic exercise than resistance exercise. More recently, the same authors have examined in these patients the effects of combined exercise sessions, in which the aerobic training was performed either before or after the resistance training <xref rid="pone.0049937-Yardley2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this study, blood glucose reduction was again greater during aerobic exercise than resistance exercise, especially when the aerobic component came first. Moreover, there was a tendency to differences in AUC for post-exercise nocturnal hypoglycaemia according to the sequence in aerobic and resistance exercise, the glucose reduction being greater when aerobic exercise preceded resistance exercise.</p><p>As a whole, these data indicate that a better understanding of the acute effects of each specific type of exercise is needed, in order to maintain glucose levels in an appropriate range during and after physical activity. This is also relevant if we consider that therapeutic adjustments induced by fear of exercise-induced hypoglycaemia often cause a suboptimal metabolic control during physical activity in diabetic patients, mitigating the potential beneficial effects of exercise.</p><p>The strengths of our study are the careful experimental design and the assessment of the effects of bouts of exercise included in a regular training programme, in order to reproduce real-life conditions. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the acute effects of exercise within a long-term training programme in type 2 diabetic subjects.</p><p>A limitation is the somewhat small sample size, although it did not prevent us from finding several statistically significant differences. Moreover, owing to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, extrapolation of the present findings to other classes of diabetic patients, such as those on insulin therapy, should be undertaken with caution.</p><p>In conclusion, although aerobic and resistance training have similar long-term metabolic effects in type 2 diabetes subjects, the acute effects of single bouts of these exercise types differ. In particular, aerobic exercise lowers blood glucose concentrations to a greater extent than resistance exercise, both during and up to twelve hours after the exercise session, carrying a higher risk of exercise-induced hypoglycaemia. Of particular concern is late-onset hypoglycaemia, especially when the exercise is scheduled in the late afternoon, as this risk occurs in the sleeping nocturnal period. These findings suggest that adjustments of medications and/or carbohydrate intake in diabetic subjects should also take into account the scheduled type of exercise. Further research is needed to establish the mechanisms underlying differences in the short-term effects of aerobic and resistance training, and to assess the acute metabolic changes induced by a combination, in the same session, of aerobic and resistance exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0049937.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
