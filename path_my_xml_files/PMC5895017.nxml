However, for adults living in developed countries, &#x0201c;unhealthy&#x0201d; dietary patterns, associated with a high intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and a low intake of vitamins and minerals, persist [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the general population, women of childbearing age who are likely to become pregnant are of growing interest in terms of public health issues related to nutrition [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, there is an important body of evidence that associates maternal nutrition during preconception and pregnancy with birth outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the health of offspring during childhood and adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, in developed countries, although pregnancy has been described as being associated with a rise in nutrition awareness [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194764.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and a will to adopt healthier behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], nutrient requirements are not always satisfied [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194764.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In France, few data are available on nutrient intakes in pregnant women, but studies of different samples have revealed a high n6:n3 fatty acid ratio [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a moderate iodine deficiency [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and inadequate intakes in dietary fiber, folate, vitamin D, SFA and sodium [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, a previously published simulation study carried out by our team [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that compliance with generic dietary guidelines, such as consuming recommended snacks, is only partially effective in maintaining the nutrient adequacy of the preconceptional diet of French women. This calls for major changes to the diet of women so that they will meet the higher nutrient requirements associated with pregnancy (e.g. thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, iodine and zinc during the first trimester) [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We recently developed an algorithmic model that identifies the best nutritional substitution of a food or beverage that forms part of the observed diet of an individual with a food or beverage from the same food group or subgroup [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given that adapting advice to individual habits can improve the perception of interventions [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], resorting to tailored dietary advice has proved more efficient than generic dietary advice [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194764.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, dietary advice identified as being theoretically efficient needs to be acceptable (e.g. it should appear realistic to implement it in the diet) to the targeted population if it is to be effective in practice [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194764.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although women in the periconceptional period are keener to adopt healthier eating behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we could anticipate that the efficiency of dietary advice might be limited by its acceptability. Our objective was therefore to identify the dietary changes most efficient in improving nutrient adequacy during pregnancy, and to investigate a possible trade-off with acceptability.</p><p>We therefore ran a simulation and optimization study to evaluate the theoretical efficiency of three different types of dietary changes in improving the nutrient adequacy of the diet for the first trimester of pregnancy, followed by a study to evaluate the acceptability (declared intention to use in the diet) of these dietary changes to pregnant women. Finally, we combined the two studies in order to analyze the degree of acceptability of these changes that might limit an improvement in the nutrient adequacy of the diet during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We report the results of two studies, a simulation &#x00026; optimization study and an acceptability study, which are detailed below and the combination of their results are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194764.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>. Briefly, the simulation &#x00026; optimization study allowed us to identify dietary changes that would be theoretically efficient in increasing the nutrient adequacy during the first trimester of pregnancy. The acceptability (as the declared intention to use in the diet) of these changes was then evaluated by a panel of French pregnant women during an online survey.</p><fig id="pone.0194764.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0194764.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Combination between the simulation &#x00026; optimization study and the acceptability study.</title><p>Type-1 dietary changes consist in modifying the amount of a food item present in the observed diet (D0&#x02019;). Type-2 dietary changes consist in replacing a food item consumed in the observed diet (D0&#x02019;) by a food item from the same subgroup. Selection of food items to be used as potential substitutes under type-2 dietary changes was made to account for their consumption in the French population, their price and their seasonality. Type-3 dietary changes consist in replacing a food item consumed in the observed diet (D0&#x02019;) by a food item from the same group or that could be consumed at the same time according to the French cultural meal scheme. For the simulation &#x00026; optimization study (upper part), a step by step optimization process of each individual diet according to each type of changes was used, and this resulted in evaluating the efficiency of each type of changes and identifying the 20 most efficient changes of each type. In the acceptability study, each individual tested in total, 18 different dietary changes (6 of the most efficient of each type), that were divided into 3 sets composed by 6 dietary changes (two by type). Sets A, B and C were presented at three different occasions and each of the 18 changes was evaluated both a priori and a posteriori. Individuals were randomized in 3 groups (#1&#x02013;3) for the order of evaluation of the 3 sets for the three occasions, according to a Latin square.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0194764.g001"/></fig><sec id="sec007"><title>Simulation &#x00026; optimization study</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Dietary data</title><p>Data were collected between February 2006 and July 2007 in the context of the French Nutrition and Health Survey (Etude Nationale Nutrition Sant&#x000e9;, ENNS). The design and methods of the ENNS have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The survey was carried out in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. All participants gave their written informed consent and the survey protocol was approved by an Ethics Committee (H&#x000f4;pital Cochin, Paris, no. 2264) and the French Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale de l&#x02019;Informatique et des Libert&#x000e9;s, CNIL, authorization no.905481). The authors of the present study were granted permission to use anonymized data from the ENNS survey by its principal investigator (Unit&#x000e9; de Surveillance en Epid&#x000e9;miologie Nutritionnelle, USEN). The survey had a multistage, stratified, descriptive and cross-sectional design. Non-institutionalized 18 to 74-year-old people living in mainland France were selected at random and their dietary data were collected using three non-consecutive 24-hour recalls (including a weekend day) chosen randomly during a 2-week period. Dietary recalls were conducted over the telephone by trained dieticians. Nutritional values in terms of energy and nutrients were taken from a previously published nutrient database [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], updated as previously presented [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

This intake is defined as the level likely to satisfy a nutrient requirement and unlikely to be excessive, according to dietary reference values, which differ according to age, sex and physiological condition [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Briefly, the PANDiet is a 100-point score that results averaging two sub-scores, the Adequacy sub-score (Adeq-S) and the Moderation sub-score (Mod-S), so the higher the PANDiet score, the better the nutrient adequacy. The composition of each sub-score is detailed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194764.s012">S1 Text</xref></bold>.

As previously described, for our study, the PANDiet score was adapted for early pregnancy in order to evaluate the nutrient adequacy of women of childbearing age during the first trimester of pregnancy.

The same process was implemented for the three types of dietary changes. Step 1 consisted in calculating the PANDiet score for pregnancy for the initial observed diet (D0). Step 2 involved the potential replacement of 134 food items not recommended during pregnancy and included in each observed diet with its cooked version for raw meat when available in the database (n = 4), with a very similar food item when identifiable (n = 3) or with an equivalent &#x0201c;average food&#x0201d; (n = 127), the latter being a theoretical food whose nutritional composition is the mean of that of similar food items weighted by their consumption in the population. The diet thus obtained was called the &#x0201c;initial observed modified diet&#x0201d; (D0&#x02019;) and its associated PANDiet score was calculated. Step 3 then consisted in generating all possible dietary changes (depending on the selected type) with respect to D0&#x02019;. Step 4 consisted in selecting the dietary change that enabled the greatest improvement in the PANDiet score while not decreasing energy intake versus D0&#x02019; or increasing it by more than 150 kcal. This was in line with the French guidelines which consider a 150-kcal increase in energy intake during the first trimester of pregnancy to be an approximate reference value [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

The women recruited for the study were members of an online panel operated by a generalist market research company (QualiQuanti), aged from 18 to 44 years and living in mainland France (n = 17,244). After eligibility was checked, women signed a consent form electronically. Non-inclusion criteria were as follows: not pregnant, more than six months pregnant, multiple pregnancy, specific diet linked to the dietary management of metabolic disorders or major food exclusions and no signature of the consent form. Eligible participants (n = 155) were asked to answer a questionnaire on their usual consumption of the 56 (out of 66) food subgroups involved in the dietary changes. This questionnaire was mainly used to avoid proposing the evaluation of a dietary change that might be irrelevant to their diet.

The three types of tailored dietary changes had different a priori graded difficulty in implementation by individuals ranging from type-1 where no new foods were added to the initial diet, to type-2 where a new food item could be added to the food repertoire providing it belonged to a food subgroup that was already being consumed by the individual, and type-3 where a food item belonging to new food subgroups could be added to the food repertoire (providing that it belonged to the same group or could be consumed at the same time). In type-1 dietary changes, a broadening of the food repertoire remained impossible and the individual's eating habits were preserved. By contrast, type-2 dietary changes produced diets containing a mean of eight supplemental food items (out of a possible ten) and no new food subgroups (by construction) and type-3 dietary changes generated diets containing a mean of four supplemental food subgroups (out of a possible ten). The type-2 dietary changes were substitutions limited to a particular food subgroup, thus their impact on the individual's eating habits remained small. By contrast, type-3 dietary changes were based on substitutions between food items from the same group or consumed at the same time, enabling a greater broadening of the food repertoire. As expected, the types of dietary changes which enabled more broadening of the food repertoire were the most efficient in improving the nutrient adequacy of the diet. In the online survey, the type which least broadened the food repertoire was found more acceptable by pregnant women. However, the relationship between efficiency and acceptability was not linear. Our analysis of this trade-off was able to show that in general, the final expected impact of a higher theoretically efficient change is largely limited by the lower acceptability.</p><p>Furthermore, the tailored approach used here appeared to be more efficient than a generic approach. In particular, tailored dietary changes based on the observed diet resulted in a greater increase in the simulated-pregnancy PANDiet score after four (type-1) and two (types -2 and -3) dietary changes than adding any of the 150-kcal snacks recommended during pregnancy and also simulated in the same population, as reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>It is important to note that even though the type-1 dietary changes did not broaden the food repertoire and resulted in only a minor improvement in overall nutrient adequacy as compared to the other types of dietary changes, they could still improve the overall nutrient adequacy of women at the start of their pregnancy, by balancing the amounts of different foods consumed. They could even be more efficient than type-2 dietary changes in improving the intake of certain nutrients. For instance, the probability of an adequate dietary fiber intake, which is low in France and other western countries [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194764.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], was more increased with type-1 than with type-2 dietary changes.</p><p>The type-2 dietary changes were surprisingly efficient in improving overall nutrient adequacy at the beginning of pregnancy, inasmuch as we limited the extent of substitutions (based on the level of consumption of food items in the French population, their price and seasonality). Overall, the type-2 dietary changes improved the probability of adequacy for all nutrient intakes in most of the population, except for some specific nutrients (such as vitamin D and iodine, whose intakes were markedly inadequate). When focusing on folate, whose requirement fulfillment at the start of pregnancy is very important [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the type-2 dietary changes were more efficient than type-1 changes in improving the probability of adequate intake.</p><p>The marked efficiency of type-3 dietary changes could be ascribed to a greater use of food items belonging to the &#x0201c;Fish, unprocessed&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Nuts, oilseeds and oil fruits&#x0201d; subgroups, the consumption of which remains low in the French population [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Introducing foods from these subgroups contributed to dramatically improving the intake of long chain PUFA and vitamin D. This could be seen as a major strength of this type of dietary change, knowing that an adequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids can impact pregnancy outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], human milk composition and the DHA status of offspring [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, with type-3 dietary changes, the slight decrease in the probabilities of adequacy for calcium and vitamin A intakes could be ascribed to substituting food items from the &#x0201c;Dairy&#x0201d; group with those from the &#x0201c;Fruits and nuts&#x0201d; group, and from the &#x0201c;Butter, margarine and fresh cream&#x0201d; subgroup with those from the &#x0201c;Oil&#x0201d; subgroup. Such slight reductions could be considered as side effects of the global approach used in our dietary counseling model, which was driven by increasing the probability of overall nutrient adequacy of the diet, not the intake of a specific nutrient.</p><p>A comparison of the efficiency results achieved with each type of dietary change revealed that broadening the usual food repertoire was necessary to meet nutrient requirements, a finding which had already been highlighted during a diet modeling study in French adults [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Here we could show that broadening the food repertoire was deemed less acceptable. This lower acceptability should be expected to be a firm limit to the efficiency of that type of dietary change for improving nutrient adequacy of the diet.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>There are no data comparing the nutritional efficiency of tailored dietary changes with a priori graded difficulty of implementation and studying their acceptability in pregnant women. In this group, dietary interventions have mostly targeted those who are overweight and/or obese and/or at risk of gestational diabetes. In most cases, dietary counseling has been based on generic dietary guidelines (e.g. increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables, increasing dietary fiber intakes, and reducing those of SFA and refined carbohydrates); to some extent they have been adapted for pregnant women [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194764.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], but not tailored to the adequacy of their nutrient intakes in view of the specific nutrient requirements for pregnancy. By contrast, our study was conducted in a general population of women, and identified dietary advice based on theoretical efficiency (using a tailored approach) and acceptability (using a dedicated online survey). A major strength of our approach was the dual assessment of efficiency and acceptability, considering the trade-offs that could exist between them as a function of the type of changes.</p><p>The principal limitation of this study was its theoretical aspect because we used a dietary optimization model to generate theoretical best changes for being tested in the acceptability study. Although three days of record is a standard, relevant method in dietary surveys, and has proven adequate to score the diet of the individuals with the PANDiet system, it is not able to capture food items that are less frequently consumed and this could have slightly limited the number of dietary changes that could have been studied. Then, it can be noted that the food grouping used in types-2 and -3 dietary changes had an impact on the dietary changes that were the most proposed by our algorithm, but it corresponds to the classification used by ANSES in France. Furthermore, we used dietary data from women of childbearing age, whereas we could hypothesize that if they had been pregnant, some of the women would have adopted a healthier diet [<xref rid="pone.0194764.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Nonetheless, the approach remains relevant to women of childbearing age who are considering changes to their diet during the periconceptional period, because we were able to show that at the start of pregnancy, just a few tailored dietary changes to the pre-pregnancy diet would result in marked improvements in nutrient adequacy. As some confounders that could impact dietary intakes such as medical conditions, physical activity or gestational weight gain were not collected in the acceptability study because women were not followed all along their pregnancy, they could not be included in the statistical analysis, and this could be a limitation of this part of the study. Then, evaluating the acceptability of a dietary change as the intention to use it could be considered as a limitation since it is a general endpoint. In the future, more specific dimensions of the acceptability could be evaluated (such as the cost, the cooking skills and the preferences). The motivation of women to modify their dietary habits during pregnancy could also be evaluated using a dedicated behavior change theory. Lastly, because we needed first of all to design different types of dietary changes and evaluate their efficiency in improving the nutrient adequacy of the diet, efficiency and acceptability could not have been evaluated in the same samples.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we characterize a clear trade-off between theoretical efficiency and acceptability of dietary changes with a graded broadening of the food repertoire, in order to improve nutrient adequacy during pregnancy in French women: the type of dietary changes that most broadened the food repertoire and most improved the nutrient adequacy was also the least acceptable. This trade-off has practical implication for the design of dietary interventions that would be practically effective in improving the nutrient adequacy of pregnant women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194764.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Characteristics of women of childbearing age (premenopausal, 18&#x02013;44y, <italic>n</italic> = 344) from the ENNS<sup>1</sup> survey.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0194764.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194764.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Items, reference values<sup>1</sup> and variabilities used to calculate the PANDiet score at the start of pregnancy.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0194764.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194764.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Number of food items by subgroups in total, and number of food items whose the amount consumed could be modified with type-1 dietary changes, whose the substitution is possible with types -2 and -3 dietary changes, and that could be used as a substitute in types -2 and -3 dietary changes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0194764.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194764.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Characteristics of pregnant women (<italic>n</italic> = 115) included in the acceptability study of dietary changes during pregnancy.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0194764.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194764.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>PANDiet scores, Adeq-S, Mod-S, probabilities of adequacy for nutrient intakes and total energy intake excluding alcohol for the initial observed diet (D0), the initial observed modified diet (D0&#x02019;), their delta (&#x00394;0&#x02019;) and the percentage of individuals with an increase between D0&#x02019;
