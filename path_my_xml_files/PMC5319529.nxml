Approximately 20&#x02013;50% of patients with leiomyoma have related symptoms such as excessive menstrual bleeding, which may lead to anemia, pelvic pressure, and increased uterine size.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> No approved medical treatment to completely eliminate uterine fibroids is currently available. The application of medical treatments is limited to the reduction of related symptoms before surgery. Moreover, interest in nonsurgical treatments of uterine fibroids has grown.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Few medical options are currently available for preoperative and symptom management; 2 options are mifepristone and enantone.</p><p>Mifepristone can effectively inhibit the progesterone receptor,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> which is contained in uterine fibroids.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> This medication is beneficial in that it reduces bleeding, fibroid-related pain, and the size of the uterine fibroids.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The effectiveness of mifepristone in the treatment of uterine fibroids has been demonstrated with 5- and 10-mg doses over 3-, 6-, and 12-month treatment periods in several trials.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Other studies have shown that 10&#x0200a;mg of mifepristone is as effective as 25 and 50&#x0200a;mg with fewer side effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>Enantone is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog and is considered to be the most effective medical therapy for correction of anemia, reduction of fibroid size, and control of excessive menstrual bleeding.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, there are still concerns about the potential risks of drug-related side effects; especially with long-term use of enantone, patients may also experience bone mineral loss and menopausal symptoms. Most of these side effects can be prevented with a hormonal add-back; however, such treatment may reduce the ability of enantone to reduce the fibroid size.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, we compared the efficacy and safety of mifepristone (10 and 25&#x0200a;mg/day) with those of enantone (3.75&#x0200a;mg/month) over a 3-month period.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized clinical trial included 3 treatment groups to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10&#x0200a;mg/day of mifepristone, 25&#x0200a;mg/day of mifepristone, and 3.75&#x0200a;mg/month of enantone for 3 months to treat uterine fibroids. This study is based on the previously established evidence that low-dose mifepristone reduces fibroid size, relieves the associated symptomatology, and improves the patient's general condition.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p><p>This study was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China. Patients were recruited from 8 sites, and all patients provided written informed consent. The inclusion criteria were a uterine size equivalent to at least 10 weeks of gestation in a gravid uterus; if the uterine size did not reach that equivalent to 10 weeks of gestation, then the presence of 1 or more of the following symptoms: menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pressure, or anemia; and providing written informed consent. The exclusion criteria were postmenopause; submucosal fibroids; suspicion or diagnosis of uterine or endometrial malignancy; adnexal mass or endometriosis; coagulation dysfunction and bleeding tendencies; severe anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level of &#x0003c;6&#x0200a;g/dL; suspicion or diagnosis of pregnancy or breastfeeding; hepatic or renal malfunction; mifepristone therapy in the last 3 months; and allergy to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog drug class.</p><p>Qualified subjects were randomized into 3 treatment groups:</p><p>10-mg mifepristone group: starting from day 1 to 3 of the menstrual cycle, 1 10-mg tablet of mifepristone was taken orally every day for 84 days.</p><p>25-mg mifepristone group: starting from day 1 to 3 of the menstrual cycle, 1 25-mg tablet of mifepristone was taken orally every day for 84 days.</p><p>3.75-mg enantone group: starting from day 1 to 5 of the menstrual cycle, a subcutaneous injection of 3.75&#x0200a;mg of enantone was administered every 28 days for 84 days (3 injections).</p><p>Because mifepristone has been on the market in China for many years, according to the State Food and Drug Administration's regulations on supplementary application for additional indications, this study randomized 500 patients at a ratio of 3:1:1 to the 10-mg mifepristone group, 25-mg mifepristone group, and enantone group, respectively. The mifepristone tablets were supplied by Zizhu Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China).</p><p>A complete gynecological examination and abdominal or vaginal ultrasound examination of the uterus were performed at the beginning and end of treatment. The fibroid volume was calculated using the following formula<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>:</p><p>fibroid volume = 0.5236ABC,</p><p>where A, B, and C are the diameters of the sphere in each of the 3 planes and are expressed in cubic centimeters. If the patient had more than 1 fibroid, the measurement of the largest fibroid was taken and its variations were used to evaluate efficacy. The volume of the uterus was also measured using the above equation.</p><p>Measurements taken at the end of each treatment visit were performed by sonographers who were blinded to the previous measurements, knowing only the localization of the fibroid to be measured. Blood samples were taken for hematological testing and determination of hepatic transaminase levels at the first and last visit.</p><p>The patients had 5 visits throughout the study: the screening visit (Visit 1), randomization visit (Visit 2), and 3 evaluation visits (Visits 3&#x02013;5). There were no follow-up visits after the treatment. All patients were asked to report their bleeding situation and leiomyoma-related symptoms (Visits 1 and 3&#x02013;5), which were graded on a 3-point scale (0 = no symptoms, 1 = light symptoms, 2 = severe symptoms). The symptoms were classified into 2 categories: pelvic pressure and pain. The scores were registered between the 2 groups at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.</p><p>The red blood cell count and concentrations of hemoglobin, liver transferase enzymes, cortisol, estradiol, and follicle-stimulating hormone were monitored before and after treatment. The primary efficacy variable was the change in fibroid volumes before and after treatment. The secondary efficacy variables were the changes in the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit and improvement in symptoms including menstrual blood loss, pelvic pressure, dysmenorrhea, and non-menstrual abdominal pain. The safety variables included adverse events and other laboratory parameters.</p><p>The drugs were coded using a statistics code table produced by SAS software (Cary, North Carolina) and dispensed according to the patient enrollment sequence and drug code in ascending order.</p></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Data analysis</title><p>The results are presented in absolute frequencies, percentages, mean values, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals for the mean values in fibroid and uterine volumes. A 2-sided <italic>t</italic>-test was adopted through the data analysis. Analysis of variance, a nonparametric test, or the chi-square test was used to evaluate homogeneity among the 3 treatment groups.</p><p>The main efficacy measure was calculated and compared among the 3 groups using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel/chi-square test stratified by sites, at &#x003b1; = 0.05 and corrected by side effect. The 95% confidence intervals for intergroup differences were also calculated. The secondary efficacy measure was analyzed and compared among the 3 groups using analysis of variance at &#x003b1; = 0.05 and corrected by side effect. The pre- versus post-treatment changes in hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, pelvic pressure, and lower abdominal pain scores were analyzed using paired comparisons.</p><p>Statistical data processing, summaries, and analyses were performed using SAS software (Cary, North Carolina), version 8.2.

There was a significant reduction in the volume of the 2 largest fibroids in the 10- and 25-mg mifepristone groups and in the enantone group (40.27%, 42.59%, and 44.49%, respectively), with no significant differences among the groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.49).</p><p>Compared with the enantone group (55.06%), the 10- and 25-mg mifepristone groups had more participants who developed amenorrhea after the first month of treatment (76.41% and 72.00%, respectively). The mean blood hemoglobin level, red blood cell count, and hematocrit were significantly improved with no significant differences among the 3 groups, as well as dysmenorrhea, partly due to the amenorrhea. In all groups, other fibroid-related symptoms, such as pelvic pressure and pain, were significantly relieved compared with the baseline in all 3 groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001). According to Fiscella et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> mifepristone treatment was also beneficial for patients&#x02019; health status and energy improvement.</p><p>A significant reduction in the uterine volume was observed in all 3 groups, and the enantone group (43.58%) exhibited a more significant reduction than both mifepristone groups. However, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events in the enantone group (32.58%) was higher than that in the 10- and 25-mg mifepristone groups (13.59% and 17.00%, respectively); these adverse events included hot flashes, mood changes, sweating, and vaginal dryness. In both mifepristone groups, the plasma estradiol levels were maintained in the mid-follicular range, whereas patients in the enantone group exhibited a significant reduction to postmenopausal levels (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001).</p><p>In this study, few patients had abnormal alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase concentrations after treatment; the mechanism for this is unclear. However, none of these patients had elevated liver transaminase concentrations of &#x0003e;100&#x0200a;U/L with clinical significance. Only 1 patient in the 10-mg mifepristone group had an elevated cortisol level after the 3-month treatment. However, considering the anti-glucocorticoid properties of mifepristone and the short course of this study, the cortisol level should be noted in patients undergoing long-term use in the clinical setting.</p><p>There are some limitations of this study. It was not specifically designed to assess surgical outcomes, and we had no follow-up data about the patients&#x02019; relapses and or resumption of their regular menstrual cycles after the treatment. All enrolled participants were Han Chinese, which may limit generalization of the results to other populations. Additionally, the duration of treatment was restricted to 13 weeks. Hence, more data on the benefits and risks of long-term treatment with mifepristone are needed. Furthermore, there are methodological limitations such as the lack of support for the sample size selection and blinding. Potential bias may have been introduced owing to the lack of blinding during the study. However, it was very difficult to apply blinding because mifepristone was orally administered and enantone was subcutaneously injected.</p><p>Based on the previous data and this study, 10&#x0200a;mg of mifepristone shows potential for greater clinical use. Additionally, compared with enantone and 25&#x0200a;mg of mifepristone, it offers a more suitable alternative for patients before surgery because it can be orally administered with a comparable reduction in fibroid size, fewer side effects, and improvement in the hemoglobin level, decreasing the potential risk of a blood transfusion during the surgery. However, further studies of the safety of long-term 10-mg mifepristone treatment are needed for clinical application, especially for perimenopausal patients who may be able to take it to decrease the size of uterine fibroids and relieve related symptoms until menopause. In this way, it may be particularly beneficial for perimenopausal patients in terms of lowering cost and improving quality of life.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our observation of 501 patients divided into 10-mg mifepristone, 25-mg mifepristone, and 3.75-mg enantone groups for 3 months suggests that the largest fibroid significantly and comparably decreased in size among the 3 groups. Leiomyoma-related symptoms improved comparably as well; these symptoms included menstrual blood loss, hemoglobin levels, dysmenorrhea, and non-menstrual abdominal pain. Although these treatments were well tolerated during the study, patients in the 3.75-mg enantone group reported more adverse events than those in the mifepristone groups. Mifepristone at a dose as low as 10&#x0200a;mg/day may be effective in treating uterine fibroids before surgery, serving a similar purpose as enantone.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: FSH = follicle-stimulating hormone, GnRHa = gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog, ITT = intention-to-treat.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>LC, LQ, and QH contributed equally to this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buttram</surname><given-names>JVC</given-names></name><name><surname>Reiter</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name></person-group>
