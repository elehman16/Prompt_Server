The PC10 was chosen because it is the bleaching agent most frequently found on the market,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and has been reported in the majority of publications on home bleaching in the last 20 years.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>In relation to different methodologies, <italic>in situ</italic> models have advantages compared with <italic>in vitro</italic> models, because the presence of human saliva and acquired pellicle provide remineralization and protection to the enamel surface.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Two different methodologies using the <italic>in situ</italic> model to simulate realistic clinical conditions for night guard vital bleaching treatments were found in the literature. The first methodology used fragments of enamel and dentin fixed on the buccal surface of sound molars and/or premolars with the aid of phosphoric acid, adhesive and composite resin, and a custom tray for bleaching agent application. Although this technique is frequently used,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> it presents some disadvantages for the volunteer, such as the use of the adhesive system and resin composite on sound enamel, and the need for polishing the enamel at the end of the experiment. Moreover, the area that receives the fragment bonding is not bleached, and it could generate a stain on the buccal surface of the tooth. In the present study, the bleaching treatment and brushing were performed on human enamel fragments fixed onto removable palatine acrylic appliances, outside the oral medium, and were thus a less invasive method. These removable plates have also been used by Justino <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and Araujo <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Furthermore, a crossover model was used<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> because it is less expensive and statistically more powerful.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Each volunteer in this study was considered a statistical block so that the differences between them would be minimized. The differences include the biologic factors: Salivation levels, buffer capacity and saliva composition, in addition to diet and force during brushing.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Nevertheless, in the final roughness and microhardness analyses, the effect of the volunteers (block) was significant. This means that there was natural variability among the volunteers, even using exclusion criteria. Thus, as individuals are naturally different, it was expected that this effect would be significant. On the other hand, there were no statistical differences in both surface roughness and microhardness in the initial analyses. This result was satisfactory because it showed homogeneity at the beginning of the experiment.</p><p>Most published studies have evaluated the separate effect of PC10<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and toothpastes<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> on dental enamel. Few studies have evaluated the combined effect of those two treatments.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Considering that tooth brushing is a daily oral hygiene practice, whether the patient is undergoing bleaching treatment or not, the aim of the present study was to focus only on the combination effect of the bleaching agent with different toothpastes. Given the methodology used, it was not possible to determine which factor most affected the surface roughness and microhardness of enamel. The goal of the present study was the combined effect of both treatments only.</p><p>According to the results, the combined effect of PC10 and toothpastes significantly increased the enamel surface roughness. The bleaching gel used (perfect bleach) has a pH of 6 and is carbopol-free. Studies have reported that carbopol-free PC10 with pH close to neutral does not affect enamel surface roughness.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, when associated with toothpastes, this bleaching agent significantly increased the enamel surface roughness in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The enamel roughness was also increased for the placebo associated with the toothpaste groups. The placebo gel consisted of a carboxypolymethylene polymer (carbopol). This placebo was similar to bleaching agent in appearance and consistency and could not be easily identified by the volunteers.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The same placebo gel was used in other studies.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, it has been suggested that the carbopol contained in the placebo gel may also harmfully affect dental enamel.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, it can be assumed that the increased enamel surface roughness found in the placebo groups may be due to the effect of carbopol and abrasive agents contained in the toothpastes.</p><p>The toothpaste factor presented a significant difference in surface roughness. Toothpaste BS, composed of hydrated silica, calcium peroxide, and sodium bicarbonate created significantly rougher enamel compared with toothpaste R, which contains calcium carbonate, a polishing agent with less abrasive power.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Sodium bicarbonate contributes to stain removal,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> calcium peroxide provides a whitening effect due to oxygen release, and hydrated silica is an intermediate abrasive agent.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The combination of abrasive agents in a single toothpaste could explain the significant increase in enamel surface roughness with toothpaste BS. According to Haywood<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> there is a group of whitening toothpastes that are more abrasive than regular toothpastes, thus the excessive use of abrasives combined with more vigorous brushing not only acts on stain removal, but may also promote exaggerated enamel wear.</p><p>Toothpaste W, with hydrated silica, presented no statistical difference from toothpastes BS and R. W&#x000fc;lknitz<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> evaluated the abrasiveness and cleaning capacity of different toothpastes. The author considered that hydrated silica was an intermediate abrasive agent, and was more efficient in removing stains from enamel and dentin compared with other abrasives. The result obtained for toothpaste W may be due to the moderate abrasiveness of hydrated silica, placing this abrasive agent in an intermediate position.</p><p>In accordance with Bollen <italic>et al.</italic>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> surface roughness above 0.20 &#x000b5;m leads to dental plaque accumulation. None of the toothpastes studied presented roughness above this value. Despite the statistical difference between the roughness created by toothpaste BS (0.20 &#x000b5;m) and toothpaste R (0.15 &#x000b5;m), it can be assumed that a difference of 0.05 &#x000b5;m would not be a clinical issue.</p><p>Several authors have shown that the microhardness of enamel changes after exposure to PC10 under a variety of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic> conditions.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, McCracken and Haywood<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> reported that PC10 caused a 1.06 &#x000b5;g/mm<sup>2</sup> calcium loss on enamel without clinical significance. In the present study, the association of PC10 with toothpastes caused a significant decrease in microhardness. The same decrease in microhardness could be observed in the placebo groups.</p><p>The toothpaste factor was not significant, which highlights that the different compositions of the toothpastes did not affect the enamel microhardness. In relation to the composition, all toothpastes used in the present study contained fluoride. Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> evaluated whitening toothpastes with and without fluoride, and non-fluoride toothpastes exhibited a greater mineral loss; the fluoride toothpastes presented were found to have the cariostatic effect expected as a result of the remineralization process. Furthermore, brushing with fluoride toothpaste helps to prevent the decrease in surface microhardness during bleaching treatment.<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The absence of fluoride in toothpastes could result in lower surface microhardness as well as higher roughness values of enamel. In addition, the presence of fluoride in the PC10 gel could have had a positive influence on the results of this research. Attin <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> revealed that the contact of fluoride with the tooth surface was important for the enamel remineralization process and the increase in surface microhardness.</p><p>In this <italic>in situ</italic> study, the presence of saliva may have played an important role on the results. The combination of an <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> study to evaluate the effect of three PC10 agents on the microhardness of enamel indicated that the effect of bleaching gel may be modified by the action of human saliva on enamel remineralization.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Some studies have suggested that saliva could revert some mineral loss caused by bleaching treatment.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>In an overall analysis of all groups, the mean initial microhardness was 420 VHN, with a decrease of 95 VHN in 21 days after combining the treatments with toothpastes. It is not known whether this decrease is clinically significant or not. Although the enamel microhardness was not evaluated some weeks after the end of the bleaching treatment, it is believed that human saliva may have led to enamel microhardness recovery due to its remineralization capacity.<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>Within the clinical significance of the present study is the evidence that enamel microhardness and surface roughness are altered when PC10 bleaching is associated with tooth brushing using toothpastes BS, R, and W. Moreover, it can be speculated that an individual could use toothpastes BS, R, and W, while bleaching his teeth with PC10 with no clinical significance on enamel microhardness and surface roughness related to the choice of the toothpaste.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>
