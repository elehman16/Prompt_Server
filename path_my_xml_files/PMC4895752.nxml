Individual when exposed to a stressor, a physiological compensatory response to stress is launched by the body that is activation of the sympathetic nervous system and release of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine occurs from adrenal medulla via hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Prolonged exposure to stressors can manifest regarding emotional, behavioral, and even physical symptoms and these symptoms of stress vary enormously among different individuals. Such kind of chronic stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases such as hypertension, stroke, ulcers, coronary heart diseases, decreased immunity, and metabolic disorders, and also mental imbalance which may lead to anxiety and depression.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There are no drugs available currently in modern medicine which modulate the compensatory mechanism to stress with minimal adverse effects.</p><p>In Ayurveda, the herb <italic>Guduchi</italic> (<italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> (Willd.) Miers.) has been used since long for its <italic>Rasayana</italic> properties to increase the vigor and immunity. The term &#x0201c;<italic>Amrita</italic>&#x0201d; is attributed to its ability to impart youthfulness, vitality, and longevity. Pharmacological properties of <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> are <italic>Deepana</italic> (ability to facilitate metabolism), <italic>Jwaranashana</italic> (to alleviate fever) and <italic>Tridosha Shamaka</italic> (helps to maintain homeostasis of <italic>Doshas</italic> during stressful situations). It is found to be safe on hematological and biochemical organ function tests and has muscle strengthening, lipid lowering action in healthy individuals.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It has been shown that the immune system can function as a neuroendocrine organ since it can synthesize not only hormones and neuropeptides but also cytokines that have an impact on the neuroendocrine system.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Stress is responsible for physiological compensatory mechanism via neuroendocrine axis. <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> currently used as cardiotonic, but its effect on physical performance is not reported.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The hypothesis of the study was that drugs which modulate immunity should have an impact on individual's physiological compensatory mechanism so along with cardiovascular performance does any changes in physical performance occurs. Hence in this study, evaluation of the effect of <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> aqueous extract in healthy participants when subjected to physical stress on physical performance and sympathetic activity is done.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a pilot study, designed as prospective, open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled comparative study in healthy male adult volunteers with fixed dosage regimen.
