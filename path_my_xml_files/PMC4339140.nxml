training on foot progression angle, weight-bearing ratio, and knee adduction moment in
patients with degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee. [Subjects] The subjects were 37
patients diagnosed with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3 degenerative knee osteoarthritis.
They were randomly allocated to three groups: a proprioceptive training group (PT group),
quadriceps strengthening group (QS group), and control group. [Methods] The study
parameters of the three groups were compared before and after a 12-week training period.
Therapeutic exercises were performed twice per week for 12 weeks. Outcomes included the
foot progression angle, weight-bearing ratio, and knee adduction moment. [Results] First,
a significant difference in the foot progression angle was observed among the groups,
significantly increasing in the PTG compared with the CG. Second, a significant difference
in the weight-bearing ratio was observed among the groups, significantly increasing in the
PTG compared with the CG. Third, a significant difference in the first peak knee adduction
moment was observed among the groups, significantly decreasing in the PTG compared with
the CG. [Conclusion] The results of the present study indicate that proprioceptive
training increased the foot progression angle and weight-bearing ratio and decreased the
first peak knee adduction moment. Moreover, incorporating proprioceptive training into a
physical therapy exercise program could improve functional ability and delay the
progression of degenerative osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Knee adduction moment</kwd><kwd>Proprioceptive training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Degenerative knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and painful disease with advancing age
and leads to functional disorder<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Patients with degenerative knee OA clinically complain of pain, decreased muscle strength,
joint instability, joint stiffness, and proprioceptive deficits, all of which lead to a
decrease in or loss of function<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Quadriceps muscle weakness leads to a change in the biomechanics and axis of the knee
joint<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, negatively affecting joint
mobility, posture, and gait<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
changes also cause increased dynamic loading in the medial knee joint, resulting in
degenerative knee OA<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in the
ankle joint especially affect lower extremity alignment during the stance phase and result
in overuse of the knee joint<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In clinical
practice, rehabilitation for knee OA typically aims to increase muscle strength and enhance
proprioceptive function<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
due to the contribution of the quadriceps to shock absorption and stability at the knee
during gait, previous studies focused more on strengthening knee joint muscles, mainly the
quadriceps<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since quadriceps weakness
strongly contributes to disability in knee OA, this may alter local contact stress in a
manner detrimental to articular cartilage<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It may also lead to increased impulse loading, which has been
associated with knee pain and may contribute to knee OA<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Anwer et al. indicated that quadriceps exercises can significantly
improve knee pain and quadriceps strength<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In patients with degenerative OA, there is a prominent loss of proprioception compared with
healthy people of the same age and gender<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. OA can cause changes that affect not only intracapsular tissues
but also periarticular tissues such as ligaments, capsules, tendons, and muscle, leading to
proprioceptive deficits both in extremes of joint position and body position<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study reported proprioception
deficits with age progression and reported a greater decrease in patients in knee OA<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is clear that in knee OA,
proprioception deficits may play a role in OA development and also as contributing risk
factors for the progression of OA<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Another study demonstrated the effects of proprioceptive training and strengthening exercise
on knee pain, joint function, and proprioception<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, studies related to the effects of proprioceptive training
and strengthening exercise on joint kinetics in patients with degenerative OA of the knee
are rare. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of proprioceptive
training using a balance pad and quadriceps strengthening exercise on foot progression
angle, weight-bearing angle, and peak knee adduction moment in patients with degenerative
knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects included 60 female patients over the age of 65&#x02005;years from Seoul A Senior
Welfare Center. The inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis with degenerative OA and had
radiologically stage 2 and 3 bilateral knee OA according to the Kellgren and Lawrence
scale<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> and (2) deficits in sensation,
circulation, balance, or range of motion,; lower extremity MMT; or serious foot problems
according to the index of Speechley and Tinetti. The exclusion criteria were (1) a history
of other neurologic or circulatory diseases or disorders, (2) any cardiovascular system
abnormality, or (3) any history of knee, hip, or ankle surgery.</p><p>This study used a randomized three-group pretest-posttest design. Subjects were randomly
allocated to a proprioceptive training group (PTG; n=16), quadriceps strengthening group
(QSG; n=16), or control group (CG; n=16). All 37 participants completed the intervention.
Randomization was accomplished with a computer using a basic random number generator. Prior
to the subjects&#x02019; participation, all procedures were explained, and each subject provided
written informed consent to participation. This study was approved by the Sahmyook
University Institutional Review Board.</p><p>The PTG and QSG therapeutic exercises<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>
were performed for 30&#x02005;min twice per week for 12 weeks. Therapeutic exercise programs were
performed one-on-one with a physical therapist. The ankle proprioceptive training program
focused on improvement of the proprioception sense of an ankle to correct the joint&#x02019;s
position. The PTG performed its exercise program with a Torsiomed (Haider Ltd, 2000,
Germany), which and consisted of frontal and sagittal plane exercise. The frontal plane
exercise comprised maintenance of balance, lateral tilting, and medial tilting, and the
sagittal plane exercise comprised forward tilting and backward tilting. Both the frontal and
sagittal plane exercises were performed 40 times repeatedly. In the first four weeks, the
exercises were performed while standing on both legs with the eyes open and with verbal
commands to provide the subjects with visual and auditory feedback. In the next four weeks,
they were performed while alternating between standing on the left or right leg. In the last
four weeks, the exercises were performed without any visual or auditory feedback. We
performed that without a visual and auditory feedback at last 4 weeks. The QSG performed
isometric exercise for improvement of muscle power. The subjects performed 10 repetitions
per set for a total of three sets in the long sitting and supine positions and gradually
increased the training intensity every 4 weeks. We offered both groups 3 minutes of rest
between sets for recovery from fatigue. On the other hand, the CG only applied a hot pack to
both knee for 20 minutes and then TENS at 80 to 120&#x02005;Hz for 15 minutes.</p><p>To evaluate the foot progression angle and weight-bearing ratio, radiographs were taken
with a Shimadzu 500 X-ray generator on 35.56 &#x000d7; 91.44 films in a long cassette. The
focus-film distance (FED) was set at 183&#x000b0; to minimize distortion evaluations. Subjects were
positioned on a foothold standing with the knees extended, and a radiographer measured the
foot progression angle in the same manner before and after the intervention. After this, the
angle of the superior side leg was measured.</p><p>Peak external knee adduction moment was measured using a 3D motion analysis system
(Orthostat 6.29, Motion Analysis Ltd, USA, 2005) with eight cameras and two force plates
(piezoelectric force plate, 600 &#x000d7; 900, Kistler, Winterthur, Switzerland) embedded in the
center of an 8-m walkway. Participants walked in their own low-heeled shoes at a
self-selected pace for five trials, and single-leg force platform contacts were recorded.
The peak knee adduction moment was normalized to body weight multiplied by height (force
[N]/body weight &#x000d7; distance [m]/height [m]). Outcome measures included knee adduction moment
magnitude (knee adduction impulse, loading response [1st] peak and terminal stance [2nd]
peak).</p><p>The SPSS ver. 12.0 statistical software was used for all analyses. Descriptive statistics
were used to describe patient characteristics after confirming the data were normally
distributed. Comparisons of all groups&#x02019; general characteristics were performed using the
independent t-test or chi-squared test. Pre- and post-intervention data were analyzed using
the paired t-test to test within-group differences and one-way ANOVA to test differences
among the groups. Duncan&#x02019;s post hoc test was used to test the significance of differences
between the groups. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all measurements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>General subject characteristics are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

with degenerative OA exhibited an increase in foot progression angle and weight-bearing
ratio and a decrease in first peak knee adduction moment.</p><p>In this study, there was a significant difference in foot progression angle during the
initial stance phase after the intervention. Previous studies have reported that the foot
progression angle directly affects the medial compartment compressive load in asymptomatic
individuals and those with mild to moderate knee OA<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, several interventions are aimed at reducing knee medial
compartment loading<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study
showed the effect of proprioceptive training, focusing on movement of the foot and ankle
joints. During proprioceptive training, subjects controlled the ankle joint in multiple
directions to maintain balance on the balance pad, and they repeatedly performed ankle
tilting in the frontal and sagittal planes. Movement of the ankle in various directions,
causing changes in ankle ligament length, facilitates joint stability by creating a reaction
to concentric movement<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current
study, ankle proprioceptive training improved proprioception and enhanced ankle stability in
elderly individuals<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results are
in accordance with findings showing that changing the foot position improves position sense
and joint stability.</p><p>Another interesting result was that the weight-bearing ratio significantly increased in the
PTG after the intervention. In a previous study, a weight-bearing ratio of &#x0003c; 50% was
defined as genu varus, and a weight-bearing ratio of &#x0003e; 50% was defined as genu
valgus<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Of the PTG, 31% were
classified as having genu varus. However, after the intervention, the percentage increased
to 43.67%. It is common to move the weight-bearing line laterally to the center of gravity
with a lateral wedge in shoes to correct varus deformities<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The changes in the weight-bearing ratio in the present study are
in accordance with this effect of a lateral wedge. Based on this, changes in foot
progression angle may result in changes in the weight-bearing ratio by shifting the center
of mass and the biomechanical axis to the lateral side.</p><p>In the present study, the peak knee adduction moment was used to determine the effects of
proprioceptive training and quadriceps muscle strengthening exercises. In particular, the
external adduction moment of the knee has been demonstrated to be a valid measure for load
on the knee medial compartment, a risk factor for disease progression<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a useful outcome measure following an
intervention<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The normal predominance
of the knee adduction moment throughout the stance phase of gait and its subsequently larger
medial knee compartment load relative to the lateral knee compartment load has been
suggested to contribute to the markedly greater incidence of advanced OA in the medial knee
compartment<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, in the
presence of medial compartment knee OA, articular cartilage degeneration leads to a
decreased medial joint space, creating a further shift in the lower limb alignment toward
varus<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> and an even greater adduction
moment about the knee during gait<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
study demonstrated that participants with degenerative OA exhibited a decrease in first peak
knee adduction moment after proprioceptive training. A previous study showed that
proprioceptive training increased lower extremity strength and neuromuscular control and
reduced peak knee adduction moment in patients with knee OA<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study showed that valgus bracing<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> and lateral heel wedges<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> reduced the magnitude of knee adduction moment during gait. In the
present results, the first peak knee adduction moment in the PTG decreased 24% after the
intervention. Previous studies of valgus bracing<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> and wedged insoles<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> showed reductions of 13 and 8%, respectively. It has been suggested
that every 20% increase in knee adduction moment increases the six-year risk of radiographic
progression sixfold<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> and that an 8%
increase in peak adduction moment increases the risk of developing chronic knee pain four
years later<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the current
study demonstrated that proprioceptive training decreased the adduction moment and delayed
disease progression.</p><p>Despite demonstrating the effectiveness of proprioceptive training on leg alignment and
knee adduction moment in patients with degenerative OA, this study had some limitations.
First, the statistical power was not calculated, and only a small number of subjects were
recruited. Second, because the participants consisted of only female patients over the age
of 65&#x02005;years, the results of this study cannot be generalized to all patients with
degenerative OA. Therefore, we suggest that further studies include subjects of both genders
and a wider age range.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Helmick</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Arnett</surname><given-names>FC</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Estimates of the prevalence of arthritis and selected
