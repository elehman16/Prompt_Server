However, patients continue to receive late referrals to PC even in comprehensive cancer centers. Patients and health professionals may perceive PC as &#x02018;a place to die,&#x02019; and this stigma is a barrier to timely referrals and to patient acceptance of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of psychosocial intervention and PC in patients with advanced cancer. The patients will be submitted to a series of brief psychosocial interventions that are based on cognitive behavioral therapy, and patient acceptance and satisfaction will be assessed. In addition, the impact of these interventions on depressive symptoms will be evaluated. A randomized, open-label, phase II trial with two intervention arms and a control group will be conducted. Patients who are started on palliative chemotherapy and who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. The study participants will be recruited from the outpatient oncology clinics at Barretos Cancer Hospital and will be randomized into one of the following three treatment arms: Arm A, which will include five weekly psychosocial interventions based on CBT in combination with early PC; Arm B, which will include early PC only; and Arm C, which will include standard oncologic care. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS-br), the Family Satisfaction with End-of-Life Care (FAMCARE)-Patient scale, and the Disease Understanding Protocol will be used for data collection. The patients will answer these questionnaires at baseline and 45, 90, 120 and 180&#x000a0;days after randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite evidence of the positive impact of early PC, it is often provided to patients only at later stages. The inadequate awareness and stigmatization of PC as a place to die are barriers that complicate the early referral. Patients with advanced cancer may benefit from a psychosocial and educational strategy that adequately prepares them for initial PC appointments after an early referral to PC. We anticipate that benefits of psychological intervention shall be synergistic to secondary emotional benefits from the early integration of PC.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was registered on 6 May 2014 with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02133274?term=NCT02133274&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02133274</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0655-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>neoplasms</kwd><kwd>palliative care</kwd><kwd>cognitive behavioral therapy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Approximately 32.6 million people worldwide are living with cancer that has been diagnosed within the last five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many cancer cases are diagnosed as metastatic disease despite advances in cancer prevention strategies. Furthermore, a significant portion of these cases are associated with disease recurrence during the monitoring period. These advanced disease cases are eligible for concurrent or exclusive monitoring by specialized palliative care (PC) teams. Approximately 6.5 million cancer patients are in PC worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The World Health Organization has defined PC as &#x02018;an approach that improves the quality of life (QL) of patients and families who face a life-threatening illness through the prevention and relief of suffering. This approach is based on the early identification, assessment, and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, PC should be provided by a multidisciplinary team that acts integrally in outpatient, hospital, and/or home environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Temel <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] evaluated the early integration of PC in non-small cell lung cancer patients who were starting first-line palliative chemotherapy. An improvement in the QL scores and a decrease in the symptoms of depression were evident 12&#x000a0;weeks after randomization. Furthermore, they found that the patients who received early PC were submitted to fewer aggressive treatments in the final stages of life. A post-hoc analysis inclusively demonstrated a 2.7-month increase in the overall survival rate of patients who received PC. A study by Bakitas <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] evaluated the early introduction of a psychoeducational program in the treatment of cancer patients from rural areas in the United States. The authors observed improved QL scores and reduced symptoms of depression over time. More recently, a cluster randomized clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] evaluated the early introduction of PC in a general oncology population in Canada. The main objective of this study was to improve the spiritual QL of patients 3&#x000a0;months after randomization. Improvements in the overall QL at 3 and 4&#x000a0;months after randomization, the spiritual QL after 4&#x000a0;months and patient satisfaction were observed in the patients who received early PC.</p><p>Despite evidence of the positive impact of early PC on the progress of cancer patients, PC is often provided to patients at later stages even at oncology and PC reference centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Brazil, reliable information on how and when cancer patients are referred to PC is lacking; however, we believe that patients are referred late to PC. The inadequate awareness and stigmatization of PC, which is perceived as a place to die, are barriers that complicate the early referral of patients to PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The title &#x02018;Palliative Care&#x02019;, which implies improvisation or something provisional, has complicated patient acceptance of PC within the context of early cancer support during chemotherapy. Patients who are referred to PC are often anxious at the first appointment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which leads to a high absenteeism rate.</p><p>Therefore, the main hypothesis of the present study is that patients with advanced cancer may benefit from a psychosocial and educational strategy that adequately prepares them for initial PC appointments after an early referral to PC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Main objectives</title><p>The main objectives of this study are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To assess the feasibility of a brief psychosocial intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and early PC in advanced cancer patients, including patient acceptance and satisfaction.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the impact of the intervention on symptoms of depression at 90&#x000a0;days after randomization and to compare the differences between the intervention groups and the control group and between the intervention groups.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To assess the impact of the interventions on symptoms of depression at 45, 120 and 180&#x000a0;days after randomization and to compare the differences between the intervention groups and the control group and between the intervention groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the impact of the interventions on anxiety symptoms at 45, 90, 120 and 180&#x000a0;days after randomization and to compare the differences between the intervention groups and the control group and between the intervention groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the impact of the interventions on the QL scores at 45, 90, 120 and 180&#x000a0;days after randomization and to compare the differences between the intervention groups and the control group and between the intervention groups;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the impact of the interventions on symptom scores (pain, fatigue, nausea, drowsiness, anorexia, dyspnea, and insomnia) at 45, 90, 120 and 180&#x000a0;days after randomization and to compare the differences between the intervention groups and the control group and between the intervention groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the differences in disease awareness at 45, 90, 120 and 180&#x000a0;days after randomization in the three arms of the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the differences in the number of invasive procedures at the end of life, such as intensive care unit admissions and chemotherapy during the last 14 to 28&#x000a0;days of life, between the treatment arms.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>This study will be a randomized open-label, phase II clinical trial with two intervention arms and a control group.

The HADS consists of 14 items that are divided into two subscales of seven items each (HADS-A and HADS-D). The score for each item ranges from 0 to 3. A score of 0 is the minimum score for each subscale, and 21 is the maximum score. The psychometric properties of HADS have previously been assessed in the Brazilian population and are considered adequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) screening questionnaire for depressive symptoms, which was originally developed to screen patients for depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, somatoform disorders, and eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The PHQ-9 was validated for use in Brazil in 2013 and is considered a useful tool for screening depression symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The PHQ-9 consists of nine questions that examine the presence of major depressive episode symptoms (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, DSM-IV) using the 4-point Likert scale (0 to 3) for a total of 27 points.</p><p>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Pal (EORTC QLQ-C15-Pal) consists of 15 items, and 14 of these items are answered using 4-point Likert-type scales (1 to 4). In addition, a single item assesses overall QL, which is measured using a numerical scale that ranges from 1 to 7. The QLQ-C15-Pal assesses two functional scales (physical and emotional), two symptom scales (fatigue and pain), and five single-item scales (nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, and constipation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

This study is preliminary in nature, and a key objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a new clinical intervention. Furthermore, this study aims to assess the magnitude of the effect of adding a psychosocial intervention to early PC, which has not been determined according to the literature and would be useful in planning a future definitive phase III trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Monitoring committee</title><p>An independent monitoring committee that consists of staff from the Center for Research Support (Coordenadores de Pesquisa do N&#x000fa;cleo de Apoio ao Pesquisador, NAP) of BCH will monitor the collection and analysis of the study data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Interim data analysis</title><p>An interim analysis is planned for 90&#x000a0;days after the inclusion of 20 participants with complete data in each arm.

We believe that the benefits of psychological intervention shall be synergistic to secondary emotional benefits from the early integration of PC. Therefore, this study will evaluate a new strategy for the transition into PC. Furthermore, the inclusion of early PC with or without a brief psychosocial and educational strategy will be compared to standard oncological care in a control arm (first-line palliative chemotherapy) in which patients are referred to PC by the attending physician.</p><p>Identifying the reasons patients are referred to PC services is essential because of the benefits of early PC in patients with advanced cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Patients are most likely referred to PC too late even at oncology reference centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Two randomized phase III trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found that early PC was associated with lower levels of depression symptoms compared with standard oncologic treatment. This study aims to confirm this benefit and to examine whether the psychosocial and educational strategy can reduce depression symptoms over time. This original approach may be useful in hospitals with settings similar to those at BCH. This large hospital is dedicated exclusively to oncology and has a well-structured PC service; however, this service is associated with significant patient stigmatization. Patients often perceive the PC unit as being exclusively for dying patients, which complicates their acceptance of early referral to PC.</p><p>The attribution of meaning is important for detecting maladaptive behaviors, which are modifiable through interventions according to CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. CBT is based on the premise that cognition affects behavior; however, cognition may be monitored and changed and the desired behavioral change may be achieved through cognitive change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. CBT aims to enable individuals to identify and modify their distorted or dysfunctional automatic thoughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Evidence suggests that CBT may benefit advanced-stage cancer patients by reducing anxiety symptoms, improving QL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and decreasing psychiatric disorders, which have been observed in cancer patients who were classified as high-risk for the development of such disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, the study population in the present study (advanced-stage cancer patients who start palliative chemotherapy) may be considered at a high risk for developing depression. Psychoeducation is another key tool used in CBT. In a previous clinical trial, cancer patients were submitted to a psychoeducational intervention. This strategy was effective in improving disease awareness rates, and the patients were better equipped to deal with problems, had lower levels of isolation and guilt, and felt a sense of belonging to the group. A broad sharing of experiences and lessons by other patients with advanced cancer was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>The strategy that has been proposed in this study is novel and has not yet been assessed in this context. BCH receives patients from all of the states in Brazil, particularly patients from the Southeast, Midwest and North regions because this hospital is recognized as a reference institution in the Brazilian public health system. Despite being monocentric, this study will assess the impact of the intervention in a culturally heterogeneous population with different needs, and the results of this study may be generalized to the entire Brazilian population.</p><p>The study has several limitations and challenges. The main limitation is the small sample size. This study is preliminary and will assess the feasibility of a new intervention and provide initial data on the magnitude of its benefit. Therefore, the statistical significance of this intervention is less important than the main objectives of the study. A larger confirmatory study may be necessary depending on the results of this phase II study. This study will include patients without underlying psychological problems. We anticipate difficulties in enrolling patients because many advanced cancer patients receive psychological support and use antidepressants as part of standard care. Another difficulty in enrolling patients may be the stigma regarding the PC unit and psychological approaches. However, those difficulties will be analyzed in the feasibility assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>Patient enrollment in the study began in August 2014.
