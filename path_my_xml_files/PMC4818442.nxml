There is a growing trend to treat throat symptom patients with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to suppress stomach acid, but most controlled studies fail to demonstrate a significant benefit of PPI over placebo. In addition, patient views on PPI use vary widely.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A UK multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial for adults with persistent throat symptoms to compare the effectiveness of treatment with the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) lansoprazole versus placebo.</p><p>The trial includes a six-month internal pilot, during which three sites will recruit 30 participants in total, to assess the practicality of the trial and assess the study procedures and willingness of the patient population to participate. If the pilot is successful, three additional sites will be opened to recruitment, and a further 302 participants recruited across the six main trial sites. Further trial sites may be opened, as necessary. The main trial will continue for a further 18 months. Participants will be followed up for 12 months from randomisation, throughout which both primary and secondary outcome data will be collected. The primary outcome is change in Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score, the &#x02018;area standard&#x02019; for this type of assessment, after 16 weeks (four months) of treatment. Secondary outcomes are RSI changes at 12 months after randomisation, Quality of Life assessment at four and 12 months, laryngeal mucosal changes, assessments of compliance and side effects, and patient-reported satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>TOPPITS is designed to evaluate the relative effectiveness of treatment with a proton pump inhibitor versus placebo in patients with persistent throat symptoms.

In one UK survey, 6 % of the middle-aged female population had had a persistent feeling of the something in the throat (globus) in the previous 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Globus is also reported to account for up to 4 % of ear, nose and throat (ENT) referrals to secondary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Throat clearing is the commonest single symptom in any voice clinic. Equally familiar are intermittent hoarse voice and postnasal drip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is claimed that 55 % of patients referred to a voice clinic have symptoms of extra oesophageal reflux (EOR), while an English study of primary care attenders indicated that 25 % had recent experience of persistent upper respiratory symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the general population, the lifetime incidence of milder variants of globus (a feeling of a lump in the throat) is over 40 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2010&#x02013;2011, the Hospital Episode Statistics online database of National Health Service (NHS) activity lists 1,142,404 first ENT consultations. A conservative estimate is that 5 % of these patients were referred for very common throat symptoms like throat clearing, fluctuating voice change, catarrh and chronic throat discomfort, which equates to over 57,000 NHS patients referred to secondary care that year in England alone. Some patients experience anxiety as they fear they may have throat cancer. Even if they have no features and no risk factors for cancer, they may be referred for urgent ENT clinic assessment&#x02014;a process which prolongs the anxiety, and at times the symptoms. In the absence of good quality treatment algorithms, patients also undergo invasive and costly assessments such as rigid endoscopic examination of the upper aerodigestive tract under general anaesthesia, which typically reveals no significant abnormality, and empiric trials of acid suppression, typically with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).</p><p>EOR symptoms have long been recognised as having a strong placebo response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The original evidence that reflux might affect the upper airway came from animal experiments, and the term &#x02018;acid laryngitis&#x02019; was coined 40 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Intracellular reactivation of acidified pepsin may explain pepsin activity at weakly acid pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is a growing trend to treat throat symptom patients empirically with PPIs, but most controlled studies fail to demonstrate a significant benefit of PPI over placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our UK Evidence Based Medicine EOR conference concluded that: &#x02018;Studies assessing PPIs in EOR suffer from variable study design and quality, small numbers and heavy selection bias and use a variety of different treatment regimes. The small proportion of controlled studies demonstrating overall benefit of PPI over placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] may incorporate a disproportionate improvement in heartburn, known to respond promptly to antacid therapies, without due regard to the upper airway symptoms per se&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There was little evidence on other pharmaceuticals such as H2 antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the Patient and Public Involvement background work for this proposal, individual interviews were conducted with several patients encompassing both young professionals and retired patients. All interviewees fully supported the research proposal. It was also clear, even from a small sample, that patient views on PPIs vary widely but all of them had been treated at some point with PPIs, sometimes on more than one occasion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p>This is a non-commercial study to determine the clinical effectiveness of the PPI lansoprazole compared with placebo, in patients referred to secondary care with persistent throat symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to compare the symptomatic response in patients with persistent throat symptoms at the end of 4 months (16 weeks) of treatment with lansoprazole versus placebo.</p><p>Secondary objectives are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To explore the feasibility of study recruitment by means of an internal pilot trial rehearsal whose data will be included in the main data for analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To compare the symptom response at the end of 4 months (16 weeks) of treatment with those at 12 months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine the utility of the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) questionnaire, the Comprehensive Reflux Symptom Score (CReSS) questionnaire items and subscales, endolaryngeal examination findings as scored by the Reflux Finding Score (RFS) and patient demographics including age, gender, smoking and body mass index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] as potential baseline determinants of treatment response.

The PI and colleagues will ensure that all clinicians at each site are informed about the nature and purpose of TOPPITS, to enhance recruitment.</p><p>At the initial clinic appointment a routine consultation and clinical examination will take place. Any patient with persistent throat symptoms will be asked to complete the RSI form, and the total minus the heartburn item will be computed. If a patient scores 10 or more non-heartburn items the physician will inform the patient of the trial and offer them participation.</p><p>If a patient scores 10 or more on the RSI&#x02014;Heart Burn, and is interested in the TOPPITS concept, a participant information sheet (PIS) will be given with an opportunity to view a DVD explaining study procedures (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The potential participant will be invited to attend the dedicated TOPPITS clinic at a subsequent date convenient for them. The details of such patients will be passed to the TOPPITS research nurse to arrange a convenient appointment. A screening log will be produced which will be filled in for all potential participants screened, including reason for ineligibility and/or refusal to participate.</p><p>Potential participants may also be screened using their primary care referral letters. The PIs at site will be responsible for sending out an invitation letter and PIS in the post, detailing the study. These patients will be booked straight onto a TOPPITS trial clinic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Eligible patients who have received the PIS through the routine clinic outpatient appointment or through the invite process will then attend a dedicated TOPPITS trial clinic, where any outstanding queries will be answered, followed by an invitation to participate from the consultant or research nurse. They will have all already have received the PIS and a study DVD. They will be given time to discuss the study further in this clinic. At the first trial clinic appointment, a more detailed confirmatory eligibility screen will be completed by the investigator to document participants&#x02019; fulfilment of the entry criteria for all patients considered for the study and subsequently included or excluded.</p><p>A screening log will be kept to document details of subjects who attend the trial clinic. For subjects who decline participation, the log will record any reasons specified for non-participation.</p><p>Patients taking acid suppressants, acid neutralisers or alginates prior to involvement in/being approached to take part in the TOPPITS trial must undergo a 4-week washout period of PPIs or 24 hours for alginates or acid neutralisers, before they start taking TOPPITS trial medication (prescribed as part of Clinic Visit 1). Consent should be taken prior to the washout period. Patients will be provided with a &#x02018;washout period card&#x02019; confirming when the washout period started, in case they attend a general practitioner (GP) or clinic appointment prior to Visit 1. This card can then be shown to the GP/consultant to try and ensure the patient does not take/is not prescribed acid suppressants, acid neutralisers or alginates.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Consent</title><p>Informed consent discussions will be undertaken by appropriate site staff (as per delegation log) involved in the study, including medical staff and research nurses, with the opportunity for participants to ask any questions. Because patients will have already received the patient information at their initial consultation (usually with a different physician to that running the trial clinic) or through the post with an invitation letter, and have taken the positive step to attend the trial clinic, formal TOPPITS consent can be obtained at the first dedicated trial clinic appointment. Those wishing to take part will provide written informed consent by signing and dating the study consent form, which will be witnessed and dated by a member of the research team with documented, delegated responsibility so to do. Written informed consent should always be obtained prior to randomisation and prior to study specific procedures/investigations. Those wishing to have further time to consider may attend a subsequent clinic if they decide to participate.</p><p>The original signed consent form will be retained in the Investigator Site File (ISF), with a copy in the clinical notes and a copy provided to the participant. The participant will specifically consent to their GP being informed of their participation in the study.</p><p>The right to refuse to participate without giving reasons must be respected.</p><p>Because of the small subject population, the patient information sheet, consent form and questionnaires for the study will be available only in English. Interpreters may be arranged for all visits of patients who require them either for verbal translation or for hearing-impaired subjects wishing to take part in the study, via local NHS arrangements. As per local custom, qualified interpreters may be used to explain the consent form and information sheet, and finding the most direct communication will be a priority.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The RSI remains the &#x02018;area standard&#x02019;, and despite well-rehearsed limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] is therefore our chosen primary outcome in the present proposal. Some reported studies have a baseline RSI only just above the normal level, others considerably higher. A Korean observational study of 455 patients reported that the mean RSI score fell from 15 at baseline to &#x0003c;6 after 12 weeks of the PPI rabeprazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Baseline RSI scores in a much smaller but comparative study of 62 patients treated with esomeprazole were considerably higher (&#x0003e;20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], whereas baseline scores in a rabeprazole randomised controlled trial were around 14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Two trials showed a benefit from a 3-month trial of acid suppression &#x02013; but Lam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] continued follow up for a further 6 weeks, when the effect disappeared, while Reichel et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] final measurement point was the end of therapy.</p><p>Throat symptoms impact on general health status measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A tool specifically designed to assess throat symptom patients is the LPR-HRQL tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which has also been validated in a Swedish population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Its 43 items are grouped into four domains and an overall impact category, and the tool appears responsive to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The TOPPITS primary outcome is the change in RSI at 4 months in the treatment and placebo groups in an intention-to-treat analysis. The nine-item RSI total score (0&#x02013;45) allows comparison with previous studies. We plan, however, to report also the RSI score omitting the heartburn item (0&#x02013;40), which we and others note can skew the results in favour of PPIs in past small trials. Our proposed analysis will also address the issue of severity variation, through our stratification variables of site and baseline severity.</p><p>Secondary outcomes are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>RSI changes as above, at 12 months after randomisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quality of life: change in LPR-HRQL total score and subscale at 4 and 12 months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Laryngeal mucosal changes&#x02014;increased RFS&#x02014;are widely prevalent in both normal volunteers (64&#x02013;86 %) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and in throat symptom patients (38&#x02013;51 %).

We believe a clinical effect of 0.4 (equivalent to a difference in change of RSI of 3.1 given a standard deviation of 7.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]) is a reasonable target based on prior LPR therapy studies. Further, an effect size of 0.4 is of smaller magnitude than the effect of phonomicrosurgery or speech therapy. A similar effect size is predicted from the more limited amount of published data available on the LPR-HRQL. For a two-sample <italic>t</italic> test, 90 % power and at the 0.05 significance level, allowing for 20 % loss to follow-up, we require 332 patients (166 in each arm of the study) to give 266 (133 in each arm) completing the study. Two other recent reports of LPR drug studies show lower than 7 % dropout rates. Our NHS experience, however, suggests that this is overly optimistic for a trial of this kind. Because the literature is well populated with underpowered low-impact studies, we prefer to err on the side of caution and hence our sample allows for a 20 % attrition rate.</p><p>Participant recruitment into the pilot phase will be for a total of 6 months. We estimate that each site will be able to recruit 10 participants per 3-month block once the study is established. However, as research studies usually take some time to become embedded into practice, we have calculated recruitment across the whole trial based on lower recruitment in three sites during the first 6 months. Our predicted recruitment allows for each of the three sites to recruit 30 % (three participants) in the first 3 months, and 70 % (seven participants) in the second 3 months. We aim for those three sites to be recruiting to full target (10 participants per 3 months) thereafter in the main trial, with equivalent run-in for the remaining three sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Study design and duration</title><p>This is a multi-centre, phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with internal feasibility pilot, carried out in secondary care. Patients will be randomised into two parallel streams on a 1:1 ratio stratified by site and baseline severity (two groups, on the basis of the RSI score). Following successful demonstration of recruitment in three sites in the internal pilot, a definitive trial will be conducted over 30 months. Patients with persistent throat symptoms will be identified and recruited from ENT clinics.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Feasibility pilot</title><p>There will be an initial feasibility pilot, for 6 months, during which three sites will recruit 10 participants each. At the end of month 6, a report will be submitted to the funder, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA). The criterion for stopping the trial early is the failure to recruit 30 participants in the pilot, demonstrating a lack of feasibility. Trial progress will be overseen by the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) and Trial Steering Committee (TSC), and if this target is not reached the HTA will not release the full funding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Full trial</title><p>A further 302 participants (332 participants in total) will be recruited over seven sites: Newcastle, Sunderland, Nottingham, Brighton, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Intervention</title><p>The active intervention is a 16-week (4-month) course of a 30 mg twice daily dose of the PPI lansoprazole.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Control</title><p>Participants in the control arm will receive a 16-week (4-month) course of twice-daily matched placebo capsule.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Study compliance and withdrawal</title><p>Where feasible, visit windows of &#x000b1;14 days should ensure visit attendance; non-attendance for study visits will prompt follow-up by telephone.</p><p>Compliance with study medication will be assessed by checking and recording the remaining number of capsules at the end of the treatment period by a member of the study team.

The PI also has the right to withdraw participants from the study drug in the event of intervening pregnancy, inter-current illness, adverse events, serious adverse events, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, protocol violations, cure, administrative reasons or other reasons. It is understood by all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of participants should be avoided. Should a participant decide to withdraw from the study, all efforts will be made to report the reason for withdrawal as thoroughly as possible. Should a participant withdraw from the study drug only, efforts will be made to continue to obtain follow-up data, with his/her permission.</p><p>Participants who wish to withdraw from study medication will be asked to confirm whether they are still willing to provide the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Study-specific data at follow-up visits at 4 and 12 months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02018;End of study data&#x02019; as per the visit at 12 months, at the point of withdrawal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If participants agree to either of the above, they will be asked to complete a confirmation of withdrawal form to document their decision.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Participants who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcome measure of change in RSI score after 4 months will be analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) methods in order to compare the change in RSI between the trial arms while adjusting for potential confounders including the stratification variables used at randomisation of site and baseline severity (as defined by the binary RSI cutoff value) as covariates in the analysis. We will also consider adjusting for gender, age, body mass index, baseline laryngeal appearance scores by the RFS and categories of symptoms. Not all of these covariates mentioned will necessarily be included in the final model but will be considered during the model selection process.</p><p>Should data be found to be non-normally distributed the use of transformations or non-parametric approaches will be considered, although as ANCOVA is generally robust to departures from normality the aforementioned approach is likely to be followed. More basic exploratory analyses may be undertaken using the two-sample <italic>t</italic> test or non-parametric alternatives.</p><p>The analysis of secondary outcomes will follow a broadly similar strategy when considering questionnaire scores or the change in questionnaire scores. The proportion with follow-up RSI scores within versus out with the published normal range will be analysed using a logistic regression approach, once more adjusting for the covariates as already described for the primary outcome.</p><p>The primary analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis; other analysis groups, such as per protocol, may be considered subsequently. Outcome data will be analysed at the end of the study. There are no planned interim analyses and a full statistical analysis plan will be developed prior to the start of analysis. Safety data will not be subject to statistical analysis. Data with missing observations due to loss to follow-up will be examined to determine both its extent and whether it is missing at random or is informative. If data are missing to a sufficient extent, the use of appropriate multiple imputation techniques will be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Study monitoring</title><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial Management Group</title><p>The trial will be managed by a Trial Management Group (TMG) consisting of key staff members at the Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit, together with selected investigators, and will meet monthly throughout the set up and duration of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial Steering Committee</title><p>A TSC will be established to provide overall supervision of the trial.
