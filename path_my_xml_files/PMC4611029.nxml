We assessed how ENFD is impacted by initiation of first-time antiretroviral therapy (ART) in subjects free of neuropathy and how it is altered when mitochondrial toxic nucleoside medications are used as part of ART. Serial changes in proximal thigh and distal leg ENFD were examined over 72&#x000a0;weeks in 150 Thai subjects randomized to a regimen of stavudine (d4T) switching to zidovudine (ZDV) at 24&#x000a0;weeks vs ZDV vs tenofovir (TDF) for the entire duration of study, all given in combination with nevirapine. We found individual variations in ENFD change, with almost equal number of subjects who decreased or increased their distal leg ENFD over 72&#x000a0;weeks and no relationship to nucleoside backbone or to development of neuropathic signs or symptoms. Lower baseline distal leg ENFD and greater increases in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex I (CI) activity were associated with larger increases in distal leg ENFD over 72&#x000a0;weeks. Distal leg ENFD correlated with body composition parameters (body surface area, body mass index, height) as well as with blood pressure measurements. Assessed together with a companion cross-sectional study, we found that mean distal leg ENFD in all HIV+ subjects was lower than in HIV&#x02212; subjects but similar among HIV+ groups whether ART-na&#x000ef;ve or on d4T with/without neuropathy/neuropathic symptoms. The utility of ENFD as a useful predictor of small unmyelinated nerve fiber damage and neuropathy risk in HIV may be limited in certain populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Neuropathy</kwd><kwd>Epidermal nerve fiber density</kwd><kwd>Stavudine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc. 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is a neurologic complication of HIV characterized by bilateral lower extremity burning pain and numbness. The etiologies for HIV-SN include HIV immunovirologic factors as well as mitochondrial toxic medications such as stavudine (d4T), a medication still in use in many developing countries as part of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p><p>Distal leg epidermal nerve fiber density (ENFD) is commonly accepted as a useful predictor of small unmyelinated nerve fiber damage and of neuropathy risk in many diseases including HIV (England et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>; Simpson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>; Polydefkis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). Our study conducted serial skin punch biopsies with determination of ENFD within South East Asia Research Collaboration with Hawaii (SEARCH) 003, an open-label, randomized, clinical trial which recruited and randomized 150 HIV+ subjects in Thailand free of neuropathy prior to first-time ART to three different ART regimens differing by NRTI backbone. Specifically, a backbone of 24&#x000a0;weeks of stavudine (d4T) followed by switch to zidovudine (ZDV) was compared to continuous ZDV and to continuous tenofovir (TDF) for the entire 72-week duration of the study. Using ENFD as a surrogate marker of HIV-SN risk, our overall intent was to investigate the risk factors and course of HIV-SN over 72&#x000a0;weeks of ART.</p><p>We have previously reported on baseline immunovirologic and mitochondrial correlates of ENFD in SEARCH 003 prior to initiation of first-time ART (Shikuma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>). This present report describes the longitudinal change in ENFD seen over 72&#x000a0;weeks of first-time ART therapy within SEARCH 003 and the correlates of such change. We attempted to examine whether use of ART improved ENFD over 72&#x000a0;weeks and whether use of the neurotoxic NRTI medication d4T altered such changes in ENFD. We sought to examine the relationship of ENFD to development of SN signs/symptoms and to assess the association of various demographic, immunovirologic, and mitochondrial parameters to change in ENFD from baseline to 72&#x000a0;weeks. In order to identify the general ranges of ENFD that might be expected in SEARCH 003, a concurrent cross-sectional study (SEARCH 014) assessed ENFD values in healthy HIV seronegative controls and in three different cohorts of HIV+ subjects on d4T-containing ART regimens: subjects without HIV-SN, those with asymptomatic HIV-SN, and those with symptomatic HIV-SN.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>SEARCH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.searchthailand.org/">http://www.searchthailand.org/</ext-link>) 003 was a 150-patient, 72-week, two-site clinical trial in ART-na&#x000ef;ve subjects conducted in Thailand at the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre (TRCARC) in Bangkok and at the Queen Savang Vadhana Memorial Hospital in Chonburi, Thailand (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identification NCT00669487). SEARCH 003 compared, in randomized fashion, rates of anemia, lipoatrophy, and neuropathy among three ART regimens differing by NRTI backbone (Phanuphak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>). Specifically, ART-na&#x000ef;ve Thai HIV-infected adults were randomized 1:1:1 to arm A: 24&#x000a0;weeks of d4T 30&#x000a0;mg + lamivudine (3TC) 150&#x000a0;mg + nevirapine (NVP) 200&#x000a0;mg [GPO-VIR S30<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>] twice daily followed by 48&#x000a0;weeks of ZDV 250&#x000a0;mg + 3TC 150&#x000a0;mg + NVP 200&#x000a0;mg [GPO-VIR Z250<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>] twice daily; arm B: 72&#x000a0;weeks of GPO-VIR Z250<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> twice daily; and arm C: 72&#x000a0;weeks of TDF + emtricitabine [FTC] (Truvada<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) once daily + NVP (Neravir<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) 200&#x000a0;mg twice daily.</p><p>Clinical evaluation for HIV-SN and skin punch biopsies for distal leg and proximal thigh ENFD assessments were performed as elective procedures at baseline, week 24, and week 72 to allow an in-depth evaluation of ENFD as a surrogate marker of neuropathy risk during ART. The main ENFD findings at baseline from this study have been previously published (Shikuma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>).</p><p>Entry criteria included documented HIV infection, age <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>18&#x000a0;years, CD4 T-lymphocyte count &#x0003c;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and ART-na&#x000ef;ve status except for females with past exposure to ART associated with pregnancy who were allowed to enroll as long as the exposure was at least 3&#x000a0;months prior to entry. The study utilized an entry criteria of CD4 T-lymphocyte count &#x0003c;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> to be consistent with Thai national guidelines at that time for initiation of ART. Subjects were excluded for active AIDS-defining illness or other active illness, current use of immunomodulator therapy or any experimental therapy, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and presence of active malignancies. Entry criteria required subjects at entry to be free of neuropathy because of concerns about increased risk of neuropathy if randomized to the d4T-containing arm. This study was approved by the Chulalongkorn University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Queen Savang Vadhana Memorial Hospital IRB as primary IRBs of record and by the University of Hawaii Committee on Human Subjects as a secondary IRB. Informed consents were obtained from all subjects.</p><p>To investigate the magnitude of ENFD changes seen on ART in SEARCH 003, a concurrently running SEARCH 014 study proposed to gather cross-sectional ENFD data on 50 HIV seronegative controls and on three different groups of 25 HIV+ subjects each who were already on d4T-containing ART: subjects without neuropathy, subjects with asymptomatic neuropathy, and subjects with symptomatic neuropathy. Subjects in SEARCH 014 underwent identical evaluations as SEARCH 003 subjects including identical clinical neuropathy evaluations and distal leg and proximal thigh ENFD assessments but at a single time point. The three groups of HIV+ subjects on d4T were required to have been on d4T treatment for &#x0003e;6&#x000a0;months and to have plasma HIV RNA by PCR &#x0003c;50 copies/mL. HIV ELISA was utilized to confirm absence of HIV infection in HIV seronegative subjects. In order to be able to ascertain the specific effect of d4T use on ENFD, subjects were excluded from SEARCH 014 if they were on treatment with concomitant medications (other than their d4T-based antiretroviral regimen) or had conditions (e.g., compressive neuropathy, diabetes, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, excessive alcohol intake meeting substance dependence criteria by DSM-IV, hepatitis C infection) known to cause neuropathy. The presence of risk factors for neuropathy was not an exclusion in SEARCH 003. Classification into neuropathy categories utilized the same definition as that in SEARCH 003 as defined below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical evaluations including assessment for neuropathy</title><p>Socio-demographic and medical history including relevant HIV history was obtained and a general physical examination with assessment for neuropathy performed in all SEARCH 003 and SEARCH 014 subjects. Blood was obtained for CBC, chemistries, T cell subsets, and HIV RNA as relevant. In SEARCH 003, updated medical history and physical examination including assessment for neuropathy were repeated at week 24 and 72 of study.</p><p>The evaluation for neuropathy was based on the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)/Neurology and Neurologic AIDS Research Consortium (NARC) methodology (Simpson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>). Subjects were classified as having signs of neuropathy if they had any of the following: absent or diminished ankle reflex, diminished vibratory, pin or temperature sensation, or contact allodynia. The ACTG definition was used for peripheral neuropathy which was reduced vibration sensation in both great toes or absent or diminished ankle reflexes bilaterally relative to the knees. Subjects were classified as having symptomatic neuropathy if complaints of numbness, pain, or tingling were elicited.</p><p>Serially at entry, week 24, and 72 of study in SEARCH 003 and cross-sectionally in SEARCH 014, blood was obtained and processed on site with separation of viably preserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from plasma. PBMC was cryopreserved and shipped in batches to the University of Hawaii for various research analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>ENFD assessment</title><p>Skin punch biopsies for ENFD were conducted longitudinally in SEARCH 003 at week 0 (entry), week 24, and week 72 and as one-time evaluations in all subjects in SEARCH 014. Skin punch biopsy samples were obtained and processed using the skin punch biopsy technique and processing recommendations of the Cutaneous Nerve Laboratory at Johns Hopkins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/cutaneous_nerve_lab/">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/cutaneous_nerve_lab/</ext-link>). Briefly, following a 1&#x000a0;% lidocaine subcutaneous injection and utilizing sterile techniques, a 4-mm skin punch biopsy was performed on the distal leg at the level of the ankle with an additional skin punch biopsy of the upper lateral thigh. Skin specimens were processed on site and forwarded, via the University of Hawaii, to the Cutaneous Nerve Laboratory at Johns Hopkins for PGP9.5 immunostaining. To ensure acceptable specimen quality, the skin biopsies were grossly examined under a microscope for pinch and crush artifacts and such specimens were excluded from the study. Slides of 50-&#x003bc;m-thick immunostained sections were further confirmed for acceptable staining pattern, and the number of unmyelinated nerve fibers per millimeter length of epidermis was assessed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Skin biopsy section immunostained with PGP9.5 distal leg skin section from an ART-na&#x000ef;ve subject showing numerous sensory nerve fibers (<italic>arrows</italic>) entering from the dermis into epidermis. <italic>Scale bar</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13365_2015_352_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessment of PBMC mitochondrial parameters</title><p>Viably preserved PBMCs were shipped in batch to the University of Hawaii.

No difference in ENFD values were found by neuropathic signs or symptoms, and values in subjects on first-time ART, most without neuropathy, were no different to values obtained cross-sectionally in subjects on d4T with neuropathy.</p><p>Our study suggests that ENFD as a useful predictor of small unmyelinated nerve fiber damage and of neuropathy risk in HIV may need to be reexamined in certain populations, such as in the HIV+ Thai population utilized in this study. While ENFD values were significantly lower in all HIV+ subjects (whether ART-na&#x000ef;ve or at week 24 or week 72 post-initiation of ART in SEARCH 003 or on d4T-based therapy in SEARCH 014) than in HIV seronegative subjects, ENFD values were similar among all HIV+ groups and did not distinguish individuals with or at risk of developing neuropathy.</p><p>Despite differences in definition and methodology, rates of HIV SN in ranges as high as 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% have been reported in the literature particularly with use of d4T as part of the ART regimens (Schutz and Robinson-Papp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). Very few subjects in our study developed neuropathic signs or symptoms on this study even in the arm utilizing d4T. This low percentage may have been due to several factors. The duration of d4T use in our study was a short 24&#x000a0;weeks, and a lower dose of 30&#x000a0;mg daily was used rather than the older 40&#x000a0;mg dose, a factor known to minimize risk of neuropathy (Maskew et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>; Pahuja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). We have previously reported that our Thai seronegative subjects have higher ENFD values compared to published US control ENFD values (Shikuma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>) which may have provided our Thai subjects with a higher &#x0201c;ENFD reserve.&#x0201d; We as well as others have reported the impact of underlying genetic factors on neuropathic risk (Hulgan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>; Kampira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>; Wadley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>; Domingo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>), and it is possible that such influences as well as possible differences in virologic factors may modulate development of neuropathy in different HIV-infected populations. Our study was also unusual in the development of more neuropathic signs and symptoms in the ZDV arm (Phanuphak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>), a factor that remains puzzling.</p><p>The large variation in change in ENFD values over 72&#x000a0;weeks in SEARCH 003, both in the distal leg and in the proximal thigh, was unexpected and suggests that parameters other than NRTI selection were more important factors of change in this study. We did find that improvement in distal leg ENFD was greater in subjects who were initiating ART with lower ENFD values and perhaps in those with lower CD4 counts who had more to gain from ART and also in subjects with greater capacity to improve energy metabolism (i.e., able to improve mitochondrial function as reflected by an increase in CI). These factors, however, only explained approximately 20&#x000a0;% of the variance. Similar to other noninfectious complications associated with HIV, we speculate that HIV-associated inflammatory tendencies not fully suppressed by ART and not effectively assessed by parameters examined in this study may explain part of the variance.</p><p>The relationship between height and distal ENFD has been previously reported (Cherry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>). It has been hypothesized that the higher energy demands of taller individuals resulting from a need to actively transport essential compounds down their longer processes from the dorsal root ganglia may mean that they are particularly vulnerable to any insult to these sensory nerves. We add to this information that while height showed correlations with ENFD in our study as well, composite scores of BMI and BSA, both of which utilize calculations based on weight and height, also correlate. Of the body composition measurements evaluated, we utilized BSA in the multiple regression model because it gave the most robust association with distal leg ENFD, accounting for 6 to 11&#x000a0;% of the variance. However, use of height or BMI also gave similar results. It can be hypothesized that the contribution of weight may be mediated via increases in weight-associated pro-inflammatory tendencies and/or other factors related to weight-induced changes in glucose metabolism. Interestingly, a possible protective effect for HIV SN with noninsulin glucose-lowering drugs has been reported (Evans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>). In the case of BSA, it can be hypothesized that this composite value may explain more of the variance than height simply because of the &#x0201c;stretching&#x0201d; of the skin leading to less nerve fiber endings per millimeter of skin. The negative relationship between blood pressure measurements and distal leg ENFD is unlikely to be the result of impaired glucose metabolism, as there was no association with HOMA-IR but may be related to concomitant dysregulating influences on autonomic nerves traveling along with the small unmyelinated nerve fibers responsible for HIV-SN.</p><p>Our study calls into some question how closely ENFD values can reflect the presence of HIV SN or predict risk in certain populations as demonstrated by the lack of a significant difference in ENFD in SEARCH 014 Thai subjects on d4T with or without neuropathy or in SEARCH 003 Thai subjects who did or did not have incident neuropathic signs or symptoms. While it has traditionally been believed that proximal thigh ENFD is relatively stable and could be used as a control for changes in distal leg ENFD, proximal thigh ENFD values were somewhat more variable in our HIV+ groups than distal leg ENFD values. Examining the data as a ratio of distal leg ENFD/proximal thigh ENFD did not help to distinguish subjects with or without neuropathy or with or without neuropathic signs or symptoms (data not shown).</p><p>This study has several limitations including the short 72-week duration of the study, the low number of subjects who developed neuropathic signs and symptoms, and its limited applicability to ENFD changes only in the Thai population. The strengths of the study are the careful quality-controlled clinical evaluation for neuropathy and the laboratory evaluation for ENFD done in a laboratory familiar with the assessment of ENFD.</p><p>In summary, our study found large individual variations in ENFD change following initial ART which was not related to nucleoside (tide) backbone. Poorer clinical status as reflected by lower distal leg ENFD and possibly lower CD4 count as well as greater ability to increase mitochondrial energetics was associated with greater increase in distal leg ENFD over 72&#x000a0;weeks. Body composition measurements of BSA, BMI, and height as well as blood pressure measurements correlated with ENFD. ENFD measurements did not distinguish individuals with or without neuropathy or with or without new onset of neuropathic signs/symptoms. The value of ENFD as a surrogate marker for HIV-associated SN may need to be reevaluated in certain populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the patients for participation in this study.
