balance exercises on postural stability indices in healthy women. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty healthy female students were randomly assigned into two equal groups: ankle taping
and balance exercise. The balance exercise group performed balance exercises for 6 weeks,
with 3 sessions per week and each session lasting 40 minutes. Ankle joint taping was
performed for 6 weeks and was renewed three times a week. Before and after the
interventions, overall, anteroposterior, and mediolateral stability indices were measured
with a Biodex Balance System in bilateral and unilateral stance positions with the eyes
open and closed. [Results] In the taping group during bilateral standing with the eyes
closed, the overall stability index changed from 6&#x000b1;1.4 to 4.8&#x000b1;1.3, anteroposterior
stability index changed from 4.2&#x000b1;1.27 to 3.4&#x000b1;0.97, and mediolateral stability index
changed from 3.2&#x000b1;0.75 to 2.7&#x000b1; 0.7. In the balance exercise group during bilateral standing
with the eyes closed, the overall stability index changed from 5.7&#x000b1;1.69 to 4.5&#x000b1;1.94,
anteroposterior stability index changed from 4.1&#x000b1;1.61 to 3&#x000b1;1.21, and mediolateral
stability index changed from 3.5&#x000b1;1.4 to 2.2&#x000b1; 1.3. No significant difference was seen
between the two groups regarding any study variables. [Conclusion] The results showed that
compared with the taping technique, balance training increases postural stability in the
majority of the studied balance situations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance exercise</kwd><kwd>Taping</kwd><kwd>Biodex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The position of the body in relation to space is determined by visual, vestibular, and
somatosensory functions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ability to
control the body in space is a complex interaction between musculoskeletal and neural
systems. This set of systems is called the postural control system<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural control involves the control of body position in
space for the dual purposes of postural stability and postural orientation. Balance is a
complex process involving the reception and interpretation of information about body
movement, integration of sensorimotor information, and execution of appropriate movement to
achieve the goal of upright postural control<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A defect in each of these three aspects of data processing, i.e.,
sensory input (somatosensory, vision, and vestibular), sensorimotor integration, and motor
output, can lead to imbalance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
reduction in joint position sense can cause recurrent ankle sprains<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, knee ligaments sprain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and degenerative joint diseases<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The somatosensory system signals two types of information to the CNS. One of them is the
movement of body parts in relation to a supporting surface, and the other one is the
relative position of the body parts to each other. somatosensory inputs originate from
pressure receptors in the skin, deep tendon sensory receptors, and joint receptors
(especially the foot and ankle)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
postural control system should be regulated to ensure it functions properly, which is done
by the feedback and feed forward systems. Sensory inputs adjust these mechanisms<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sensory inputs in the sole of the foot send
information about the supporting surface. Proprioceptors send the position of the limbs and
the relative position of head to the body, and at the same time, visual detection of
movement in space can signal the head position related to the horizon line<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several types of exercise have been proposed to improve proprioception. Bou&#x000eb;t and Gahery
stated that balance exercises improve neuromuscular relations and reduce proprioception
errors. They believe that those who have more proprioception difficulty may benefit more
from exercise therapy<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rozzi et al.
showed that balance exercises improve balance in patients with ankle instability and normal
subjects. They related these findings to improvement of balance in the ankle joint and
improvement of general balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lentell
et al. showed that proprioception deficit and anatomical instability are two factors
affecting functional stability. Proprioception data play a fundamental role both in local
and general stability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tropp et al.
showed that proprioception reduces after joint damage, so increasing a patient&#x02019;s joint
motion sense and dynamic stability are important for fast recovery<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Taping is another technique to enhance proprioception. Improvement in proprioception leads
to better function and reduction of disability. Kinesio taping is being used to prevent
injuries and to help injuries to heal<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It can also improve efficiency in sport, improve lymph and venous circulation, decrease
edema, stimulate the mechanoreceptors and increase awareness of a subject with regard to
ankle position, reduce pain, and improve muscle performance<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taping improves dynamic stability by increasing sensory input,
decreasing the delay in postural reflexes, and increasing stability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioception is the most important part of motor
systems. It is an essential part of motor control and plays a very important role in joint
dynamics<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The lateral ligaments and
joint capsule of the ankle joint are full of proprioceptors, and any malfunctioning of these
receptors reduces the joint kinesthesia. So decreasing input from these receptors to higher
control centers leads to improper muscle response and changes in joint movement
direction<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taping has been shown to
be able to control the center of pressure sway speed and lead to better performance in
maintaining stability when a perturbation is applied<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have shown that taping facilitates the
neuromuscular reflexes<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. This capability is the result of increasing sensory input
caused by direct contact between the tape and skin<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. While other techniques like bracing do not increase sensory
feedback, a previous study showed that taping can improve joint position sense in a
non-weight-bearing position<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Heitkamp
et al. showed that taping can improve proprioception<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Robbins et al. reported that taping has a positive effect on the
position sense of the ankle joint<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance exercises and taping can both improve postural control by improving proprioception
inputs, but comparing the effects of these treatments to select the best strategy to manage
proprioception deficit is a challenge. This study evaluated dynamic stability, while many
other studies have measured static stability, and so their results cannot be generalized to
dynamic stability. Since many daily activities are link to dynamic stability, the study of
balance in these situations is of more importance. Both taping and balance exercises have
effects on dynamic balance, so this study compared the effects of ankle taping and balance
exercise on postural stability indices in healthy women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Thirty female students from
Zahedan University of Medical Sciences participated in this study and were divided into two
groups. Subjects were randomly divided into the two groups by lottery conducted by clinical
therapists. There were 15 subjects in each group. Subjects were not informed about the
basics of the study. They just knew that we were comparing the effects of ankle taping and
balance exercise, both of which can improve balance. The administrator and participants were
informed about the grouping data. But the physiotherapist who assessed the subjects,
measured the outcome, and analyzed the data was blinded about the grouping. Balance
exercises were performed for six weeks, three days a week, with each session lasting forty
minutes. Data were recorded before and after finishing the protocol.</p><p>In this study, thirty healthy female students were selected through simple non-probability
sampling method. Before entering the study, they were tested for the health of the muscle
and ligaments around the ankle joint by anterior and posterior drawer tests and joint
glides. The inclusion criteria for this study were having no pain in the ankle joint; not
being involved in any sports activity in the period of this study; healthy sensory motor
function in the lower limbs; no history of neuromuscular disease, vertigo or any uncorrected
visual problems, any kind of ankle injury or lower limb surgery, taking sedative medication,
cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease, balance problems, rheumatoid disease, and
psychological disease; and a body mass index of between 17 and 25. Exclusion criteria
included ankle pain, allergy to tape, and not completing all interventional sessions. Those
subjects who were eligible to take part in the study signed an informed consent before
entering the study. This study was approved by the Scientific and Ethics committee of the
School of Rehabilitation Sciences of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, and the rights
of the subjects were respected throughout the study.</p><p>In order to apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all cases were subjected to an
interview and assessment. The heights of the subjects were measured by a meter with 1&#x02005;cm
accuracy, and a digital scale was used to measure the body weights of the subjects (in order
to calculate BMI). A Biodex Balance System was used to measure balance indices. It has
reliability and validity for measuring balance indices<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The overall stability index (OSI), anteroposterior stability index (APSI), and mediolateral
stability index (MLSI) were recorded with a Biodex Balance System (SD 950-340, Biodex
Medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, NY, USA).</p><p>The Biodex system has a circular deck with a 55&#x02005;cm diameter located 20&#x02005;cm above the floor
inside its body, which is able to tilt 20 degrees from the horizontal position to all sides.
The overall stability index shows the variance in plate deviation from the horizontal plane.
The anteroposterior and mediolateral indices show the deviation of the plate from the
horizontal position in the sagittal and frontal planes, respectively. The scores for the
indices show the level of deviation from the horizontal position, so the lower scores
indicate better balance<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The subjects stood on the balance board without shoes and stockings. The right heel was
placed at the intersection of the lines from E and 9. The left heel was placed on the
intersection of the lines from F and 12. The feet were 20 degrees out toed. The hands were
laid one across the other on the thorax. The difficulty level of the test in the double leg
standing position with the eyes open and closed was decreased from level 6 to level 3. In
other words, the difficulty level in a 20-second trial changed from six to three. The trial
began with level six and finished in level three. In the single leg standing positions with
the eyes closed and open, the difficulty level changed from eight to five gradually in
accordance with previous method<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The subjects became familiar with the testing protocol in a pretesting session. Dynamic
postural stability test was performed in the double leg standing position with the eyes open
and closed and in the single leg standing position with the eyes open and closed on the
right and left legs. Each test included three trials that lasted 20 seconds with a 10-second
interval between trials for rest. A mean score was calculated from the three test
evaluations. There was five-minute rest period between tests.</p><p>The first group performed balance exercise for six weeks, 3 times a week, with each session
lasting 40 minutes. Each session started with several minutes of slow walking and
progressive stretching of the ankle, knee, and hip muscles, which was gradually increased in
time and repetition. After that, balance exercises were performed. The session was finished
with several minutes of slow walking. The balance exercises started with static exercises in
the first week and progressed to dynamic exercises with the eyes closed and open plus
crossed movement of the upper extremities in the sixth week. There were 10 repetitions for
each exercise, and each exercise lasted 10 seconds. There were also 10 minutes of rest
between exercises<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the taping group, we used elastic tape (DARCO GmbH, Raisting, Germany) with a width of
5&#x02005;cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Ankle joint taping</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-763-g001"/></fig>). In order to confirm that there would be no allergic reaction to the tape, a piece
of tape was applied to the skin of the calf for 24 hours. Ankle joint taping was performed
for 6 weeks and was renewed three times a week. In a careful assessment, proper tension of
the tape, correct cutting, and direction of tape application were taken into account for all
subjects. The ankle joint was put into full dorsiflexion before taping. Taping was started
from gastrocnemius muscle bulk and progressed toward the Achilles tendon; after passing the
heel, it was cut into four divisions and attached to the dorsal aspect of the foot, the
metatarsal area. A second length of tape was attached to the lateral malleolus in the ankle
dorsiflexion position, passed over the lateral ligaments, passed under the foot to reach the
medial malleolus, and passed across the medial ligaments of the ankle<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The sample size was determined based on a pilot study. Ten subjects were divided randomly
into two equal groups, and the main part of study was conducted on them. The means and SDs
for the parameters from this pilot study, with &#x003b1;= 0.05 and 90% power were used to calculate
the sample size.</p><p>Data analysis was performed with SPSS version 17. The assumption of a normal distribution
was assessed using the K-S test. The assumption of equality of variances was tested using
Levene&#x02019;s test. The paired t-test and independent samples t-test were used for within- and
between-group comparisons. The &#x003b1; level was less than 5% for all tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Figure 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p> Flow diagram of the progress through the phases of the randomized trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-763-g002"/></fig> presents the recruitment strategy and experimental plan.

stability, and the results can also partially support the positive effects of taping on
postural stability. However, contrary to the second assumption of this study, there was no
significant difference between the two methods. The results of this study showed that
balance exercise has effects on a greater number of balance indices comparing to taping.</p><p>Both exercise and taping improved the APSI and MLSI in the double leg stance with the eyes

leg stance on the left leg with the eyes open, MLSI in the single leg stance on the left leg
with the eyes open, and OSI in the single leg stance on the left leg with the eyes
closed.</p><p>Neither taping nor exercise had significant effects on MLSI in the double leg stance and
single leg stance on the right leg with the eyes open. Unlike taping, the balance exercise
had positive effects on the OSI and APSI in the double leg stance with the eyes open, MLSI
in the single leg stance on the right leg with the eyes closed, APSI in the single leg
stance on the left leg with the eyes open, and APSI and MLSI in the single leg stance on the
left leg with the eyes closed. The only index that had more changes with taping than
exercise was the OSI in the single leg stance on the right leg.</p><p>The overall results indicate several important points. No change in postural control in the
frontal plane or MLSI was found after taping. Among the 18 variables recorded in this group,
eight indices showed no change after taping, and four of these eight indices (50% of the
indices had no significant changes) represented the MLSI. In other words, from six variables
recorded for the MLSI, four had not changed after taping. In spite of the significant
effects of balance exercise on balance indices, three indices showed no significant change.
Two of them were related to postural control in the frontal plane or MLSI. It should be
noted that in the taping group, four other stability indices showed no change after
treatment, three of which were sagittal plane indices (APSI) and one of which was the OSI.
In the taping group, 18 stability indices were measured, and only 8 of them showed positive
changes after taping; however, in the exercise group, 15 out of 18 indices were changed,
which represnts a considerable difference between the two groups. To be able to explain the
cause of these findings, we should look at overall postural stability.</p><p>Postural stability is the ability to keep the center of mass (COM) in a limited spatial
zone, which is called the limit of stability. The limit of stability is the spatial zone
within which a person can maintain their balance without changing the base of support. These
limitations are not constant but are related to peripheral situations, biomechanics, and
personal activities. Stability is related to a balance between forces that are working for
and against it<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The postural control
system needs to integrate sensory information in order to estimate the spatial position of
the body to generate proper force and control the body position, so postural control
requires the complex interaction of the neural and musculoskeletal systems<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The musculoskeletal parts of this system
are joint range of motion, spinal column flexibility, muscle properties, and biomechanical
relations of body parts. The neural parts of postural control consist of neuromuscular
synergies for motor trajectories and sensory systems like the visual, vestibular, and
somatosensory integration and sensory strategies, which regulate the sensory input, internal
representation, which is needed for sensory to motor mapping, and higher level of brain
activities for adaptive aspects and anticipatory mechanisms. Adaptive postural control is
defined as changes in sensory and motor output in response to changes in the environment and
tasks. Anticipatory aspects of postural control are based on previous experiences and
learning<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Postural adjustments might be voluntary, involuntary, or semi voluntary. There is a limited
zone for COP swing without falling or changing the limits. This area is 12 degrees in the
sagittal plane (8 degrees forward and 4 degrees backward) and 16 degrees in the frontal
plane (8 degrees to each side) in adults. There are three main involuntary postural
strategies: stepping strategy, hip strategy, and ankle strategy. Anticipatory adjustments of
posture are controlled by a feed-forward mechanism. These mechanisms are like involuntary
mechanisms, but their response happens before real instability. Voluntary postural
adjustment is initiated by a person voluntarily and is controlled and performed by personal
experiences and learning in a state of awarness<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For further assessment, we need to know more about involuntary postural responses and their
sensory and motor parts. The ankle strategy is usually used for controlling postural sway by
the ankle and foot. The head, trunk, hip, and legs move as a whole on an ankle pivot point
(anteroposteriorly and laterally). The ankle strategy is used when sways are small in range,
slow in speed and near the midline<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
is usually used when a person is standing on a large stable surface. The contraction pattern
of the muscles is from distal to proximal. The hip strategy is used to control the posture
via the hip and trunk. In this strategy, the head and hips moves in different directions.
This strategy is used when the sway is large and fast (1&#x02005;Hz) and near the midway point of
the limit of stability area or when a person stands on a narrow unstable surface. In this
strategy, the muscle contraction pattern is from proximal to distal<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. For sway frequencies between 0.3 to 1&#x02005;Hz, a combination
of ankle and hip strategies is used<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.
When the sway is too large and the COP falls outside the limit of stability zone, the step
strategy is used because a new stability zone is needed<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies have shown that humans can switch between postural
strategies very quickly. When a person stands on a narrow surface, they shift from the ankle
strategy to a hip strategy (in 5 to 15 trials), and when they return to a normal support
surface, they shift to an ankle strategy (in 6 trials)<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sensory inputs are important for postural control. Sensory
components of postural control include visual, vestibular, and somatosensory inputs<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The data from each are combined with other sensory information to produce a proper motor
response. Deficits in the visual, vestibular, or somatosensory system can cause postural
control deficit<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In spite of the
importance of visual inputs for postural control, they are not necessary<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vestibular inputs play a role in
signaling perturbations in the transitional phase of postural stability<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the vestibular system is intact, the visual inputs
are not essential, but in bilateral vestibular dysfunctions, visual inputs are needed for
postural control<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is believed that the somatosensory role is not bold when the visual and vestibular
systems are intact<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural control
needs forces to control the body position in space. In order to know the proper timing of
force generation, the CNS should have a detailed picture of the body in the space and its
movement<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each of the sensory systems
prepares special information about body position and movement, so each sensory system acts
as a reference for postural control<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. What
kind of information sent to the postural control system by each of these sensory systems? Is
one of them more important than the others? Does the CNS always use all these three sensory
inputs? If not, how does the CNS decide to use one of them? Visual inputs are important for
postural control but are not essential. Somatosensory inputs are not available to determine
the perpendicular position of the body when the supporting system is not stable. The
vestibular system by itself cannot produce a real picture of spatial orientation of the
body. How does the postural control system organize this information? Postural control
demands are different in a static position compared with in the presence of a perturbation
or movement, which are dynamic positions. All three sensations participate in postural
control when a person is in a simple standing position. Postural responses to horizontal
fluctuations in standing position are dependent on the somatosensory system in adults. The
important matter is the CNS functional flexibility to use sensory information while the task
and environment factors change. Previous research supports the theory of hierarchy weighting
of sensory information based on their relative accuracy in signaling the spatial position
and movement of the body. When a specific sensation cannot give accurate information about
the body position and movement in a special situation, the weight of this sense reduces and
other accurate senses are given more weight. In normal situations, the CNS gives more weight
to the somatosensory system versus the visual and vestibular systems<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The other parameter that plays a role in choosing the
sensory information source is the balance strategy that is used. While the CNS is using the
ankle strategy, the somatosensory source is the main sensory information, and when using the
hip strategy, the vestibular information is needed<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With the knowledge mentioned above, we can interpret the results of this study. Firstly,
taping has its greatest impact on the area to which it is applied. In addition, it affects
the tissues that are compressed or stretched by the tape, so the taping method in this study
would affect ankle somatosensory information of the ankle joint. In this study, the tape
covered posterior calf and medial and lateral ankle ligament, so it should have had an equal
effect on lateral and anteroposterior stability indices. But the results do not support this
theory. It seems that sensors of length and tension in muscles of the calf (muscle spindles
and Golgi tendon organs) are the elements responsible for the greater influence of tape on
the anteroposterior stability indices. Karig stated that the stretch and compression applied
to tissue by taping stimulate the skin mechanoreceptors and send information about movement
and position that improves proprioception. Lehpart and Raiman proposed that the information
from skin mechanoreceptor has an effect like joint receptors on proprioception<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. So the information sent to the CNS
increases, and this leads to more accurate control of joint movement<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regarding these theories, tape can improve postural control
by sending the skin sensory inputs to the CNS. Carleson and Anderson measured the reaction
time of the peroneal muscle to evaluate the effect of taping on ankle stability. Their
electromyography data showed that taping can reduce the reaction time. They proposed that it
could be the result of increased sensory inputs to the CNS after application of tape<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on the results of the present
study, balance exercises have advantage over taping. Balance exercises can improve balance
strategies other than the ankle strategy and can also strengthen and facilitate the involved
postural reflexes, so they can improve postural stability. Somatosensory inputs from taping
can only improve the ankle strategy, while balance exercise in addition to ankle strategy
facilitates the hip strategy, which is vestibular dependent. On the other hand, balance
exercise requires motor control responses from the brain stem, so these exercises improve
motor control at all CNS levels which is an important matter in balance and proprioception
rehabilitation. Proper motor control requires spinal reflexes, postural reflexes, and
involuntary balance responses in the brain stem and voluntary responses from the cortical
level of the brain<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. We did not have a
control group, and this was a limitation of this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Drs. Mohammad Hosseinfar, Mohammad Reza Arab Kangan, and Ashkan
