The hierarchical coprimary end point is the difference in HBPM average systolic BP between (in order) spironolactone and placebo, spironolactone and the average of the other two active drugs, spironolactone and each of the other two drugs. A key secondary outcome is to determine whether plasma renin predicts the BP response to the different drugs. A sample size of 346 (allowing 15% dropouts) will confer 90% power to detect a 3&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg HBPM average systolic BP difference between any two drugs.

There are various reasons for poor BP control, including clinical inertia in up-titrating therapy and poor patient concordance with treatment. There are also patients who appear to be genuinely resistant to drug treatment, hence the term &#x02018;resistant hypertension&#x02019;.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Resistant hypertension has been defined in various ways, but recent international guidelines have moved towards a consensus that resistant hypertension is best defined as poor BP control despite treatment with at least three BP-lowering medications, one of which should be a diuretic.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline was even more prescriptive by defining resistant hypertension as a blood pressure that is not controlled to recommended treatment targets despite treatment with maximal recommended or best tolerated doses of three specific drug types, that is, A+C+D, according to the NICE hypertension treatment algorithm, where &#x02018;A&#x02019; is an <bold>A</bold>CE-inhibitor or <bold>A</bold>ngiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), &#x02018;C&#x02019; is a <bold>C</bold>alcium channel blocker (CCB) and &#x02018;D&#x02019; is a thiazide/thiazide type diuretic.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, when referring to the drug treatment of resistant hypertension, guidelines are specifically referring to fourth-line drug treatment, usually added to treatment with A+C+D.</p><p>With regard to drug treatment of hypertension, a &#x02018;rule of thirds&#x02019; seems to apply, with approximately one-third of hypertensive patients achieving BP control with a single drug, one-third requiring two drugs and one-third requiring three drugs or more. Some of those requiring three drugs or more will be controlled with three drugs, with most surveys suggesting that approximately 10% of patients will require more than three drugs to control BP, and thus are defined as patients with resistant hypertension.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The true prevalence of resistant hypertension has been poorly defined, but based on the aforementioned assumptions the prevalence in the UK alone would exceed 1 million people.</p><p>The choice of fourth-line drug treatment for resistant hypertension has been entirely empirical. This reflects the lack of data from randomised controlled trials directly comparing different drug treatment options for resistant hypertension; consequently, there remains real clinical uncertainty about the preferred clinical management of such patients. It is possible that it makes no difference what drug is added as fourth-line treatment and that the response, on average, will be the same for all available treatment options. Alternatively, it is possible that one class of drug will usually be superior to all the others because there is a common mechanism underpinning resistant hypertension for the majority of patients. In this regard, a popular view is that resistant hypertension is predominantly due to excessive sodium retention and thus &#x02018;further diuretic therapy&#x02019; will usually be the most effective treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A third possibility is that resistant hypertension is a more heterogeneous state and that the study of average responses in cohorts in clinical studies masks substantial individual patient differences and that treatment decisions could potentially be better stratified.</p><p>With regard to treatment stratification, one approach would be to use biomarkers of the patient's sodium/volume status, the rational being that an excess of total body sodium would contribute to treatment resistance and could help define the best treatment for patients with resistant hypertension. In this regard, plasma renin level is a surrogate for and inversely related to sodium status.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This may be especially true in patients already receiving treatment with A+C+D, all of which would be expected to increase plasma renin levels. In this setting, we hypothesised that the finding of low plasma renin (lowest tertile) would be strongly suggestive of excessive sodium load as a mechanism for resistant hypertension and thus, might predict that the best treatment response would be obtained with further diuretic therapy as the preferred fourth-line treatment. Conversely, the finding of an elevated plasma renin (highest tertile) would point to a better response to a drug that suppresses plasma renin, that is, a &#x003b2; blocker, whereas those in the mid-tertile of plasma renin would respond best to a &#x003b1;-blocker as fourth-line treatment.</p><p>We selected spironolactone as the &#x02018;further diuretic&#x02019; therapy to be tested because of observational data suggesting its efficacy in lowering BP in resistant hypertension.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> However, the downside with spironolactone is the development of gynaecomastia in some patients with prolonged usage.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A previous crossover comparison of diuretics showed that a potential alternative to spironolactone in this setting is amiloride.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Thus, PATHWAY-2 will obtain prospective, sequential comparative evidence for amiloride in resistant hypertension by offering this treatment as an open-label run-out to all patients after completion of the prospective randomised treatment cycles, at doses likely to have comparable efficacy to the doses of spironolactone. The PATHWAY 2 study was initiated in May 2009, and the final results are expected in 2015. This manuscript describes the objectives, design and respecified analysis plan for the PATHWAY 2 study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>PATHWAY 2 is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicentre trial comparing the four treatment options for patients with resistant hypertension. The four treatment options are taken once daily, in addition to the maximum/best tolerated doses of three drugs at baseline according to the current NICE hypertension treatment guideline, that is, A+C+D where: A=ACE-inhibitor or Angiotensin receptor blocker; C=Calcium channel blocker; D=thiazide/thiazide-type Diuretic.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>After a screening visit, patients potentially eligible for randomisation proceeded to a 4-week run-in period on the patient's baseline therapy with three drugs, that is, A+C+D. After the run-in period and if still meeting the eligibility criteria, the patients were allocated double blind to a cycle of 4&#x000d7;once daily oral treatments in a random sequence. The randomisation is not stratified and in this 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;12-week period, four treatments crossover study, participants are randomised with equal probability to one of the 24 possible sequences of treatments. The treatments comprise: (1) further diuretic therapy&#x02014;spironolactone; 25&#x02013;50&#x02005;mg, (2) &#x003b1;-blocker&#x02014;doxazosin modified release; 4&#x02013;8&#x02005;mg, (3) &#x003b2;-blocker&#x02014;bisoprolol; 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;mg and (4) placebo. The treatment cycles were initiated with each treatment for 6&#x02005;weeks at the lower dose, followed by forced titration to twice this dose for a further 6&#x02005;weeks&#x02014;each cycle for a total of 12&#x02005;weeks. There is no washout period between the four treatment cycles (3 active, 1 placebo), as 12&#x02005;weeks of treatment per drug cycle is considered sufficient to eliminate the order effects of treatment. The total length of the trial is 52&#x02005;weeks (4&#x02005;weeks run-in and 4&#x000d7;12&#x02005;week treatment cycles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008951F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008951F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>PATHWAY 2 study design and flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008951f01"/></fig><p>The trial was designed as double-blind, but this incurs considerable extra costs; thus, we decided that the last 100 patients should be studied open-label, in order to determine whether the large extra cost of blinding confers any advantage. For the blinded phase of the trial, the study drugs will be re-encapsulated to provide participants with an identical single capsule throughout, containing either active drug or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose). For the open label cohort, patients will receive drugs according to the randomisation schedule in the original drug manufacturers&#x02019; packaging.</p><p>During the double-blind phase, none of the investigators, patients or laboratory staff were aware of the assignment. A 24-h telephone unblinding service was provided by the Data Management Centre for instances where principal investigators (PIs) believed that treatment of an adverse event may be compromised by their not knowing the treatment assignment.</p><p>Compliance has been assessed by returned tablet counts.</p><sec id="s2b"><title>Tolerability</title><p>Adverse events are recorded in the electronic case record form at each visit. A 2-week drug holiday is permitted at any point if the investigator considers that this may allow participants to remain in the trial without early withdrawal.</p></sec><sec id="s2b1"><title>Run-out phase of the study</title><p>To evaluate if amiloride would be a suitable alternative to spironolactone, the run-out phase of the study was used to evaluate the BP-lowering effectiveness of amiloride using an open label design. Patients were eligible for the amiloride open label run-out phase of the study as long as they did not develop potassium levels &#x02265;5.5&#x02005;mmol/L during the study treatment cycles. If eligible, patients were prescribed open-label amiloride 10&#x02005;mg once daily for 6&#x02005;weeks, followed by forced titration to amiloride 20&#x02005;mg once daily for a further 6&#x02005;weeks. Patients were evaluated at study sites at 6 and 12&#x02005;weeks, and BP recorded in accordance with procedures for the main study. In the remaining patients, physicians will choose the exit drug based where possible on pretrial experience of fourth and fifth-line treatment. For patients with uncontrolled BP at the end of the treatment cycles, or the amiloride run-out phase, it was considered unethical to wait for completion of the overall study before their best treatment option could be revealed. Thus, at the end of the main study, the data base will be locked for individual patients and the data centre can reveal the best treatment option for an individual patient at the request of the study site PI.

Further secondary analyses will use physiological phenotyping of non-invasive haemodynamic parameters indicative of sodium retention and volume status, that is, cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance, bio-impedance, pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity to evaluate mechanisms for resistant hypertension and determine if these methods can help better stratify the best treatment for individual patients with resistant hypertension.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Study procedures</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Clinic blood pressure measurement</title><p>Seated clinic blood pressure will be measured at each clinic visit in accordance with the methods recommended by the British Hypertension Society,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> using an automated, approved and validated BP monitor (Microlife Watch BP, Microlife) with an appropriate cuff size applied to the non-dominant arm.

We will then describe differences between blood pressure response to each drug at extremes of plasma renin. Similar analyses will be performed for each haemodynamic variable. We will also examine the predictive value of the baseline measurements of cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance and thoracic impedance. The study will also explore the cost-benefit of using plasma renin to stratify best treatment in individual patients. An additional end point will be analyses of relationships between genetic factors and pharmacodynamic responses.</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size was based on detecting a difference of 3&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg (SD=12&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg) in systolic blood pressure between each of the experimental drugs and the placebo treatment with 90% power, and using a single sample t test at the 0.003 significance level (0.01 level adjusted for 3 comparisons being made). Variances in these calculations were estimated from the within-subject (interdrug) variability observed in 90 patients participating in the Cambridge crossover studies of the major drug classes.</p><p>The estimated requirement was for 294 patients; so we set a recruitment target of 346 to allowing for a dropout rate of 15%. This number also provides similar power to detect a twofold increase in superiority through renin profiling, namely a 6&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg difference in systolic BP between best and second-best drug within each quartile of plasma renin.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Statistical model</title><p>The protocol requires patients to take triplicate morning and evening HBPM BP readings for the 4&#x02005;days before each study visit, a total of 24 readings per visit. We shall use the arithmetic mean of last 18 measurements prior to a study visit to calculate home blood pressure. If more than 18 measurements have been obtained, the earliest recorded readings will be discarded. Thus, for most patients we will use all the readings on days 1 to 3 prior to the visit, but if any of these are missing then readings from day 4 will be used instead. The minimum number of measurements required for a valid assessment of home blood pressure using home BPM is six. Means of the morning and evening readings will be used in all subsequent analysis.</p><p>We shall use a mixed model to analyse HBPM BP, with unstructured covariances for the repeated measures for a patient. The model will include terms for time of day (morning or evening), gender, age, height, weight and smoking history. We will also adjust for baseline BP. If any of the baseline BPs cannot be estimated, we will substitute the overall mean baseline value, set an indicator variable to denote an imputed value and include the indicator variable in the model. The model will also include terms for treatment and phase (to allow for period effects), and an indicator variable to identify the subgroup of patients whose crossover treatments were unblinded.</p><p><italic>The primary analysis</italic> will use BPs recorded for the maximum tolerated dose of each drug. The first of the primary end points is the mean difference between spironolactone and placebo; the second is the mean difference between spironolactone and the average of other active treatments; and the third and fourth are the mean differences between spironolactone and each of the other active treatments taken individually.</p><p><italic>The secondary analysis</italic> will estimate for each treatment: changes in home BP; clinic BP on maximum tolerated dose, and changes in clinic BP; responder rates; withdrawals due to adverse events; and haemodynamic variables and pulse wave analyses. We shall use mixed models to analyse the continuous variables and these will include baseline covariates.</p><p>A patient will be deemed a &#x0201c;responder&#x02019; if they meet any of these two conditions; (1) HBPM systolic BP (SBP) &#x0003c;135&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg; (2) HBPM SBP has fallen &#x02265;10&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg since baseline. Responder rates will be analysed by logistic regression and will be adjusted for baseline covariates. Withdrawal rates will be analysed by logistic regression and will be adjusted for baseline covariates.</p><p>The main secondary objective is to use plasma renin measurements to evaluate an &#x02018;&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x00394;&#x02019; rule for the selection of the fourth-line drug for patients with drug-resistant hypertension (see secondary objectives above). The hypothesis is that plasma renin (measured on a background of 3 drugs, ie, A+C+D), will predict the most effective fourth-line drug. We shall identify the best treatment for each patient, that is, the one on which they achieved the lowest BP. This is a categorical response and we shall use a logistic model to estimate the probability of each treatment being declared the best as a function of baseline renin. Superimposed plots of these probabilities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008951F2">figure 2</xref>) will show the range of renin values for which each treatment is most likely to be the best choice. We will also, in the same way, evaluate haemodynamic parameters indicative of sodium retention and volume status, that is, cardiac output, peripheral resistance and bioimpedance as predictors of the best fourth-line treatment among the three active treatments. An additional end point will be analyses of relationships between genetic factors and pharmacodynamic responses.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008951F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Predicted probabilities model for plasma renin as the predictor of the best treatment option for resistant hypertension.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008951f02"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Blinded versus unblinded cohorts</title><p>We will assess the advantage and disadvantages of using the double-blind, placebo-controlled random crossover design in comparison to the open label random crossover design.

The PATHWAY 2 study also includes assessments of plasma renin and detailed cardiovascular physiological phenotpying, which will provide important insights into underlying mechanisms for resistant hypertension and help determine whether treatment decisions could be better stratified using measurements such as plasma renin. In the absence of any prior RCTs of this type, the data provided by this study will undoubtedly influence future treatment guidelines for the treatment of resistant hypertension.</p><p>The PATHWAY 2 study forms part of a trilogy of studies (PATHWAY 1,2,3)<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> currently being undertaken by the British Hypertension Society research network that have been specifically designed by clinical researchers, who are leading regional specialist hypertension clinical services, to tackle fundamental unresolved questions regarding the treatment of hypertension. The need for clinical trial data to inform future recommendations for the treatment of resistant hypertension was also highlighted by NICE as a key research question.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><sec id="s3a"><title>Challenges in studying resistant hypertension</title><p>In the past, studies of resistant hypertension have been difficult because of a lack of consensus with regard to the definition of resistant hypertension and the need to exclude a variety of factors that can lead to apparent or pseudo-resistant hypertension, including (1) poor BP measurement techniques and failure to exclude a so called &#x02018;white coat effect&#x02019; in which the clinic BP is elevated despite multiple drug treatments, but BP measured using ambulatory or home BP measurements shows BP to be controlled;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> (2) failure to exclude underlying and potentially remediable secondary causes of hypertension, such as aldosterone producing adenomas, renovascular disease, phaeochromocytoma, etc and (3) poor recognition of the scale of non-partial or partial patient concordance with their drug therapy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, there has been a longstanding lack of enthusiasm by the big pharmaceutical companies for drug development and clinical trials in this area, in part due to an aversion to developing drug new therapies that would only be used as a fourth-line treatment, as well as the aforementioned lack of consensus regarding the definition of resistant hypertension and a clear understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. That said, the recent emergence device-based therapies that have specifically targeted resistant hypertension have served to elevate the profile of resistant hypertension and have also underscored the challenges and complexity in identifying, characterising and studying these patients.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>International context for the study</title><p>The PATHWAY 2 study has benefited from an emerging international consensus regarding the definition of resistant hypertension,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which is consistent with the definition used in our study, based on NICE guidelines.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Moreover, all current international guidelines have recently converged and now recommend A+C+D as the preferred three-drug combination at step 3 of their treatment algorithms, which forms the basis of the diagnosis of resistant hypertension.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> This means that the findings of our study will have broad international relevance and applicability. Our study also benefits from inclusion of robust methods to monitor treatment concordance and the inclusion of home blood pressure monitoring to exclude a &#x02018;white coat effect&#x02019; and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the BP response to the various treatments. In addition, most of our study sites are specialist hypertension centres, ensuring that potential secondary causes for resistant hypertension will have been excluded. Taken together with the renin profiling and detailed physiological phenotyping, the PATHWAY 2 study will be recruiting the most precisely defined resistant-hypertension population to date.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Choice of drug therapies to be tested</title><p>When designing the PATHWAY 2 trial, the potential drug treatment options to be tested were limited by the fact that most patients will already have been treated with A+C+D at baseline. Thus, the potential fourth-line drugs to be tested included further diuretic therapy and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) blockade with either &#x003b1;-blockade or &#x003b2;-blockade. We considered other possible treatments, such as centrally acting drugs, but as these predominantly act through modulation of the SNS, the use of &#x003b1;-blockade or &#x003b2;-blockade would allow us to test whether increased activity of the SNS is a key underlying mechanism for resistant hypertension. This has become even more relevant with the emergence of device-based treatment strategies, such as renal denervation, which are designed to target the SNS.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The choice of spironolactone as &#x02018;further diuretic&#x02019; therapy for our study was supported by data, predominantly from observational studies, suggesting that this treatment may be particularly effective in patients with resistant hypertension.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> This decision was subsequently supported by the NICE guideline recommendation in 2011, which noted that the best available data supported the use of low dose spironolactone for the treatment of resistant hypertension, but noted the absence of RCTs to test this hypothesis and recommended that RCTs were required to better define optimal treatment for resistant hypertension.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The testing of an &#x003b1;-blocker as treatment for resistant hypertension was supported by observational data, albeit on a background of two rather than three drugs, suggesting that an &#x003b1;-blocker could be an effective add-on therapy.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The choice of a &#x003b2;-blocker was also logical because in addition to providing an alternative mechanism to inhibit the SNS, &#x003b2;-blockade also suppresses plasma renin and thus allows our &#x02018;&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x00394;&#x02019; rule and plasma renin hypothesis to be tested (see below), which states that a &#x003b2;-blocker would be the most effective treatment when plasma renin is elevated at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Evaluating strategies for treatment stratification</title><p>The PATHWAY 2 study also incorporates measurement of plasma renin and a detailed physiological evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension (eg, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, arterial stiffness and thoracic bioimpedance) to determine if these tests can better predict the best response to a specific drug type. The principal secondary hypothesis tests an &#x02018;&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x00394;&#x02019; rule<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> which states that (1) further diuretic therapy (&#x00394;), that is, spironolactone, will be the best therapy in patients with evidence of sodium and volume overload, and this will be predicted by a low plasma renin at baseline, despite treatment with A+C+D; (2) that a &#x003b2;-blocker (&#x003b2;), that is, bisoprolol, which suppresses renin would be the best treatment in patients with a high plasma renin at baseline; and (3) that an &#x003b1;-blocker (&#x003b1;), that is, doxazosin, would be the best treatment in those with a plasma renin level in the mid-tertile. Such a finding would suggest potential utility in measuring plasma renin to stratify the most appropriate treatment for individual patients. This concept was suggested many years ago<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and previous studies have suggested that physiological phenotyping of sodium/volume status (for which plasma renin is a surrogate) have suggested that this can predict the most effective treatment.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In this regard, our primary hypothesis states that we expect the most common underlying pathophysiology for resistant hypertension will be sodium/volume overload, resulting in a low plasma renin at baseline, and consequently the best response will be obtained with further diuretic therapy, that is, spironolactone, in most patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Evaluating further diuretic therapy</title><p>Since spironolactone has been associated with the development of gynaecomastia, estimated to occur in approximately 6% of patients,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> we also incorporated an open label run-out phase for the study during which patients will be treated with amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic, to determine if this replicates the effects of spironolactone on BP, thus providing an alternative further diuretic therapy for those intolerant of spironolactone.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Differential BP thresholds for patients with and without diabetes</title><p>When this study was designed in 2008, international guidelines had recommended differential BP threshold and targets for people with and without diabetes. Thus, a clinic systolic BP threshold of &#x02265;140&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg was adopted for the definition of uncontrolled BP despite treatment with A+C+D for people without diabetes and &#x02265;130&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg for those with diabetes, with the goal of achieving systolic BP levels below these values. Recent guidelines have adopted a more conservative systolic BP threshold of &#x02265;140&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg for people with diabetes;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> however, because our study was already well underway by then, we decided not to adjust our inclusion criteria for people with diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Double blind versus open label design for the treatment cycles</title><p>We designed this study as a double blind study for the treatment cycles, with active study drugs and placebo being identically encapsulated for blinding. The costs and logistics of doing this are substantial and as patients were destined to receive all treatments in random rotation, we questioned the value of the blinding process as the trial progressed. We decided to evaluate the importance of blinding the treatment allocations by adopting an open label design for the final 100 patients recruited into the trial by dispensing the active treatments in their usual packaging. We will conduct analyses to determine if this had any impact on the outcome in the blinded versus unblinded phases of the trial. These findings will provide valuable information with regard to the necessity of the expensive treatment blinding procedures for future studies of this kind.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PATHWAY 2 trial is fully recruited and is due to complete in 2015. The dropout rate is within expectations and thus, the trial should be fully powered to test its primary and secondary hypotheses. PATHWAY 2 is the first robust RCT to evaluate the optimal treatment/s for resistant hypertension and will define whether treatment can be best stratified according to plasma renin levels. Whatever the outcome, the findings of PATHWAY 2 are likely to influence future international guidelines for the drug treatment of resistant hypertension and provide insights into underlying mechanisms that could facilitate the targeted development of new therapies for this condition.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>BW, TMM, IF and MJB Trial Executive for the British Hypertension Society's PATHWAY programme of trials.</p></fn><fn><p>BW, TMM, MC, PS, DJW, IF and MJB Steering Committee for the British Hypertension Society's PATHWAY programme of trials.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> BW, MJB, TMM, MC, JKC, GM, PS, DJW and IF designed the trial.
