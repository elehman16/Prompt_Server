Randomized clinical trials using gene transfer to improve function of the failing heart are the focus of this review. Four randomized clinical trials of gene transfer in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have been published. Each enrolled patients with stable symptomatic HFrEF and used either intracoronary delivery of a virus vector or endocardial injection of a plasmid. The initial CUPID trial randomized 14 subjects to placebo and 25 subjects to escalating doses of adeno-associated virus type 1 encoding <italic>sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase</italic> (AAV1.<italic>SERCA2a</italic>). <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://AAV1.SERCA2a">AAV1.SERCA2a</uri> was well tolerated, and the high-dose group met a 6 month composite endpoint. In the subsequent CUPID-2 study, 243 subjects received either placebo or the high dose of AAV1.<italic>SERCA2a</italic>. AAV1.<italic>SERCA2a</italic> administration, while safe, failed to meet the primary or any secondary endpoints. STOP-HF used plasmid endocardial injection of <italic>stromal cell-derived factor-1</italic> to promote stem-cell recruitment. In a 93-subject trial of patients with ischemic etiology heart failure, the primary endpoint (symptoms and 6&#x02009;min walk distance) failed, but subgroup analyses showed improvements in subjects with the lowest ejection fractions. A fourth trial randomized 14 subjects to placebo and 42 subjects to escalating doses of adenovirus-5 encoding <italic>adenylyl cyclase 6</italic> (Ad5.<italic>hAC6</italic>). There were no safety concerns, and patients in the two highest dose groups (combined) showed improvements in left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction and &#x02013;dP/dt). The safety data from four randomized clinical trials of gene transfer in patients with symptomatic HFrEF suggest that this approach can be conducted with acceptable risk, despite invasive delivery techniques in a high-risk population. Additional trials are necessary before the approach can be endorsed for clinical practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title><bold>Keywords:</bold>&#x02002;</title><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>SERCA2a</kwd><kwd>stromal cell-derived factor-1</kwd><kwd>adenylyl cyclase type 6</kwd></kwd-group><counts><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="18"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s001"><title>Introduction</title><p>H<sc>eart failure (HF) affects</sc> six million patients in the United States.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although there has been some reduction in the HF admission rate and mortality in the last 10 years, the prognosis and burden of HF remains unacceptably high.

These four trials are summarized by providing the rationale for transgene selection, important preclinical or nonrandomized clinical trials, safety, and results.

Although the experience with these agents is limited, clinically evident adverse immunologic responses, arrhythmias, and other adverse events have not been as high as anticipated. The clinical course of subjects receiving gene transfer has been as good as or better than that of subjects receiving placebo. Remaining challenges include refinement of endpoints, optimal dosing, selection of transgene, and the persistence of benefits.</p><p>The promising potential efficacy of AAV1.<italic>SERCA2a</italic> seen in the initial CUPID was not borne out by the larger CUPID 2 study. The STOP-HF study showed potential benefits in patients with the lowest EF, and additional trials may be planned. The current work with Ad5.<italic>hAC6</italic> has shown potential benefit at higher doses. A larger study will be required to confirm the preliminary indications of improvement in EF and the reduction of clinical adverse events.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s021" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant (P01 HL66941 and R42HL122038) and a Merit grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs (1101BX001515).</p></sec><sec id="s022" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Author Disclosure</title><p>Dr. Hammond is founder, unpaid consultant, and equity holder of Renova Therapeutics.
