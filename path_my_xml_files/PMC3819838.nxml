A continuous sample of 124 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 and 2 patients of adult age group undergoing elective modified radical mastectomy under general anesthesia were recruited in the study after obtaining the informed consent. Patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases (tuberculosis, obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung, and pleural infections), previous lung surgeries, co-existing cardiovascular diseases and history of allergy to LAs and bleeding diathesis were excluded from the study. All patients included in the study were randomly allocated to two groups, Group paravertebral (Group PVB, <italic>n</italic> = 60) and Group inter pleural (Group IPB, <italic>n</italic> = 60) by sealed envelope technique. A computer generated allocation sequence was used by a person other than the anesthesiologist involved in the study. All patients recruited for the study were familiarized with visual analog scale (VAS) score and bedside spirometry (Microloop10122, micro medical limited, Kent, England) and their baseline values were recorded.</p><p>All patients were pre-medicated with oral diazepam 10 mg on the night before and 2 h before surgery. In the operating room, baseline electrocardiogram, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. After securing an intravenous access, patients belonging to inter-pleural group were placed in lateral position with affected side facing up. IPB was performed after local infiltration of the skin (2 ml of 1% lignocaine) under complete aseptic conditions with an18 gauge Tuohy needle in 7<sup>th</sup> intercostal space, 10 cm lateral to the posterior midline, at the superior border of the rib. The interpleural space was identified by loss of resistance technique,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine was injected after performing negative aspiration. Patients were then turned supine and the number of dermatomes blocked was assessed at 5 min interval until 20 min and then every min until 30 min by an independent observer.</p><p>In paravertebral group, PVB was performed opposite the third thoracic spine under aseptic precautions using the technique described by Eason and Wyatt in the sitting position.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Skin infiltration was performed with 2 ml of 1%lignocaine. Tuohy needle (18 gauge) used to identify the paravertebral space was introduced 2.5 cm lateral to the most cephalad aspect of the spinous process and advanced perpendicular to the skin in all planes until the transverse process of the vertebra below was located. Then, the needle was walked above the transverse process and advanced gently until there was a loss of resistance to the injection of air indicating that the needle tip has traversed the superior costo-transverse ligament into the paravertebral space. After negative aspiration, 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine was slowly injected over 2-3 min. The patient was turned to supine position and level of analgesia was assessed in the same manner as for inter-pleural group by pinprick method.</p><p>A sham puncture was produced at IPB or PVB site depending upon the group allocation of the subject and the dermatome level of sensory block was assessed on the side of surgery to blind the observer recording the parameters.</p><p>Anesthesia was induced with 2.5% thiopentone in a dose sufficient to abolish eyelash reflex. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium bromide 0.1mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained using 1 minimum alveolar concentration MAC of isoflurane and 66% of nitrous oxide in oxygen. Controlled ventilation of lungs was performed using a circle system with an Ohmeda 7,000 ventilator. Analgesia was supplemented with intravenous fentanyl (1g/kg) if there was any hemodynamic response (more than 20% increases in pulserate and blood pressure (BP) from the baseline) to surgical incision. At the end of the surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with a mixture of neostigmine (2.5 mg) and atropine (1.2 mg). The patient was transferred to post-operative recovery room after recording BP, HR, and SpO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>VAS score was recorded at 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h post-operatively and then every day until patient discharge. During the first 4 h after surgery, whenever the VAS was more than 4 or the patient complained of pain, rescue analgesia was provided with intravenous morphine (1.5 mg every 5 min till VAS was less than 3). After 4 h post-operatively, rescue analgesia was provided with injection. Diclofenac 50 mg for the next 2 days and tablet diclofenac 50 mg for next 5 days. Fentanyl, morphine, and diclofenac requirement was recorded daily for a period of1 week. The quality of the block was assessed by opioid and diclofenac requirement. Patients who required fentanyl intra-operatively, morphine during first 4 h post-operatively and diclofenac (before the scheduled dose at 6 PM) were considered to have a failed block. Those who required either fentanyl or morphine were considered to have a partial block and those who required neither fentanyl nor morphine were considered to have complete block. Lung functions were assessed daily at night 8 pm for 1 week by using hand held bedside pulmonary function test apparatus.</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on the Pilot study performed on 20 patients (10 in each group), which indicated that 8 patients in PVB group and 6 in IPB group had complete block. Therefore to demonstrate a 20% difference in the quality of block we needed to study 59 patients in either group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the quality of the block is similar in both groups with probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis was 0.05. We used continuity-corrected Chi-squared statistics to evaluate this null hypothesis.</p><p>The data collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 16. Parametric and non-parametric data of the two groups were compared and analyzed using the unpaired student's t?test and Mann Whitney U?test respectively. Inter group differences between the variables recorded during the study period were analyzed by a two?way repeated measure analysis of variance using group as the independent samples factor and time as the repeated measurement factor. A?significant group?by?time interaction was followed by tests of significance using Tukey?s method to compare the two groups at various points in time. The Chi?square test was used for analysis of nominal data.-test and Mann Whitney U-test respectively. Inter group differences between the variables recorded during the study period were analyzed by a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance using group as the independent samples factor and time as the repeated measurement factor.

Decrease in intensity of post-operative pain and subsequent reduction in analgesic requirement during the 1<sup>st</sup> week after surgery may not only help in prevention of chronic post-mastectomy pain,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] but may also decrease the pulmonary morbidity post-operatively.</p><p>In the present study, patients in PVB group had more complete block when compared to IPB group, but the total dose of opioids consumed were not significantly different. The small difference in fentanyl consumption may have been due to incomplete analgesia with IPB for axillary dissection, but this did not translate into acute post-operative pain as evidenced by similar morphine requirements in both groups. The ability to perform pulmonary function tests in the presence of a large chest wound is an objective measure of pain control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Lung functions returned to near normal values by day2in both groups. The decrease in lung functions on day1 could be because of the higher concentration of LA used for the blocks. Clinical research has shown better lung functions with PVB when compared to IPB in thoracotomy patients because of higher loss of the drug through chest drain, presence of blood in the pleural cavity, increased absorption of drug by the inflamed pleura and dependent pooling of the drug affecting the function of the diaphragm with IPB,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] However, in the absence of these factors as in our study PEFR took 4 days in both paravertebral (4.56 &#x000b1; 0.45) and inter-pleural group (4.58 &#x000b1; 0.53) to return back to baseline value (4.57 &#x000b1; 0.45 in paravertebral and 4.59 &#x000b1; 0.53 in inter-pleural).</p><p>Acute post-operative pain relief with PVB results from direct penetration of LA in to the neurological structures present within the paravertebral space because the spinal nerve lacks both epineurium and part of the perineurium and has a thin membranous root sheath which can be easily penetrated by LA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Furthermore, relative avascularity of the paravertebral space limits anesthetic diffusion and allows prolonged sensory block and provides effective post-operative pain control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>In IPB, LA deposited between the parietal and visceral pleura diffuses from the pleural cavity across the endothoracic and subserous fascia, and innermost inter-costals muscles to provide multiple unilateral intercostal blockade.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Analgesia with IPB occurs by reverse diffusion of LA to the subpleural space and this diffusion of LA from the pleural space to the intercostal nerves is limited by uptake of drug by the visceral pleura. The rapidity and extent of this uptake is highly unpredictable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Furthermore, LA diffuses out through both layers of the pleura and gets deposited on the surfaces of lung, diaphragm, and pericardium thereby reducing the amount of LA acting on the intercostal nerves to produce pain relief for modified radical mastectomy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] This explains why the patient population in the PVB group had more complete block when compared to IPB.</p><p>PVB resulted in a complete block in 81% patients when compared to71% with IPB and it enabled effective anesthesia for axillary dissection. There is sufficient spread of LA towards lower cervical and upper thoracic paravertebral spaces with PVB,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] but with IPB most of the injected LA collects at the lowest point of the pleural cavity in a gravity-dependent manner, and hence spread is highly dependent on body position and it does not always reach the T2 level to provide analgesia for axillary dissection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Effective block of the nociceptive afferent input with PVB removes the stimulus for the generation of central sensitization and along with the afferent blockade of the sympathetic chain results in a &#x0201c;total afferent block.&#x0201d; This characteristic total afferent block because of PVB is the most important factor that prevents the development of chronic pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] None of patients from the current study were referred to the pain clinic with complaints of post-mastectomy pain until 3 months after the study. However, it is not possible to comment on the likely percentage of patients who would actually benefit from these blocks and be free of chronic post-mastectomy pain. Further studies having follow-up for at least a year are needed to establish the percentage relationship between adequacy of immediate post-operative pain relief with these blocks and chronic post-mastectomy pain.</p><p>To conclude Lung functions are well-preserved in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy under general anesthesia supplemented with Paravertebral or IPB. IPB is as effective as PVB for post-operative pain relief. PVB has the added advantage of achieving a more complete block.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
