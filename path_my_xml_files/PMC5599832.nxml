differed in their impact on bone mineral density (BMD) and fall risk in postmenopausal
women with osteoporosis. [Subjects and Methods] The research sample consisted of 40
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis with ages between 51 and 58&#x02005;years old. They were
divided at random into two groups of 20 each, respectively receiving closed and open
kinetic chain exercises. These exercises were administered three times per week over a
period of four sequential months. Prior to and following the treatment, Dual X-ray
Absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to measure the BMD of the femur neck in every participant,
while the Biodex Stability System (BSS) was used to estimate how likely each participant
was to sustain a fall. [Results] The strongest effect on BMD and fall risk was recorded by
the closed kinetic chain exercise. [Conclusion] Osteoporotic postmenopausal women should
be prescribed closed kinetic chain exercise to diminish the effects of the disease and
minimise their risk of fall.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Closed kinetic chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Open kinetic chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Postmenopausal women</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A systemic bone disease, osteoporosis manifests as gradual reduction in bone mass and
degradation of the microarchitecture of bone tissue, which is caused by the fact that bone
resorption is more intense than bone formation, making the bone fragile and therefore
heightening the risk of fracture<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Estimates suggest that fractures due to osteoporosis are sustained by 15&#x02013;30% of men and
30&#x02013;50% of women over the course of their life. At global level, osteoporosis has come to
affect more than 2,000 million individuals, becoming a significant health hazard despite
being a silent epidemic<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the US, in
2010, osteoporotic femur neck or lumbar spine developed in 10.2 million (10.3%) adults of
50&#x02005;years of age or older, with reduction in bone mass at the site of osteoporosis being
recorded in 43.4 million individuals (43.9%). Overall, 53.6 million adults presented both
osteoporosis and low bone mass, accounting for about 54% of the American population 50&#x02005;years
of age and older<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the case of Egypt,
various research has revealed that osteopenia and osteoporosis affected postmenopausal women
in proportions of 53.9% and 28.4%, respectively<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, while 26% and 21.9% of men were
respectively affected by the two diseases<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, in Saudi Arabia, about 23% of women with ages between 50
and 70&#x02005;years old suffered from osteoporosis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In 2004, 8768 cases of hip fractures due to osteoporosis were
recorded<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In postmenopausal women, the major fall risk factors are balance loss and increased body
sway<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fractures sustained due to falls
may significantly lower their quality of life, intensifying the financial burden on health
services and increasing the likelihood of disease development and death<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, as attested by a number of studies, the BMD
benefits from physical exercise, the latter thus having a key role in preventing BMD
reduction. Strength training was used by several studies to improve BMD<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it is believed that this improvement is due to the
bone piezoelectric effect. The occurrence of biochemical signals apparently reflecting an
electric field likely as a result of applied overload lends support to this explanation<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In older individuals, physical exercise not only diminishes fall risk, but also enhances
quality of life<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, in the
case of individuals with Alzheimer&#x02019;s, the likelihood of falls can be reduced by enhancing
motor function<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In closed chain
exercise (CKC), the body is made to move on a distal segment fixed or stabilised on a
surface of support, with movement at joint determining concomitant movement at both distal
and proximal joints in a way that can be more or less anticipated<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In open chain exercise, the distal segment (hand or foot)
is not fixed but can move unhindered in space, with movements in neighbouring joints not
necessarily occurring concomitantly<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Leg press strength is closely correlated
to the BMD of L2&#x02013;L4 of the lumbar spine and the neck of the femur. Stimulation of bone
deposition at these sites can be achieved with exercises that make use of gravitational or
ground reaction forces (e.g. stair climbing, walking or jumping with weighted vests)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Open-chain exercises involve motions in which the distal segment (hand or foot) is free to
move in space, without necessarily causing simultaneous motions at adjacent joints, It
performed in non-weight-bearing positions while Closed-chain exercises involve motions in
which the body moves on a distal segment that is fixed or stabilized on a support surface
and Movement at one joint causes simultaneous motions at distal as well as proximal joints
in a relatively predictable manner which stimulate joint and muscle mechanoreceptors,
facilitate co-activation of agonists and antagonists (co-contraction), and consequently
promote dynamic stability. Also, provide greater proprioceptive and kinesthetic feedback
than open-chain training because multiple muscle groups that cross multiple joints are
activated during closed-chain exercise, which provide more stress effect on bone that help
for stimulation of osteogenesis more sensory receptors in more muscles and intra-articular
and extra-articular structures are activated to control motion than during open-chain
exercises that improve balance and postural control<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) is usually applied to diagnose fractures or estimate the
risk of fracture at the femur neck and lumbar spine. In fact, hip fracture is most
accurately determined by DEXA at the femur neck<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meanwhile, the postural stability assessment and training system
known as the Biodex stability system constitutes a multi-axial device that can provide
accurate measurements of joint stabilisation capacity under dynamic stress<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the present study sought to
determine whether postmenopausal women with osteoporosis benefitted more from closed or open
kinetic exercises in terms of BMD and fall risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>To assess how closed and open kinetic chain exercises compared in terms of their effect on
BMD and fall risk in the case of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, this study employed
a sample of 40 osteoporotic postmenopausal women in the age range 51&#x02013;58 years old who were
treated in Makkah hospitals, Saudi Arabia. All participants completed a consent form before
undergoing the study. The study was approved by the research committee of physical therapy
department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences in Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi
Arabia. Approved Number: FAMS20160123.</p><p>The following inclusion criteria were applied for sample selection: postmenopausal women
with osteoporotic femoral neck but without fractures, and a Body Mass Index (BMI) no higher
than 30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Individuals were not included in the research if they smoked, had
a history of hip fractures or had hip operations, presented congenital hip deformities, had
taken corticosteroids for a protracted period of time, their BMI exceeded
30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, or had cancer, kidney disease gastrectomy or any condition that could
lead to secondary osteoporosis. The 40 selected participants were randomly divided into two
groups. In group I, closed kinetic chain exercises were administered to 20 postmenopausal
women with osteoporosis for a duration of 40 minutes thrice weekly over a period of four
months while in group II, open kinetic chain exercises were administered to the remaining 20
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis for a duration of 40 minutes thrice weekly over a
period of four months. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figure 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-1612-g001"/></fig> shows the flowchart of the study.</p><p>In the case of both groups, femoral neck BMD was qualitatively assessed with the help of
Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) (Model QDR-1000W, Hologic, Inc., and Waltham, MA, USA). The
procedures involves measurement of bone density, which represents the amount of mineral
present in a given volume of bone) by subjecting the bone to X-rays with two distinct levels
of energy. Diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on this imaging test. Balance and
neuromuscular control under dynamic stress are typically measured with the balance device
called Biodex Stability System (BSS) (Biodex Medical System Inc., Shirley, NY, USA). This
multi-axial device has an unstable balance platform with up to 20u surface tilt in a motion
range of 360u. It evaluates postural stability and fall risk based on a scale of twelve
levels, with the first and twelfth level respectively being the least and the most
stable.</p><p>In Group I, twenty osteoporotic postmenopausal women received closed kinetic chain
exercises for 40 minutes with 5 minute break between each exercise, which included leg press
in horizontal position (15 minutes), bicycling (15 minutes), Stairmaster climbing (10
minutes). If the participants became tired, lost their balance, sweated excessively, were
breathless, or experienced chest pain or leg cramps, the exercises were discontinued. In
Group II, twenty osteoporotic postmenopausal women received open kinetic chain exercises for
40 minutes with 10 minute break between them, which included straight leg raising, hip
shrugging from a half crock lying position, hip extension from prone lying position,
abduction and adduction from side lying position. All participants were required to maintain
the position with the leg straight and as high as possible for a couple of seconds. If the
participants became tired, lost their balance, sweated excessively, were breathless, or
experienced chest pain or leg cramps, the exercises were discontinued.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>BMD and risk of fall were analysed and compared between the two groups based on a paired

chain exercises on the BMD and fall risk among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The
results obtained indicated that, of the two types of exercises, the closed kinetic chain
exercises significantly improved both BMD and risk of fall (p&#x0003c;0.0001) in postmenopausal
women with osteoporosis. These results were consistent with those of an earlier study, which
showed that bone repair in rats subjected to weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing exercises
but the bone repair was improved by weight-bearing exercise after two weeks of
treatment<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of this study
were also similar to Vincent et al. findings, which indicated that higher intensities
related to maximum load were usually associated with higher stimuli, stimulating and having
a more immediate effect on BMD compared to lower training intensities<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, DeSure et al. found that strength, balance,
proprioception and gait were all improved by regular physical exercise<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, exercise programs focused on the promotion of
physical fitness could contribute to minimise the risk of falls among institutional care
patients<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study was also in agreement with previous study that reported that functional
balance, muscle strength, mobility, disability and falling risk were all improved by
exercise programs of moderate intensity specifically designed for fall prevention<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study also concurred with Menkes et al. results who found that
bone compression, tension, torsion or shear was a causative factor of bone overload. The
differences in the bone&#x02019;s electrical power produced by such mechanical forces act as an
electrical field that promotes cellular activity, causing minerals to be deposited in the
areas under stress<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study
contributed to reinforce existing evidence that strength training is among the physical
activities that promote bone formation<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, Liu et al. has also indicated that exercises engaging the body weight or
generating significant muscular strength as overload have an osteogenic effect. For example,
individuals performing sports that involve such exercises were found to exhibit a higher BMD
compared to non-athletes<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study
results were in line with earlier evidence that individuals of all ages can derive bone mass
benefits from physical exercise, with bone strength being particularly enhanced by short,
repetitive and multidirectional mechanical loading exercises<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results obtained in the present study provided support for the fact that the BMD and
fall risk of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis could both be improved by closed kinetic
chain exercises. Therefore, it is worth integrating these exercises with other strategies
for the treatment of osteoporosis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Nikander</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Siev&#x000e4;nen</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Heinonen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic
