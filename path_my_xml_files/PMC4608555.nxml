Increasing evidence suggests that aerobic exercise can attenuate the postprandial increase in plasma triacylglycerols (TAGs) in response to a high-fat or a high-fructose meal. However, it is unknown if resistance exercise can dampen the postprandial lipemic response to a meal rich in both fructose and fat.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p>Eight apparently healthy men (Mean &#x000b1; SEM; age = 27 &#x000b1; 2 years) participated in a crossover study to examine the effects of acute resistance exercise on next-day postprandial lipemia resulting from a high-fructose, high-fat meal. Participants completed three separate two-day conditions in a random order: (1) EX-COMP: a full-body weightlifting workout with the provision of additional kilocalories to compensate for the estimated net energy cost of exercise on day 1, followed by the consumption of a high-fructose, high-fat liquid test meal the next morning (day 2) (~600 kcal) and the determination of the plasma glucose, lactate, insulin, and TAG responses during a six-hour postprandial period; (2) EX-DEF: same condition as EX-COMP but without exercise energy compensation on day 1; and (3) CON: no exercise control.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The six-hour postprandial plasma insulin and lactate responses did not differ between conditions.

However, the effect of a single bout of resistance exercise on postprandial plasma TAG excursions in response to a mixed liquid meal with significant quantities of both fructose and fat has not been examined. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to determine whether or not a single bout of resistance exercise performed the day prior to a meal challenge could attenuate the postprandial increase in plasma TAG in response to a high-fructose, high-fat meal. Secondarily, the effect of energy balance was examined in conjunction with resistance exercise by studying the exercise conditions with and without dietary energy compensation for the estimated net energy cost of the single exercise bout. We hypothesized that there would be a significant attenuation of the postprandial lipemic response, following resistance exercise with no dietary energy compensation compared to a no-exercise control condition, but considered the possibility that providing additional food calories to compensate for the net cost of exercise would result in little to no attenuation of the postprandial lipemic response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study participants</title><p>Nine men were recruited who met the eligibility requirements as follows: apparently healthy, normotensive males with a body mass index (BMI) between 23 and 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and participated in recreational weightlifting on an average of two to three times per week in the month prior to enrollment. Exclusionary criteria included cigarette smoking, history of CVD, bone and joint dysfunction that would preclude resistance exercise, self-reported dyslipidemia, metabolic disorders, actively training for either resistance or aerobic exercise competition, and use of any nutritional supplements and/or medications that could alter metabolic function. Body weight (BW), BMI, and body fat percentage were assessed at an initial screening visit using a body composition analyzer (Tanita<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> Corporation). Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and body fat percentage to the nearest 0.1%. Height was measured using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm. One of the nine eligible participants had discontinued after enrollment due to difficulties with blood sampling. All subjects gave written informed consent.

Each of the three conditions lasted two days, with a minimum of a five-day washout between conditions. The conditions were as follows: (1) resistance exercise with calorie replacement (EX-COMP), (2) resistance exercise without calorie replacement (EX-DEF), and (3) no exercise control (CON). In the EX-COMP condition, participants completed a 95-minute resistance exercise protocol on the first day of the condition, 15 hours prior to the test meal the following morning. On the exercise day, they received additional kilocalories to compensate for the calories expended during the resistance exercise. Similar to the EX-COMP condition, participants also completed 95 minutes of resistance exercise on the first day of the EX-DEF condition. However, in the EX-DEF condition, participants were fed a similar amount of kilocalories as the control condition (therefore were likely in an energy deficit state for that day). The CON condition did not include any exercise, but participants reported to the laboratory for 95 minutes of quiet rest during the same time period in which they exercised in the EX-COMP and EX-DEF conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Day 1 protocol</title><p>In order to estimate energy requirements for the study participants, resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured by indirect calorimetry using a Parvo Medics TrueOne&#x000ae; 2400 metabolic measurement system (Parvo Medics). All RMR tests began between 6 am and 9 am, with a consistent start time across the three conditions for each study participant. Following the RMR test, participants were provided with breakfast, lunch, and snacks for the day by the researchers. Following either the resistance exercise bout or quiet rest, participants were provided with their dinner for the evening. All participants were instructed to consume only the food provided by the researchers and to return any uneaten food the following morning. Study participants were also instructed to refrain from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise on the day prior to beginning and during each condition (with the exception of the investigator-monitored resistance exercise bout in the two exercise conditions).<xref rid="b4-nmi-8-2015-029" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b14-nmi-8-2015-029" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Adherence was verbally confirmed by the participants the morning of day 2 of each condition.

Four sets of 10 repetitions each of 14 different exercises were completed in supersets, with the exception of lunges for which only three sets were performed. The 90-second rest intervals occurred between the start of one set and the start of the next set, with a two-minute rest interval following the completion of each superset. The fourth set of each exercise was performed to failure. The exercises included the following in order of performance: bench press, seated row, leg press, calf raise, shoulder press, lateral pull-down, leg extension, leg curl, bicep curl, triceps extension, lunges, lateral raise, sit-ups, and back extensions. The weight lifted for each exercise (~12 repetition maximums) was determined during an initial familiarization visit, where study participants performed an abbreviated version of the resistance exercise protocol.

In keeping with the study design, participants were provided significantly more calories for day 1 in the EX-COMP condition (2,988 &#x000b1; 117 kcal) than in either the EX-DEF or CON condition (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise</title><p>During the 95-minute bout of resistance exercise, the subjects lifted a large mass of weight. The total mass lifted was not significantly different between the two exercise conditions (EX-COMP: 37,325 &#x000b1; 1,237 kg; EX-DEF: 38,740 &#x000b1; 1,614 kg; <italic>P</italic> = 0.28).</p></sec><sec><title>Glucose, insulin, and lactate</title><p>The plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma lactate concentration data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-nmi-8-2015-029">Figure 1</xref>. There were no differences in fasting glucose concentrations across the three conditions, and plasma glucose rose only modestly during the postprandial period across all the three conditions. Statistical analyses revealed a significant time effect as well as a time by condition interaction, with subsequent contrasts between conditions showing a significant difference between CON and EX-COMP and between EX-COMP and EX-DEF (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). However, the six-hour AUC values for glucose were not different among conditions. There were no differences in fasting insulin concentrations (CON = 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x003bc;IU/mL EX-COMP = 1.4 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x003bc;IU/mL; EX-DEF = 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x003bc;IU/mL) or in fasting lactate (CON = 0.86 &#x000b1; 0.06 mmol/L; EX-COMP = 0.83 &#x000b1; 0.06 mmol/L; EX-DEF = 0.87 &#x000b1; 0.07 mmol/L) across the three conditions, although as expected there was a significant time effect for insulin and lactate as they increased and then decreased during the six-hour postprandial period across the three conditions. There were no time by condition interactions for insulin or lactate, indicating that the changes in these metabolites over time were not different among the conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Triacylglycerol</title><p>The TAG data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-nmi-8-2015-029">Figure 2</xref>. There was not a significant difference in fasting plasma TAG across the three conditions. As expected, there was a significant time effect across the three conditions owing to the rise and subsequent fall of TAG during the postprandial period. The repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant time by condition interaction with contrasts, showing both EX-COMP and EX-DEF to be significantly lower than CON (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but no differences between EX-COMP and EX-DEF. Post hoc tests revealed differences at several time points that were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) between CON and EX-COMP and CON and EX-DEF, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-nmi-8-2015-029">Figure 2</xref>. Additionally, the total six-hour AUC for TAG was significantly lower for both the EX-COMP and the EX-DEF conditions as compared to the CON condition (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main finding of our study is that compared to a no-exercise control condition, resistance exercise performed 15 hours prior to a high-fructose, high-fat liquid meal attenuates the postprandial lipemic response to the meal. This study appears to be the first to show this ostensibly beneficial effect of a single resistance exercise bout on postprandial lipemia induced by an acute high-fructose, high-fat meal. We examined the possibility that without an acute energy deficit created by the resistance exercise bout, the latter would not attenuate the postprandial TAG excursion. However, there was no statistical difference between the six-hour TAG AUC for EX-COMP and EX-DEF. Importantly, even in the face of energy compensation, resistance exercise significantly reduced the six-hour postprandial TAG AUC by 20% in comparison to the no-exercise control condition.</p><p>While we made no attempts in this study to determine the mechanisms behind the dampened postprandial lipemic response following the resistance exercise, it would follow that the decrease in postprandial TAG must be due to a decreased rate of appearance of TAG, an increased rate of disappearance of TAG, or both in combination. Previous research may allow some speculation as to the mechanistic effects. The kinetics of TAG appearance and disappearance have been examined in relation to endurance exercise performed the evening before testing. Studies utilizing stable-isotope tracers to determine the rates of both appearance and disappearance of TAG following a bout of endurance exercise indicate that the likely culprit for decreased VLDL-TAG following exercise is an increased rate of disappearance as compared to a non-exercise control condition.<xref rid="b29-nmi-8-2015-029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-nmi-8-2015-029" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Comparing arterial and venous blood samples from femoral veins and arteries the morning following an hour-long bout of treadmill running provides a similar insight that the decrease in plasma TAG may be attributable to an increased rate of disappearance of TAG from circulation.<xref rid="b29-nmi-8-2015-029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-nmi-8-2015-029" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Plasma LPL, but not muscle LPL, concentrations were found to be significantly increased following endurance exercise, suggesting that increased LPL expression may be at least partly responsible for the decrease in TAG.<xref rid="b30-nmi-8-2015-029" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-nmi-8-2015-029" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The rates of postprandial TAG appearance and disappearance following resistance exercise are an area ripe for future investigation.</p><p>The reason for the slightly, but statistically significant, lower postprandial plasma glucose response for the EX-COMP condition is not readily apparent. The lack of any condition differences in the glucose AUC values suggests that the aforementioned difference may be relatively inconsequential.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>There are a number of strengths of the present study that add to the credibility of our findings. The within-subjects crossover design allowed tight control over participant characteristics and limited potential confounding factors between the conditions. Each of the exercise protocols was supervised by the same individuals for consistent treatment, with a matched supervised control period. All meals on the first day were prepared and provided by the same investigator (JW) and were controlled to meet specific targeted macronutrient compositions. Additionally, the timing of all meals provided was repeated across each condition for each study participant. The postprandial changes in the plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and lactate were within expected ranges in response to the high-fructose, high-fat meal, lending credibility to our TAG differences between the conditions.</p><p>Several limitations are noteworthy. (1) Despite the tight control of energy intake among our participants, energy balance is difficult to measure and control in free-living individuals. We requested each participant to be sedentary (only movement required to complete the minimal activities of daily living) apart from the exercise bouts, and therefore, we assumed an activity factor of 1.4. We did not directly measure the energy expenditure of the exercise, as this is difficult to accurately determine given the significant anaerobic metabolism present with resistance exercise. Rather, we estimated the energy cost of the exercise bouts based on published values minus RMR. Thus, we recognize that our attempts at achieving zero energy balance for CON and EX-COMP and an energy deficit for EX-DEF are not without their limitations. A whole room calorimeter could be used in a future study to remove some of the estimations required of free-living study participants. Nevertheless, we believe our approach did create an approximate energy balance in the CON and EX-COMP conditions and some degree of negative energy balance in the EX-DEF condition. The additional energy provided for the EX-COMP condition clearly did not negate the effect of the resistance exercise in attenuating the postprandial lipemic response. (2) The reasons for the condition differences in the plasma glucose concentrations in response to the meal are not readily apparent, but these differences were quite small and may have little physiological relevance. (3) We chose to use a test meal with the same relative dose of energy, fructose, and fat used in a previously published study<xref rid="b4-nmi-8-2015-029" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> that was shown to induce a significantly greater postprandial lipemic response to fructose than to glucose. We reasoned that it was necessary to have a large postprandial lipemic response incurred from fructose and fat together in order to determine if resistance exercise could attenuate the response. However, given that fructose ingestion is most often accompanied by glucose in a meal (eg, fructose and glucose exist in a 1:1 ratio in the disaccharide sucrose, a major source of dietary fructose), we recognize that the meal used in our study limits the real-world application. (4) We only included apparently healthy young men, all of whom exhibited fasting TAG concentrations within normal limits. Future research will be required to determine whether a similar exercise-induced attenuation of the postprandial TAG response occurs in individuals who exhibit hypertriglyceridemia.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Resistance exercise performed the evening prior to a high-fructose, high-fat meal significantly attenuated the six-hour postprandial TAG excursion in apparently healthy young men.
