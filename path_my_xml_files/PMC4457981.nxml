Little is known about how patient factors influence physicians&#x02019; treatment decision-making in hypercholesterolemia. We examined physicians&#x02019; treatment recommendations in high-risk patients whose LDL-C remained uncontrolled despite statin monotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Physicians completed a questionnaire prior to randomization into period I of a two-period randomized controlled trial evaluating LDL-C goal attainment in patients whose LDL-C remained &#x02265;100&#x000a0;mg/dL after 5&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; treatment with atorvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg/day (NCT01154036). Physicians&#x02019; treatment recommendations were surveyed for two hypothetical and one real scenario: (1) LDL-C presumed near goal (between 100&#x02013;105&#x000a0;mg/dL), (2) LDL-C presumed far from goal (~120&#x000a0;mg/dL), and (3) observed baseline LDL-C of enrolled patients. Prognostic factors considered during decision-making were identified by regression analysis. Observed lipid outcomes at the end of period I (following 6&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; treatment with ezetimibe 10&#x000a0;mg plus atorvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg, atorvastatin 20&#x000a0;mg, or rosuvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg) were compared with estimated LDL-C outcomes for physicians&#x02019; treatment recommendations after 6&#x000a0;weeks (based on individual patients&#x02019; pre-randomization LDL-C and expected incremental change).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Questionnaires were completed for 1,534 patients. No change in therapy, or double atorvastatin dose, were frequently recommended, even when LDL-C was far from goal (6.5% and 52.2% of patients, respectively). Double atorvastatin dose was commonly recommended in all scenarios (43&#x02013;52% of patients). More intensive LDL-C-lowering regimens were recommended infrequently e.g. double atorvastatin dose <italic>and</italic> add ezetimibe only &#x0003c;12% in all scenarios. Overall, cardiovascular risk factors and desire to achieve a more aggressive LDL-C goal were prominent factors in decision-making for treatment. Comparison of observed and estimated LDL-C levels showed that physicians tended to overestimate the effectiveness of their recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides insight into physicians&#x02019; perspectives on clinical management of hypercholesterolemia and highlights a gap in knowledge translation from guidelines to clinical practice. The need for lower LDL-C and cardiovascular risk were key drivers in clinical decision-making, but physicians&#x02019; treatment choices were more conservative than guideline recommendations, potentially resulting in poorer LDL-C reduction. When compared with actual outcomes, projected LDL-C control was better if physicians used more comprehensive strategies rather than simply doubling the statin dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01154036">NCT01154036</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12944-015-0037-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Decision-making</kwd><kwd>Hypercholesterolemia</kwd><kwd>LDL-C</kwd><kwd>Ezetimibe</kwd><kwd>Statins</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with statin therapy is associated with clear benefit in reducing cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For years, both European and US dyslipidemia guidelines advocated a treat-to-target approach for LDL-C reduction to &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;mg/dL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since the development of this study, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines have advocated a shift away from LDL-C treatment targets <italic>per se</italic> to focus on identifying patients most likely to benefit from high-intensity (LDL-C reduction &#x02265;50%) or moderate-intensity (LDL-C reduction 30 - &#x0003c;50%) statin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. International guidelines, however, continue to advocate a treat-to-target approach, albeit with a more stringent LDL-C target for very high cardiovascular risk patients of &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;mg/dL or a 50% reduction from baseline, compared with an LDL-C target of &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;mg/dL for high cardiovascular risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Many patients at high cardiovascular risk receiving statin monotherapy experience sub-optimal LDL-C-lowering with persistent residual risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Retrospective analysis of medical records for &#x0003e;27,400 US patients with very high cardiovascular risk (e.g., coronary heart disease or atherosclerotic vascular disease) with prescriptions for atorvastatin monotherapy showed that &#x0003e;65% of patients had LDL-C levels &#x0003e;70&#x000a0;mg/dL and, of these, 30&#x02013;40% had LDL-C &#x02265;20&#x000a0;mg/dL in excess of this level regardless of dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Where LDL-C-lowering remains sub-optimal on statin monotherapy, guidelines generally recommend using the maximum tolerated statin dose in high-risk individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or introducing combination therapy with another lipid-lowering agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In clinical practice, physicians may/should use evidence-based guidelines to implement an individualized sequential treatment approach to lipid management, particularly for relatively challenging high-risk patients who require more intensive LDL-C reduction. Nevertheless, failure to achieve therapeutic LDL-C targets persists for various reasons, including non-adherence, intolerance and cost factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For high-risk patients, including those who may be poor responders and/or intolerant to treatment with higher statin doses, baseline levels can greatly exceed target values making it difficult to achieve LDL-C goals. In addition, achieving target LDL-C may require several steps, such as dose uptitration, or combination therapy; thus, compliance and cost factors can be an issue. Physicians&#x02019; knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs also play a major role in the translation of guideline-based evidence to the treatment choices they make in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Specifically, organizational structures, time constraints, perceived lack of usefulness of guidelines, and knowledge gaps commonly preclude wider implementation of best-practice recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, with physician-patient partnerships increasingly promoted in healthcare decision-making, physicians (particularly in general practice) often adopt a pragmatic and flexible approach to guideline implementation in order to preserve relationships with their patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>To date, there has been little study of patient characteristics that influence physicians&#x02019; treatment decisions. We therefore conducted a questionnaire-based survey of physicians participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to better understand physician attitudes/beliefs and patient characteristics that influence clinical decision-making for specific treatments in hypercholesterolemia. The primary results of the RCT, which assessed LDL-C goal attainment rates in high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and elevated LDL-C on atorvastatin monotherapy when changed to more potent LDL-C-lowering therapies (i.e., uptitration, ezetimibe add-on, or switch to a more potent statin), have been published previously (NCT01154036) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Here we report the findings of the questionnaire-based survey, which assessed physicians&#x02019; treatment recommendations and prognostic factors involved in decision-making for two hypothetical and one real scenario: (1) LDL-C presumed near goal (between 100&#x02013;105&#x000a0;mg/dL), (2) LDL-C presumed far from goal (~120&#x000a0;mg/dL), and (3) observed baseline LDL-C. The survey was conducted just prior to randomization of each patient into the RCT, thus providing a unique opportunity to compare estimated outcomes based on treatment choices made in a real-life clinical setting with those obtained under strict protocol guidance during an actual RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physician and patient characteristics</title><p>Physicians at 296 sites in 29 countries randomized 1,547 patients to receive treatment with ezetimibe 10&#x000a0;mg plus atorvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg, atorvastatin 20&#x000a0;mg, or rosuvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg daily for 6&#x000a0;weeks during period I of a phase III, two-period, multicenter, double-blind RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; 1,460 of these patients completed period I.</p><p>Physicians completed the pragmatic use questionnaire for a total of 1,534 male and female patients at high cardiovascular risk; the majority (67.2%) were aged &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years and approximately 50% had prior history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Physicians&#x02019; treatment recommendations were solicited for individual patients who had received atorvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg during a 5-week pre-treatment period and were thus eligible for inclusion in a double-blind RCT designed to assess LDL-C goal attainment rates with different treatment strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As such, the survey provides real-world insight into the key drivers used by physicians in the decision-making process for lipid management in patients with hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>A number of key determinants in the physician decision-making process, primarily cardiovascular risk factors and the desire to achieve a more aggressive LDL-C goal, were identified in this survey. Notably, patients randomized to a relatively intensive treatment regimen tended to have better LDL-C-lowering outcomes but in practice physicians tended to be conservative, recommending relatively few patients to receive such treatments and typically only when LDL-C was far from goal.</p><p>Observational data suggest that, in clinical practice, more potent LDL-C-lowering efficacy interventions involving the combination of a statin with ezetimibe and/or statin uptitration are infrequently prescribed to patients at high cardiovascular risk whose LDL-C remains elevated on low- to moderate-potency statin monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this questionnaire-based study, physicians were similarly conservative when choosing a regimen for patients who had not responded adequately to initial treatment with atorvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg, especially if such patients were close to, but not at, the recommended goal.</p><p>Physicians recommended doubling the atorvastatin dose in approximately 42&#x02013;50% of patients, regardless of whether or not the observed baseline LDL-C was known or presumed to be near or far from goal. Guidelines generally recommend that the maximum tolerated statin dose should be used in individuals at high cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], although it is recognized that patients may not achieve adequate LDL-C-lowering on statin therapy alone, with LDL-C being typically reduced only by an additional 4&#x02013;7% when the statin dose is doubled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Adverse events, including myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and adverse effects on liver enzymes, can also be increased at relatively high statin doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Consequently, combination therapy with standard statin doses and other lipid-lowering agents is necessary for individuals whose therapeutic response to statins is sub-optimal and if the risk-benefit balance is favorable as recommended in guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>We found that when patients&#x02019; observed baseline LDL-C was known to physicians, or when LDL-C was presumed to be far from goal, physicians recommended add-on therapy with ezetimibe in only 15% of patients. Addition of ezetimibe 10&#x000a0;mg to ongoing statin therapy has been shown to reduce LDL-C by an additional 14&#x02013;22% compared with doubling the statin dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the RCT in which this questionnaire-based study was a component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], daily treatment for 6&#x000a0;weeks with ezetimibe 10&#x000a0;mg&#x02009;+&#x02009;atorvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg was associated with reduction in LDL-C of &#x02212;20% from baseline for patients not controlled with atorvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg. This is comparable with that expected, and significantly better than either atorvastatin uptitration or a switch to rosuvastatin in terms of LDL-C change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is likely that the conservative approach to use of combination therapy seen in clinical practice has, until recently, reflected a lack of confidence amongst physicians in the clinical benefit of LDL-C-lowering by combination therapy due to lack of evidence showing benefits on CVD-related events in outcome trials &#x02013; both fibrates and niacin, for example, have reported negative trial results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. While the SHARP (Study of Heart And Renal Protection) trial demonstrated that combination therapy with statin (simvastatin 20&#x000a0;mg) plus ezetimibe 10&#x000a0;mg was associated with a significant decrease in major atherosclerotic events, non-hemorrhagic stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures compared with placebo in patients with severe chronic kidney disease, a statin monotherapy arm was not included in the SHARP study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The recently completed IMPROVE-IT trial assessed the cardiovascular benefit of LDL-C-lowering with ezetimibe 10&#x000a0;mg added to simvastatin (mainly 40&#x000a0;mg) compared with simvastatin monotherapy in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes. The study investigators reported that the trial met its primary and secondary composite cardiovascular efficacy endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Clinical inertia or conservatism is an increasingly recognized factor in poor management of chronic conditions, such as dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In certain complex clinical situations, rather than clinical inertia, it is possible that appropriate inaction may reflect the need for individualized treatment (i.e. patients with multiple comorbidities receiving multiple medications) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. There is a need to examine the complex interplay between provider-, patient-, and system-level barriers that contribute to clinical inertia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Our survey enabled identification of prognostic factors considered by physicians during decision-making in hypercholesterolemia. We found that physician characteristics had no evident impact on physician treatment recommendations. No change in therapy was a common recommendation and was even made for 6.5% of patients in the hypothetical scenario of LDL-C being far from goal. Relative to no change in therapy, cardiovascular risk factors and the desire to achieve a more aggressive LDL-C goal were the prognostic factors that appeared to consistently contribute to the physician decision-making process across all scenarios. Specifically, the desire to achieve a more aggressive LDL-C goal was the strongest factor with a consistently high relative risk (RR) across all scenarios and treatment options. Concerns regarding side effects also had an impact on decision-making; this factor was selected more often by the physician when their recommendation was no change in therapy, compared to the other treatment recommendations.</p><p>Prior response to a statin was a key factor across all scenarios influencing implementation of combination therapy with statin and ezetimibe. Consideration of reimbursement status generally impacted across all scenarios and treatment recommendations, being a key determinant towards use of combination therapy. An overall apparently counter-intuitive desire to achieve a more aggressive LDL-C goal and apparent reluctance by physicians to implement combination therapy may mirror lack of evidence supporting the use of more potent LDL-C-lowering (combination) therapy in specific patient groups. This observation is, in fact, consistent with findings in other studies showing less frequent use of switching to more potent statin or combination therapy in real-world clinical practice compared with use of moderate-potency lipid-lowering therapy; this is very likely attributed to patient non-compliance/intolerance, health-provider non-adherence to current guidelines, and/or cost factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The situation may be countered by recent reports from IMPROVE-IT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Other approaches may include benchmarking, which has been shown to provide a potential means to drive quality of care and improve target attainment of modifiable risk factors in type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>A key strength of this study is that questionnaires were provided prior to treatment results. The data reflects unbiased physician perspectives for clinical management of dyslipidemia. Physicians were more conservative in their treatment choice than guidelines generally recommend. Physicians recommended more aggressive treatment regimens if LDL-C was far from the goal, and estimated lipid outcomes with these recommendations approached or surpassed those attained with the more aggressive randomized treatments. Indeed, when compared with observed lipid outcomes, estimated LDL-C control was better if physicians were to have used more comprehensive strategies rather than simply doubling the statin dose. This is further consistent with the observed LDL-C outcomes from period II of the RCT where more intensive lipid-lowering regimens, such as add-on therapy with ezetimibe, produced incremental improvements in LDL-C-lowering and LDL-C goal attainment in patients who had persistently elevated LDL-C levels following 6&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; of therapy with more conservative strategies, such as atorvastatin 20&#x000a0;mg or rosuvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Several factors may be considered limitations. Differing health care systems may influence treatment practices. Through willingness to participate in the trial, it might be expected the primary care physicians and specialists in our study sample would have a greater interest in lipid management than those in broader clinical practice, and may be more familiar with best-practice guidelines. However, this did not seem to have a major influence on the findings as the original RCT design resulted in uptitration and/or switching to a more potent statin in more than 90% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], whereas 18% of physicians recommended no change in therapy, less than half recommended uptitration and relatively few (&#x0003c;3%) endorsed switching to a more potent statin, even when the baseline LDL-C was known. We believe that in clinical practice, where various real-life patient factors (e.g., age, social environment, comorbid conditions, likelihood of adherence) affect physicians&#x02019; prescribing patterns, most physicians would be even more conservative in their treatment approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides insight into physicians&#x02019; perspectives on the clinical management of hypercholesterolemia and highlights a gap in guideline implementation. Specifically, physicians adopt a generally conservative approach towards treating patients to LDL-C targets, tending to overestimate the magnitude of any effect of doubling the statin dose. LDL-C levels close to goal may contribute to physician reluctance to manage patients more aggressively. Improved understanding of the factors that influence physicians&#x02019; treatment recommendations will help guide better guideline implementation and that may overall contribute to better lipid management in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study design</title><p>This questionnaire-based survey was performed in the context of a phase III, two-period, multicenter, double-blind RCT (NCT01154036), published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Multiple choices and write-in choices were also permitted. The questionnaire also asked physicians to specify which patient factors they would consider in deciding their real-life treatment choice(s): LDL-C close to the goal; LDL-C far from goal; desire to achieve more aggressive goal; cardiovascular risk factors; obesity/metabolic syndrome; low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; high triglyceride; concerns regarding side effects; prior good response to statin; prior poor response to statin; age; sex; patient preference; cost of medication to patient; and reimbursement status.
