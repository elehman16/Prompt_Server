Approximately 70% of calcaneal fractures are intraarticular fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although the treatment of calcaneal fractures remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], it has been reported that nonoperative treatment for displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures has been associated with poor results secondary to subtalar arthrosis and abnormal hindfoot morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, many authors advocate for surgical treatment over conservative treatment for these fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since the mid-1990s, open reduction and internal fixation via an extended L-shaped lateral approach has been considered the gold standard for surgical treatment of displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, postoperative wound healing complications, including wound infection, skin edge necrosis, wound breakdown, and hematoma, remain a major concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The incidence of wound complications when using extended L-shaped lateral approaches has been reported to be anywhere from 5.8 to 43% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>To minimize the incidence of wound complications, several minimally invasive techniques have been developed in recent years, including closed reduction and percutaneous screw fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], open reduction via a less invasive sinus tarsi approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and arthroscopic-assisted fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Closed reduction and percutaneous screw fixation has frequently been reported and can effectively reduce the risk of operative wound complications as a result of the small incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the screw fixation is not strong enough to offer rigid stabilization of the calcaneal fracture fragments. Additionally, open reduction using a less invasive sinus tarsi approach is recommended by some experts and has the advantages of effective reduction of the subtalar articular surface and greatly decreased impact on local skin blood supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the application of the common calcaneal plate is limited as specially designed plates, which have not undergone biomechanical testing, are applied. More recently, early reports of arthroscopically assisted fixation have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but a number of factors have prevented it from gaining widespread use, including a steep learning curve with prolonged surgical duration and a costly equipment requirement.</p><p>We developed a novel minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis (MIPO) technique for the treatment of displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures that showed favorable outcomes in our clinical series. In the MIPO technique, a small vertical incision was placed midway between the posterior border of the fibula and the anterolateral border of the Achilles tendon, and percutaneous internal fixation was performed. The purpose of this study was to describe this MIPO technique and to evaluate the clinical outcomes and complications of this technique compared with conventional treatment for Sanders type II and III calcaneal fractures using an extended L-shaped lateral approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a prospective randomized controlled trial of patients with displaced intraarticular fractures of the calcaneus. The study was conducted according to the &#x0201c;CONSORT statement&#x0201d; guidelines for randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients were allocated in accordance with the random number table and divided into two groups, a MIPO group and an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using a conventional approach group (conventional treatment group). A calcaneus plate (AO Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland) was used for internal fixation in both groups. The procedures were all performed by a team of two senior surgeons. All radiographic assessments were conducted by two independent senior radiologists. The final result was the average of the two testing values. The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Shaoxing People&#x02019;s Hospital (No. 2010024).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>The inclusion criteria for this study were displaced intraarticular fractures of the calcaneum with standard radiographic and CT evidence of Sanders type II or III fractures. Patients with an open fracture, bilateral calcaneal fractures, peripheral vascular disease, skin infection, signs of compartment syndrome, neurologic deficit following head injury or spinal injury, other fractures of the ipsilateral or contralateral limb, and severe osteoporosis were excluded. From May 2011 to November 2013, 82 consecutive patients with unilateral calcaneal fractures that met these criteria were included in the study. All patients received the type of treatment to which they had been allocated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Demographic data including age, sex, injury mechanism, and follow-up time were recorded.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow of patients through the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13018_2017_511_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Surgical techniques</title><p>Following admission, the patients&#x02019; extremities were elevated and ice was applied in an effort to minimize swelling and avoid blisters. Surgery was performed either within 24&#x000a0;h or after the swelling had subsided and skin wrinkling had appeared. For antibiotic prophylaxis, 1.5&#x000a0;g of intravenous cefuroxime was administered 30&#x000a0;min preoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All patients underwent general anesthesia or epidural anesthesia.</p><p>In the MIPO group, the patient was placed in a lateral position on a radiolucent operating table and a tourniquet was applied. Landmarks for skin incision were identified, including the posterior border of the lateral malleolus and the anterolateral border of the Achilles tendon. An axially directed incision (3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;cm) was made from the level of the tip of the lateral malleolus to midway between the posterior border of the fibula and the anterolateral border of the Achilles tendon (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). After dividing the subcutaneous tissue directly to the bone, a periosteum elevator was used to create a lateral calcaneal subfascial channel to fit the calcaneal plate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Afterward, a Steinmann pin was inserted into the calcaneal tuberosity from the lateral side and traction was applied along the long axis of the foot to correct the varus and length of calcaneus while the posterior articular surface was reduced by leverage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). For cases of Sanders type III calcaneal fractures, the posterior articular surface was also reduced with the help of a periosteum elevator. After incompletely uncovering the fragment of the lateral wall, a periosteum elevator was inserted in the calcaneus and placed under the posterior articular surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Under C-arm fluoroscopy, the posterior articular surface was directly reduced by leverage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Once satisfactory anatomical reduction of the calcaneus was achieved, a pre-bent calcaneus plate (AO Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) was inserted into the subcutaneous calcaneus lateral channel. After confirming the proper placement of the plate under C-arm fluoroscopy, an identical plate was placed on the implant area as a scope for selective stab incisions and screws were placed into the rear calcaneal body, the subtalar articular surface, and the anterior process of the calcaneus through the stab incisions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). Next, the plate and screw were secured under C-arm fluoroscopy, rubber drains were inserted, and the incision was closed in a layered fashion followed by compression bandaging (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>

</p><p>In the conventional treatment group, ORIF using an extended L-shaped lateral approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] was performed. An incision measuring 10&#x02013;12&#x000a0;cm was made directly to the bone to create a full-thickness flap. In contrast to the MIPO group, the entire lateral wall of the calcaneus was exposed and the subtalar joints were directly visualized after overturning the fracture fragment of the lateral wall. Once anatomical reduction of the calcaneus was achieved, the allogeneic bone was used for the reconstruction of calcaneal defects. Rigid fixation with the calcaneus plate and screws (AO Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland) was also achieved under C-arm fluoroscopy.</p><p>Postoperatively, the affected limbs of the patients were elevated to minimize swelling. At 3 and 12&#x000a0;h postoperatively, 1.5&#x000a0;g of prophylactic intravenous cefuroxime was administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. At 24&#x000a0;h postoperatively, it was possible to begin passive and active motion of the ankle and subtalar joint without weight-bearing. Rubber drainage was extracted after 48&#x000a0;h and the incisions were cleaned every 2&#x000a0;days until the sutures were removed approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks after surgery. All patients were treated with analgesic therapy for 1&#x000a0;week (celecoxib 200&#x000a0;mg, orally, twice daily). Partial weight-bearing was begun after 6&#x000a0;weeks post-operation, and full weight-bearing was initiated after 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcome parameters</title><p>Primary clinical outcomes including operative time, postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score, and wound healing complications were recorded. VAS was used to track patients&#x02019; daily pain scores during the pre-operation and post-operation phases, as well as at 1&#x000a0;week postoperatively. The VAS was measured in centimeters (0&#x02013;10.0&#x000a0;cm) in this study. The wound healing complications, including superficial infection, deep infection, and wound necrosis, were evaluated. According to the surgical site infection criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], superficial infections could be treated non-operatively and infections that required surgical intervention, readmission, or intravenous antibiotics were classified as deep infections.</p><p>Secondary clinical outcomes including time to operation, length of incision, postoperative drainage, length of hospital stay, and medical expense were also recorded.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>The foremost benefit of MIPO is the reduced risk of wound healing complications. The entire blood supply of the lateral skin is derived from the peroneal artery and its terminal branches. The L-shaped lateral incision must specifically avoid this artery and its branches, and it will result in a severe risk of wound necrosis and soft tissue infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, the lateral wall of the calcaneus is subcutaneous and any implants on the surface can lead to wound healing complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, the risk of postoperative wound healing complications using the extended L-shaped lateral approach is quite high; in fact, Buckley et al. reported a 25% rate of wound healing issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Likewise, DeWall et al. reported a deep infection rate of 14.3% and superficial infection rate of 21.4% in patients treated with open reduction using an extended L-shaped lateral approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similar to the previous studies, 13 of the 35 fractures (37.1%) in the conventional treatment group in our study experienced wound healing problems; deep infection occurred in 2 of the 35 (5.7%) fractures and the incidence of superficial infection was 4 in 35 (11.4%). However, only 2 patients (6.7%) in the MIPO group experienced a wound or soft tissue complication or infection. Compared with conventional treatment, MIPO substantially decreased the risk of wound complications because of minimal soft tissue dissection and lateral skin blood supply preservation.</p><p>The fact that this technique was minimally invasive was also evidenced by the shortened operating time, decreased postoperative pain, and shortened hospital stay. In our study, the operative time and length of hospital stay in the MIPO group were considerably shorter than those in the conventional treatment group with a statistically significant difference. Additionally, the VAS value in the MIPO group was lower than that of the conventional treatment group at 1&#x000a0;week postoperatively. These data demonstrate that minimal soft tissue dissection by MIPO leads to better postoperative rehabilitation. According to the previous literature, the operative risks of the L-shaped lateral approach include injury to the peroneal tendons and the sural nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although neither of those occurred in the two groups in our study, MIPO generally prevents these complications by employing careful subperiosteal dissection and percutaneous internal fixation.</p><p>The allowed application of a common calcaneus plate in MIPO was also an added advantage compared with previous minimally invasive techniques. Closed reduction and percutaneous fixation have been widely reported to significantly reduce the incidence of wound healing complications. De Vroome et al. reported that postoperative infection occurred in 1 of 46 (2.4%) cases treated using closed reduction and percutaneous screw fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, this treatment seems to be more suitable for cases with moderately displaced fracture or non-comminuted calcaneus fracture because of the limited fixation strength. For instance, Stulik et al. reported 13 cases (4.5%) of loss of reduction in patients treated with closed reduction and percutaneous fixation using K-wires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In our study, a common calcaneus plate was applied in the MIPO group which can offer rigid fixation of calcaneal fracture fragments. Minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach was also recommended by some authors due to fewer wound complications and easy subtalar articular reduction. Kline et al. reported the overall rate of wound complications was 6% in the patients treated with minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Xia et al. also reported shorter surgical times and lower wound complications using the minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach compared with an extended L-shaped lateral approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, compared with our minimally invasive technique, the application of a common calcaneal plate is limited and some specially designed plates, which have not undergone biomechanical testing, have been used in the sinus tarsi approach.</p><p>One of the most important aspects of this technique pertains to the skin incision. An axially directed incision (3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;cm) was made from the level of the tip of the lateral malleolus and placed midway between the posterior border of the fibula and the anterolateral border of the Achilles tendon. This type of small incision greatly decreases the impact on local skin blood supply and the length of the incision depends only on the width of the plate. Additionally, a lateral calcaneus subfascial channel should be created by careful subperiosteal dissection to avoid injury to the peroneal tendons and the sural nerve. Furthermore, an identical plate can be used as a scope to ensure the accuracy and precision of the screw placement.</p><p>A satisfactory anatomical reduction was also achieved by this minimally invasive technique. Although the use of MIPO to treat calcaneal fractures carries a risk of inadequate reduction, especially in terms of posterior facet reconstruction, we achieved satisfactory anatomical reduction of the calcaneum in the two groups in our study. Additionally, we did not use bone grafting in the MIPO group and allogeneic bone was used to fill the calcaneal defect in the conventional treatment group. While bone grafts do add mechanical support and may stimulate quicker fracture healing, the calcaneus is extremely vascular and heals rapidly with reconstitution of the cancellous bone within 4 to 8&#x000a0;weeks of surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the possibility that the use of bone substitutes increases the risk of infection is a definite source of concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>This study had several limitations of note. First, we had a relatively small number of patients and a poor power analysis (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.8) was calculated in several primary clinical outcome parameters. In addition, we had a mean follow-up period of only 14&#x000a0;months; a longer follow-up period is needed to adequately assess the arthritic changes in the subtalar joint, which are among the most common complications. For instance, Thermann et al. reported arthritic changes in the subtalar joint in 65.2% of type II fractures and in 81.7% of type III and type IV fractures and radiological follow-up evaluation showed arthritic changes in the subtalar joint in 44% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, we achieved satisfactory anatomical reduction of the calcaneus in the two groups in this study; however, the quality of fracture reduction was not assessed in this study. At the last follow-up, radiographic evaluation was not routinely underwent in majority of patients on account of the medical cost, and the radiological outcomes of the last follow-up were also not showed in this study. Lastly, we had a significant loss to follow-up as 18 (21.20%) patients did not return to the clinic and thus did not complete the questionnaires. Therefore, further investigation with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up period is necessary to obtain a more precise understanding of the clinical efficacy of MIPO in the management of intraarticular calcaneal fractures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>From our experience with the 29 patients in the MIPO group, we believe that the radiologic and clinical results achieved by our patients were satisfactory. Compared with the conventional treatment using an L-shaped lateral approach for intraarticular calcaneus fractures, MIPO offers critical advantages, including a considerably reduced risk of wound healing complications, shortened operating time and length of hospital stay, as well as superior postoperative rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AOFAS</term><def><p>American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIPO</term><def><p>Minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ORIF</term><def><p>Open reduction and internal fixation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>Short Form-36</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USD</term><def><p>United States dollar</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None declared.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81572126).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The authors declare that all data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>YQ and CJ conceived the design of the original study.
