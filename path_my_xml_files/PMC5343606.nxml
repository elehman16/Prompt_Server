Recently, collagen cross-linking (CXL) has been introduced as an effective intervention in management of progressive keratoconus. Accelerated CXL is a new protocol of this procedure which reduces corneal ultraviolet irradiation exposure time to 5 min. This study aimed to compare visual acuity, keratometry and topographic criteria of keratoconic eyes after conventional and accelerated CXL with a six-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this prospective interventional study we assessed eyes of 40 patients. Patients were divided into two groups randomly. One group underwent accelerated (5 min) CXL and the other underwent conventional (30 min) CXL. Visual acuity, topographic criteria and keratometry were assessed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In the present study we assessed 40 patients, 50% of which were right eye (OD) and 50% were left eye (OS). Mean age of patients in the accelerated group was 22.10 and in the conventional group was 22.80 years. Our results showed no significant differences between visual acuity, keratometric and topographic criteria in the two groups before intervention. Likewise our results manifested no significant difference between visual acuity, keratometric, refractive and topographic criteria after intervention.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>According to our survey topographic criteria and keratometry improvement in the accelerated and conventional protocol are the same. So accelerated protocol is suggested as a safe and effective option for management of progressive keratoconus.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Accelerated method</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>conventional method</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>cornea collagen cross-linking</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>keratoconus</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Keratoconus is a non-symmetrical, non-inflammatory slowly progressive corneal degeneration and dystrophy that commonly presents in young adults characterized by changes in corneal collagen structures and organization. Decreased mechanical stability has a pivotal role in the progressive ectasia of the keratoconic cornea, leading to mild to severe impairment of visual acuity resulting from irregular astigmatism, progressive myopia, corneal thinning and central corneal scarring. Its incidence has been reported to be 1 in 2000 in the general population. Nevertheless some studies suggest the prevalence of keratoconus to be higher. Current interventions like spectacles and contact lenses, intracorneal ring segment implantation, lamellar keratoplasty and penetrating keratoplasty, have limitations.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Recently, different studies demonstrated stiffening of the cornea with the use of ultraviolet A and riboflavin solution as a photosensitizer-initiated collagen cross-linking without any loss in corneal transparency. Collagen cross-linking (CXL) was introduced by Wollensak <italic>et al</italic>., to stabilize progressive keratoconus, to prevent some underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease and avoid corneal transplantation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In the most commonly used CXL procedures, the UVA is illuminated for 30 min. Recent advances in UV light sources and CXL techniques have led to development of uniform, high-powered UVA light sources. These advances helped to develop a new accelerated technique for CXL that reduces exposure time to UVA.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A number of studies have investigated this new technique and compared it with conventional CXL. In their study carried out with the main purpose of comparison of early healing following conventional, transepithelial and accelerated corneal cross-linking, Touboul <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] demonstrated that accelerated CXL had a greater impact than conventional CXL on the anterior cornea. Matalia <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] evaluated the safety of accelerated CXL in their pilot study and concluded that accelerated CXL can be considered as a safe procedure for the treatment of keratoconus.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In another study, Rocha <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed that the rapid method of collagen cross-linking has similar efficacy in stiffening the cornea in comparison to standard cross-linking, but requires only 30 sec of UVA exposure.</p><p>In the present study the clinical results of conventional and accelerated collagen cross-linking for keratoconus after 6 months of follow-up, are presented and compared with each other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Forty patients in which keratoconus progression was observed in the last 3 months were enrolled in the present study.</p><p>Keratoconus progression was confirmed by corneal topography in all eyes included in the study.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were a documented keratoconus and refractive error higher than 2 diopters and corneal thickness more than 400 microns.

Patients were randomly divided into two groups, one of which underwent accelerated collagen cross-linking (18 mW/cm2 for 5 min) and the other underwent conventional collagen cross-linking (3 m W/cm2 for 30 min).

There are some therapeutic options for keratoconus including intrastromal implants, intraocular lenses, microwave remodeling and anterior lamellar keratoplasty.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The use of collagen corneal cross-linking (CXL) with riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) has rapidly expanded in the world and is currently regarded as the only recognized treatment to slow or arrest KC progression, obtaining in some cases a significant improvement of corneal curvature and regularity.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Efficacy of CXL in treatment of progressive keratoconus has been proved in lots of studies. Vinciguerra <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have reported refractive, topographic, aberrometric, and tomographic outcomes 24 months after corneal cross-linking (CXL) in patients up to 18 years of age with progressive keratoconus. In their study 40 eyes underwent riboflavin-ultraviolet A-induced CXL and they reported that CXL improved uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity in studied patients, most likely by significantly reducing corneal asymmetry as well as total wave front aberrations. Wittiq-silva <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in a prospective, randomized, control trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of collagen cross-linking in the management of progressive keratoconus. They enrolled 66 eyes of 49 patients with documented progressive keratoconus in their study and their results suggested temporary stabilization of all treated eyes after CXL. Caporossi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported long-term results of 44 keratoconic eyes treated by collagen cross-linking. Their results showed a long-term stability of keratoconus after cross-linking without relevant side-effects. Agrawal[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in a retrospective study assessed corneal collagen cross-linking for keratoconus in a one-year period. In this study 68 eyes were observed after CXL procedure for 12&#x02013;16 months and the obtained results suggested CXL as an effective treatment for progressive keratoconus. Likewise Mencucci <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in their study evaluated the safety and efficacy of collagen cross-linking as a parasurgical treatment of keratoconus and concluded that this procedure is safe and effective for stiffening of the cornea.</p><p>All these studies corroborated the fact that CXL is a safe and efficient option for keratoconus treatment but to the best of our knowledge there are few studies which have compared new techniques of collagen cross-linking with traditional ones.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Touboul <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in their study compared early healing of cornea after accelerated, conventional and transepithelial collagen cross-linking protocols. In their study 24 patients with progressive keratoconus were divided into three groups to receive accelerated, transepithelial and conventional CXL. Corneal confocal microscopy was performed on each patient preoperatively and 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Their results showed that accelerated CXL had a greater impact than conventional CXL on the anterior cornea, whereas transepithelial CXL did not appear to alter corneal morphology.</p><p>Our results show that there is no significant difference in visual acuity, refractive criteria and topographic criteria in keratoconic eyes after 6 months of follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). To date, lots of studies have concluded that conventional (30 min) CXL has a great effect on the progression of keratoconus and it is accepted as a safe and efficient method in the management of keratoconus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results manifested that the accelerated technique did not make significant difference in the improvement of visual acuity, refractive errors and topographic criteria of keratoconic eyes after 6 months of follow-up. Considering that the accelerated method has some advantages like better fluency of work in the ward with shorter duration of surgery, it can be suggested as a better option than the conventional method with the same therapeutic results.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This work accomplished with support of Isfahan University of Medical
