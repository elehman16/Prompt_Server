To bridge these results to human disease, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind phase 1 trial with a well-studied immune modulator, sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). We enrolled 17 age-matched non-Parkinsonian subjects as non-treated controls and 20 Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients. Both Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients and controls were monitored for 2 months for baseline profiling. Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients were then randomized into two equal groups to self-administer placebo (saline) or sargramostim subcutaneously at 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/kg/day for 56 days. Adverse events for the sargramostim and placebo groups were 100% (10/10) and 80% (8/10), respectively. These included injection site reactions, increased total white cell counts, and upper extremity bone pain. One urticarial and one vasculitis reaction were found to be drug and benzyl alcohol related, respectively. An additional patient with a history of cerebrovascular disease suffered a stroke on study. Unified Parkinson&#x02019;s disease rating scale, Part III scores in the sargramostim group showed modest improvement after 6 and 8 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo. This paralleled improved magnetoencephalography-recorded cortical motor activities and Treg numbers and function compared with pretreated Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients and non-Parkinsonian controls. Peripheral Treg transformation was linked to serum tryptophan metabolites, including L-kynurenine, quinolinic acid, and serotonin. These data offer a potential paradigm shift in modulating immune responses for potential therapeutic gain for Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. Confirmation of these early study results requires larger numbers of enrolled patients and further clinical investigation.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Immune modulation: translating the benefits</title><p>The immune system modulating drug sargramostim shows promising results in a small clinical trial with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) patients. Previous studies have shown that sargramostim increases the number of regulatory T cells, attenuates immune responses, and confers neuroprotection in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. To determine whether these findings translate to humans, Howard E. Gendelman at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, USA, and colleagues examined the effects of sargramostim in 20 patients with PD. Despite the high number of mild to moderate reported adverse events, the drug was generally well tolerated and led to an increase in regulatory T cell number and activity. Moreover, preliminary assessments after 6 and 8 weeks of treatment suggested an overall improvement in the motor skills of patients that received the drug compared with those that received a placebo.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>PD, the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, is a progressive and debilitating disease that affects up to 5 million people worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Characteristic movement deficits parallel reductions in striatal dopamine and progressive loss of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons and their striatal connections. To date, therapy is nearly exclusively devoted to symptomatic control of disease manifestations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Considerable research efforts are underway to define disease mechanisms and as such develop novel therapies to affect disease outcomes. Indeed, despite knowledge of disease mechanisms, therapeutic modalities remain palliative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Considerable evidence supports the notion that immune alterations exist in PD. Such alterations can be modulated for &#x0201c;potential&#x0201d; therapeutic benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Mechanisms that could be harnessed for therapeutic gain rest in transforming neurotoxic innate and adaptive immune responses. Indeed, work performed by a number of laboratories have shown that Lewy bodies, containing aggregated and nitrated &#x003b1;-synuclein (N-&#x003b1;-syn), released into the extraneuronal environment induce activated macrophages and microglia and affect the emergence of effector T cell (Teff) populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> In animal models of PD, brain-infiltrating macrophages and microglia produce pro-inflammatory neurotoxins that damage surrounding nigral neurons. Such neurotoxin-producing cells can exacerbate disease outcomes as mediated by peripheral N-&#x003b1;-syn-induced Teff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> In contrast, regulatory T cells (Treg) maintain immunological tolerance, attenuate inflammation, and can positively modify disease at least in PD animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> As neurodestructive Th1 and Th17 cells can be transformed by pharmacological interventions into neuroprotective Treg, a platform has recently come operative to harness immunological responses for therapeutic gain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>
</p><p>Sargramostim (Sanofi US, Bridgewater, NJ) is an Food and Drug Administration-approved human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor known to affect myeloid recovery in patients receiving bone marrow transplantation or cancer therapy along with induction of Treg immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> The latter was shown to protect against nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in rodent PD models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> However, sargramostim administered under regimens to counter myeloablative intervention or as adjunctive neoplastic therapy has mild adverse effects that include increased white blood cell (WBC) counts, injection site reactions, and bone or sternal pain, which may be self-limiting for some within aged populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Despite mild adverse effects of sargramostim, we evaluated an immune-mediated neuroprotective compound as a potential therapy for PD. We found that on the whole sargramostim was well-tolerated, and the adverse effects observed were similar to the effects of this treatment in other patient populations. Our results demonstrated that sargramostim produced the expected immune transformation with the emergence of increased numbers and improved function of Treg. These desired immunological endpoints were confirmed by metabolomic and transcriptomic tests, showing engagement of the serum tryptophan metabolites that included L-kynurenine, quinolinic acid, and serotonin. Although the study was not powered for motor activity efficacy, nor was it long-term, positive effects on some patients' motor skill sets were seen. The results are of potential importance and warrant the consideration of larger-scale investigations. The clinical efficacy endpoints examined remain exploratory in nature and are also dependent on larger-scale monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Demographics and baseline hematologic and immune profiles</title><p>In all, 22 PD patients and 17 non-Parkinsonian subjects were enrolled and assessed for eligibility.

Event-associated severities for all pain sites between groups were not significantly different and ranged from mild and moderate (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Frequencies of patients with pain at sites other than injection sites that included upper and lower torso and extremities were not significantly different between treatment groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.179). Pain severities as scored by the attending physician at injection sites and at sites other than injection sites including the extremities, the lower torso, and the upper torso and included &#x0201c;chest-tightening&#x0201d;, ranged from mild to moderate and were not significantly different between treatment groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Notably, during the 2 months of pre-treatment baseline observations in our study (visits 1&#x02013;3), three patients reported pre-treatment pain (2/10, 20% in the sargramostim group vs. 1/10, 10% in the placebo group) (data not shown), suggesting that reported pain experienced during treatment was distinguishable from those attributable to PD. However, in the context of staggered enrollment and non-significant event frequencies among treatment groups, adverse events were not considered significant enough to break the study blind. The likelihood of a treatment-associated adverse event was greatest in the sargramostim group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) with likelihood scores ranging from possible to probable, while those in the placebo group ranged from unlikely to possible.</p><p>Severe events included a generalized hypersensitivity reaction, a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and a thrombotic stroke; the latter two were deemed unlikely associated with drug. Notably, for the first patient enrolled, sargramostim was formulated with benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Administration of this formulation for 48 days led to the vasculitis, which responded successfully to formulation cessation and steroid treatment with complete symptom resolution. As benzyl alcohol was deemed vasculitis-associated, the preservative was removed from all subsequent preparations without further incidents of vasculitis. The subject who experienced stroke presented a previous history of hypertension and parallel co-morbid vascular events and were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging examination. As there were no contraindications of sargramostim for cerebrovascular disease the subject remained in and completed the study. The four sargramostim-treated patients who withdrew from study included the two subjects with upper torso, bone pain, or chest-tightening (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Extensive work up demonstrated that none of these symptoms were linked to cardiac disease that was the precipitating concern that led to drug cessation decisions. Complete data sets for analysis were obtained for 66 visits by sargramostim-treated patients compared with 77 visits for placebo group. Serum anti-sargramostim antibodies were detected in the drug group by week 4 of treatment (visit 5), but diminished by week 8 (visit 7). Antibody levels were marginal at 4 weeks after drug cessation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sargramostim increases CD4+ Treg subsets and Treg-mediated suppression</title><p>The study yielded expected Treg induction outcomes.

However, while inter-patient variation precluded meaningful statistical analysis of the total UPDRS III scores per visit for each patient, the relative low profiles of scores over visitation from sargramostim-treated patients suggested an overall improvement compared with the placebo group. To confirm that observation, we assessed for each patient, changes from mean baseline score at each visit during pre-treatment (visits 1&#x02013;3), during treatment (visits 4&#x02013;7), and after cessation of treatment (visit 8).

Overall frequencies of patients experiencing adverse events between sargramostim and placebo groups were not significantly different and were confined to increased injection site reactions, increased WBC counts, or upper torso or extremity bone pain; all reported adverse effects to therapy with sargramostim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Mild side effects such as extremity or torso pain representing bone marrow replenishment are associated with these types of constitutional symptoms such as bone and muscle ache or minor pain and are helped by nonsteroidal drugs or acetaminophen. Sternal or non-cardiac chest pain or &#x0201c;chest tightening&#x0201d; was rated as moderate to severe symptoms. These torso and extremity pains described for sargramostim are readily distinguishable from the common types of pain experience by patients with PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Meta-analysis of pain in PD for 18 studies and 15,636 cases revealed a mean prevalence of pain in 58.36% of patients that included a relatively wide variation ranging from 11 to 83%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> The wide variability in prevalence is due, in part, to lack of (1) visibility to the physician, (2) reporting by the patient, (3) treatment priority if reported, and (4) attention to sufficient objective signs that are disregarded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Distribution of pain types in PD includes musculoskeletal pain (48%), dystonic pain (26%), neuropathic pain (13%), and non-localized/central pain (8%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Musculoskeletal pain originates from rigidity or skeletal deformity due to Parkinsonism. Dystonic pain is related to involuntary muscular contractions and is often associated with anti-Parkinsonian medication. Neuropathic pain is thought to be related to the central dopaminergic deficit. Non-localized/central neuropathic pain is a burning pain with spontaneous onset and periods of exacerbation. It is poorly localized and is more intense on the affected side.</p><p>Sargramostim treatment was associated with significantly transformed immune function and sera metabolites. Treatment-associated improvements in UPDRS III scores and cortical motor electrical activities paralleled one another as well as the immune biomarker changes. These findings are supported by a number of prior animal and clinical studies for PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and other neurodegenerative disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Indeed and as in this report, it is now well known that control of pro-inflammatory signals by Tregs is a focus of clinical research activities to develop novel neurotherapeutics for a range of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. By suppression of T cell proliferation and production of a broad range of anti-inflammatory cytokines that includes, for example, interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;, Tregs can in fact ameliorate the pathobiology and clinical signs and symptoms of progressive neuronal degeneration. Moreover an imbalance of effector and regulatory immune cells can affect systemic inflammatory and metabolic processes and predict disease progression. This has been previously uncovered for a spectrum of disorders beyond PD that include Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, stroke, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> Thus, restoring or increasing Treg frequency and enhancing their suppressive activities by immune modulators such as sargramostim is believed to be a novel yet promising approach for treating these disorders.</p><p>For PD, N-&#x003b1;-syn, the dominant protein in dopaminergic neuronal inclusions, induces potent neurotoxic Teffs that can accelerate nigrostriatal degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Transformation of Teff responses by Tregs leads to significant dopaminergic neuronal protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and proportional changes in numbers of interferon-&#x003b3;-producing Th1, IL-4-producing Th2, and CD4+CD25+ T cells are linked to the tempo of disease progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> However, whether sargramostim-induced changes in T cell profiles could affect PD pathobiology remained unknown. This possibility is bolstered by drug correction of PD-associated Treg dysfunction and improved motor task outcomes.</p><p>Parallel observations as shown herein were reported in a spectrum of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Thus for Tregs, defining the tempo, phenotype, and functional role in disease is bolstered by their known abilities to attenuate microglial inflammatory responses and ongoing neurodegeneration. Gene array evaluations showed that sargramostim had multiple effects on peripheral T cells, supporting the idea that an established neuroinflammatory environment was required to affect a regulatory cell profile. This unique idea of cooperative pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory neuroprotection was supported by our metabolomics studies. Here, tryptophan pathway dominance was associated with flow cytometric Treg activity. While 5-hydroxytryptophan is converted to serotonin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> tryptophan is, in parallel, converted to kynurenine by indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and kynurenine is further metabolized to quinolinic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> IDO expression and kynurenine production induce Treg formation. Notably, IDO can be increased by both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> as is seen in Parkinsonian patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>
</p><p>The clinical observations are exploratory in nature in this study with a relatively small sample size and short duration. It does seem clear, however, that sargramostim does not worsen motor function. The suggestion of improved motor function, along with the apparent biomarker responses measured by MEG, is intriguing and will need to be evaluated more fully in larger studies.</p><p>Taken together, our findings show that sargramostim treatment in PD is feasible and reasonably well-tolerated. They support the idea that the effects of sargramostim on T cell polarity change depending on the brain-immune environment. The induction of Tregs, modulation of Teffs, and overall improvement of immune modulatory activities by Tregs is a novel pathway that corrects aberrant immune responses during PD. The therapeutic potential of sargramostim awaits larger confirmatory studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participants and study design</title><p>This single-center, randomized, double-blind, phase 1 clinical trial was performed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), Omaha, NE, USA, to test the safety and tolerability of sargramostim for PD.
