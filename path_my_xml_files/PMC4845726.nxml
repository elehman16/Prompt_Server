particularly affected by the negative health outcomes associated with low health
literacy. Although the literature points to variables such as age, educational
background and language, only a few studies have investigated the factors that
may influence health literacy in this group. Similarly, the role that
bilingualism and/or multilingualism play in health literacy assessment continues
to be an issue in need of further research. The purpose of this study was to
examine the predictors of English health literacy among adult Hispanic
immigrants whose self-reported primary language is Spanish, but who live and
function in a bilingual community. It also explored issues related to the
language of the instrument. An analysis of data collected through a randomized
controlled study was conducted. Results identified English proficiency as the
strongest predictor of health literacy (p &#x0003c; 0.001). The results further
point to the importance of primary and secondary language in the assessment of
heath literacy level. This study raises many questions in need of further
investigation to clarify how language proficiency and sociolinguistic
environment affect health literacy in language minority adults; proposes
language approaches that may be more appropriate for measuring health literacy
in these populations; and recommends further place-based research to determine
whether the connection between language proficiency and health is generalizable
to border communities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) found that Hispanics in
the United States (U.S.) had lower levels of health literacy compared to other
population groups (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">U. S. Department of Education
2006</xref>). However, recent reports and research studies have concluded that
there is a need for more recent and reliable data on health literacy among certain
groups, including Hispanics and Spanish-speaking adults (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Berkman, et al 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Koskan,
Friedman &#x00026; Hilfinger Messias 2010</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas, et al 2015</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas,
Mein, Fuentes, Thatcher &#x00026; Balc&#x000e1;zar 2013</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas, Ji, Fuentes &#x00026; Tinajero 2015</xref>,
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
2010</xref>). The national-level data is more than 10 years old, and there is a
scarcity of current information on the health literacy levels of populations with
limited English language skills (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services 2010</xref>). Although the 2003 NAAL embedded most of
the health-related questions into the main section of the questionnaire, it may not
be an appropriate tool for assessing health literacy among non-English speakers.
First, NAAL measures English oral fluency and &#x0201c;how well Americans perform
tasks with printed materials similar to those they encounter in their daily lives at
work, at home, and in the community,&#x0201d; which may include balancing a
checkbook (quantitative literacy), filling out a job application (document
literacy), or finding information in a news article (prose literacy) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">National Center for Education Statistics [NCES]
n.d.</xref>). Under this framework, English proficiency, or the lack thereof,
becomes a confounding factor in the assessment of health literacy. Similarly, people
who are not originally from the U.S. may find scenarios and tasks portrayed by NAAL
foreign to them, which adds an additional threat to the internal validity of the
instrument.</p><p id="P3">Aside from the data generated by the 2003 NAAL, only regional U.S. studies
have assessed the health literacy level of Hispanics, mostly in clinical settings,
and with conflicting results. Studies in North Carolina, New York, and California
found high prevalence of low health literacy among male and female patients (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Brice, et al 2008</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Garbers, Schmitt, Rappa &#x00026; Chiasson 2010</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Sudore, et al 2009</xref>). To the contrary, a study
with primary care patients on the U.S.-Mexico border found that more than
98% had adequate health literacy (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Penaranda,
Diaz, Noriega &#x00026; Shokar 2012</xref>). A more recent study with Hispanic
college students on the U.S.-Mexico border also found higher levels of health
literacy in this group than in the general Hispanic population, and similar to
educated U.S. adults (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Mas, Jacobson&#x00026; Dong
2014</xref>).</p><p id="P4">There are also inconsistencies across studies in terms of the factors that
have been identified as possibly influencing health literacy among Hispanics. In the
general U.S. population, national data identified gender, age, educational level,
and language as relevant variables affecting health literacy level. The 2003 NAAL
found that women had higher average health literacy than men; adults 65 years-of-age
and older had lower health literacy compared to younger adults; and average health
literacy increased with higher level of educational attainment (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Kutner, Greenberg, Jin&#x00026; Paulsen 2006</xref>).
In the case of Hispanics, however, there are conflicting results due in part to the
fact that these variables have only been explored in small studies with different
demographic groups. One study found that education was a significant predictor of
health literacy but that age, gender, income, and citizenship status were not (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Boyas 2013</xref>). Two recent studies suggested that
education and age may have an effect on health literacy (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Mas, Jacobson &#x00026; Dong 2014</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas, Ji, Fuentes &#x00026; Tinajero 2015</xref>). Although these
discrepancies may be related to the disparate designs, sub-populations and
instruments generally used in studies with Hispanics (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Koskan, Friedman &#x00026; Hilfinger Messias 2010</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas, et al 2015</xref>), there are also relevant conceptual
issues relating to health literacy that must be further explored. For instance,
health literacy has no single, standard definition. At times it is defined as simply
the ability to read and write, and in other cases it is more comprehensively linked
to socio-cultural and political change (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas,
Jacobson, Balc&#x000e1;zar 2015</xref>). Methodological approaches vary
according to the definition used by the study. Similarly, the roles that both
primary (L1) and secondary (L2) language use and proficiency play in health literacy
assessment in bilingual communities has not been researched or discussed in the
literature. In the U.S., this is particularly relevant for Spanish speakers, as more
than 37 million people speak Spanish, and approximately half of them speak English
&#x0201c;less than very well&#x0201d;, with the rest speaking English at varying
levels of proficiency (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Ryan 2013</xref>). In
addition, no research to date has explored the interaction within bilinguals of L1
and L2 languages, and impact on health literacy levels. Future research should
explore the role L1 literacy plays as a predictor variable of L2 health
literacy.</p><p id="P5">Another issue to consider is the fact that health literacy has generally been
defined as the ability to understand <italic>English</italic> health information
(<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Kirsch, Jungeblut, Jenkins &#x00026; Kolstad
1993</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Kutner, Greenberg, Jin&#x00026;
Paulsen 2006</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer
&#x00026; Kindig 2004</xref>), and is a construct that is embedded within the
U.S. healthcare system, which is predominately English-speaking. Studies have found
that even when health literacy assessments are conducted in Spanish, participants
whose L1 is self-reported as Spanish have lower health literacy than L1 English
speakers (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Brice, et al 2008</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Garbers, Schmitt, Rappa &#x00026; Chiasson 2010</xref>,
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sentell &#x00026; Braun 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Williams, Parker &#x00026; Baker 1995</xref>).
Researchers have debated whether or not it is appropriate to measure health literacy
in other than the L1 of the participant, and recommend that studies with Hispanics
control for language use (that is, collect data on the languages used by
participants for different purposes and contexts) and language proficiency (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Koskan, Friedman&#x00026; Hilfinger Messias
2010</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Mas, Jacobson &#x00026; Dong
2014</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas, et al 2015</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas, Ji, Fuentes &#x00026; Tinajero 2015</xref>).
In fact, NAAL includes a questionnaire with items on language background (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">NCES n.d.</xref>). However, these variables are
difficult to control without going beyond self-report on language use and conducting
proficiency testing in the participants' languages. And even if these
variables were controlled, the question still remains as to how the interaction
between two languages in a bilingual individual impacts the results, or, just as
importantly, the interpretation of the results, of commonly used health literacy
assessments, such as the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) and
the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). TOFHLA
measures functional health literacy by assessing numeracy and reading comprehension
using actual health-related materials such as prescription bottle labels and
appointment slips, and is available in both English and Spanish (Peppercorn Books
&#x00026; Press, Inc.). PIAAC assesses literacy by measuring &#x0201c;understanding,
evaluating, using, and engaging with written texts to participate in
society&#x0201d;. Although PIAAC is part of an international program involving more
than 20 countries and is available in multiple languages, it is administered in the
&#x0201c;official language&#x0201d; of each of the participating countries (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
[OECD] 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In the Hispanic communities that exist throughout the U.S. where the majority
of Spanish speakers are bilingual to some degree along a continuum, it is not clear
which health literacy assessment tool should be used. Hispanics in the U.S. cannot
be reduced to such simple categories as "Limited English Proficient"
as is currently the practice: language use among Hispanic groups throughout the U.S.
is complex and dynamic, and requires much deeper exploration in order to better
understand health literacy among these groups. It often is not clear which literacy
tests, the English test or the Spanish test, will provide the most reliable health
literacy score in bilinguals. For example, which test will provide the most reliable
score for a bilingual who speaks Spanish primarily at home, but uses English at
work, or for the bilingual who obtained a high school equivalent education in a
Spanish-speaking country, but has resided in the U.S. for 10 years? There is great
complexity involved in measuring health literacy among bilinguals, leading to other
unexplored questions: does having low health literacy in Spanish constitute low
health literacy in English and vice versa? Does the score on a test of health
literacy in Spanish predict how a person will access or process information in
English in an English-speaking context? In other words, if a person has high health
literacy in Spanish, what does this mean when faced with the challenges of accessing
information in an English-speaking context? These and a myriad others are questions
that have not been addressed in the literature.</p><p id="P7">It is such complexity that justified this study. The purpose was to examine
the predictors of health literacy, assessed in English, among adult Hispanic
immigrants. Variables of age, sex, years living in the U.S., education level,
whether participants attended English classes and school or college in the U.S., and
language history and preferences were included in the analysis. The study involved
immigrants whose L1 is Spanish but who show varying degrees of proficiency in
English. In other words, these immigrants fall along a bilingual continuum,
according to the demographic information provided. Issues related to the language of
the instrument, specifically the significance of the language of the test and the
sociolinguistic environment of the community in which the data were collected are
also explored.</p><p id="P8">This was part of a larger study conducted in a southern city on the
U.S.-Mexico border that assessed the effectiveness of a curriculum in improving
health literacy and English proficiency among Hispanic adults. Information on the
curriculum and the results of the intervention have been reported previously (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas, Mein, Fuentes, Thatcher &#x00026;
Balc&#x000e1;zar 2013</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Soto Mas, Ji,
Fuentes &#x00026; Tinajero 2015</xref>). The study obtained approval by the
Institutional Review Board and all participants signed an informed consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P9">This study involved an analysis of baseline data collected for a randomized
controlled study and included only self-reported immigrants.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Participants</title><p id="P10">Participants were recruited from the community through local Spanish
media. The original inclusion criteria for the larger study included adults (21+
years of age) with Spanish as their L1, able to read and write Spanish, and
self-reported as having no previous participation in a formal
health/cardiovascular education/prevention program. Since the interest of the
study was to assess health literacy in English, only people with a low to
intermediate level of English proficiency -able to read, write and speak English
at a basic level- were included in the study. For this analysis, the number of
eligible cases was adjusted to include only those who were born outside the U.S.
as a means of controlling for immigration status.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Data Collection and Measures</title><p id="P11">Prior to inclusion, all individuals who met the criteria and indicated
interest in participating were screened for English proficiency. The Combined
English Language Skills Assessment (CELSA) (Association of Classroom Teacher
Testers, CA) was used. CELSA is a standard computerized proficiency test that
measures grammatical ability and understanding of meaning in a typical reading
context, and is generally used as a placement test in foreign language programs.
The test is written in English and all instructions are given in English only.
It establishes three levels of language proficiency based on the obtained score:
90&#x02013;102 level 1, 103&#x02013;107 level 2, and 108&#x02013;114 level 3
(<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Thompson 1994</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Health literacy was assessed using the English version of the TOFHLA,
which has proven to be a valid and reliable instrument for testing literacy in a
particular domain (healthcare) in which particular domain-specific documents are
used, including, for example pharmaceutical labels and patient education
materials (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Parker, Baker, Williams &#x00026;
Nurss 1995</xref>). Assessment of health-related reading fluency is
essential because, as a predictor variable, it is more powerful than a measure
of general reading fluency in &#x0201c;detecting associations with health
outcomes&#x0201d; (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Baker, 2006</xref>). In
addition, it is not possible to simply assume a correlation between general
reading fluency and health literacy. TOFHLA classifies participants in three
categories according to their total score: inadequate functional health
literacy, marginal functional health literacy, and adequate functional health
literacy.</p><p id="P13">Participants were also asked to complete a brief bilingual demographic
questionnaire that included questions on: age, sex, years living in the U.S.,
education level, whether they attended English classes and school or college in
the U.S., and language history and preferences (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> below).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Data Analysis</title><p id="P14">Data quality included crosschecking 100% of the cases. Missing
data was minimal. For this study, all analyses were conducted in Stata v13
(StataCorp, 2013) and using complete cases only. The original study included 181
participants. This analysis was conducted with 144 participants after excluding
incomplete cases and those who were born in the U.S. and did not meet the
immigrant criterion (10 cases).</p><p id="P15">Associations between demographic characteristics, English proficiency,
and health literacy were quantified. The continuous outcome measures were total
TOFHLA scores (range 0&#x02013;100), weighted numeracy scores (range
0&#x02013;50), and reading comprehension scores (range 0&#x02013;50). Total
TOFHLA scores were categorized into inadequate functional health literacy (score
0&#x02013;59), marginal functional health literacy (60&#x02013;74), and adequate
functional health literacy (75&#x02013;100).</p><p id="P16">Demographic predictors of interest in the study included all demographic
variables and English proficiency (CELSA score) at baseline. Simple linear
regression models were used to calculate differences in means across levels of
the predictors. For each continuous outcome, changes were estimated as a
function of each predictor, along with confidence intervals. For continuous
predictors, the linear model was compared to models with higher-order polynomial
terms using an F-test. For ordinal categorical variables, the saturated model
was compared to a linear trend model using an F-test. Regression coefficient
F-tests were used to test for differences in the average outcome as a function
of each predictor in the univariate analysis. In a multivariate analysis, a
multiple linear regression model was used to summarize effects of English
proficiency, controlling for the other predictors. Non-significant terms were
dropped from the multiple regression model using a backwards stepwise procedure
with a p-value threshold of 0.1.</p><p id="P17">Differences were examined in the TOFHLA categories across quartiles of
English proficiency scores and testing for an association between the
categorical outcome and quartiles using a Pearson chi-square test. All
hypothesis tests were conducted at the 0.05 level of significance and confidence
intervals at the 95% level.</p><p id="P18">It is important to note that although the original study implemented a
randomized control, pretest and posttest design, this analysis was conducted
only on the baseline data. The aim was to make a prediction, rather than
establishing a causal inference.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S6"><title>Results</title><p id="P19">Demographic characteristics of the sample are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The majority were 31 to 60 years of
age (85%), female (78%), and had been living in the U.S. for eight
or more years (74%). More than 80% graduated from high school or had
a higher degree, and less than 40% attended school/college in the U.S.
Regarding language background and preferences, a high majority spoke Spanish at home
(81%). Descriptive statistics for test scores are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p id="P20">TOFHLA results yielded an overall marginal functional health literacy level
(mean score 63.7), with 51 (35.4%) participants at the inadequate level; 52
(36.1%) at the marginal level, and 41 (28.5%) at the adequate level.
Reading comprehension mean score was higher (33.8) than that for numeracy
(29.9).</p><p id="P21">There was no evidence of non-linearities in the relationship between the
continuous variables (English language proficiency and age) and any of the outcomes.
Therefore, the continuous variables were included as linear terms in the regression
models. The estimated mean test scores, with 95% confidence intervals, as a
function of the predictor variables are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. English proficiency was the strongest predictor of health
literacy scores. The estimated average TOFHLA score increased linearly with English
proficiency score (p &#x0003c; 0.001). As shown, 1 standard deviation increase in
English proficiency resulted in an estimated 10 point increase in TOFHLA score.
There was no evidence of a difference in mean TOFHLA score and any of the other
variables. Numeracy and reading comprehension scores also increased with English
proficiency score. Average reading comprehension score was higher in those with more
than 1 year of English language courses. There was no evidence of differences in
mean reading or numeracy scores across levels of any of the other variables (though
age was almost a statistically significant predictor of numeracy).</p><p id="P22">Results from the multiple linear regression models are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. After implementing the stepwise
selection procedure, age and English proficiency were the only variables retained in
the linear regression models for total TOFHLA score and numeracy score; and English
proficiency was the only variable retained in the model for the reading
comprehension score. The relationship between English proficiency and the three
continuous outcomes, total TOFHLA, weighted numeracy, and reading comprehension,
remained statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.001). After adjusting for English
proficiency score, the magnitudes of the age-total TOFHLA and age-numeracy score
associations increase; specifically, the average numeracy score decreases on average
with age (p = 0.02), resulting in a trend of a decrease in total TOFHLA scores with
age (p = 0.07). There was no evidence of a difference in reading comprehension score
as a function of age.</p><p id="P23">TOFHLA category frequencies as a function of quartiles of English language
score are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>. The same pattern
of monotonic increase in TOFHLA performance as a function of English language score
is evident.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">To our knowledge, this is one of few studies that have explored predictors
of English health literacy specifically among U.S. adult Hispanic immigrant
bilinguals. There is consensus among experts on the need for further research
involving language minorities and exploring the relationship between health literacy
and limited English proficiency (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">McKee &#x00026;
Paasche-Orlow 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sentell &#x00026;
Braun 2012</xref>). Consistent with the literature, the study emphasizes
language history and preferences. The demographic data suggest a continuum of
bilingualism in this sample, as influenced by number of years living in the U.S.;
experience with the U.S. education system; and amount of time in English classes. A
strength of the study was the fact that English proficiency was assessed through a
standard test, rather than self-reported. In addition, by including only
participants born outside of the U.S. it was assumed that participants had a high
proficiency in oral Spanish, although future studies would benefit from also
administering a test in Spanish, as suggested by the varying levels of education in
this sample. Additionally, the study individually explored two key health literacy
domains: reading comprehension and numeracy. Finally, analyses included absolute
TOFHLA score as well as categorical results or health literacy level. It might
appear that using an English instrument would compromise the validity of the test
when administered to Spanish speakers, as is argued in the literature. However, it
is essential to consider that the use of a Spanish instrument would be equally
problematic, unless all of the participants being assessed have no fluency in
English (such as being recent arrivals to the U.S.).</p><p id="P25">Overall, TOFHLA results indicated marginal functional health literacy in
this sample, when measured in English. This result is consistent with existing
national data. The 2003 NAAL found that 66% of Hispanics had
&#x0201c;basic&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;below basic&#x0201d; health literacy (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Kutner, Greenberg, Jin&#x00026; Paulsen 2006</xref>),
and that 13.8% of Medicare managed-care Spanish speaking enrollees had
inadequate health literacy (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Wolf, Gazmararian
&#x00026; Baker 2007</xref>). However, it is important to remember that small
regional and clinical studies with Hispanics have provided inconsistent results,
some finding a high prevalence of limited health literacy (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Brice, et al 2008</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Garbers,

Dong 2014</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Penaranda, Diaz, Noriega

be related to a number of theoretical and methodological issues that must be further
explored, including geographical and sociolinguistic factors.</p><p id="P26">This study identified English proficiency as the strongest predictor of
TOFHLA scores among participants, including numeracy and reading comprehension
scores. Results indicate that time attending English language courses may also
constitute a relevant factor affecting functional English health literacy.
Categorical results confirmed the positive effect of English proficiency on health
literacy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>). These results are
consistent with previous literature emphasizing the importance of English language
proficiency in health literacy (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">McKee &#x00026;
Paasche-Orlow 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Pippins,
Alegr&#x000ed;a &#x00026; Haas 2007</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sentell &#x00026; Braun 2012</xref>). This study also found evidence that
younger participants obtained higher numeracy scores (after adjusting for English
proficiency). Thus, age may be a relevant demographic factor associated with
functional health literacy and numeracy in this population. A previous study with
Hispanics in Arkansas found that age and gender were not significant predictors of
health literacy scores (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Boyas 2013</xref>), however
it is not clear whether that study controlled for immigrant status or proficiency in
English and Spanish.</p><p id="P27">As would be expected, completing the test in a language in which the
participants were not highly proficient seems to have negatively affected the
outcome of the test. The typical argument to recommend testing health literacy in
English is that English is the dominant language in the healthcare system in the
U.S., and that there is therefore a need for the general public to understand
English health information (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Kirsch, Jungeblut,
Jenkins &#x00026; Kolstad 1993</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Kutner,
Greenberg, Jin&#x00026; Paulsen 2006</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer &#x00026; Kindig 2004</xref>). In addition to the
obvious question of whether similar results would have been obtained if the Spanish
TOHFLA had been implemented, it is also important to consider the implications of
marginal health literacy within the sociolinguistic context of metroplexes on the
border such as the one in which the study was conducted. This context provides an
opportunity to call into question the significance of low or marginal health
literacy and Limited English Proficiency (LEP) across subpopulations of
Hispanics.</p><p id="P28">The study was conducted in a U.S.-Mexico border community in which the
language environment and language needs and preferences vary from other non-border
communities. In the city where the study was conducted, more than 80% of the
population is Hispanic/Latino, and more than 71% of the residents speak
Spanish at home (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Census Bureau 2014</xref>).
Daily activities in all social domains are negotiated among individuals who lie
along a broad continuum of Spanish and English bilingualism (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Teschner 1995</xref>). What has not been sufficiently explored in the
literature is whether English proficiency and functional health literacy in English,
as measured using currently available instruments, are essential to obtaining
reliable health information and accessing the health care system in a community in
which most people have learned to navigate a bicultural and bilingual environment
and are familiar with the established health care systems (on both sides of the
border). Although studies have found that LEP constitutes a barrier to health care
and is associated with poorer health status in Hispanics (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Pippins, Alegr&#x000ed;a &#x00026; Haas 2007</xref>), whether this is
true among the border communities of this study and other border communities is an
issue in need of further investigation. It is possible that in communities in which
there is not a pressing need for learning and using English to carry out normal
daily activities, and in which meaning negotiation among bilinguals is the norm,
including within the available health care systems accessed in two countries, the
connection between LEP, low English health literacy and poorer health outcomes is
not as evident. However, it cannot be assumed that health literacy levels have no
impact on health outcomes in this context, either. There is an urgent need for
further research into border bilingual communities, and on how to measure health
literacy within such richly layered social and linguistic contexts. In this
particular border community, for example, the hospital systems lack professional
interpreters and translators, and no research to date has explored how
provider-patient interactions take place; how accessible information is in both
languages; and how individuals with different levels of literacy and bilingualism
navigate the system.</p><p id="P29">In summary, the language of the instrument used to assess health literacy
level; the L1 and L2 proficiency of participants; and the geographic and
sociolinguistic environment are variables that merit further consideration in health
literacy research. Concerning the former, we may accept that, for the most part, the
language of the healthcare system in the U.S. is English and that L1 Spanish
speakers have lower English health literacy than native English speakers (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Sentell &#x00026; Braun 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Williams, Parker &#x00026; Baker 1995</xref>).
However, researchers have also recommended that future research consider whether
differences in health literacy level among U.S. Hispanics is determined by language
use alone or associated with cultural adaptations such as health beliefs and
practices (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Boyas 2013</xref>). We contend here that
geography and sociolinguistic environment must also be integrated into research on
health literacy. In addition, this research must go beyond implementation of health
literacy tests to in-depth sociolinguistic and ethnographic analysis of particular
geographic areas, including within hospital and clinical settings. These
observations may apply globally to other border areas. Additionally, there are some
other relevant global questions related to language acquisition and proficiency that
urgently need to be addressed. First, there is general consensus among language
acquisition researchers that L1 language proficiency directly influences second
language (L2) acquisition. According to Cummins&#x02019; language interdependence
principle, academic aspects of language proficiency, including literacy (reading and
writing) of L1 proficiency, are transferable to L2 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Cummins 1991</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Cummins 2012</xref>). This
suggests that a bilingual person who has high literacy in L1 is likely to perform
better on a test of L2 literacy. Future studies in health literacy should test for
both L1 and L2 proficiency, and collect explicit data on educational attainment in
L1 and L2 in order to explore the complex interdependence of literacies. Only
through such rigorous, in-depth language research will it be possible to fully
understand the significance of the results of literacy tests and the challenges
faced by LEP populations in accessing the healthcare system throughout the U.S.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P30">The results and contribution of the present study must be considered within
its particular design and the characteristics of the participants, as well as the
context in which the study was conducted. For instance, health literacy was assessed
in English and participants included only immigrants whose L1 was Spanish with a
low-to-intermediate level of English. However, the majority had a high school or
higher degree, had lived in the U.S. for eight or more years, and more than half had
taken English classes for more than 1 year. Thus, findings cannot be generalized to
the general Hispanic population: demographic and contextual factors vary according
to sociocultural and geographical context. We reemphasize here that a weakness in
many health literacy studies in general has been a lack of in-depth description of
study populations and settings. Without such description, it is difficult to tease
apart contributors to low health literacy, and to interpret the impact on healthcare
access and outcomes accurately.</p><p id="P31">This was a small exploratory study, and results may only apply to adults
with the same characteristics as those of the study population. The study used a
health literacy definition that includes only functional health literacy. The TOFHLA
was not administered individually, but rather to an entire group. Although the
content of the test was not altered, results may not be comparable to one-on-one
administration. In addition, Spanish proficiency levels were collected through
self-report of language used at home. Finally, only variables that were the focus of
the original study were explored, which were limited. Including other independent
and dependent variables may have yielded additional significant results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P32">The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering both
language context and language use in heath literacy research, particularly in the
interpretation of the results of health literacy assessments. Contextual factors
must be considered in studies looking at the impact of health literacy on health
outcomes, including health access, health quality and health status. This is
especially important in the U.S., considering the growth of the Spanish speaking
population in many communities across the country, particularly along the
U.S.-Mexico border region. Globally, language diversity is facilitated by
globalization, immigration, and displacement of people. Language use is a contextual
factor that may influence health care and health outcomes, and assessing L1 and L2
proficiency should become the norm in heath literacy studies with language
minorities. Health literacy research must further explore the role of bilingualism
in health literacy among Hispanics, and clarify the factors that must be considered
when measuring health literacy in this group This study raises many questions in
need of further investigation to clarify how language proficiency and
sociolinguistic environment affect health literacy in language minority adults;
proposes language approaches that may be more appropriate for measuring health
literacy in these populations; and recommends further place-based research to
determine whether the connection between language proficiency and health is
generalizable to border communities.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S10"><p id="P33">This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,
