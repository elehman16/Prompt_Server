Surgery is proven to be the most effective treatment in early stages, despite its potential impact on quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation, either before or after surgery, is associated with reduced morbidity related symptoms and improved exercise capacity, lung function and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We describe the study protocol for the open-label randomized controlled trial we are conducting on patients affected by primary lung cancer (stages I-II) eligible for surgical treatment. The control group receives standard care consisting in one educational session before surgery and early inpatient postoperative physiotherapy. The treatment group receives, in addition to standard care, intensive rehabilitation involving 14 preoperative sessions (6 outpatient and 8 home-based) and 39 postoperative sessions (15 outpatient and 24 home-based) with aerobic, resistance and respiratory training, as well as scar massage and group bodyweight exercise training.</p><p id="Par3">Assessments are performed at baseline, the day before surgery and one month and six months after surgery. The main outcome is the long-term exercise capacity measured with the Six-Minute Walk Test; short-term exercise capacity, lung function, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay, quality of life (Short Form 12), mood disturbances (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and pain (Numeric Rating Scale) are also recorded and analysed. Patient compliance and treatment-related side effects are also collected. Statistical analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat approach. T-test for independent samples will be used for continuous variables after assessment of normality of distribution. Chi-square test will be used for categorical variables. Expecting a 10% dropout rate, assuming &#x003b1; of 5% and power of 80%, we planned to enrol 140 patients to demonstrate a statistically significant difference of 25&#x000a0;m at Six-Minute Walk Test.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">Pulmonary Resection and Intensive Rehabilitation study (PuReAIR) will contribute significantly in investigating the effects of perioperative rehabilitation on exercise capacity, symptoms, lung function and long-term outcomes in surgically treated lung cancer patients.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent type of all lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], with surgical resection appearing to be the most effective treatment in early stages (Stages I and II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Although surgical resection results in higher survival rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], it is associated with significant morbidity, functional limitations and decreased quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Long-term physical impairment is an important and undesirable consequence of surgery, limiting patients&#x02019; recovery to a greater extent than do other severe pulmonary complications, such as atelectasis, dyspnoea and pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is frequent in lung cancer patients and is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Recent studies suggest that perioperative pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programmes including exercise may improve exercise capacity, functional performance and QoL, both pre- and postoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">PR is a comprehensive intervention that includes exercise training (endurance and resistance), education and behaviour changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. PR is also part of the new integrated pathways for enhanced recovery, where it has shown to improve patient satisfaction and to reduce in-hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Surgical candidates seem to benefit from preoperative PR. In COPD patients, preoperative PR is correlated with improvement in functional parameters, which in turn may increase resection rate and allow more extensive lung resections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">It is well known that exercise training is associated with significant increase in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which has been confirmed as a strong independent predictor of perioperative or postoperative complications and overall long-term survival for individuals with NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Indeed, patients with reduced exercise tolerance and low VO2peak show poorer thoracic surgical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, preoperative PR could reduce symptoms and morbidity, shorten hospital stay and lower healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Concerning postoperative PR, recent literature supports improvement in exercise capacity through physical training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], whereas there is not sufficient evidence supporting meaningful clinical changes in lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The effectiveness of postoperative PR on QoL is still controversial, although some studies suggest that exercise training could be advantageous for some domains of QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Both pre- and postoperative PR tailored to lung cancer patients has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], although research conducted in this field presents dissimilarities concerning type of intervention, intensity, setting and timing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">An updated, extensive literature review on perioperative physical exercise interventions was conducted by our group to establish the most updated and evidence-based interventions for patients undergoing surgery for NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Based on its results, the best available evidence supports the inclusion of high intensity aerobic training for upper and lower limbs (primarily cycling and/or walking) and respiratory exercise (primarily inspiratory muscle training) in the perioperative period. Postoperative programmes should also include strength training and balance training. Therapeutic interventions can be conducted in both outpatient and home-based settings. Although this review focused on the exercise components of rehabilitation, most treatment protocols also include routine physiotherapy with dyspnoea management and airway clearance techniques. With regards to the length of interventions, while the duration of the preoperative phase is strictly determined by the time of elective surgery, postoperative intervention ranges from 6 to 20&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p id="Par41">In summary, systematic reviews conducted in this field advocate the value of both pre- and postoperative PR programmes, with aerobic training as the most relevant component. However, this literature demonstrates that primary research validity has been limited by poor methodological quality and small and heterogeneous samples of clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Moreover, this study design was powered according to an a priori specified hypothesis of superiority of intensive PR compared to SC.</p><p id="Par120">The intervention of any trial should always be based on the best available evidence and described in sufficient detail to be reproducible. The study protocol provides a detailed description of the interventions delivered; this is particularly important in trials focusing on complex interventions, as is the case in rehabilitation. In fact, a comprehensive description of both standard care and additional treatments allows an accurate interpretation of the conclusions and ensures the correct replication of the protocol described, if appropriate, in order to compare results.</p><p id="Par121">The definition of the best PR treatment programme required a careful review of the current literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], resulting in the definition of the following key elements:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par122">The inclusion of both aerobic and strength training of lower and upper limb muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par123">The combination of outpatient and home-based treatment sessions.

</p><p id="Par127">At the time of planning this protocol, we estimated an overall 10% withdrawal rate, mainly due to perioperative morbidity and mortality, as well as unforeseen N1/N2 lymph nodal involvement diagnosed after surgery and requiring adjuvant therapies. However, more recent literature suggests a greater incidence of intraoperative lymph nodal upstaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and even when an accurate staging workup is performed, including PET/CT and EBUS-TBNA when appropriate, minimal involvement of hilar nodes (N1 stage) remains difficult to assess preoperatively. Furthermore, more aggressive protocols are recommended by international guidelines in treating N1 NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A greater than expected number of patients may therefore withdraw post randomization to ensure they receive the best cancer care.</p><p id="Par128">In addition, because preoperative diagnosis may not always be obtained and, whenever possible, it seems to be a significant barrier to trial enrolment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], we chose to include patients without proven cancer histology, providing that the clinical evaluation is consistent with malignancy (PET positivity, history of smoking, radiological features of malignancy, absence of concomitant extra-thoracic malignancies).</p><p id="Par129">The exclusion of patients undergoing adjuvant therapies might represent a limit of this study, because it leads to a further selection of patients that could impact reproducibility in the future. However, in patients with lung cancer little is known about feasibility of physical exercise during chemo or radiotherapy, whose side effects might offset the potential benefits of PR. Thus, we chose to sacrifice broader inclusion criteria to find reliable answers, first and foremost, in the population that could most benefit from PR.</p><p id="Par130">We emphasize the need for a timely delivery of preoperative PR to comply with the regional guidelines, which recommend starting cancer treatments within 30&#x000a0;days from referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. If the results of this study show a clear benefit of intensive PR in patients with lung cancer, especially in improving QoL, a future trial on combined PR and non-radical treatments to extend the benefit of improved functioning to patients with advanced disease may be warranted. Likewise, the use of preoperative PR, if beneficial, will need to be evaluated in patients with severe COPD to increase the rate of lung resection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par131">Due to the growing interest in perioperative PR, we are confident that PuReAIR will contribute significantly to providing reliable recommendations for systematic application of PR to patients undergoing surgery for early stage lung cancer. Moreover, the hybrid intervention adopted (inpatient-outpatient and home-based, group and individual sessions) could facilitate adherence to the protocol, which is determined by a combination of personal and health-related factors and might be pivotal in the rehabilitation of individuals with NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The results of PuReAIR will be disseminated and will help healthcare professionals in implementing effective and affordable strategies to improve the care of cancer patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>6MWD</term><def><p id="Par6">distance walked in six minutes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>6MWT</term><def><p id="Par7">Six-Minute Walk Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASMN</term><def><p id="Par8">Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p id="Par9">Control Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p id="Par10">Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p id="Par11">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DLCO</term><def><p id="Par12">Diffusing Lung capacity for Carbon monoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EBUS-TBNA</term><def><p id="Par13">Endobronchial Ultrasound Transbronchial Needle Aspiration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV1</term><def><p id="Par14">Forced Expiratory Volume in 1&#x000a0;s</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FVC</term><def><p id="Par15">Forced Vital Capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS</term><def><p id="Par16">Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IG</term><def><p id="Par17">Intervention Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LoS</term><def><p id="Par18">Length of hospital Stay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p id="Par19">Numeric Rating Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSCLC</term><def><p id="Par20">Non-small cell lung cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEP</term><def><p id="Par21">Positive Expiratory Pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PET/CT</term><def><p id="Par22">Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFTs</term><def><p id="Par23">Pulmonary Function Tests</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PR</term><def><p id="Par24">Pulmonary Rehabilitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PuReAIR</term><def><p id="Par25">Pulmonary Resection and Intensive Rehabilitation study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p id="Par26">Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMT</term><def><p id="Par27">Respiratory Muscle Training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p id="Par28">Standard Care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-12</term><def><p id="Par29">Short form 12</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VO2peak</term><def><p id="Par30">peak oxygen consumption</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Dr. Claudio Tedeschi (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Unit at Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia), Dr.ssa Debora Formisano (Research and Statistics Unit at Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy) for support in the planning phase of the study.</p><p>Dr. Virginia Dolcini, Dott.ssa Sabrina Grossi (Grant Office at Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova, Reggio Emilia) for support in submitting the protocol for funding.</p><p>Dr. Jacqueline Costa for professional writing revision.</p><sec id="FPar4"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par132">This research study was supported by Italian Ministry of Health, which we would like to thank for funding the project &#x0201c;Effects of early pulmonary rehabilitation and long-term exercise on lung function, quality of life and postoperative outcome in lung cancer patients.&#x0201d; (Project Code: GR-2011-02351711), in the Bando Ricerca Finalizzata e Giovani Ricercatori 2011/2012.
