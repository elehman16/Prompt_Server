Almost all Danes (98%) are listed with a general practice.

No designated health professional overlooked the coordination of health services for this group and they did not receive telephone calls to systematically assess their well-being and the coordination and continuity of their care. In accordance with a paragraph in the Danish Health Act,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> all control group patients were given the name and a phone number on an employee at Department P to grant them easy access to the department during the treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>CM intervention</title><p>The main aims of the CM intervention, which was conducted supplementary to usual care, were to streamline individual patients&#x02019; care pathways and improve their well-being and experiences of care. Two experienced nurses were employed from January 2009 to May 2011 to work principally as case managers. They initially went through 2&#x02005;months of combined additional training and pilot testing of the manual-based CM intervention and its appertaining checklists. The case managers had their office at Department P, worked daytime and weekdays only, were introduced as members of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and they attended all MDT meetings where most patients had their cancer staged and treatment options discussed.</p><p>A detailed manual, which was pilot tested before the trial, chronologically described the case managers&#x02019; duties. As soon as possible after randomisation, the case manager scheduled a meeting with the patient to provide detailed information about the CM services and availability. In addition, the case manager made a formal assessment of the patient's medical and non-medical condition, his or her expectations regarding care, and his or her knowledge about the disease and care. An ad hoc developed needs assessment checklist was used to guide the conversation.</p><p>Throughout the period of treatment, the case manager regularly (&#x0223c;every fortnight) telephoned the patient to assess his or her biopsychosocial status and screen for barriers to optimal care related to coordination and awareness of the care plan. Potential inadequacies were addressed by involving relevant health professionals and by increasing the frequency of outreach telephone calls.</p><p>Patient-specific information was passed on to the GP and other relevant health professionals initially and at transitions between care settings.</p><p>Most patients met the case manager at their first meeting in the outpatient clinic which took place a few days after the patient's primary colonoscopy or for patients referred from another CRC specialist to Department P at the patient's first encounter in the Department. The duration of active CM varied between patients but did not terminate before 4&#x02005;weeks after the patient had completed planned CRC treatment. There was no formal time at which patients could no longer exercise their option to contact the case manager by telephone.</p><p>Online supplementary figure S1 provides an overview of the CM intervention and the usual care in a Pat plot(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001481F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> The CM intervention was pragmatically designed and operationalised the case manager's function as described in the Danish Generic Model for Care Pathway Programmes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> The CM intervention and the methods and feasibility of the trial have been described in detail elsewhere (paper submitted to BMC Health Services Research 9 December 2011).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2012001481F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Overview of the interventions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2012001481f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>HRQoL was assessed with the use of the Danish version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire V.3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30), which is a validated, cancer-specific, 30-item questionnaire measuring HRQoL on: one global health status scale, five functioning scales and nine symptom scales.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>

Analyses were accompanied by graphical presentations of the groups&#x02019; mean scores stratified by the patients&#x02019; last consecutive questionnaire response.

functioning as assessed from the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Patients of the CM group answered almost all (23 of 24) patient evaluation items more positively than the control group patients. The items regarding &#x02018;the experience of being continuously followed by a doctor or a nurse&#x02019;, and &#x02018;confident about going home after surgery&#x02019; seemed, in particular, to be more positively evaluated by CM patients than by the control group. We found no statistical indication that any subgroup (gender, age or cancer type) benefited differently from CM.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>The principal strength of this study was the comprehensive, manual-based CM intervention performed in the RCT design. A statement of the case managers&#x02019; activities from the CM records and a debriefing of the case managers indicated that the CM intervention was conducted according to the manual (reported in a paper submitted to another journal).</p><p>Another strength was the use of the EORTC QLQ-C30, which is the most used validated HRQoL instruments in CRC settings and available in Danish. EORTC QLQ-C30 focuses on domains relevant to most cancer patients and minimally clinically relevant cross-sectional contrasts have been proposed to guide the interpretation of findings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> In this study, all the confidence limits of the difference estimates were within &#x000b1;10 units (after round off). We are therefore convinced that we do not reject a clinically significant effect of CM.</p><p>Patient evaluations were assessed using ad hoc items which may be a potential weakness compared with instruments with established measurement properties and &#x02018;benchmark scores&#x02019;. The use of ad hoc items was deemed necessary because existing relevant measures were found to focus on either the inpatient or the outpatient setting and not on care across care interfaces. We argue that it is acceptable to analyse non-validated items in a trial as long as items are presented by their exact wording and analyses are conducted item by item.</p><p>This RCT was implemented with randomisation at the patient level and with both patient groups being treated at the same department at the same time. We acknowledge that an intervention based on visibility and communication would have been more validly tested in a cluster-randomised trial with randomisation performed at department or hospital level. Anyway, the success of a cluster randomised trial relies on its inclusion of several treatment units which was hindered by our budget.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> The two main limitations caused by the single unit set-up were: (1) patient evaluations might have suffered from information bias because patients had information about the purpose of the trial and they were unblinded to group assignment. To reduce information bias caused by patients&#x02019; experience of &#x02018;losing&#x02019; or &#x02018;winning&#x02019; the randomisation procedure, patients were neutrally informed about the purpose of the trial at recruitment. In addition, we believe patients over time &#x02018;forgot&#x02019; about taking part in a randomised study for which reason the patient evaluations were unaffected by information bias. (2) The usual staff noticed &#x02018;effective&#x02019; CM actions which they tried to &#x02018;copy&#x02019; to improve control group patients&#x02019; care (spill-over effect). It is very unlikely that control group patients had ongoing support and supervision, because this would require organisational restructuring (eg, revised work plans) or extra manpower, which did not take place.</p><p>A known problem when assessing patient-reported outcomes is missing data and, as for HRQoL-data, non-random dropout<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> due to deaths. Importantly, although more CM patients than control group patients were dead at 52&#x02005;weeks, online supplementary figure S3 does not indicate that we have overlooked a positive effect of CM on the global health status, physical functioning or the role functioning subscales due to non-random drop-out. On the other hand, the emotional functioning, cognitive functioning and social functioning differences might have been biased favouring the control group as a consequence of excess deaths in the CM group. Thus, online supplementary figure S3 insinuates that the CM patients who withdrew between weeks 30 and 52 might already have experienced diminishing functioning on these scales at 30&#x02005;weeks.</p><p>Although the baseline questionnaire was returned before the concealed randomisation, CM patients had higher mean baseline scores on five of the six EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales than the control group patients. Importantly, ANCOVA appropriately handles such &#x02018;by chance problem&#x02019; without introducing bias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></p><p>Despite multiple comparisons, p&#x02264;0.05 was generally used as the level of statistical significance. Importantly, even if we had adjusted the p values to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons we would still report the tendency towards improved patient evaluations in the CM group.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Generalisability</title><p>Non-participants and participants differed in terms of cancer type and age. The group of CM participants counted statistically more rectal cancer patients than the usual care group and they were slightly, but statistically, significantly older. The primary reason for this was that another study included patients suffering from primary non-metastatic rectal cancer, who we thus could not include.</p><p>The results can be generalised to a wider group of cancer patients, primarily for two reasons: (1) interaction analyses indicated that no particular subgroup (gender, age or cancer type) benefited from CM and (2) previous research has shown that patients suffering from different cancer types face identical psychosocial problems and healthcare system-related barriers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Comparisons with other studies and meaning of the study</title><p>The present study found that CM improved patient evaluations of care even if attrition over time reduced the power of the analyses. Improved patient evaluations have also been reported in other CM RCTs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> The consistent finding of improved patient evaluations despite the use of different measures is important because patient evaluations may be seen as a quality criterion at par with &#x02018;technical quality&#x02019; and objective outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> Observational and qualitative studies including CRC patients have found that patients&#x02019; care evaluations correlate positively with their HRQoL.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Anyway, based on the &#x02018;neutral findings&#x02019; in present and previous CM trials,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> one may speculate whether it is possible for case managers to improve cancer patients&#x02019; HRQoL during the treatment phase. One explanation may be that CM does not alleviate the impact of cancer symptoms, adverse treatment effects and the existential concerns on patients&#x02019; HRQoL. Another plausible explanation is poor responsiveness of the existing HRQoL instruments in the &#x02018;new&#x02019; settings they have been applied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> Retrospectively, we regret that we did not consider including an anchor item in our questionnaire for the purpose of responsiveness analyses of the EORTC QLQ-C30 in the setting and context of present trial.</p></sec><sec id="s5e"><title>Unanswered questions and future research</title><p>This CM study focused on patient-reported outcomes. CM may also be implemented to reduce the amount of &#x02018;inappropriate&#x02019; healthcare services (duplicated services, unplanned readmissions and out-of-hours services) or if it enhances information transfer and professional collaboration around the patient. Yet, these issues remain to be explored.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this RCT of CRC patients undergoing treatment, we found no impact of hospital-based CM on patients&#x02019; HRQoL at week 8, 30 or 52 after inclusion, but several patient evaluation items were statistically significantly improved by CM, and a tendency towards better patient evaluations in the CM group than in the usual care group was observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e144" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001481.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e145" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001481.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank all patients and the staff at Surgical Department P, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark and all the GPs who filled in the questionnaires.
