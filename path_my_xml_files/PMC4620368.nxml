Uncontrolled CINV may limit the dose intensity of chemotherapy and seriously compromise the patient's quality of life.</p><p>The objective of antiemetic therapy is to completely prevent CINV, which is achievable in the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. Three categories of drugs with the highest therapeutic index for CINV management include: (1) three 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonists (palonosetron and granisetron), (2) neurokirin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists (aprepitant), and (3) glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The administration of three antiemetic agents is recommended in patients treated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) according to the updated antiemetic guidelines of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) as well as the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and guidelines published by the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology (JSCO) in 2010 [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, during treatment with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), the administration of two antiemetic drugs, a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone, is recommended, with the additional administration of aprepitant as a recommended option [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The CINV risk also depends on patient characteristics, such as gender, age, and history of alcohol consumption. It has been reported that female patients are at greater risk of CINV [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Gynecological oncologists are tasked with treating female patients at greater risk of CINV than males. The most frequently used chemotherapy regimen in patients with gynecological malignancy is the TC regimen (paclitaxel and carboplatin) of MEC [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In female patients, this regimen is expected to be associated with a greater frequency of CINV, even in those receiving MEC, in comparison with that generally reported in male patients. Although there are some reports of the efficacy of antiemetic agents in patients treated with MEC [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], there are no reports assessing female patients at greater risk of emesis. Moreover, in patients receiving HEC, palonosetron has been reported to be more effective than granisetron as a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although various reports exist about HEC, there is currently no research regarding differences in the efficacy of the two 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists palonosetron and granisetron in female patients administered the MEC regimen.</p><p>Therefore, we examined differences in the efficacy of two 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists, palonosetron and granisetron, in combination with the TC regimen of MEC in patients with gynecological malignancies. In addition, we examined the efficacy of additional treatment with aprepitant in these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>1. Study population</title><p>Female patients older than 20 years of age with histologically confirmed gynecological cancer (ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, endometrial cancer, and cervical cancer) scheduled to receive a TC regimen (with two intravenous cytotoxic antitumor drugs: paclitaxel, 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and carboplatin, area under the curve 5 mg/min/mL, on day 1) were eligible for inclusion in this study. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled in this study between January 2011 and January 2012. The clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Eligible patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 in addition to meeting the following laboratory criteria: aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels &#x02264;2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range at the facility; a total bilirubin level &#x02264;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range at the facility; and a creatinine level &#x02264;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range at the facility. We also excluded patients with a history of a hypersensitivity to 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists or dexamethasone and those with a risk of vomiting for other reasons (symptomatic brain metastasis, active peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal obstruction, and so on). Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to study entry.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Study design</title><p>This investigation was a prospective, stratified randomization, non-blinded, crossover comparative study. This study was conducted at Osaka Medical College between January 2011 and January 2012 after obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB No. 0860). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> shows the crossover design of the study. For the first and second cycles of chemotherapy, all patients were administered three antiemetic agents: a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist (palonosetron or granisetron), a NK-1 receptor antagonist (aprepitant) and dexamethasone. The dose of each drug according to the study group is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. The group assignment was performed by simple randomization using a table of random numbers and patients were informed of which group (arm A or B) they were assigned. Both groups of patients received three daily oral doses of aprepitant and dexamethasone. On day 1, the patients in arm A received a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and the patients in arm B received a single dose of granisetron. For the second cycle, as in the first cycle, the patients in both arms received three daily oral doses of aprepitant and dexamethasone. In addition, the patients in arm A received granisetron and the patients in arm B received palonosetron as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. This research involved a crossover study in which two different drugs were administered to the same patient. In the third cycle, the patients were given a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone as antiemetic treatment according to the antiemetic guidelines of the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology. However, in the present study, the patients who experienced strong nausea or high levels of anxiety in the previous cycles were given aprepitant with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone in the 3rd cycle. The clinical characteristics of the patients in the third cycle (with or without aprepitant) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Study objectives</title><p>The first objective of this study was to demonstrate noninferiority between the two 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists, granisetron and palonosetron, in combination with three antiemetic agents in the acute and delayed phases in terms of a complete response (CR; no emesis or need for rescue medications). The second objective was to show non-inferiority between the two 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists in terms of changes in the level of dietary intake. Finally, in the sub-analysis conducted during the third cycle, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of an additional dose of aprepitant in terms of the rate of CR and changes in dietary intake.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Efficacy parameters</title><p>Efficacy was monitored via clinical evaluations and patient diaries regarding emesis from the first to the third cycles. From the start of chemotherapy (day 1) and for seven days, the patients' diaries were used to document the date of emetic episodes, use of rescue medications and changes in dietary intake, as well as daily nausea ratings (based on grading according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE). The patients were allowed to take rescue therapy for nausea or vomiting as needed throughout the study period.</p><p>All efficacy analyses started with the TC regimen (day 1) and continued through the subsequent seven days. The primary endpoint was the CR rate during the acute (day 1, 0-24 hours) and delayed periods (day 2-7). The secondary endpoint was the change in dietary intake in both the acute and delayed periods.</p></sec><sec><title>5. Statistical analysis</title><p>All of the statistical analyses were performed using the JMP Pro 11 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Fisher exact test was used for comparisons of the CR rate between groups, and the chi-square test was used to assess the changes in level of dietary intake. Differences in efficacy parameters were determined to be significant at p-values of 0.05 using two-sided tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 38 female patients with gynecological cancer receiving the TC regimen (paclitaxel and carboplatin) were enrolled. The intent-to-treat population included 19 patients who received palonosetron on day 1 (Arm A) and 19 patients who received granisetron on day 1 (Arm B).</p><sec><title>1. Complete response</title><p>In the first and second cycles, during the acute phase, the CR rate was 89.5% among the patients who received palonosetron and 86.8% among the patients who received granisetron, with a non-significant difference between the two groups (p=0.87). During the delayed phase, the CR rate was 60.5% among the patients who received palonosetron and 65.8% among the patients who received granisetron, with no significant differences (p=0.79) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2. Changes in the level of dietary intake</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> shows the percentage of patients classified according to the grade (based on the CTCAE grading) of changes in the level of dietary intake. We compared the percentage of patients with grade 0 or 1 and found the reduction in the level of dietary intake to be lower. During the acute phase, the percentage of patients with grade 0 or 1 was 92.1% among those who received palonosetron and 89.4% among those who received granisetron, with a non-significant difference between the two groups (p=0.19). During the delayed phase, the percentage of patients with grade 0 or 1 was 63.5% of the subjects who received palonosetron and 65.7% of those who received granisetron, with no significant differences (p=0.14). With respect to the combination of the addition of aprepitant therapy with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone, there were no clinically relevant differences between the patients who received palonosetron and granisetron.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Efficacy of an additional dose of aprepitant</title><p>In this study, during the third cycle of TC administration, the antiemetic regimen consisted of a combination of two antiemetic drugs, a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone, without aprepitant, according to the guidelines [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, aprepitant was also given during this cycle to patients exhibiting a remarkable loss of dietary intake during the first two cycles and those with strong anxiety regarding the potential for nausea and vomiting in the next cycle.</p><p>The results of the comparison of the groups who received a combination of the addition of aprepitant therapy with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone (n=23; three drugs group) or a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist with dexamethasone (n=15; two drugs group) as chemotherapy in the third cycle are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. There were no significant differences in the CR rate between the three drugs group and the two drugs group in the acute phase (86.7% to 82.6%, p=0.61). However, in the delayed phase, when aprepitant was added, the CR rate rose in comparison with that observed in the two drugs group (93.3% to 47.8%, p&#x0003c;0.001). Similarly, there were no significant differences in the effect in suppressing nausea between the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists (palonosetron or granisetron) when administered in the two drugs group. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the level of dietary intake between the subjects who received palonosetron and granisetron in either the acute or delayed period.</p><p>Moreover, the level of dietary intake in the delayed phase was significantly better in the group treated with the addition of aprepitant therapy with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist (palonosetron or granisetron) and dexamethasone than those treated with the combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist with dexamethasone (93.3% to 56.5%, p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>CINV is a complex phenomenon consisting of both acute (0-24 hours) and delayed (24-120 hours) components that may have different physiological mechanisms [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Effective antiemetic regimens for highly and MEC have historically been based on the combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone. This combination is highly effective for controlling acute emesis, but less so for delayed emesis, and the contribution of a first-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist to the management of delayed emesis has been questioned. The properties of palonosetron, a second-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, include a prolonged half-life of approximately 40 hours and effects on receptor internalization. These properties underlie the effectiveness of this drug in the management of delayed nausea and vomiting. In a recently reported double-blind randomized phase III trial of patients undergoing HEC, a 3-day treatment regimen consisting of palonosetron on day 1 and dexamethasone on days 1-3 provided complete protection against delayed CINV, the effects of which were superior to those of a single dose of granisetron on day 1 plus dexamethasone on days 1-3 [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the present study, we used different 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists in the first and second cycles because we wanted to confirm the different effects of palonosetron and granisetron in the same individuals. The number of CR rates during the acute and delayed phase who received palonosetron in TC regimen was not significantly different compared with the patients received granisetron in this study. Ohzawa et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] also reported that there were no significant differences in the incidence of CINV in breast cancer patients who received palonosetron and granisetron. It might be that the treatment with the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists and dexamethasone cannot prevent CINV in female patients who undergo MEC regimens such as the TC regimen. With respect to MEC regimens, recent guidelines, such as the MASCC antiemesis tool (MAT), ASCO guidelines for antiemesis and JSCO guidelines for antiemesis, generally recommend the use of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone with or without the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Aprepitant enhances the ability to prevent CINV in patients receiving HEC, such as that involving cisplatin. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the use of aprepitant is recommended only in select patients receiving MEC, although the characteristics of these select patients are unclear. However, no clinical study has evaluated whether palonosetron or aprepiant is the best antiemetic therapy for MEC.</p><p>In general, as to the risk profile for CINV, age, gender and the medication history of past chemotherapy regimens have been mentioned [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The rate of a CR in patients treated with a combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone without aprepitant, in the delayed period after MEC has been reported to be approximately 80% [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, in the present study, the administration of the TC regimen in patients with gynecological malignancies receiving a combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone resulted in a lower antiemetic response in the delayed period, with a CR rate of approximately 48% and a decrease in the level of dietary intake of approximately 50%. Molassiotis et al. [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that gender in particular is an important risk factor for CINV. Nearly half of the female patients &#x0003c;70 years who mainly received a carboplatin-based MEC experienced vomiting or used a rescue medication after the administration of MEC despite receiving granisetron and dexamethasone treatment [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These results suggest that female patients are at greater risk of CINV. In this study, the efficacy of an additional dose of aprepitant for MEC was confirmed; an antiemetic response of approximately 90% was observed following the additional administration of aprepitant with the TC regimen among the patients with gynecological malignancies. These results suggest that positive supportive care is required for antiemesis when administering chemotherapy in female patients, who are higher risk of CINV, even when receiving MEC. The major limitation associated with the present study is the small sample size. Large-scale randomized crossover clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of the addition of aprepitant therapy with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist (palonosetron or granisetron) and dexamethasone in comparison to treatment with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist (palonosetron or granisetron) and dexamethasone without the addition of aprepitant during the first and second cycles of a MEC such as the TC regimen.</p><p>In conclusion, using a combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone with aprepitant, the CR rate and level of dietary intake in both the acute and delayed phases were more effective compared with that achieved with a combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist with dexamethasone. Therefore, in order to maintain the patient's quality of life, we suggest that, when providing the TC regimen to patients with gynecological malignant cancer, it is necessary to take into consideration the addition of aprepitant therapy with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist (palonosetron or granisetron) and dexamethasone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a JSPS KAKENHI Grant, Number 25462621 (to Y.
