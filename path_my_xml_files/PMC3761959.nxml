Breast milk when available is always the best especially during the 1<sup>st</sup> week of life. However, in cases when human breast milk is not available or is inadequate, choosing the next best substitute formula that would be well tolerated could prove to be trying.</p><p>It had been a standard practice worldwide to use the liquid or ready to feed milk formulas. This was brought about by the many reported outbreaks of neonatal sepsis, gastroenteritis, and Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) due to the bacterial contamination of powdered formulas during preparation in hospitals or Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) settings in developed countries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] But is the liquid formula really the right choice for supplementing breast milk in feeding these high risk neonates?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Single-center prospective, randomized and controlled, double blinded pilot study which was conducted from July, 2010 to December, 2011 in a University Hospital in Ankara, Turkey.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Population</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion</title><p>Preterm infants (gestational age less than 37 weeks) admitted to NICU after birth and for whom at least 75% of daily enteral nutrition volume was supplied as preterm infant formula from the first day of life because of complete absence or inadequate amount of maternal breast milk.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Exclusion</title><p>

Forty four of those who completed the study received powdered formula whereas 34 were assigned to the liquid formula group. The mean birth weight was 1,800 g. There were no differences in baseline characteristics, risk factors and presence of neonatal morbidities in both groups.</p><p>The incidence of feeding intolerance was significantly higher in infants fed with liquid formula (<italic>n</italic>=34) when compared with infants fed with powdered formula (<italic>n</italic>=44) (9 (26.5%) vs. 2 (4.5%), <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, respectively). The median fasting gastric fluid pH was significantly lower and postprandial gastric fluid pH was significantly higher than in infants fed with powdered formula (2.9 vs. 3.4, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 and 6.0 vs. 5.9, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 respectively). Infants fed with liquid formula regained birth weight significantly later than infants fed with powdered formula (9.5 vs. 8.0 days, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of gastrointestinal problems and findings in preterm infants who were fed with powdered or liquid formula</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCN-2-11-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This is the first randomized controlled, double blinded, pilot study that had shown an increased incidence and delayed growth in preterm infants fed with liquid or ready to feed formula when compared with powdered infant formula of the same brand. Increased incidence of FI and delayed growth in the 1<sup>st</sup> weeks of life in preterm infants fed with liquid formula might be caused by altered gastric acidity or possible disrupted protein bioavailability due to different production and sterilization processes.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>COMMENTARY</title><p>Although, the study idea is unique and well thought of, several issues and questions could have been raised. It's not clear why there is a 10 patients&#x02019; difference in the numbers of intervention and control groups. Feeding intolerance is a prominent feature of the very preterm infants. Infants included in this study were more mature and had a mean birth weight above 1500 g at birth, which might limit the applicability of their findings. A very important aspect of mixing formula or using the ready to feed form is the risk of contamination when the formula is prepared at the local institutions. The issue of formula surveillance and incidence of nosocomial sepsis was not addressed adequately. Other published small studies showed similar results with increased rate of regurgitation in the ready to feed formula group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>A similar study by Lucas <italic>et al</italic>. showed that infants fed the reconstituted formula had a larger increase in their body weight compared to ready to feed formula. Errors in mixing powdered formula were thought to play a role. When compared to breast fed infants growth pattern, ready to feed formula showed a more physiological pattern as to powdered formula.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>We believe that the findings of this study could encourage researchers to perform larger data sets including smaller infants and including hard outcomes that are of interest to both clinicians and parents of preterm infants.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Abstracted from</title><p>Surmeli-Onay O, Korkmaz A, Yigit S, Yurdakok M, Feeding intolerance in preterm infants fed with powdered or liquid formula: A randomized controlled, double-blind, pilot study.
