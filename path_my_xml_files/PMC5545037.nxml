In-custody barriers to treatment, including a lack of evidence-based treatment options and the often short periods of incarceration, and limited communication between jails and community-based treatment agencies that can hinder immediate enrollment into community care once released have contributed to a cycle of limited treatment engagement, unaddressed criminogenic risks, and (re)arrest among this vulnerable and high-risk population. This paper describes a study that will develop research and communication protocols and adapt two evidence-based treatments, dual-diagnosis motivational interviewing (DDMI) and integrated group therapy (IGT), for delivery to adults with CODs across a jail-to-community treatment continuum.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">Adaptations to DDMI and IGT were guided by the Risk-Need-Responsivity model and the National Institute of Corrections&#x02019; implementation competencies; the development of the implementation framework and communication protocols were guided by the Evidence-Based Interagency Implementation Model for community corrections and the Inter-organizational Relationship model, respectively. Implementation and evaluation of the protocols and adapted interventions will occur via an open trial and a pilot randomized trial. The clinical intervention consists of two in-jail DDMI sessions and 12 in-community IGT sessions. Twelve adults with CODs and four clinicians will participate in the open trial to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of, and fidelity to, the interventions and research and communication protocols. The pilot controlled trial will be conducted with 60 inmates who will be randomized to either DDMI-IGT or treatment as usual. A baseline assessment will be conducted in jail, and four community-based assessments will be conducted during a 6-month follow-up period. Implementation, clinical, public health, and treatment preference outcomes will be evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Findings have the potential to improve both jail- and community-based treatment services for adults with CODs as well as inform methods for conducting rigorous pilot implementation and evaluation research in correctional settings and as inmates re-enter the community.

A majority of justice-involved adults with SMI also have alcohol or drug use problems. Substance use among adults with SMI is a complicating treatment factor, as drug and alcohol use worsens illness trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], increases the cost of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and is associated with multiple negative outcomes, including homelessness, arrest, and violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there are many jail-based barriers to treatment for co-occurring mental and substance use disorders (CODs), including a lack of evidence-based treatment options and the often short periods of incarceration. There also is limited communication between jails and community-based treatment agencies, which decreases the likelihood of immediate entry into community care upon release. As a result, justice-involved adults with CODs experience high rates of treatment failure, and jail-based and community-based services struggle to intervene effectively. Together, these issues have contributed to a cycle of limited treatment engagement, unaddressed criminogenic risks, and (re)arrest among this vulnerable and high-risk population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Although evidence-based programs for CODs are available for inpatient and outpatient settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], effective treatment programs for justice-involved adults with CODs are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite an inmate&#x02019;s constitutional right to adequate healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], behavioral health treatment in jail is rarely evidence-based or focused on key leverage points, such as community re-entry or criminogenic risks. Several factors have contributed to this lack of evidence-based care, including jails&#x02019; limited capacity to respond to inmates&#x02019; behavioral health needs, the long-standing mission of incapacitation and punishment rather than rehabilitation, and the often short periods of incarceration and frequently unknown release dates for inmates, which limits the opportunities for and duration of in-jail treatment when available. Also, frequent and ongoing coordination with community-based agencies regarding inmates&#x02019; immediate enrollment in community services upon release from jail remains a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The issues are as follows: (1) Can existing evidence-based practices be adapted and delivered to justice-involved adults with CODs across both jail and community settings in a way that mitigates these barriers while also reducing re-arrest, substance use, and psychiatric symptoms and improving quality of life? (2) Can communication protocols be developed that facilitate immediate entry into community-based services upon release from jail? If so, what are the available and effective interventions that are portable to the jail setting and amenable to the inclusion of criminogenic risks? In addition to existing guidelines and recommendations for jail-based services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the mental health services literature describes several strategies that focus on organizational and clinical changes and the development of effective intra- and inter-agency communication that improves outcomes associated with transitions from institutional to community care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These include discharge planning, information sharing, monitoring of clients post-release, immediate and intensive community-based care, and peer support workers who span both the institutional and community settings. Still, the development and adoption of and adherence to guidelines, recommendations, and improvement interventions for clinical care with justice-involved adults with CODs have proven difficult in both the jail setting and during the transition to the community.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par20">The objectives of the current study are to (1) develop research protocols to obtain access to a jail population, implement a rigorous research design, including randomization to a pilot trial, and ensure that participants do not perceive any undue coercion to participate; (2) develop communication protocols so that jail and community treatment are coordinated and linked for effective community re-entry; and (3) adapt the clinical content of extant evidence-based programs to better address both behavioral health and criminogenic needs of jail inmates with CODs, including anger management, harm reduction, illness management, criminal thinking, antisocial peer networks, and treatment motivation.

IDDT programs are the &#x0201c;standard of evidence-based treatment&#x0201d; for adults with CODs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], p. 317). After a review of multiple IDDT and non-IDDT treatment programs, our partner agencies believed DDMI and IGT to be appropriate candidates for adaptation to justice-involved populations.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dual-diagnosis motivational interviewing</title><p id="Par28">DDMI is an adaptation of motivational interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] that incorporates an integrated framework and accommodates the cognitive impairments and disordered thinking associated with CODs. For example, DDMI includes simplified open-ended questions, refined reflective listening skills, and integration of psychiatric issues into personalized feedback and decision making. Given its portability and effectiveness in few sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], DDMI was thought to fit particularly well within the context of brief, but intensive jail-based treatment prior to community re-entry. In the current study, DDMI sessions lasting approximately 60&#x000a0;minutes will be delivered one on one to inmates in the jail prior to their first court appearance. When possible, inmates will receive a second DDMI session before anticipated release from jail.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Integrated group therapy</title><p id="Par29">IGT is an evidence-based practice that has been cited by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as one of five examples of &#x0201c;promising behavioral therapies&#x0201d; for adults with CODs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], p. 3). IGT uses cognitive and behavioral strategies to address substance use, psychiatric symptoms, and medication nonadherence via a focus on (1) promoting abstinence from drugs, including alcohol; (2) promoting adherence to psychiatric medications; (3) teaching mood- and thought-monitoring skills; (4) teaching social skills; and (5) improving other aspects of life functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Because cognitive-behavioral therapies like IGT are effective for treating adults with CODs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], including the reduction of antisocial behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], our partners believed that community-based IGT also was an appropriate treatment to adapt for the jail-to-community treatment continuum. The goal is to have inmates, within 1&#x000a0;week of release from jail, enroll in IGT and participate in 12 90-minute IGT sessions with four to eight other inmates for 6&#x000a0;weeks. IGT sessions will be run with an open enrollment format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to facilitate a quick jail-to-community transition period and rapid engagement in community-based treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conceptual frameworks</title><p id="Par30">Our treatment adaptation and implementation and communication protocol frameworks are described next.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Treatment adaptation framework</title><p id="Par31">Our treatment adaptation framework is guided by the Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the National Institute of Corrections&#x02019; (NIC&#x02019;s) implementation competencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Within RNR, the risk principle indicates that individuals at highest risk of future adverse outcomes should be identified and resources allocated accordingly. The need principle asserts that interventions should target criminogenic needs related directly to adverse outcomes for the individual offender. The responsivity principle affirms that strategies should be sensitive to identified risk and needs, while being delivered in a way that considers individual factors that can affect treatment outcomes (e.g., learning style). There are eight NIC implementation competencies that also informed our treatment adaptation process: assess risk and need, enhance motivation, target interventions, cognitive-behavioral skill training, positive reinforcement, increase ongoing support, measure processes and practices, and measurement feedback.</p><p id="Par32">Through the integration of RNR principles and NIC competencies, DDMI will be adapted for in-jail use with a focus on motivating the inmate for community re-entry, continuity of care, and uptake of routine outpatient services. IGT will be adapted for more intensive, staged delivery of sessions that target criminogenic risk and needs, while continuing to enhance motivation for uptake of routine outpatient services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Implementation framework</title><p id="Par33">Our implementation framework is guided by the Evidence-Based Interagency Implementation Model (EB-IIM) for community corrections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This framework considers multiple, interacting levels at which implementation must occur, including the role of inner and outer settings in implementation. For example, we will focus on developing knowledge and building a foundation through the open trial (i.e., preparation phase), in addition to establishing agreed-upon expectations for the jail and community partners and aligning the jail&#x02019;s policies and procedures to accommodate changes identified through the two trials. Finally, ongoing treatment adaptations, informed via open trial results, should improve the likelihood of sustaining a successful jail-to-community-based treatment continuum through and then beyond the pilot RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Communication framework</title><p id="Par34">Our communication protocols will be based on the Inter-organizational Relationship (IR) model that emphasizes situational factors, as well as process, structural, and outcome dimensions in inter- and intra-agency communication. The IR model defines the situational factors (e.g., need for resources) and process (e.g., intensity of information flow), structural (e.g., complexity), and outcome dimensions (i.e., perceived effectiveness) necessary for inter-agency collaboration. Thus, in addition to developing and testing inter-agency communication protocols (e.g., from jail to community treatment), we also will develop and test intra-agency communication protocols (e.g., how to manage scheduling conflicts between IGT and usual care services). The IR model has been used effectively across service settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and maps onto the technical, procedural, and resource dimensions of the EB-IIM&#x02019;s foundation core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par35">The study consists of two phases: (1) an uncontrolled open trial and (2) a pilot RCT. During the open trial phase, we will collect data to inform the refinement of the research and communication protocols and the adapted interventions&#x02014;broadly, the jail-to-community treatment continuum. For example, results from the uncontrolled open trial may result in changes to the inmate participant recruitment and consent process, procedures for facilitating inter-agency communication, and additional adaptations to the DDMI-IGT continuum training materials, manuals, or session handouts. All modifications to the research and communication protocols and to the adapted interventions will be made in collaboration with community partners throughout the uncontrolled open trial and implemented in the pilot RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par36">The study will be conducted at a large urban county jail in the southeastern USA. The jail&#x02019;s average daily census ranges between approximately 1300 and 1450 with one-quarter of those inmates identified as being in need of mental health evaluation beyond standard screening completed during booking. Within 24&#x02013;48 hours, on average, all inmates have their first court appearance. From there, inmates are either (1) bonded out or have their charges dropped or (2) detained and sent to Misdemeanor or Felony Court.

These outcomes will be assessed five times, including an in-jail baseline assessment and four additional community-based assessments spanning 1&#x000a0;week to 5&#x000a0;months after jail discharge (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Low-level codes will be grouped into broader categories when possible. Additionally, we will calculate and review descriptive statistics of administrative data (e.g., call logs, frequency of inter- and intra- communication, average number of treatment sessions attended) to assess treatment and protocol feasibility.

This study is developmental in nature, which informs how we have chosen to address the choice of error rates and power to detect effects in our clinical and public health outcomes. Prior research suggests small to medium substance use and psychiatric symptom effects of DDMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and IGT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, type I error rate &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15 was chosen so as not to limit power to conduct inferential analyses, giving an 80% chance (1 &#x02013; &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.80) to detect a difference between the treatment conditions that would explain 9% of the total variance [&#x003b8;<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.09] in an outcome variable if the null hypothesis were false (calculated using G*Power 3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]). This approach allows for increased opportunity to detect a smaller effect, while running the risk that the effect will not replicate. This course of action is appropriate for a developmental study and is consistent with prior research involving adults with SMI and preliminary-stage multivariable models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par56">Adults with mental illness suffer disproportionately from drug and alcohol problems and are overrepresented in jails.

We will adapt two interventions, DDMI and IGT, for justice-involved adults with CODs. Our project is grounded in evidence-based conceptual and treatment processes and will have the potential to improve substance use, psychiatric, arrest, and routine outpatient treatment uptake outcomes among an underserved and high-risk population. This type of research is needed to address the increasing rates of persons with CODs in jail populations and associated treatment failure. Second, the development and implementation of RCT methodologies is needed within and across jail and community settings to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of adapting treatments and conducting RCTs with this population. Accordingly, this study may influence the progression of subsequent CODs and jail research and encourage others to adopt similar rigorous and system-bridging approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par58">Our study has several limitations in the design and implementation. Although court orders can be successful in increasing treatment participation among adults with CODs, substance use disorders (SUDs), and SMIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], we do not propose any judicial oversight. This decision is in line with the preferences of our community partners and other ongoing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] and has proven to be successful in retaining participants. Given our focus on one jail, the generalizability of our findings may be limited; however, generalizability of our findings can be examined in a future full-scale RCT. Allowing access to TAU in both experimental conditions also presents several potential limitations. As much as possible, our community agencies will have different clinicians deliver the DDMI-IGT and usual care services to experimental and control participants; however, DDMI-IGT and usual care will be provided in the same agencies, which may result in treatment contamination. Fidelity assessments will allow us to monitor DDMI-IGT treatment integrity and to address this potential contamination. It also is likely that, across both experimental conditions, inmates will receive different types and intensities of usual care services, resulting in treatment heterogeneity. This will not affect study interpretability, however, because service intensity will be titrated to individual client needs, consistent with the RNR framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. If our DDMI-IGT continuum increases the amount or duration of usual care service uptake, the extent to which improvements in outcomes can be &#x0201c;explained&#x0201d; by amount or duration of usual care services could be explored by statistically controlling for these services and comparing the treatment conditions, e.g., through analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models. Lastly, given that our study is focused on the preliminary treatment adaptations and feasibility, we have not focused on differential effects of DDMI and IGT within our treatment continuum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par59">Participant recruitment for the RCT is ongoing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec33"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par73">
