Particularly, patients with slow-growing low-grade tumors (low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and glioneuronal tumors) in cortical areas of the temporal lobe are more frequently associated with seizures than high-grade tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since patients harboring low-grade tumors tend to live several years after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the impact of epilepsy on disease burden is high. Thus, epilepsy control is one crucial factor to improve patients&#x02019; quality of life, to free them from disease burden, and to help retain their functional independence and social participation.</p><p>It is generally believed that successful surgical resection of these tumors has a significant effect not only on the rate of overall survival (OS) and tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but also on seizure outcome. Extent of resection (EOR) has been suggested to be a strong predictor of postoperative seizure freedom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, LGGs are infiltrating tumors that do not have distinct borders, which cannot be easily differentiated from periphral normal brain tissue with the naked eye. Intraoperative MR imaging (iMRI) provides information about EOR and allows update of immediate data sets for neuronavigation to compensate for anatomic changes that occur as a result of surgical retraction, gravity, and loss of cerebrospinal fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Combined with neuronavigation with tractography and functional data, information about the white matter tracts and eloquent areas and their relationships with tumors can also be obtained preoperatively for evaluation and surgical design and updated during surgery. These intraoperative imaging techniques have been developed to maximize EOR while minimized postoperative neurological deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], however, still need to be further tempered by surgical judgement.</p><p>Few studies have demonstrated the effects of iMRI on surgery of temporal lobe lesional epilepsy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this prospective study, we sought to investigate the value of high-field iMRI combined with integrated neuronavigation in temporal lobe LGGs resections for seizure outcome, postoperative morbidity, and rate of return to normal life and compared these findings with those of a control cohort without iMRI guidance. Initial, intraoperative, and immediate postoperative tumor volumes were measured quantitatively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>Patients with suspected temporal lobe LGG showing no contrast enhancement on T1-weighted MRI who presented with seizures were eligible. After giving their informed consent, these cases were discussed in the morning meeting in our department, and then the patients were allocated by the chief resident to undergo either iMRI-guided or conventional microneurosurgical tumor resection (include all standard neurosurgical instruments and neuronavigation system) according to the risk and the difficulty of the operation. Only patients with histopathological examination confirmed temporal lobe grade II tumors (except gemistocytic astrocytoma) were enrolled. Functional MRI and fiber tracking were performed for both groups of patients to localize motor and speech areas and to reconstruct white matter tracts if the lesion was in the vicinity of these eloquent regions. Postoperative treatment was done according to clinical guidelines and dependent on preferences of the patient. Follow-up evaluation including neurological examination and MRI were obtained at regular intervals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The local Ethic Committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital approved intraoperative MRI, and signed informed consent was provided by all patients or family members. We had obtained consent to publish from the participants to report their data in any form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>MRI and data processing</title><p>Both conventional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed on a 1.5-T scanner (Siemens Espree, Erlangen, Germany). Our imaging protocol started with a T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence (echo time (TE) 3.02&#x000a0;ms, repetition time (TR) 1650&#x000a0;ms, matrix size of 256&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;256, field of view (FOV) 250&#x000a0;mm, slice thickness 1&#x000a0;mm) and followed by several sequences applied in the transverse plane, which are T2-weighted sequence (TE 93&#x000a0;ms, TR 5500&#x000a0;ms, matrix size of 512&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;512, FOV 230&#x000a0;mm, slice thickness 3&#x000a0;mm); T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence (FLAIR; TE 84&#x000a0;ms, TR 9000&#x000a0;ms, matrix size of 256&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;256, FOV 230&#x000a0;mm, slice thickness 3&#x000a0;mm); and DTI echo planar (TE 147&#x000a0;ms, TR 9400&#x000a0;ms, matrix size of 128&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;128, FOV 251&#x000a0;mm, slice thickness 3&#x000a0;mm, bandwidth 1502&#x000a0;Hz per pixel, diffusion-encoding gradients in 12 directions using <italic>b</italic> values of 0 and 1000&#x000a0;s/mm<sup>2</sup> and voxel size 1.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;mm). We used 40 slices, no intersection gap, 40 continuous free interval collection slices, and five time repetitions. The same scanning protocol was used for both preoperative and intraoperative MRI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Fiber tracking</title><p>For reconstruction and visualization of the fiber tracts, we used the &#x0201c;fiber tracking&#x0201d; module of the navigation planning software iPlan 2.6 (BrainLab, Feldkirchen, Germany). Before tractography could be started, scans were transferred to a navigation planning workstation in DICOM format, and format conversion of the data and fusion of different sets of images were needed. The fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold was adjusted to 0.15 and the minimum fiber length to 40&#x000a0;mm before fiber tracking was initiated. Tract seeding was performed by defining a rectangular region of interest (ROI) in the co-registered standard T1 anatomical datasets and the color-encoded fractional anisotropy map. For reconstruction of the optic radiation, one region of interest (ROI) was placed on the lateral geniculate body identified by selecting the axial slice at the level of the transition from the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the cerebral peduncle on the resection side and a second ROI was placed at the level of the lower lip (anterior bundle) or middle and upper lip (central and posterior bundle) of the visual occipital cortex (calcarine cortex) on the same side. The arcuate fasciculus tractography was performed using approaches with two ROI, as reported by Catani et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For tractography of the pyramidal tract, we used a two-ROI approach described by Nimsky and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. After selecting the appropriate fiber bundle, erasing false-positive tracts, a 3D object was generated automatically by wrapping neighboring fibers with a 5-mm hull. The closing lines around all fibers from all slices together resulted in the 3D object.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>BOLD imaging</title><p>For the determination of eloquent cortex, we implemented the &#x0201c;blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) mapping&#x0201d; module. Preoperatively, patients had to perform specific tasks including number-counting task and picture-naming task for language-eloquent cortex localization. Broca&#x02019;s area was activated in the posterior section of the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere and Wernicke&#x02019;s area in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus. Repeated hand and foot movement task was used activate the hand and foot cortex in the pre-central gyrus.</p><p>We used the object creation module of the iPlan 2.6 for tumor segmentation. Tumor volume was determined based on hyperintense region on T2 FLAIR because the majority of low-grade gliomas have optimal visibility in this sequence and peritumoral edema could be distinguished from the lesion. Segmentation of the tumor was performed on a slice-by-slice basis in anatomic data. After all the slices containing the lesion were outlined, a 3D object was formed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Microscope-based neuronavigation</title><p>Preoperative 3D T1-weighted sequence was used for intraoperative anatomic neuronavigation. Optic radiation, cortical speech areas, and other functional data, if needed according to tumor location and tumor volume, were integrated into the anatomical imaging data. After accurate registration, the neuronavigation microscope (Pentero, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was connected. The functional data were overlaid in the neurosurgeon&#x02019;s microscope viewing field; thus, an appropriate incision could be planned accordingly. When the surgeon had the impression of having a complete resection or further removal of the lesion might endanger eloquent areas or functional white matter tracts, an intraoperative MRI was performed. If residual tumor which could be further removed was revealed, the intraoperative MRI and DTI tractography data were used to update the navigation information, in a way compensating for intraoperative brain shift caused by tumor resection, brain swelling, and cerebrospinal fluid outflowing. The initial registration file was restored so that no repeated image registration procedure is needed. Imaging would be repeated prior to closure of the craniotomy to confirm adequate resection of any lesion and to exclude any immediate complications such as hemorrhage.</p><p>Primary endpoint was the extent of resection. To assess the extent of resection, pre- (with contrast agent within 7&#x000a0;days), intra-, and early postoperative 1.5T high-field MR images were collected to perform volumetric analyses. For the iMRI group, final extent of resection (EOR) was calculated based on the last intraoperative scan before closure. For the conventional group, postoperative MRI was performed within 3&#x000a0;days after surgery to assess the EOR. MRI scan were performed within 7&#x000a0;days after surgery to rule out postoperative complications such as intracranial hematoma and hydrocephalus for all patients. Volumetric analyses of the tumors and tumor residuals were undertaken by an independent and masked neuroradiologist to establish the EOR, using the editor module of 3D slicer 4.3.1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Image area of signal abnormality on T2 FLAIR sequences was segmented manually across all sections. The duration of surgery were also compared.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Volumetric analysis. Axial MR images obtained in a patient with a right temporal lesion infiltrating the mesial temporal lobe structures. The lesion showed an irregular shape with no enhancement on the postcontrast T1-weighted images, which was revealed an oligoastrocytoma by histopathological findings (<bold>a</bold>). The tumor was more visible on T2 FLAIR and was segmented manually slice by slice using the &#x0201c;paint effect&#x0201d; in the editor module of 3D slicer (<bold>b</bold>). Using the &#x0201c;make model effect,&#x0201d; a 3D object was built (<bold>c</bold>). The tumor volume automatically computed was 42.6&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>

A favorable seizure outcome was defined as Engel class IA&#x02013;D (seizure-free or rare consciousness-sparing nondisabling seizures), whereas constant consciousness-imparing seizures were labeled as Engel classes II&#x02013;IV. Postoperative neurological deficits were graded as mild (upper visual field homonymous quadrantanopia, slight aphasia, or latent mono-paresis) or severe (hemiparesis, hemianopia, or aphasia ). Deficit with no clinical improvement at the 6-month follow-up examination were considered permanent.

Postoperative histopathological examination revealed three of theses patients had anaplastic astrocytoma; one patient had parenchyma inflammation. One patient with gemistocytic histology was excluded to create a more uniform study population. Thirteen patients underwent conventional surgery. Thus, data from 54 temporal lobe World Health Organization (WHO) grade II glioma patients with preoperative seizures could be analyzed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In our series, 59.3&#x000a0;% of patients were male, and complex partial seizure was the predominant type.

Preoperative MRI revealed a nonenhanced lesion in the left temporal lobe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a&#x02013;c</xref>), and tractography identified the optic radiation passing rostral to it and was pushed slightly upward. The minimum distance between the lesion and dorsal bundle of the optic radiation was &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;mm, while Meyer's loop was closely involved in the lesion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d&#x02013;f</xref>). The option between a more conservative resection (lower risk to visual field) vs a gross-total resection (certain damage to Meyer&#x02019;s loop but greater chance of seizure freedom and reduced risk of tumor recurrence) was discussed, and the patient chose the latter. A left inferior temporal approach was planned, and a suitable cortex incision was designed according to neuronavigation. First, iMRI detected partial tumor remnants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a and d</xref>), and intraoperative DTI-based dorsal bundle of the OR was reconstructed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b and e</xref>).

Contrary to the indolent characteristics claimed by classical literature, there is a constant growth pattern of these tumors before and after surgery in cases of incomplete resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Tumor progression will inevitably occur, which will lead to neurological deficits with a deteriorating of quality of life and ultimately to death. Since surgery is the first therapeutic option to consider in LGG, the impact of surgery has been studied in numerous literature, supporting the significant effect of EOR on overall survival (OS) by delaying anaplastic transformation, even in incomplete tumor removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, LGG tends to have ill-defined margin which is nearly impossible to distinguish from peritumoral normal brain under the microscope with the naked eye, and EOR tend to be overestimated even by experienced neurosurgeons.</p><p>Intraoperative MRI is today an increasingly proved useful tool for operations of many brain lesions, especially for small deep seated tumors. This technique provides nearly real-time images, which allows detection of residual tumors and immediate intraoperative complications. Furthermore, it enables intraoperative update of registration compensating for brain shift caused by outflow of cerebrospinal fluid, deformation from retraction and effects of gravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Extent of resection</title><p>For discussion of impact of iMRI on glioma surgery, the resection control was the most relevant feature which has been validated by different studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. And the advantage provided by iMRI for further reduction of tumor volume was obvious. One prospective volumetric analysis enrolled both low and high-grade glioma cases and reported that EOR of contrast-nonenhancing tumors benefit more from iMRI scan than enhancing tumors, possibly due to diffuse signal abnormality of nonenhancing gliomas on T2-weighted images. The median percentage of tumor resected in patients with nonenhancing gliomas improved from 63 to 80&#x000a0;%, although this was not statistically significantly due to small sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In our series, we uniformly enrolled WHO grade II gliomas focusing on temporal lobe location. As a consequence of iMRI imaging, we identified 44&#x000a0;% of patients with residual tumors intraoperatively and continued surgery using the updated neuronavigation data, and EOR of these patients increased significantly from 71.1 to 94.4&#x000a0;%. Final iMRI scans documented gross-total resection rate of 31.7&#x000a0;%, in which 14.6&#x000a0;% of improvement benefited directly from iMRI. Compared to another study investigating impact of iMRI on lesional temporal lobe epilepsy surgery, this seems low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, WHO grade I tumors (GGs and DNTs) made up the majority of their cases, which might be less infiltrative than LGG and tumor borders might be clearer. Further, they adopted qualitative categorization of EOR instead of volumetric manual segmentation of the tumor. It is likely that tumor volume were limited in their series; thus, tumors were less involved with eloquent areas. Of note, inter-observer variances exist even for the quantitative approach, which theoretically has the advantage of higher precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Stratified analysis with regard to pathological diagnosis and tumor location using validated criteria to assess EOR are needed for comparisons of results between studies in the future.</p><p>A randomized, controlled trial was conducted aiming to assess the efficacy of iMRI guidance on extent of resection in patients with glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. They randomly allocated patients with contrast enhancing gliomas to undergo tumor resection either with iMRI guidance or with conventional microneurosurgical instruments and techniques. Their data showed significantly better extent of resection and decreased residual tumor volume in the iMRI group than in the control group, and this benefit was associated with an extended progression-free survival (PFS). However, we were unable to conduct a randomized trial due to cost-effective considerations. We would only propose an iMRI-guided surgery if preoperative imaging data had presented a large tumor with diffuse component in close relationship with functional subcortical white matter tracts because an iMRI-guided surgery was quite costly. This resulted in the larger tumor volumes in the iMRI group and highly uneven number of observations between the two groups. However, although selection bias set up a challenge for the resection in the iMRI group, comparable results were achieved with regard to final residual tumor volume and EOR, which could reflect indirectly the beneficial effect of guidance with iMRI for complete resection of LGGs compared with conventional microsurgery. Our study was not powered or designed to show whether this benefit corresponded to an increase in PFS and OS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Functional neuronavigation</title><p>As has been reported, BOLD MRI and DTI-based fiber tracking were noninvasive tools to localize eloquent gray matter and white matter tracts which can be integrated into a neuronavigation system. Eloquent cortex including the primary motor regions and Broca and Wernicke areas and functional subcortical connectivity including pyramidal, language, and visual tracts were successfully created and implemented in all patients in the iMRI cohorts as needed to reduce the potential risk of damage to these structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. When the process of fiber tracking was done, we tended to add a 5-mm hull around the object. During surgery, the surgeon would be reminded that the manipulation was getting closer to the object if the contouring line turned from dotted to solid under the microscope. Sometimes, we had to leave some residual tumor in the brain when trying to dissect the tumor boundaries from the tracts in cases of relatively severe compression. When the surgeon had the impression of a satisfactory resection or further resection might pose a threat to functional region, an iMRI scan was performed to evaluate the EOR and update information acquired for the neuronavigation. In terms of neurological outcome, our results were more favorable than previous literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], with permanent mono-paresis occurred in two patients, upper visual field defects in two patients, mild aphasia in one patient, and complications occurred in two patients in whom iMRI led to continued resection of tumor tissue. This underlined the fact that the application of multimodal navigation combined iMRI was a safe and advantageous technique. Reviewing preoperative surgical planning of integrated anatomical and functional data of the two mono-paresis patients, we found rather severe tumor compression of the posterior limb of internal capsule, and the pyramidal tract reconstructed presented an obvious inward curve. Of note, our data showed that surgery in the iMRI operation room consumed significantly more time than it did in other rooms, not due to only continued resection but also preparation and scanning time. Fortunately, this did not resulted in wound infection in any patient. For the conventional group, two patients developed permanent postoperative defects. Preoperative MRI revealed a mesial temporal lobe lesion invading the interpeduncular fossa and prepontile cistern for the patient who had postoperative oculomotor paralysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Tumor-related epilepsy</title><p>Given the fact that low-grade gliomas are slow progressing tumors which are more frequently associated with symptomatic focal seizures than high-grade gliomas, epilepsy usually represents the key clinical issue in these patients. Although surgery is facilitated by advances in preoperative and intraoperative techniques such as multimodal integrated neuronavigation, iMRI and electrical cortical and subcortical stimulations to perform a safe and maximal resection even for eloquently located LGGs, surgery cannot cure these patients. Good seizure outcome and increased quality of life in these patients with many years of survival expectancy should remain a priority. However, whether observational waiting until the occurrence of drug-resistant epilepsy or early resection irrespective of seizure control should be proposed has long been discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. From oncologic observations, convincing evidence has been provided that early surgery significantly improves PFS and OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Meanwhile, postoperative seizure outcome correlated with preoperative seizure history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], so presumably, a timely surgery might also prove optimal for seizure control. Our study reflected a cohort routinely seen in a neuro-oncology clinic and did not focus only on patients with intractable epilepsy. Most patients in our study had sporadic seizures without long-term regular medications. As a result, duration between seizure onset and surgery was significantly shorter compared with other studies, which was considered to be one of the factors contribute to our exceptional seizure outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, we did not observe an influence of seizure history on seizure outcome as others did [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], possibly attributable to the small sample size and fewer poor outcomes in our population.</p><p>Tumor-related epilepsy had unknown mechanisms, and several hypotheses for epileptogenesis including blood-brain barrier disruption, metabolic changes due to vascular disturbance, and functional connectivity alteration had been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Since these changes might take place not only within the tumor but also in peritumoral area or even distant from the tumor, the epileptogenic zone was not always resected with oncological surgery. Thus, conventional oncological surgery might not be sufficient to achieve a desirable seizure outcome, and consideration should be given to a more extended resection, especially in patients with tumors in or around temporal lobe because mesial temporal structures might become an independent seizure generator and may be responsible for postoperative persistent seizure activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In one meta-analysis, Englot et al. reported additional benefit with regard to seizure outcome for tailored resection including hippocampectomy plus corticectomy over gross-total lesionectomy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, we noticed in the literature that the association between tumor and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is rare, with HS coupled with a tumor occurred in only 7&#x02013;8&#x000a0;% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Further, some studies reported similar seizure outcome between groups regarding the resection of hippocampus and amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. When trying to explain the similar results achieved in temporal lobe epilepsy surgery using different approaches with different extent of resection of temporal lobe mesial structures, Abosch et al. hypothesized that it would be enough to sever or interrupt a large enough proportion of the network between these structures, so that a seizure is unable to be built up or sustained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In addition, the insular cortex was associated with seizure spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This is probably why satisfactory seizure outcome could be achieved by some studies performing lesionectomy alone or even subtotal tumor resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and why mesial temporal location prognosticated favorable seizure outcome in tumoral epilepsy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In our series, excluding patients that were lost to follow-up, 82.1&#x000a0;% of patients in the iMRI group had tumor invasion of the insular cortex and 89.7&#x000a0;% of patients had tumor involvement of the mesial structures of temporal lobe, which was significantly higher than that in the conventional group (insular cortex involvement: 25.0&#x000a0;%; mesial structure involvement: 58.3&#x000a0;%). Reducing an epileptogenic mass involving these regions was more likely to include excision of the mesial temporal structures and the insular cortex and might possibly resulting in disconnection of critical seizure propagation pathways. This was considered to be another factor contributing to our favorable seizure outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Return to work</title><p>Return to work could be used as a surrogate parameter for patients&#x02019; good performance status as well as improved quality of life. It required not only a high degree of independence but also spared cognitive functions. Among patients in our iMRI cohort, 84.6&#x000a0;% had returned to work or school within 1&#x000a0;year after surgery. This rate of return to work was comparable to a previous study, which reported 90.3&#x000a0;% of patients returned to work 6&#x000a0;months after surgery in a cohort with frontal lobe LGG patients, indicating that return to previous lifestyle can be achieved for most LGG patients after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In our iMRI cohort, other problems including neurological defects and tumor progression prevented patients who had an Engel class I seizure outcome from returning to work in 3 patients. Three patients had not returned to work in the conventional group, all due to tumor progression. Thus for the relatively young patients with tumor-related epilepsy patients, complete seizure freedom without postoperative adverse events was the ultimate goal of each resective procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitation</title><p>One major limitation of the study was that it was not done in a double-blinded, randomized manner, which allowed the existence of selection bias. It also resulted in the highly uneven numbers of observations between the groups. However, even the patients with larger tumors were allocated to undergo surgery in the iMRI operation room; similar results were observed with regard to EOR, and although not statistically significant, even better results for the iMRI group with regard to seizure outcome. This is done without the compromise of patients&#x02019; postoperative neurological function, indicating the advantage of iMRI-guided surgery over conventional approach. Our finding might also be restricted by the fact that our study was done at only one center, which resulted in possible admission bias. Still, we believed that our results were valid and provided additional information for the most controversial topics in lesional temporal lobe epilepsy surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the best surgical approach to temporal lobe LGG-related epilepsy is still debated. Timely surgery before the seizure becomes medically intractable is advisable. More aggressive resection of the infiltrative temporal lobe WHO grade II tumors which frequently involving the mesial structures and even the insular cortex may contribute to a satisfactory long-term seizure outcome. iMRI is a safe and appropriate method to improve the extent of resection of LGGs. The multimodal intraoperative imaging technique led to a favorable Engel class I outcome in our study with low morbidity rate.
