Capsule endoscopy (CE) became available in 2000 and enabled physicians to better visualize the luminal aspect of the SB; however, it is limited by its inability to obtain diagnostic tissue and perform therapeutic interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The development of device-assisted deep enteroscopy has provided us with a practical method to examine the SB and perform diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in real time.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Three deep enteroscopy platforms exist: double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE), single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE), and spiral enteroscopy (SE). Double-balloon enteroscopy (FUJIFILM medical systems, Wayne, NJ, USA) was first described by Yamamoto in 2001.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> It consists of an enteroscope and overtube with a balloon at the end of both the enteroscope and overtube. Single-balloon enteroscopy (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA) was first described in 2007 and consists of an enteroscope that is fitted with an overtube with a balloon on the tip.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The enteroscope and overtube are advanced into the SB, and on reaching depth of maximum insertion (DMI), the balloon is inflated and the overtube and enteroscope withdrawn, resulting in the SB being telescoped over the overtube. The enteroscope is then advanced with the overtube held in place by the inflated balloon and the procedure repeated. The most recent deep enteroscopy platform is SE (Spirus Medical Inc., Stoughton, MA, USA), first described in 2008.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This consists of a spiral overtube on an enteroscope that allows deep insertion into the SB by pleating the SB onto the overtube via rotation.</p><p>There have been multiple randomized controlled trials and prospective studies comparing DBE with both SBE and SE.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="bibr8-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr9-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr10-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr14-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Double-balloon enteroscopy has been shown in some, but not all of these studies, to be superior to SBE and SE in terms of DMI and achieving total enteroscopy.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This potential advantage comes at the cost of an increased procedure time associated with DBE.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Despite the increased DMI, no difference has been found between diagnostic yield, therapeutic yield, or adverse events across these platforms. Khashab et al<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> published the only comparative study of SBE and SE. In this retrospective study, 105 deep enteroscopies were performed by a single experienced endoscopist. The DMI for SE was found to be superior, with no differences in procedure time and diagnostic yield observed between the 2 groups.</p><p>The literature to date suggests that a greater DMI does not correlate with a higher diagnostic or therapeutic yield. A consistent finding in the literature is the increased procedural time of DBE compared with both SE and SBE.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Given this, a comparison of these 2 newer platforms is appropriate. This is the first prospective randomized study to compare SBE and SE, with the primary aim being to compare the DMI between these 2 techniques.

Exclusion criteria were inability to give informed consent, pregnancy, uncorrected coagulopathy, cirrhosis, esophageal stricture, patients with prior SB surgery, primary anal approach, or inability to tolerate sedated endoscopy due to cardiopulmonary instability. Randomization was performed through a computer-generated sequence that was then sealed in an envelope and only revealed to the endoscopist prior to the procedure. The requirement for anterograde enteroscopy was based on the results of previous diagnostic studies when available. If a lesion detected on CE prior to deep enteroscopy was within the first 75% of SB transit time, an anterograde approach was chosen.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> If no diagnostic studies were available, anterograde enteroscopy for evaluation of the midgut was performed based on the clinical information available.</p></sec><sec id="section9-1179552218754881"><title>Data collection</title><p>The following data were collected prospectively at the time of the procedure: Relevant demographic (age, sex) and clinical data including body mass index (BMI), presenting symptoms, indication for deep enteroscopy, prior radiologic and gastrointestinal (GI) investigations, and history of prior abdominal surgery (excluding appendectomy) were recorded. Procedural data including the type of anesthesia, diagnostic findings, therapeutic interventions, DMI, total procedure time, adjusted procedure time, and adverse event (including mucosal trauma) were recorded prospectively. All patients were contacted within 1&#x02009;week of the procedure by telephone to assess for postprocedural adverse events.</p><p>In all patients undergoing enteroscopy for obscure GI bleeding (OGIB), the number and type of previous endoscopic and radiologic evaluations were noted. Obscure GI bleeding was defined as presumed midgut source of bleeding in patients with prior negative endoscopic and radiologic evaluations of the upper and lower GI tract or with evidence of SB bleeding on CE. Patients were documented to have either overt or occult OGIB based on clinical evidence of absence or presence of bleeding, respectively. Patients undergoing enteroscopy for causes other than OGIB also had documentation of the number of prior biochemical, endoscopic, and radiologic evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="section10-1179552218754881"><title>Deep enteroscopy technique</title><p>All procedures were performed by an experienced endoscopist (P.I.O.) with a second endoscopist assisting during SE procedures. P.I.O. had performed more than 110 SBE and 100 SE procedures prior to commencement of this study. All procedures were performed with carbon dioxide insufflation. Fluoroscopy was not used for any procedures. Procedures were performed under conscious sedation or general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.

The single-balloon overtube (ST-SB1; Olympus America) was used for SBE procedures and the Endo-Ease Discovery SB overtube (Spirus Medical Inc.) was used for SE procedures. For SBE, the enteroscope and SBE overtube were inserted together through the mouth and passed into the duodenum. The enteroscope was advanced through the SB using a combination of push and pull technique, with sequential balloon inflation and deflation. For SE, the enteroscope and SE overtube were inserted through the mouth and advanced into the duodenum.

The net advancement is defined as the point of maximal insertion for SBE.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> To estimate the DMI for SE, the length of bowel examined in 10-cm increments during withdrawal was counted.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Total enteroscopy was defined as visualization of cecum during anterograde enteroscopy.</p><p>The total and therapeutic procedure times were recorded. The total procedure time was defined as the time from insertion to withdrawal of the enteroscope through the mouth. The therapeutic procedure time was the time spent for any therapeutic intervention (including tattooing, polypectomy, etc).

In this study, we report a mean DMI in the range of 285 to 330&#x02009;cm, which is at the higher end of previously published data.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr9-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr10-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr15-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="bibr21-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr22-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The nonstatistically significant difference in DMI favoring SE (330.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;88.2 vs 285.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;80.8&#x02009;cm, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.16) is likely the result of a higher percentage of patients with female sex and a history of abdominal surgery in the SBE group, which both negatively affect DMI.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The presently reported DMI is greater than our previously published results; this may be accounted for by increased experience of the endoscopist performing the procedures and the use of carbon dioxide for insufflation, both of which are proven to increase the DMI.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>With the development of CE and improved radiologic imaging techniques, it has becoming evident that significant pathology can be harbored in the SB.

No patient required intervention or extended observation for the management of minor mucosal trauma. Most importantly, no significant mucosal trauma (score &#x02265;3) was observed with either device.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is that it failed to recruit sufficient numbers. This was due to the withdrawal of the SE system from the market. Spiral enteroscopy has since been reintroduced and is available for use in the United States, but the study was not restarted due to the previously stated reasons. Despite failing to reach its recruitment targets, the number of patients enrolled in this study is similar to some of the prior device-assisted enteroscopy comparative studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1179552218754881" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In addition, the procedures were performed by an experienced endoscopist at a tertiary referral center.

This is the first prospective, randomized study of SE and SBE and shows that there is no significant difference in DMI, diagnostic, or therapeutic yield between these 2 platforms. In comparison with SBE and SE, DBE offers superior DMI and total enteroscopy but suffers from a prolonged procedure time. Despite the differences across these platforms, they are all equal in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic yields. Thus, future studies should focus on differentiating what potential advantages exist between the SBE and SE platforms.</p><p>In conclusion, SBE and SE are safe and have comparable performance characteristics. Thus, the choice of deep enteroscopy platform should be guided by local expertise and experience. Small numbers prevent giving a definitive judgment, and future adequately powered prospective study is required to confirm these findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold>The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold>The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: M.A.K. is a consultant for Boston Scientific, and Olympus.
