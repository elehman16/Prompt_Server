The increasing prevalence of this disease in developed and developing countries has led to a global epidemic. Current epidemiological surveys suggest that approximately 1 million individuals with terminal CKD have undergone kidney replacement therapy worldwide. A large part of this epidemic may be explained by the increase in the number of diabetes mellitus cases and the increase in life expectancy. Diabetic nephropathy is expected to affect approximately 5.4% of the world population by 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>CKD is defined as the presence of kidney damage or reduced kidney function for &#x02265;3&#x000a0;months, regardless of the diagnosis. The advanced stage of this condition is known as terminal CKD or end-stage kidney disease, with progressive and irreversible loss of kidney function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>CKD is classified on the basis of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as recommended by the US National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, which provides the basis for the management of this disease. CKD is classified into 5 stages: stage 1, kidney damage with normal or increased GFR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;mL/(min&#x000b7;1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>); stage 2, kidney damage with mildly decreased GFR of 60 to 89&#x000a0;mL/(min&#x000b7;1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>); stage 3, moderately decreased GFR of 30 to 59&#x000a0;mL/(min&#x000b7;1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>); stage 4, severely decreased GFR of 15 to 29&#x000a0;mL/(min&#x000b7;1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>); and stage 5, kidney failure with a GFR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;mL/(min&#x000b7;1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>). Evidence of kidney damage for &#x02265;3&#x000a0;months is required for the diagnosis of stage 1 and 2 CKD, as manifested by pathological kidney abnormalities or abnormal urine composition (such as haematuria or proteinuria) or abnormalities on imaging tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence rate of sleep disorders in patients with CKD ranges from 40% to 80%, which is higher than those in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The most frequent comorbidities include diabetes mellitus type 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], periodic leg movements during sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and nocturnal hypoxemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], dyslipidaemia, coronary disease, heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], systemic arterial hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], respiratory disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], stress[12 ], depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>OSA is a respiratory disease characterised by the collapse of the upper airways during sleep in predisposed subjects. After chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, OSA is the most important and widespread respiratory disease, affecting 3% to 7% of the male population and 2% to 5% of the female population between 40 and 65&#x000a0;years of age in the Western world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In Brazil, the prevalence of OSA is even higher at 24.8% in men and 9.6% in women, according to a recent epidemiological study conducted in the city of S&#x000e3;o Paulo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The causal association between OSA and CKD or whether the 2 diseases result from a common pathophysiologic process has not yet been clarified. Uremic milieu has been implicated as a cause of OSA in patients with CKD. Altered ventilatory drive and chemoreceptors can lead to decreased respiration via a blunted response to ventilatory stimuli, such as hypoxia or acidaemia. Upper airway obstruction can occur from localised oedema or the collapse of the dilator muscles, leading to an increased risk of OSA. Suppression of the respiratory musculature due to metabolic acidaemia/acidosis, osmotic disequilibrium, and a reduction in middle molecule clearance could potentially cause or contribute to OSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><sec><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The present study involving patients with CKD was designed with 4 main objectives: (1) to assess the effects of dialysis on sleep parameters and determine the prevalence and severity of sleep disorders; (2) to determine the behaviour of sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity through an analysis of heart rate variability; (3) to detect upper airway collapsibility as a risk indicator for OSA; and (4) to evaluate levels of depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life. Our hypothesis is that the weather weight gain due to volume overload observed during interdialytic period will influence the degree of collapsibility of the upper airway due to narrowing and predispose to upper airway occlusion during sleep, and to investigate the effects of nocturnal hemodialysis compared to daytime hemodialysis and the influences in the physiological variables of sleep, autonomic nervous system (ANS), and respiratory mechanics and thereby compromise the quality of life in chronic kidney diseases and end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A prospective, consecutive, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial is proposed to investigate the effect of dialysis on sleep, pulmonary function, respiratory mechanics, upper airway collapsibility, ANS, depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life in end-stage renal disease patients, as summarised in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the study protocol.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2369-14-215-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The participants will be recruited from the Centro de Nefrologia Zona Norte (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) and sent to the Sleep Laboratory of the Universidade Nove de Julho (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil).

The following will be used as the inclusion criteria: male or female patients aged 18 to 80&#x000a0;years; chronic kidney failure; candidate for kidney transplant with indication for dialysis; cognitive level sufficient for understanding the procedures and following the instructions; and agreement to participate by signing a statement of informed consent. Meanwhile, the following will used as the exclusion criteria: craniofacial abnormalities; undergoing active treatment of sleep apnea; active malignancy; active alcohol and/or drug abuse; and dementia or treatment-refractory psychiatric diseases leading to an inability to provide informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>After the initial assessment and compliance with eligibility criteria, participants will be randomized into two intervention group [patients achieving diurnal hemodialysis and nocturnal hemodialysis] and the control group [CKD not submitted to dialysis]. Randomization numbers will be generated using a randomization table at a central office. A series of numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes will be used to ensure confidentiality. Each envelope will contain a card stipulating to which group the subject will be allocated.All patients underwent randomization protocol that will meet the eligibility criteria and be clinically stable.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Baseline data will be collected prior to randomisation so that trial investigators, assessors, research co-ordinators and trial participants will be blinded to allocation while the data is being collected.
