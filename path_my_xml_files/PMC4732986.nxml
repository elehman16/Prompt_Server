Although the published estimates were correct, in the analysis of the follow-up data, we redefined the indicator to eliminate the overlap with a second indicator &#x0201c;Proportion of emergency and priority patients who were admitted, detained, or referred,&#x0201d; and focused only on drug treatments.</p><p>The revised crude percentages in arm A were 35% in time 0 and 63% in time 1 among children 0&#x02013;4 years and 20% in time 0 and 48% in time 1 among patients 5 and above.</p><p>In arm B they were 41% in time 0 and 48% in time 1 among children 0&#x02013;4 years and 27% in time 0 and 37% in time 1 among patients 5 and above.</p><p>The revised results of the analysis were that the estimated proportion of emergency patients that received at least one appropriate treatment increased in arm A (aRR = 1.75; 99%CI: 0.99, 3.06, and was unchanged in arm B, (aRR = 1.04; 99%CI: 0.80, 1.35; aRRR = 1.68; 99%CI: 0.94, 3.00).</p><p>The revised conclusion is that the trial showed that the OSS intervention did not statistically significantly improve facility performance for any of the 23 indicators.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>Reference</title><ref id="pone.0148672.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Weaver</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Burnett</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Crozier</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kinoti</surname><given-names>SN</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kirunda</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mbonye</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2014</year>) <article-title>Improving Facility Performance in Infectious Disease Care in Uganda: A Mixed Design Study with Pre/Post and Cluster Randomized Trial Components</article-title>. <source>PLoS ONE</source>
