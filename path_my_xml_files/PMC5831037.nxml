We aimed to assess the effects of probiotic yoghurt intake, compared to non-fermented, acidified milk intake, on clinical biomarkers and gene expression in peripheral blood. To this end, a randomised, crossover study was conducted in fourteen healthy, young men to test the two dairy products. For a subset of seven subjects, RNA sequencing was used to measure gene expression in blood collected during postprandial tests and after two weeks daily intake. We found that the postprandial response in insulin was different for probiotic yoghurt as compared to that of acidified milk. Moreover changes in several clinical biomarkers were associated with changes in the expression of genes representing six metabolic genesets. Assessment of the postprandial effects of each dairy product on gene expression by geneset enrichment analysis revealed significant, similar modulation of inflammatory and glycolytic genes after both probiotic yoghurt and acidified milk intake, although distinct kinetic characteristics of the modulation differentiated the dairy products. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor was a major contributor to the down-regulation of the inflammatory genesets and was also positively associated with changes in circulating insulin at 2h after yoghurt intake (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05). Daily intake of the dairy products showed little effect on the fasting blood transcriptome. Probiotic yoghurt and acidified milk appear to affect similar gene pathways during the postprandial phase but differences in the timing and the extent of this modulation may lead to different physiological consequences. The functional relevance of these differences in gene expression is supported by their associations with circulating biomarkers.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>&#x0201c;Healthy nutrition and sustainable food production&#x0201d; (NRP69) hosting the JPI HDHL project &#x0201c;EU Food Biomarkers Alliance (FoodBAll)</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Higher Education Innovation Fund 5</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McTernan</surname><given-names>Philip G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by the Swiss National Science Foundation in the frame of the national research program &#x0201c;Healthy nutrition and sustainable food production&#x0201d; (NRP69) hosting the JPI HDHL project EU Food Biomarkers Alliance (FoodBAll).

The changes that accompany milk fermentation include nutrient, chemical and physical modifications of the milk matrix. Lactic acid bacteria are used for milk fermentation for their capacity to metabolise lactose and galactose to lactic acid [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but their actions during fermentation extend beyond carbohydrate metabolism with important consequences for the amino acid, mineral and vitamin composition of the milk [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, some lactic bacteria affect the microbiota of the consumer as they are probiotics, live microorganisms that when consumed in adequate quantities, provide a health benefit to the host [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus the many health benefits that have been described for fermented milks may be attributed to the effects of the fermentation-specific changes of the milk on digestion and metabolism, and/or the interactions of the bacterial strains with the gut microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The most established effect of milk fermentation on metabolism is in the specific case of lactose metabolism in populations that do not have the genotype for lactase persistence; the prior hydrolysis of lactose during the fermentation process promotes the digestibility of dairy products [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192947.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The wider consequences of milk fermentation on host metabolism have also been investigated; in postprandial studies differential effects of fermented compared to non-fermented dairy milks have been observed for glycemia and insulinemia [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] as well as lipidemia [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and protein flux [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Calcium bioavailability has been investigated in dairy products but does not appear to depend upon milk fermentation [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192947.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The health benefits of fermented dairy intake are not limited to effects on postprandial metabolism; the daily intake of fermented dairy foods (in particular those containing probiotic bacteria) has been associated with lowering lipid parameters [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], regulation of glycemia [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and a reduction in circulating parameters of inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Whilst many studies have sought to investigate the impact of diet on individual metabolic pathways, the emerging field of &#x02018;nutrigenomics&#x02019; has increasingly been applied to study the interplay between genes, diet, metabolites and dietary consequences in health and disease [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Due to the development of high-throughput technologies, whole blood transcriptomics can offer a rapid, relatively non-invasive approach to study the changes in gene expression in blood that take place in response to dietary intake. Indeed, in the recent work of Petrov <italic>et al</italic>, the value of using whole blood to identify transcript-based biomarkers of nutritional status and metabolic health was demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Transcriptomic analysis, like other &#x02018;-omic&#x02019; approaches, facilitates a broader analysis than classical blood biomarkers that focus on a limited selection of surrogate markers of metabolism. Of note, the blood transcriptome has been shown to reflect gene expression in other tissues and thus may capture the wider consequences of diet on the body [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, in the recent work of Bartel <italic>et al</italic>., the fasting whole blood transcriptome was closely associated with the fasting circulating metabolome and implied metabolic processes [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The relevance of nutrient-gene interactions for dairy research has already been identified and explored in human trials [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192947.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Notably, Sagaya <italic>et al</italic>. compared the acute intake of yoghurt and of a non-fermented, acidified milk on gene expression of blood cells, and reported broadly similar effects for the two dairy products, including the modulation of inflammatory processes [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Conversely, a specific role for probiotic bacteria added to yoghurt on gene expression of the inflammatory related gene, RAR-related orphan receptor gamma, was suggested by Zarrati <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in a study that compared standard yoghurt with probiotic yoghurt.</p><p>The analysis of transcriptome changes in blood to assess the acute impact of dietary intake can be considered as a type of <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular experiment that is characterised by a change in nutrient composition of the media (serum) in which the cell (blood cells) are active and the response of the cells to this change is measured. In contrast to the classical <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular experiment, the human model reflects the true dynamics of nutrient digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, including the complex interactions with the gut microbiota, transport and processing by the intestinal cells and metabolism by the liver, before the active metabolites act upon the blood cells.</p><p>This approach could thus support understanding of how the intake of fermented dairy foods, especially those containing probiotic strains, can affect metabolism and physiological processes that may play a role in the health qualities associated with these foods. In this study, we use whole blood transcriptomics together with classical circulating biomarkers to explore in an <italic>in vivo</italic> human model the postprandial and short-term effects of probiotic yoghurt compared to non-fermented, acidified milk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures were completed in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation and with the guidelines laid down in the Helsinki Declaration.

The effect of a single intake of the assigned dairy product (800 g) was assessed by a postprandial test (D1 and D2). Each postprandial test was completed after an overnight fast and required participants to consume the designated dairy product within a period of 15 min.

In the current study, we used whole blood gene expression together with circulating biomarkers of metabolism and inflammation to explore the physiological effects of probiotic yoghurt compared with non-fermented, acidified milk intake. The two dairy products could be distinguished by the postprandial insulin response which was significantly greater after yoghurt with respect to acidified milk intake. Correspondingly, the insulin signaling pathway was shown to be differently enriched when comparing the responses to the two dairy products at 2 h in our targeted analysis of this pathway, with a positive enrichment in the insulin signaling pathway identified at 2 h after yoghurt intake. Conversely, for both yoghurt and acidified milk intake a similar coordinated regulation of inflammatory or immune-related genes was observed although the timing of the regulation was different.</p><p>Our results concur with previous reports of differences in circulating insulin responses to fermented compared to non-fermented milks [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In one of our previous transcriptomic studies that applied a similar experimental design [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we did not observe differences on insulin-related gene expression after intake of a standard yoghurt compared to an acidified milk. The different results in this previous study, may be due to their use of linear contrasts to investigate the direction of change in gene expression between 2 and 6 h rather than the changes at individual time points. In addition, the use of larger volumes of dairy products and presence of the probiotic LGG in the yoghurt used in the current study could have accentuated the different effects of the products on insulin. The mechanisms underpinning the differences we observe for insulin responses in our present work could in part relate to the altered nutrient composition of the yoghurt following fermentation that notably include hydrolysis of lactose by lactic acid bacteria to galactose and glucose, as well as the liberation of insulin-stimulatory peptides and amino acids from milk proteins [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Of the amino acids that are released during fermentation, several branched chain amino acids and certain bioactive peptides have known insulinotrophic effects [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192947.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The characteristics of the dairy matrix are also factors that contribute to differences in the speed of gastric emptying and consequently differences in nutrient uptake between fermented and non-fermented dairy foods [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This was minimised in our study by the addition of gluconic acid to milk to mimic pH and consistency of yoghurt. While we did not assess gastric emptying time in this study, the results of our appetite sensations questionnaire showed no differences in the perception of satiety after intake of the two products, suggesting that gastric emptying was not markedly different between the products.</p><p>Several energy metabolism pathways that can be influenced by insulin were also modulated by the dairy products. Of note, the postprandial response of genes implicated in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation was remarkably different at 2 h after acidified milk compared to 2 h after yoghurt intake; we observed an up-regulation of these genes after yoghurt intake and a concurrent down-regulation of most of the same genes after acidified milk intake. As oxidative phosphorylation has previously been proposed as a potential biomarker of the postprandial response [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], we explored the changes in this geneset based on the <italic>p</italic> value of the association rather than on the <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>adj</italic></sub> value. In contrast to the findings for oxidative phosphorylation, a similar down-regulation was observed for glycolytic genes after both dairy products although this appeared to be earlier after acidified milk. The greater insulin response observed after yoghurt compared to acidified milk, together with the absence of difference in glycemic response may explain the delayed down-regulation in glycolytic genes after yoghurt compared to acidified milk, as insulin stimulates this process [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>Several genesets that are associated with inflammatory or immune regulation were enriched in the early postprandial response to both acidified milk and yoghurt intake. While the magnitude of up-regulation in inflammatory related genes appeared to be greater after yoghurt intake, the overall enrichment of the geneset was not different between the dairy products. Interestingly the genes implicated in the positive enrichment of inflammatory genesets were generally down-regulated in our study between 4 and 6 h after the dairy intake. The association between dairy products and inflammation is controversial; a recent review suggested that despite the pro-inflammatory effects that dairy products can induce in subjects that are allergic to bovine milk, dairy products may otherwise have anti-inflammatory effects, in particular in individuals with metabolic disorders [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The early increase in the expression of inflammatory-related genes in our study is consistent with the transient, physiological postprandial inflammation that is induced by a mixed or fat-rich meal [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192947.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The subsequent down-regulation of these genes suggests a regulatory control that limits prolonged inflammation. This finding is also in line with our previous work that identified a dynamic response in inflammatory parameters after dairy product intake [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The persistent down-regulation of the inflammatory response geneset at 6 h after yoghurt intake in the current study raises the notion that dairy products could impact the inflammatory state beyond the postprandial phase. However, the absence of effects on fasting gene expression after a two-week period of daily intake of the dairy products observed in the current study does not support this hypothesis.</p><p><italic>AhR</italic> and <italic>EREG</italic> (a member of the epidermal growth factor family which is regulated by AhR [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]), were identified in this study as genes that were significantly regulated during the postprandial response to probiotic yoghurt and which contribute to multiple inflammatory pathways. The AhR that has a well-defined role in the metabolism of xenobiotics, has recently emerged as a key regulator of inflammatory pathways [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Notably, the receptor is described as having a protective role in intestinal cells of the gut upon binding of pseudo-endogenous ligands such as indole derivatives (trypotophan catabolites), which can be produced by the enteric microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. As described elsewhere, (Pimentel <italic>et al</italic>., <italic>submitted</italic>) four indole compounds presented a different postprandial response after the intake of the probiotic yoghurt compared to the acidified milk. Among these metabolites, IAAld, a known AhR ligand [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], showed some association with the changes in <italic>AhR</italic> expression following the intake of the dairy products although the relationship was not linear. IAAld was detected in our probiotic yoghurt at higher levels than in the acidified milk and was correspondingly found at higher levels in serum after acute intake of this product compared to acidified milk intake (Pimentel <italic>et al</italic>., <italic>submitted</italic>). The initial decreased expression of <italic>AhR</italic> in the presence of higher levels of the IAAld ligand supports the evidence for an influence of the ligand in the regulation of <italic>AhR</italic> expression [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192947.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. However, at higher concentrations of the metabolite, the modulation of <italic>AhR</italic> expression is less clear. In the context of the distinct differences observed for the postprandial response in insulin together with the previously described role of insulin and glucose on AhR functions [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], it was intriguing to find a positive correlation between insulin changes and the change in <italic>AhR</italic> expression at 2 h after the dairy product intake. Conversely, glycemia changes at 2 h were not related to the change in <italic>AhR</italic> expression although the principal glycemic changes in response to the dairy product intakes were observed in the early postprandial phase before 2 h. The effect of insulin sensitivity on AhR ligand activity [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and the regulatory effect of glucose on AhR activation [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have important implications for understanding how dietary ligands might interact with the AhR as these parameters are likely to be modulated by a complex meal containing such ligands. It would therefore be interesting to investigate the relationship between IAAld and AhR in the presence or absence of glucose and insulin in a controlled intestinal cell culture model (such as that described by Hubbard <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]) in order to better understand the interactions between the nutritional conditions, the ligand activity, and the <italic>AhR</italic> expression.</p><p>The validity of the changes in gene expression in our study is supported by their associations with circulating biomarkers. Most notably, the enrichment of the glycolysis geneset for genes that were correlated with glycemia at 2 h showed that genes of the glycolysis pathway were more highly expressed in the presence of higher levels of circulating glucose. Glucose homeostasis is tightly regulated in non-pathological states and thus the close association between glycemia and gene expression of glycolysis, a process that leads to the rapid metabolism of the nutrient, might be expected. Changes in the expression of glycolytic genes in blood during the postprandial phase have previously been identified by Kawakami <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] but have not directly been related to glycemia. Changes in some of the circulating parameters that we studied may have direct or indirect effects on gene expression that may not be efficiently modeled by linear associations, however despite this limitation, the method supported the detection of other known associations such as heme metabolism with LPS [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and bile acid metabolism with total cholesterol [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p><p>The study of the whole blood transcriptome inherently implies a dynamic mixture of cells that will change during a stimuli such as feeding with a known increase in neutrophils and leukocytes postprandially [<xref rid="pone.0192947.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192947.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. This was considered in our study by estimations of cellular composition using CellMix and by verifying the consequence of removing a sample identified as an outlier based on estimated cellular composition. While the inter-individual variation in the cell type composition was more marked than the postprandial variation, it should be noted that the observed effects on gene expression that we report, in particular those that are associated with inflammatory processes, may relate to the compositional changes in cell type rather than absolute changes in gene expression. Nevertheless, this approach can still be used as a proxy measure of global gene expression in blood.</p><p>The lack of strong effects detected on gene expression during the short-term test phases may be due to other factors (external to diet) that influence the fasting levels of gene expression meaning that the effect of relatively small changes in the diet is difficult to discern. Alternatively, a longer exposure to the dietary intervention used in our study may be necessary to observe an effect on the fasting state. In both cases, the rationale to use the postprandial approach as a sensitive method for assessing diet-specific effects on the blood transcriptome is justified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We observed that while probiotic yoghurt and acidified milk elicit different responses on gene expression, this in part relates to differences in the timing of the postprandial response. The dairy products modulated some common pathways during the postprandial phase, notably including various inflammatory or immune genes. The whole blood transcriptome appeared to be a sensitive surrogate marker of metabolic processes that showed coherence with established clinical biomarkers but also revealed subtle differences in the responses to the dairy products that were not captured by these biomarkers. The development of nutrition-specific genesets as well as the combined assessment of metabolomic with transcriptomic data could help better exploit this tool in the context of nutritional interventions. This approach nevertheless remains a promising method to complement classical biomarkers and metabolome evaluation to help better discriminate the metabolic responses to dietary intake in a healthy population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0192947.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Kinetic changes in estimated cell populations for the three major blood cell populations: neutrophils (A), lymphocytes (B) and monocytes (C) for samples taken at during acute intake of dairy (0&#x02013;6 h) and after 2 weeks daily intake of the dairy products.</title><p>Kinetics are coloured for each subject (F3_0XX), with symbols representing acidified milk (circles) and yoghurt (triangles) test days.
