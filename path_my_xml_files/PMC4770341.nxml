Preclinical studies with ABT-639, a peripherally acting highly selective T-type Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 calcium channel blocker, showed dose-dependent reduction of pain in multiple pain models. ABT-639 also demonstrated an acceptable safety profile at single- and multiple-dose levels evaluated in a clinical phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The primary objective of this phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of ABT-639 with placebo in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain. Pregabalin, an approved treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy, was included as a positive control. A total of 194 patients were randomized and treated for 6 weeks; 62 patients received ABT-639 (100 mg twice daily), 70 patients received pregabalin (150 mg twice daily), and 62 patients received placebo. When assessing the mean changes from baseline in patient-recorded pain scores at the end of week 6, there was no significant difference observed for ABT-639 compared with placebo (&#x02212;2.28 vs &#x02212;2.36; <italic>P</italic> = 0.582). Pregabalin treatment resulted in a transient improvement in pain compared with placebo, which did not persist throughout the study. There were no significant safety issues identified with ABT-639. A majority of adverse events were considered mild to moderate in intensity. In conclusion, treatment with the highly selective T-type Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 calcium channel blocker ABT-639 100 mg twice daily for 6 weeks showed no safety signals that would preclude further investigation but did not reduce neuropathic pain in patients with diabetes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01345045).</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Diabetic neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>ABT-639</kwd><kwd>T-type calcium channels</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>1.

Over the last several years, a body of evidence has emerged indicating that activation of these channels contributes to ongoing chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 is the predominant T-type calcium channel in sensory nerves that modulates nociception.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 is expressed primarily in dorsal root ganglion neurons and peripheral receptive fields, as well as in the spinal cord dorsal horn and the brain.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Preclinical pharmacology, animal intrathecal Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 antisense oligonucleotide administration, and genetic knockdown studies support the role of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 channels in pain.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>ABT-639 is a peripherally acting highly selective T-type Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 calcium channel blocker.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> It is significantly less active at other calcium channels (eg, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2) and shows only weak or no activity on other calcium channels, including L-type and P/Q-type channels.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Preclinically, ABT-639 produced a dose-dependent reduction of nociception and increased tactile allodynia thresholds in multiple neuropathic pain models, including mechanical hypersensitivity in a spinal nerve ligation model, a chronic constriction injury model, a vincristine chemotherapy&#x02013;induced neuropathic pain model, and a monoiodoacetic acid&#x02013;induced joint pain model.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In a phase 1 first-in-human study, ABT-639 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile at all single- and multiple-dose levels evaluated.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>The primary objective of this phase 2 proof-of-concept study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of investigational drug ABT-639 with placebo in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain. Pregabalin, approved for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, was included in this study as a comparator.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1. Patients</title><p>Male and female patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years with diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2 with a diagnosis of distal symmetric diabetic polyneuropathy and the presence of pain due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy for at least 6 months were included in this study. Patients were enrolled from approximately 40 sites in North America and Europe. Patients must have had a score of &#x02265;2.5 on the physical assessment portion of the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) at screening, a score of &#x02265;4 on the Brief Pain Inventory 24-hour average pain at screening, and an average score of &#x02265;4 and &#x0003c;10 on the 24-hour average pain score (0-10 numerical rating scale) collected from the daily electronic diary over approximately 7 consecutive (minimum of 5) days before the baseline visit. Patients had to have been taking a stable antidiabetic medication regimen for 30 days before randomization.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had any clinically significant neuropathic pain condition other than painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Patients were excluded if they had a history of hypoglycemia with unconsciousness, ketoacidosis, any changes in diabetes therapy (during the 3 months before the study), or a lower-extremity amputation (other than toes) due to diabetes. Patients were also excluded if they had any history of major depressive episodes within the past 2 years, a history of major psychiatric disorders, or any significant cardiovascular abnormalities. The use of anticonvulsants, antidepressants (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin&#x02013;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [patients may have been eligible if on a stable dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]), opioids, tramadol, or topical analgesics containing lidocaine or capsaicin were not permitted throughout the course of the study. All patients voluntarily signed an informed consent form, approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board, before the conduct of any study-specific procedures. Patients were enrolled in this study between April 27, 2011, and October 26, 2011.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>2.2. Study design and treatment</title><p>This was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-controlled, parallel group study. The study included a 4-week screening/washout phase, a 6-week treatment phase, and a 1-week follow-up phase. During the washout period, patients discontinued all current medications for the treatment of neuropathic pain including, but not limited to, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin&#x02013;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tramadol, opioids, steroids, topical analgesics containing lidocaine or capsaicin, and other prohibited medications.</p><p>Patients were randomized through the computer-generated IVRS/IWRS system in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the 3 treatment groups. At the baseline visit (day 1), patients received a blinded kit of study drug (ABT-639, placebo, or pregabalin) and were instructed to take the evening dose of 2 capsules, with or without food. On days 2 through 7, patients self-administered the study drug twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, as follows: ABT-639 100 mg (2 &#x000d7; 50-mg capsules), pregabalin 75 mg (1 &#x000d7; 75-mg capsule and 1 placebo capsule), or placebo (2 capsules). Patients treated with pregabalin were titrated from 75 mg twice daily to 150 mg twice daily at the end of the first week of study drug administration. The use of acetaminophen was permitted as a rescue medication and was limited to 3000 mg per day and recorded in the daily diary. Dose selection of ABT-639 was based on the results from a phase 1 study along with the data obtained from preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> A 100-mg twice daily dose of ABT-639 was selected for this study as this dose was tolerated in the phase 1 study and was expected to be safe and to demonstrate an adequate tolerability profile in this 6-week outpatient study.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In addition, this dose was projected to be efficacious based on preclinical animal pain model data.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> For pregabalin, the dose of 300 mg/d was chosen in accordance with the approved dosage for diabetic neuropathic pain.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The investigators, study coordinator, and patients remained blinded to each patient's treatment throughout the course of the study. The placebo capsules for ABT-639 were identical in appearance to the ABT-639 capsules. Pregabalin tablets were overencapsulated into capsules that were identical in appearance to ABT-639 capsules.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Guideline as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation, The Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable federal and local regulations and institutional review board.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2.3. Assessments</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>2.3.1. Daily pain assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline to the final weekly mean of the 24-hour average pain score derived from the patient's daily pain diary. The pain score was based on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain imaginable. Patients recorded the pain score daily on an electronic patient-reported outcomes device (diary). Secondary end points included the worst pain during the day and nighttime pain, both of which were based on an 11-point NRS; pain intensity in the morning, which was based on a 5-point verbal scale; daily sleep score interference scale, which was based on an 11-point NRS; rescue medication usage; Brief Pain Inventory (short form [BPI-SF]) Interference only score, which was used to capture patients' interference by pain; and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory total intensity score, which was calculated from 10 questions regarding the severity of common neuropathic pain qualities (ie, burning, pressure, squeezing, electric shock, stabbing, tingling, and pins and needles) and from pain evoked by brushing, pressure, and cold. In addition, the number and proportion of patients with &#x02265;30% or &#x02265;50% pain reduction were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>2.3.2. Quality-of-life assessments</title><p>At scheduled study visits, several quality-of-life assessments were completed, including the Patients Global Impression of Change, in which patients evaluated their overall general impression of how they felt since beginning the study medication; Neuropathic Pain Impact on Quality of Life, which is a questionnaire designed to assess the neuropathic pain and the effect it has on the quality of daily life; and the EuroQuol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L), which is a 5-dimensional tool capturing patient's mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>2.3.3. Pharmacokinetic assessments</title><p>Blood samples for the assay of ABT-639 were collected at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6. Plasma concentrations of ABT-639 were determined under the supervision of the drug analysis department at Abbott (North Chicago, IL) using a validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (laser diode thermal desorption with tandem mass spectrometry). In brief, the analytical method was validated over the concentration range of 1.11 to 3450 ng/mL for the plasma analyses, with all calibration curves having <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> values greater than 0.993. The lower limit of quantitation value for ABT-639 was 1.1 ng/mL. The coefficient of variation values ranged from 2.3% to 26.8% and mean bias values ranged from &#x02212;4.5% to 5.8%.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-4"><title>2.3.4. Safety assessments</title><p>Safety was assessed using observed and spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs) that were classified, according to the investigator's opinion, by severity and relationship to study treatment and were coded using the <italic>Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</italic> (version 14.0). All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 days after the last dose of study drug administration were collected. Findings on patients' physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and results from clinical laboratory tests were assessed throughout the study, at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6, 1-week posttreatment follow-up, and on any discontinuation of treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>2.4. Statistical analysis</title><p>Efficacy analyses were performed on a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) data set. The mITT data set included all randomized patients who took at least 1 dose of the study drug, except that patients treated at 1 site were excluded due to data quality issues at that site. Demographic and safety analyses were performed on the ITT and mITT data sets (mITT data not presented). Statistical tests were evaluated at a significance level of 0.05, using 1-sided tests for efficacy analyses and 2-sided tests for all other analyses. For all efficacy analyses, the primary comparison was between the ABT-639 treatment group and the placebo treatment group in the mITT population. Patients who were missing the 24-hour average pain baseline score or were missing all postbaseline 24-hour average pain scores were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis, and data for these patients were not imputed. Secondary analyses evaluated by weekly intervals were conducted using the last observation carried forward and observed case methodologies. Secondary efficacy variables used the last nonmissing observation at or before the baseline visit, and the &#x0201c;final&#x0201d; refers to the last nonmissing observation no more than 3 days after the last dose of the study drug.</p><p>The sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy variable, weekly mean of the 24-hour average pain score, and the primary comparison between the ABT-639 treatment group and the placebo group. The sample size was sufficient to detect a difference of 1.25 points (effect size of 0.5) between the ABT-639 and placebo groups with at least 80% power and type-1 error at 0.05 for a 1-sided test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>3.

Regardless of treatment, most AEs were considered mild or moderate in intensity, with severe AEs reported by 8 patients: 2 (3%) patients in the placebo group, 3 (5%) patients in the ABT-639 group, and 3 patients (4%) in the pregabalin group.</p><p>The most frequently reported TEAEs (&#x02265;3%) in the ABT-639 treatment group, and at rates numerically higher than those reported with placebo, were abdominal distension (5%), muscle spasms (5%), viral gastroenteritis (3%), insomnia (3%), nasopharyngitis (3%), rash (3%), and sinusitis (3%) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). There were no significant differences between the ABT-639 and placebo groups based on incidence of any specific AE. Patients treated with pregabalin experienced AEs commonly reported for this medication, including 7 (10%) patients experiencing peripheral edema, 3 (4%) patients reporting somnolence, and 2 (3%) patients reporting dizziness. In comparison, only 1 (2%) patient treated with ABT-639 reported either peripheral edema or dizziness. There was a significant difference between the pregabalin and placebo groups based on incidence of peripheral edema (10% vs 0%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and constipation (0% vs 6.5%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Five patients experienced a serious AE: 1 patient (a 64-year-old white female in the ABT-639 group) experienced angina pectoris with onset on day 11 and resolved on day 15, which was not considered related to ABT-639 treatment by the investigator, 1 patient in the placebo group had pneumonia, and 3 patients in the pregabalin group experienced 9 serious AEs: 1 patient developed acute cholecystitis and postoperative wound infection, 1 patient developed intraocular melanoma, and 1 patient developed myocardial infarction, nausea, pyrexia, renal failure, lung infiltration, and urticaria.</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events reported in 3% or more patients in the ABT-639 group (ITT).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jop-156-2013-g007"/></table-wrap><p>In general, there were no statistically significant differences from baseline to final assessment in laboratory values between ABT-639 and placebo, with the exception of a decrease in mean change from baseline to final uric acid for ABT-639 compared with placebo, which was not deemed to be clinically meaningful.

Discussion</title><p>This phase 2 proof-of-concept study compared the analgesic efficacy and safety of ABT-639 with placebo in patients with diabetes with peripheral neuropathic pain for 6 weeks. There was no significant difference from baseline to the final weekly mean of the 24-hour average pain score when comparing patients treated with ABT-639 and patients receiving placebo. In addition, there were no clinically meaningful or significant differences for the other secondary end points between the ABT-639 and placebo treatment groups.</p><p>It is unlikely that the absence of analgesic efficacy of ABT-639 observed in this trial resulted from trial design or conduct because pregabalin, a positive control for assay sensitivity, demonstrated pain reduction for the first 2 weeks. Although the analgesic effect of pregabalin did not persist throughout the study, the current trial is not the first study to show the inconsistent performance of pregabalin in neuropathic pain trials.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Pregabalin does have a dose-dependent effect; and perhaps at higher doses, a greater reduction in pain and improvement in quality of life would be obtained.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, because 300 mg/d pregabalin is the highest approved dose in the United States for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetes, a higher dose could not be used in this trial. Nevertheless, the lack of a persistent effect of pregabalin treatment throughout the 6-week treatment period is one of the limitations of this study. Thus, the possibility of a false-negative result for ABT-639 cannot be completely ruled out. Perhaps, another active comparator such as duloxetine could have been used in this study; however, given the mechanisms of action of pregabalin and ABT-639, pregabalin was considered a better option. Another limitation of the trial is that it may have been too short to detect efficacy of ABT-639. However, based on the mechanism of ABT-639, it should not have taken more than 6 weeks to see an effect or at least a trend in efficacy.</p><p>It is conceivable that the ABT-639 dose of 100-mg twice daily was not high enough to produce an analgesic effect of ABT-639. This is particularly noteworthy given that the tolerability and safety profile from a phase 1 study and the current trial was benign and there were no significant safety issues identified.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, based on the findings from animal toxicology studies,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> it was determined that 100-mg twice daily ABT-639 was the appropriate highest dose with an adequate safety margin for this proof-of-concept study. In addition, the dose used in this study was predicted to provide an exposure level above what was required for efficacy in humans based on the projection from preclinical animal models.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Indeed, ABT-639 pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that plasma concentrations obtained from this study in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain were consistent with previous predictions and exposures observed in healthy adults for the same dosing regimen<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and were within the preclinically predicted plasma level range required for human efficacy, suggesting that lack of efficacy of the 100-mg twice daily dose is unlikely due to underexposure of ABT-639. Furthermore, the relatively high placebo response observed in this study and others may obscure any potential reduction in pain that may occur at this dose of ABT-639.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Nevertheless, whether a higher dose of ABT-639 would exert an acceptable efficacy in neuropathic pain remains uncertain.</p><p>In this study, ABT-639 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. The proportion of patients who experienced TEAEs in the ABT-639 treatment group was lower than that experienced by patients in the placebo group, although this difference was not significant. Although more than 51% of patients experienced at least 1 TEAE, most TEAEs were considered to be mild to moderate in intensity, with TEAEs considered to be possibly or probably related to study drug occurring in 16% of patients receiving ABT-639, 24% of patients receiving pregabalin, and 24% of patients receiving placebo. In general, there were very few AEs related to the central nervous system in the ABT-639 treatment group. There was a significant difference in mean change from baseline in uric acid levels at all visits and the final measurement in this study; however, this was not considered to be clinically meaningful and had been previously observed in the completed phase 1 study.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Overall, ABT-639 100-mg given twice daily demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain. For patients in the pregabalin treatment group, the observed incidences of the most frequently reported AEs, dizziness and somnolence, were lower in this study compared with other clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Although the exact reason is unclear, this may be explained by the fact that some patients enrolled in this study were treated previously with pregabalin and gabapentin and, therefore, may have developed a tolerance to these pregabalin-associated AEs.</p><p>The disconnection between human data in the current trial and preclinical animal data represents one of the greatest challenges in analgesic drug development, particularly with ion channel blockers. There are no validated biomarkers that can demonstrate target engagement. In parallel with this phase 2 proof-of-concept study, a microneurography study and a human experimental pain study were conducted with ABT-639 in an attempt to bridge preclinical and clinical findings.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Microneurography is a technique that directly assesses abnormal spontaneous activity in C-nociceptors as a marker for spontaneous pain; however, in that study, ABT-639 did not show the reduction of spontaneous activity of nociceptive C-fibers in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In the capsaicin experimental pain study, ABT-639 failed to show an effect on pain induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin in healthy human volunteers.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, ABT-639 demonstrated antinociceptive effects in multiple animal pain models (eg, spinal nerve ligation, vincristine-induced, and capsaicin-induced secondary hypersensitivity).<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although the data from this phase 2 proof-of-concept study are consistent with findings from the above 2 studies, further analysis of the data and understanding of the discrepancies between preclinical and clinical outcomes is warranted.</p><p>The failure of achieving proof-of-concept with ABT-639 in this study does not support T-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 as a potential target for treating diabetic neuropathic pain. However, another T-type calcium channel blocker, Z944, which may be less selective and more central-acting, has shown reduction in pain scores in human experimental pain models and in preclinical studies.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Therefore, targeting of T-type calcium channel blockers for the treatment of chronic pain should not be discarded without further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</p><p>W.
