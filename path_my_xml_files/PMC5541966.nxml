Moreover, <italic>Ramadan</italic> is accompanied by several personal lifestyles and societal changes, including a delay in starting work, nocturnal prayers, and the opening of stores and shopping malls until predawn time.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Furthermore, habits and meal frequency and timing change during <italic>Ramadan</italic>, for example, some cultures prefer fried foods and consume an excessive amount of sweets.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Studies have shown that high fat and sugar intake can lead to changes in clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and other peripheral brain nuclei (non-SCN brain nuclei).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] During <italic>Ramadan</italic>, the usual circadian pattern of eating shifts suddenly, which results in an increase in caloric intake at night. The increased caloric intake at night has been proposed as a mechanism that possibly affects the circadian rhythm and results in a loss of the temporal control (circadian disruption) of metabolic processes during fasting,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] given that the timing of meals and glucose levels have been shown to affect the circadian rhythm.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The melatonin rhythm is one biological marker of circadian rhythmicity, which conveys messages to the body about the daily light/dark cycle.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Although several tissues in the body produce melatonin, the circulating neurohormone is derived almost exclusively from the pineal gland.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Melatonin is believed to be one of the best markers for circadian rhythm disruption because individual melatonin profiles are highly reproducible and are less affected by masking factors than are other markers of circadian rhythms, such as core body temperature or cortisol level.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Two previous studies have suggested a shift delay in the peak of melatonin during <italic>Ramadan</italic>. However, neither study controlled for food intake, sleep/wake schedule, energy expenditure (exercise) nor the social habits that accompany <italic>Ramadan</italic>. In addition, there was no proper control for light exposure. Moreover, in both studies, the melatonin concentrations were not measured in the early morning, thus neglecting possible early morning peaks in melatonin concentration. Thus, whether Islamic intermittent fasting influences the circadian pattern of circulating melatonin remains undefined. We hypothesized that if we control for the above confounders, <italic>Ramadan</italic> daytime fasting will not influence the circadian pattern of circulating melatonin. Therefore, we designed the present study to assess the circadian pattern of plasma melatonin during and outside the <italic>Ramadan</italic> month while controlling for the sleep/wake schedule, sleep duration and quality, meal composition, energy expenditure, and light exposure.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study is a part of a research project to assess the effects of intermittent fasting on sleep architecture, circadian rhythm, hormonal changes, and different cellular biomarkers.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, the current melatonin data have not been reported before.

The selected volunteers were not on any medications, did not drink alcohol, did not perform shift work, and were not on vacation during the study period. None of the participants had sleep complaints or was on any dietary program. In addition, the selected volunteers were not practicing fasting as routine voluntary rituals before.

The present study was designed to assess the changes in the plasma levels of melatonin during intermittent fasting, while controlling for potential confounders that might affect the levels of the hormone, such as the sleep/wake schedule, sleep duration and quality, physical activity, light exposure, and meal composition. Moreover, to control for potential confounders that accompany the lifestyle changes during <italic>Ramadan</italic>, we assessed the effects of intermittent Islamic FOR. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effects of intermittent Islamic fasting on melatonin plasma concentrations outside of the <italic>Ramadan</italic> season.</p><p>The main finding of this study is that melatonin levels followed the same circadian pattern during BL, FOR, and <italic>Ramadan</italic>, although there was a decrease at 22:00 h during the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of <italic>Ramadan</italic> compared to BL <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. However, in our study, when a cosinor model was used; no shift delay was detected in the acrophase during the three periods.</p><p>During <italic>Ramadan</italic>, food and fluid intake are shifted to the hours of darkness, thus partially reversing the normal circadian pattern of eating and drinking. In theory, these changes could affect circadian rhythmicity in fasting individuals, with effects including changes in several hormone systems and the core body temperature.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] A limited number of studies has objectively assessed the circadian rhythm changes during <italic>Ramadan</italic>, and the results suggested a shift delay in the circadian rhythmicity of body temperature.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In a well-designed study, Roky <italic>et al</italic>. continuously recorded body temperature for 24 h in six healthy participants during <italic>Ramadan</italic> using a rectal thermistor probe and reported delays in both the occurrence of the acrophase and bathyphase of body temperature (i.e., the times at which the calculated maximum and minimum values, respectively, occur in the cycle).[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The shift delay in core body temperature was attributed to the shift to night time meals during <italic>Ramadan</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Whether a shift delay also occurs in the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion remained unknown.</p><p>Theoretically, changes in the circadian pattern of body temperature during <italic>Ramadan</italic> should also be associated with alterations in the circadian pattern of melatonin secretion, although some studies suggested that shifting the meal time influences the core body temperature rhythm but not the melatonin rhythm.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] To date, two studies have assessed melatonin secretion during <italic>Ramadan</italic>. In the first study, the plasma melatonin levels were measured in blood samples obtained every 4 h (omitting the 02:00 time point to avoid sleep disturbances) before and on the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of <italic>Ramadan</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The investigators reported a smaller and delayed night peak and a flatter slope in serum melatonin concentrations during <italic>Ramadan</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In the second study, saliva samples for melatonin were collected from eight healthy volunteers at three-time points over a 24 h period (08:00, 16:00, and 00:00) 1 week before <italic>Ramadan</italic> and on the 7<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> days of <italic>Ramadan</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] A significant decrease in melatonin concentrations at 00:00 and 16:00 h was reported during <italic>Ramadan</italic> compared to BL levels; however, similar trends in melatonin profiles were observed during <italic>Ramadan</italic> but with a flatter slope.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] A major limitation in those previous two studies was that melatonin was not measured in the early morning hours, which overlooks the possibility of a late peak in melatonin concentrations. Moreover, neither study properly controlled for differences in light exposure, sleep schedule, or the social habits that accompany <italic>Ramadan</italic>.</p><p>To overcome the shortcomings of these studies, we assessed circadian patterns in melatonin during intermittent fasting outside the month of <italic>Ramadan</italic> and during the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of <italic>Ramadan</italic> after controlling for light exposure, sleep schedule, sleep duration, and meal composition. A trough in melatonin levels was observed at 11:00 h and a peak at 02:00 h during all studied periods, which indicates that intermittent fasting has no significant influence on the circadian pattern of melatonin.</p><p>The current study concurs with the previous studies[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in reporting lower nocturnal melatonin levels. In general, most studies consistently found a decrease in nocturnal melatonin concentrations during fasting, even during short-term experimental fasting.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Although the exact mechanisms involved in the reduction of melatonin levels during fasting are unknown, this finding could be related to the shift in meal time. In a study that assessed the effects of a single morning and evening carbohydrate-rich meal for 3 consecutive days on the circadian phase of salivary melatonin rhythms under controlled constant routine conditions in ten healthy participants, the nocturnal melatonin secretion after the last morning meal was elevated compared to that for the evening meal.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Another plausible mechanism is the rise in nocturnal cortisol levels during <italic>Ramadan</italic>, which could be associated with a drop in melatonin levels.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] In addition, the decrease in melatonin synthesis could be due to a decrease in glucose supply.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] The latter hypothesis is supported by findings showing that melatonin levels are decreased secondary to mild hypoglycemia and that glucose supplementation during fasting ameliorates the decrease in melatonin levels.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Nevertheless, hypoglycemia is not believed to occur in healthy individuals during Ramada <italic>n</italic> fasting.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Moreover, glucose level did not change significantly in the current study.</p><p>Although the present study was conducted under well-controlled conditions, the meal time during fasting periods could not be matched to the BL because the shift in meal time is an essential part of the religious practice during fasting. The effect of meal time on melatonin levels in humans remains undefined. Indeed, there are very few uncontrolled studies investigating the effects of meal timing on circadian rhythms in humans.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In shift workers, meal timing does not appear to be a strong synchronizer of circadian rhythms.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] In fact, daily meal timing does not usually entrain circadian rhythms controlled by the SCN clock in the presence of the photic synchronizer.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] In contrast to the peripheral organs, the SCN clock seems to be invulnerable to feeding time and remains in phase with the light&#x02013;dark cycle.[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</p><p>A number of limitations of the present study must be considered. An important one is the relatively small number of participants examined due to the time constraints of the study protocol. Nevertheless, small participant numbers are typical in studies that use objective continuous assessment methods under controlled conditions and must be conducted within a limited time (the month of <italic>Ramadan</italic>) as both of these factors limit the number of recruited volunteers.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Second, the fact that the participants were recruited within a university setting, which may limit how well the sample represents the general population since individuals in this group are more likely to be more educated than the general public. Third, females were not included as females have to break their fast while having menstruation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our investigation of plasma melatonin concentration in eight fasting participants during and before <italic>Ramadan</italic> revealed that under controlled conditions of light exposure, meals, and sleep-wake schedules, intermittent fasting does not significantly influence the circadian pattern of circulating melatonin.
