The main outcome variable of interest is hospital readmission. Other outcome measures such as quality of life and patient satisfaction have also been examined. Results of these transitional care programmes are mixed, partly due to their diverse and heterogeneous approaches, which make it difficult to draw firm conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C2">2</xref>]. In his systematic review, Scott [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C3">3</xref>] categorised the intervention approaches into single component and integrated multicomponent interventions. In the single intervention category, only educational interventions with self-management approaches, post-discharge home visits and telephone follow-up were found to have significant effects on readmissions. As for the multicomponent interventions, those that assessed discharge needs, enhanced patient education and counseling, and conducted early follow-up of high-risk patients had significantly reduced use of hospital services. One might question whether more means better for the multicomponent programmes. Drewes <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C4">4</xref>] conducted a systematic review including meta-regression analyses, finding that the number of components of chronic disease management had no association with the outcomes. Another systematic review could not identify a discrete single or bundled intervention that could reliably reduce rehospitalisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C5">5</xref>].</p><p>We know that many of the transitional discharge support programmes that reported positive outcomes are bundled with a combination of components, including patient assessment, and care management with an emphasis on patient education and self-empowerment. The nurse supported by a multidisciplinary team is usually the key person in these programmes, and home visits and telephone calls are the two most common approaches of care delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C7">7</xref>]. We do not know whether there is a differential effect between telephone calls and home visits within the bundled interventions. This study was therefore launched to examine the overall effects of a transitional care programme among a group of discharged patients with chronic diseases, and included a telephone call group only in order to examine its differential effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="aft123_s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="aft123_s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomised controlled trial with three groups. The intervention group had two arms, one receiving both home visits and telephone calls and the other receiving telephone calls only. The control group received placebo calls. All groups received usual care, which involved basic health advice, medication instructions and arrangements for outpatient follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="aft123_s2b"><title>Setting and subjects</title><p>The study took place in the medical department of an acute general hospital with 1700 beds in Hong Kong during the period from August 2010 to June 2012. We estimated the sample size based on a previous study using a similar transitional care programme for general medical patients, which resulted in a 21.7% improvement in their readmission rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C7">7</xref>]. A sample size of 182 for each group would be needed for a power of 80% and a 5% level of significance.</p><p>The random assignment was computer generated, placed in sealed envelopes and opened sequentially at the time of randomisation. After a subject was successfully recruited, the research assistant would call the site investigator, who had no knowledge of the identity of the subject, for random assignment. A total of 708 subjects were assessed for eligibility and 98 were excluded from the randomisation for various reasons (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AFT123F1">1</xref>). The subject inclusion criteria were: (i) a primary diagnosis related to respiratory, diabetic, cardiac and renal conditions, (ii) MMSE &#x0003e;20, (iii) ability to speak Cantonese, (iv) living within the service area and (v) can be contacted by phone. The exclusion criteria were: (i) discharged to assisted care facilities, (ii) being followed up by an immediate designated disease management programme after discharge, (iii) inability to communicate and (iv) discharged for end-of-life care. This study targeted patients with chronic conditions because evidence suggested that they have post-discharge needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C8">8</xref>] and the four chronic conditions selected were those that are most prevalent in this study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C8">8</xref>].<fig id="AFT123F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flow chart of subject progress through the phases of randomisation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aft12301"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="aft123_s2c"><title>Placebo calls for the control group</title><p>The control group received two placebo calls which were social calls made by a research assistant not involved in data collection (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/aft123/-/DC1">Supplementary data available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online, Appendix 1</ext-link> for the call protocol).</p></sec><sec id="aft123_s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention programme included a pre-discharge assessment and a 4-week post-discharge follow-up involving two home visits (Weeks 1 and 3) and two phone calls (Weeks 2 and 4). In each of the structured event, the nurse case manager (NCM) would conduct assessment and intervention based on the Omaha System [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C9">9</xref>] which addressed patients' needs in the domains of environment, psychosocial, physiological and health-related behaviour. Studies have shown the benefits of a comprehensive approach of post-discharge support among patients with chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C8">8</xref>]. The home visits, telephone calls and referrals were governed by protocols to ensure a consistent approach of care delivery. The NCM was assisted by trained nursing students to provide part of the interventions. A previous study has shown that the use of trained volunteers to support NCMs in providing post-discharge care brought about positive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C7">7</xref>]. The design of the programmes was based on the 4 Cs model proposed by Wong <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C7">7</xref>]. The 4 Cs represent comprehensiveness, continuity, collaboration and coordination, which are key features that have proved to be effective for transitional care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C7">7</xref>]. Comprehensiveness involves a holistic assessment of the patient's condition by the NCM. Continuity refers to regular, active and sustained follow-up care provided weekly. Collaboration is the partnering with the geriatrician to address patients' needs, such as medication or treatment plan review. The NCM set mutual goals with the patients so that they would take up an active role in managing one's own health. The coordination of different efforts was facilitated by the NCM. The intervention arrangement is as follows (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/aft123/-/DC1">Supplementary data available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online, Appendix 1</ext-link> for the intervention protocols).</p><sec id="aft123_s2d1"><title>Pre-discharge</title><p>Before patients were discharged, the NCM would conduct a pre-discharge assessment based on the Omaha System.</p></sec><sec id="aft123_s2d2"><title>Post-discharge</title><p>The NCM applied the Omaha System to assess, intervene and implement the transitional care programme constructed with the same design for the home and call groups.

First, this study has detected the difference between the effectiveness of home visits with calls and that of telephone calls only in a bundled intervention programme. Secondly, this study initiated a transitional model of care that uses a skill mix, involving nursing students to support the nurse case manager. The use of assistants to support qualified providers is becoming more popular in healthcare delivery models, but there are few studies testing the effectiveness of the skill mix in transitional care.</p><p>Similar to our study (OR = 0.58, CI: 0.36&#x02013;0.94), a systematic analysis revealed that groups with post-discharge support involving combined home visits and calls were less likely to be readmitted (RR = 0.75, CI: 0.64&#x02013;0.88) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C2">2</xref>]. Another systematic review showed no significant benefit of telephone support only (RR = 0.95, CI: 0.89&#x02013;1.02) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C17">17</xref>] and this concurs with our finding (OR = 0.62, CI: 0.35&#x02013;1.10). Mere telephone calls are not potent enough to control readmission at a significant level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C17">17</xref>], whereas previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C19">19</xref>] have shown that home visits alone are not effective in controlling readmissions and can be costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C20">20</xref>]. As confirmed in this study, the combination of home visits and calls tends to bring about significant effects not only in readmissions, but also quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C21">21</xref>], self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C7">7</xref>] and satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C22">22</xref>].</p><p>This study initiated a transitional model of care that used a skill mix with the nursing students supporting the nurse case managers. In the contemporary healthcare system facing resource constraints, the redesigning of the healthcare model to incorporate different skill mixes is advocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C23">23</xref>]. Support workers could help qualified health workers in the form of job substitution, by implementing some of the work requiring less competence but working towards the goals prescribed by professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C23">23</xref>]. Well-trained care assistants allow qualified nurses to focus primarily on work that specifically requires the skill set of a registered nurse, such as assessment, prescription of intervention plan and case management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C25">25</xref>]. A systematic review revealed that support from a stroke liaison worker in the form of a healthcare worker or a volunteer had no effects on health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C26">26</xref>]. Another study, on the other hand, found that trained volunteers were effective to support the nurse case manager to reduce hospital readmissions and enhance quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C7">7</xref>]. There is little empirical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of skill mix in post-discharge care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AFT123C25">25</xref>] and this study adds to the literature.</p><sec id="aft123_s5a"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study was conducted among patients with chronic diseases in a regional hospital in Hong Kong and results may not be able to be generalised to patients in other places.

It is the first to reveal that telephone calls alone may not be sufficient to bring about significant reductions in readmissions. Bundled interventions involving both home visits and calls are more beneficial for patients after discharge.
