After an overnight fasting of at least 10 h, the subjects received single oral dose of test or reference product with either of the product as per randomization schedule in each period with a washout period of 10 days. The pre-dose blood sample was collected within a period of one h before dosing. The post-dose blood samples were collected at specified time intervals up to 96 h. The plasma concentrations of clonidine were quantified by validated LCMS/MS method and pharmacokinetic parameters were computed. The 90% confidence intervals of test/reference ratios for C<sub>max</sub> and area under the plasma-concentration- time-curve AUC under 0-t were found to be between 0.80 and 1.25 for log-transformed data. Analysis of variance did not show significant difference to these parameters. No meaningful values of K<sub>el</sub> and therefore AUC under 0-infinity could be calculated for significant number of subjects due to enterohepatic re-circulation. Based on the results obtained, two different brands of clonidine 25 &#x003bc;g tablets have comparable rate and extent of absorption after oral administration but failed to show bioequivalence as per regulatory requirement of Food and Drugs Administration-united states.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Enterohepatic re-circulation</kwd><kwd>clonidine hydrochloride</kwd><kwd>area under curve</kwd><kwd>analysis of variance</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Clonidine is an antihypertensive agent, which acts centrally by stimulating alpha<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors and producing a reduction in sympathetic tone, resulting in a fall in diastolic and systolic blood pressure and a reduction in heart rate. Treatment with clonidine diminishes the responsiveness of peripheral vessels to constrictor and dilator stimuli, thereby preventing the vascular changes associated with migraine. Clonidine, as an imidazoline, binds to imidazoline receptors (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>), in addition to its well described binding to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors. Two newer antihypertensive imidazolines, rilmenidine and moxonidine, have profile of action similar to clonidine, suggesting a role for I<sub>1</sub> receptors. However, the lack of an antihypertensive effect of clonidine in knockout mice lacking &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub> receptors supports a key role for these receptors in blood pressure regulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>]. Clonidine stimulates the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub> subtype of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors in the brainstem, resulting in a reduction in sympathetic outflow from the CNS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>]. The decrease in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine is correlated directly with the hypotensive effect[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>]. At doses higher than those required to stimulate central &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub> receptors, this drug can activate &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors of the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub> subtype on vascular smooth muscle cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]. This effect accounts for the initial vasoconstriction that is seen when overdose of clonidine taken and it has been postulated to be responsible for the loss of therapeutic effect that was observed with high doses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>].</p><p>The plasma level of clonidine peaks in approximately 3 to 5 h and the plasma half-life ranges from 12 to 16 h. The half-life increases up to 41 h in patients with severe impairment of renal function. Following oral administration about 40-60% of the absorbed dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h. About 50% of the absorbed dose is metabolized in the liver[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>]. The impact that enterohepatic cycling (EHC) has on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug depends on the importance of biliary excretion of the compound relative to renal and metabolic clearance processes and on the efficiency with which the compound is absorbed into the circulation from the gastrointestinal tract. when the compound is well absorbed and biliary secretion is a major clearance mechanism, EHC becomes prominent. As a result, a major fraction of the absorbed dose in the n<sup>th</sup> cycle participates in the (n+1)<sup>th</sup> cycle, leading to a cumulative body exposure to drug which may exceed the dose by several fold. In this context, EHC has a unique impact on both the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of the compound[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>].</p><p>Various pharmacokinetic studies confirm enterohepatic re-circulation of clonidine after oral administration. Special attention should be drawn to the unexpected findings like, late increase in the declining plasma levels and the non-linear relationship to dose of the absolute plasma concentration of clonidine. Both phenomenons are probably signs of the enterohepatic circulation of clonidine, which is already demonstrated earlier. As the pharmacokinetics of clonidine are most probably influenced by enterohepatic circulation, the kinetics cannot be described by conventional open one- to open two-compartment model, and these more complex process require a specially adapted multi-compartment model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>]. Enterohepatic re-circulation; being known characteristic of clonidine, the present study was designed to demonstrate the implication of it on assessment of bioequivalence of two different brands of clonidine.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted in 26 healthy adult volunteers (males), with a target age between 18-45 years having a body mass index (BMI) between 18-25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, who had no evidence of underlying disease or significant abnormal laboratory at screening and who voluntarily consented to participate in the study. The study was performed in accordance with the latest revisions to the Declaration of Helsinki, ethical approval having been obtained from the Independent Ethics Committee (WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan 2004) and Health/Regulatory Authority. All volunteers gave their written informed consent prior to commencement of the study. There is no financial and personal relationships exist between the authors and others that might bias their work. No potential conflicts exist between authors. Independent Ethics Committee approved the study protocol prior to initiation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design:</title><p>This was a randomized, open label, two treatment, two period, two sequence, single dose, two-way crossover, bioequivalence study of test product of clonidine hydrochloride 25 &#x003bc;g tablets and reference product of clonidine hydrochloride 25 &#x003bc;g tablets, in healthy human adult male subjects, under fasting conditions. The subjects were administered a single oral dose of either the test or reference product of 25 &#x003bc;g clonidine tablet. To eliminate the carryover effect of the drug, there was a washout period of 10 days between the period I and the period II. In each period, a total of 19 blood samples (5 ml each) were collected, prior to drug administration at 0.00 and after drug administration at 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, 36.0, 48.0, 72.0 and 96.0 h.

Subjects were instructed not to chew or crush the tablets, and were asked to take it with specified quantity of drinking water. Compliance was assessed by conducting a thorough examination of the oral cavity using flashlight and spatula by trained study personnel after dosing in each period and by measurement of plasma clonidine (during the analytical phase of the study). All subjects were dosed at the fixed time and restricted to remain supine for the first 2 h following drug administration. Subjects could be ambulatory and were advised to avoid severe physical exertion for remaining time of the each period. First 2 h post dose samples were collected at bedside and remaining blood samples were taken at sample collection area.</p><p>The order of administration of the test and reference products to each subject was determined according to the randomization scheme.

Whenever possible, all samples from each subject were analyzed on the same standard curve. Standard and quality control samples were included in each batch of study samples assayed. Samples with drug concentrations greater than the upper limit of the validated range of the assay were diluted with the appropriate drug-free biological fluid and re-assayed for those which were below the lower limit of this range were reported as being below LOQ. Repeat assays were done, if required after proper justification and documentation.

The following summary statistics for the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for both the test (A) and reference (B) product: N (No. of Subjects), Arithmetic Mean (Mean), Standard Deviation (SD), Maximum, Median and Percentage Coefficient of Variation (CV%). Additionally Geometric Mean (GM) was calculated for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-t</sub>. The log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were analyzed using generalized linear model procedure of SAS&#x000ae;. The Analysis of variance (ANOVA) model included sequence, formulation (treatment) and period as fixed effects and subjects nested within sequence as a random effect. The sequence effect was tested at the 0.10 level of significance using the mean square of subjects nested within sequence from the ANOVA as the error term, in the F-ratio of the sequence effect. All other main effects were tested at the 0.05 level of significance using the residual error (mean square error) from the ANOVA, as error term in the F-ratio for the respective main effects.</p><p>The ratio of the test and reference product averages (Least Square Means) was estimated for the differences in the Least Square Means (LSM) of the log-transformed data then taking the anti-log for the estimates. The 90% Confidence Interval for the ratio of test and reference was estimated using the&#x02018;t&#x02019; value at Mean Square Error Degrees of Freedom (df), and the Standard Error of Estimate.

All the volunteers were included in the safety evaluation. Of the 26 subjects enrolled, 24 volunteers received both the test and reference products during the study. Total five adverse events were reported in the study out of which; two adverse events (burning sensation and itching in perineum) were reported after test drug administration and three adverse events (fever, bodyache and abdominal pain) were reported after reference drug administration. All the adverse events were mild in nature and resolved completely before discharge of volunteers. There were no trends towards clinically significant changes in laboratory safety parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The main objective of the study was to determine the impact of enterohepatic re-circulation on assessment of bioequivalence of drugs exhibiting the said phenomenon. This study was carried out in accordance with the clinical research guidelines established by the Basic principles defined in the ICH E6 Guidelines for GCP, Indian council of medical research (ICMR) guidelines for biomedical research on human subjects, the principles enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki (Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, revised by the WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, 2004) and Standard Operating Procedures.</p><p>The drug concentration levels of clonidine in plasma were determined by a validated LC-MS/MS method. Sampling was done up to 96.0 h after dosing such that the plasma concentrations could be measured for adequately profiling the pharmacokinetics of the product and study periods were separated by a washout period of 10 days for complete elimination of the drug. The pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis was done on 24 subjects out of 26 subjects, excluding subject no. 02 and 13 who were lost to follow up in period II.</p><p>Analysis of variance for log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters revealed that there was no significant effect of variation due to period and formulation for all the pharmacokinetic parameters at 0.05 level of significance. The effect of sequence using subjects nested within sequence as error term for all the pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be statistically not significant at 0.10 level of significance.</p><p>Results obtained from the study indicated that both test and reference formulation demonstrated comparable rate and extent of absorption. But, for assessment of bioequivalence according to USFDA regulatory requirement, the 90% confidence interval of all three pharmacokinetic parameters i.e. C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> should fall between 80% to 125%. The present study fails to show bioequivalence if 90% confidence interval of AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> is taken into consideration. The main reason for non compliance of bioequivalence in terms of AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> may be enterohepatic re-circulation of clonidine. Further investigations are required to develop more complex modeling for such kind of drugs undergoing EHC during assessment of bioequivalence.</p><p>The study results revealed that, the two formulations under the investigation (i.e. Test and Reference) demonstrated comparable rate and extent of absorption in healthy human volunteers under fasting conditions, but failed to show bioequivalence as per USFDA regulatory requirement.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was conducted at Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Mehta, <italic>et al</italic>.: Bioequivalence Evaluation of Clonidine Hydrochloride Tablets</bold></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>MacMillan</surname><given-names>LB</given-names></name><name><surname>Hein</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Piascik</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name><name><surname>Limbird</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Central hypotensive effects of the &#x003b1;2A-adrenergic receptor subtype</article-title><source>Science</source><year>1996</year><volume>273</volume><fpage>801</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8670421</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>QM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lesnick</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Jasper</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Maclennan</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Dillon</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name><surname>Eqlen</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Cardiovascular effects of rilmenidine, moxonidine and clonidine in conscious wild-type and D79N &#x003b1;2A-adrenoceptor transgenic mice</article-title><source>Br J Pharmacol</source><year>1999</year><volume>126</volume><fpage>1522</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10217548</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Levinson</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimlichman</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitterman</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Stull</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Keiser</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clonidine suppresion testing in essential hypertension</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><year>1985</year><volume>102</volume><fpage>42</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3966744</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Link</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hein</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Chuscinski</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Cardiovascular regulation in mice lacking &#x003b1;2-adrenergic receptor subtypes b and c</article-title><source>Science</source><year>1996</year><volume>273</volume><fpage>803</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8670422</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Frisk-Holmberg</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Paalzow</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Wibell</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Relationship between the cardiovascular effects and steady-state kinetics of clonidine in hypertension</article-title><source>Eur J Clin Pharmacol</source><year>1984</year><volume>26</volume><fpage>309</fpage><lpage>13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6734692</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><source>Catapres&#x000ae;
