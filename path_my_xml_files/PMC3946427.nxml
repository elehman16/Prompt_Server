The aim of this study was to determine whether serial dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and magnetization transfer MRI (MT-MRI) are able to detect changes that accompany volume reduction in patients administered GnRH analogue drugs, a treatment which is known to reduce fibroid volume and perfusion. Our secondary aim was to determine whether rapid suppression of ovarian activity by combining GnRH agonist and antagonist therapies results in faster volume reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Forty women were assessed for eligibility at gynaecology clinics in the region, of whom thirty premenopausal women scheduled for hysterectomy due to symptomatic fibroids were randomized to three groups, receiving (1) GnRH agonist (Goserelin), (2) GnRH agonist+GnRH antagonist (Goserelin and Cetrorelix) or (3) no treatment. Patients were monitored by serial structural, DCE-MRI and MT-MRI, as well as by ultrasound and serum oestradiol concentration measurements from enrolment to hysterectomy (approximately 3 months).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A volumetric treatment effect assessed by structural MRI occurred by day 14 of treatment (9% median reduction versus 9% increase in untreated women; P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.022) and persisted throughout. Reduced fibroid perfusion and permeability assessed by DCE-MRI occurred later and was demonstrable by 2&#x02013;3 months (43% median reduction versus 20% increase respectively; P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0093). There was no apparent treatment effect by MT-MRI. Effective suppression of oestradiol was associated with early volume reduction at days 14 (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.041) and 28 (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0061).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>DCE-MRI is sensitive to the vascular changes thought to accompany successful GnRH analogue treatment of uterine fibroids and should be considered for use in future mechanism/efficacy studies of proposed fibroid drug therapies.

The burden of symptomatic fibroids has a major impact on health care use and costs <xref rid="pone.0089809-Rahn1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, with a significant number of women in the USA reported to have had a hysterectomy for fibroids <xref rid="pone.0089809-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, costing over $2 billion annually <xref rid="pone.0089809-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Surgery is the mainstay of the clinical management of symptomatic fibroids but has inherent risks. Medical therapies for improving heavy menstrual bleeding associated with fibroids do not improve symptoms associated with increased uterine volume. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are effective at reducing fibroid size <xref rid="pone.0089809-Sankaran1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> but are only licensed for short-term use. There is therefore an unmet clinical need for pharmacologic agents that alleviate all fibroid symptoms, thereby avoiding or delaying surgery, especially in women wishing to preserve fertility. However, in order to assess potential novel interventions, we need sensitive imaging approaches that can accurately identify changes in tissue volume, vascular properties and composition as surrogate biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>Against this background, our study aimed to compare serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches in monitoring and predicting response to GnRH analogue, a treatment which is expected to cause reductions in fibroid volume and perfusion. We used T2-weighted (T2W) MRI for estimation of uterine and fibroid volume, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for assessment of tissue perfusion and permeability, and magnetization transfer MRI (MT-MRI) to assess changes in fibrosis and macromolecular content. While these approaches have been explored extensively in other organs (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0089809-Bastin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089809-Harry1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>), there has been very limited application of DCE-MRI and MT-MRI in the assessment of the fibroid uterus. Our secondary aim was to assess whether the treatment response depends upon the oestrogenic state of subjects. To this end, some of the treated participants received a GnRH antagonist prior to receiving the agonist, in order to induce hypo-oestrogenism more rapidly during the first 1&#x02013;2 weeks of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089809.s008">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089809.s007">Protocol S1</xref>. Following approval from the Lothian Research and Ethics Committee (<italic>LREC 08/MRE00/30</italic>), premenopausal women scheduled for hysterectomy due to symptomatic fibroids were recruited from gynaecology clinics in NHS Lothian, Scotland from April 2009 until April 2010. The presence of benign fibroids was confirmed histologically on hysterectomy specimens. Participants were required to have at least one non-pedunculated fibroid (diameter &#x02265;2 cm) or multiple small fibroids (total uterine volume &#x02265;200 cm<sup>3</sup>) confirmed by pelvic ultrasound. Patients with contra-indications to MRI or to the study drugs were excluded. Subjects using hormonal preparations or tranexamic acid for symptom control were able to continue taking these throughout the study period.

We found that structural MRI was able to identify a significant volumetric treatment effect as early as day 14 following commencement of treatment, and at the following two scans. This effect was detected by standard clinical ultrasound only 2&#x02013;3 months after commencement of treatment. These data support the use of structural MRI as the preferred technique for detecting early volumetric treatment response and, as far as we are aware, represent the earliest detected volumetric reduction of a GnRH analogue treatment. These data also show for the first time that the change in fibroid volume with GnRH analogue treatment is rapid.

Since we assessed averaged contrast uptake across the whole fibroid, such local variations in the treatment effect may be obscured. Furthermore, caution should be exercised in interpreting changes in contrast uptake, which is influenced by multiple properties including blood flow, vascular permeability and the extracellular volume. Shimada <italic>et al</italic> have previously demonstrated a positive association between fibroid vessel density and MRI contrast enhancement <xref rid="pone.0089809-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Further work using DCE-MRI with higher temporal resolution and arterial concentration measurement should allow some of these factors to be disentangled <xref rid="pone.0089809-Tofts1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Pre-treatment DCE-MRI of myometrium was negatively associated with the final uterine volume change. It is unclear whether this reflects greater availability of the pharmacologic agent, or simply that a highly perfused uterus is more strongly affected by reductions in blood supply. A previous study using qualitative contrast-enhanced MRI has suggested that enhancing fibroids show greater volume reduction than unenhanced fibroids <xref rid="pone.0089809-Takahashi2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Whilst this may reflect a reduced treatment response in poorly-enhanced hyalinised fibroids <xref rid="pone.0089809-Okizuka1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089809-Shimada2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we did not find pre-treatment fibroid <italic>k</italic>
<sub>ep</sub> to be associated with final volume change.</p><p>Qualitative contrast-enhanced MRI is used clinically to assess suitability for uterine artery embolisation treatment and to demonstrate the consequent reductions in perfusion <xref rid="pone.0089809-Jha1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As far as we are aware, this is the first study in which quantitative DCE-MRI has been employed in patients with fibroids who have been administered GnRH agonist therapy. We have shown that DCE-MRI is sensitive to therapy-induced vascular changes in fibroid tissue and as such it may be useful in future studies of therapeutic efficacy and mechanism. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to balance the acquisition of additional scientific information against the cost of administering contrast agent and increasing the total duration of the imaging protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Fibroid composition (MT-MRI)</title><p>Whilst MT-MRI has been reported in relation to other uterine pathology <xref rid="pone.0089809-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, MT-MRI has not previously been used to assess uterine fibroids, except as an incidental finding during whole body MRI <xref rid="pone.0089809-Boss1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Here, we were unable to identify a treatment effect by MT-MRI during the study. A possible reason is that GnRH therapy does not substantially alter the fibroid tissue structure on a 2&#x02013;3 month timescale. Moreover, long acquisition times at 1.5T limited the accuracy of MTR measurement in the presence of patient motion. We have recently piloted faster MT-MRI acquisition at 3T and this permits rapid voxel-based MTR mapping that may enhance the sensitivity of this technique.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Dependence on hypo-oestrogenism</title><p>As expected, initial treatment with GnRH antagonist preceding GnRH agonist therapy resulted in lower serum oestradiol concentrations on day 4. We found greater uterine volume reduction in treated patients with the lowest serum oestradiol concentrations as early as day 14, implying that rapid suppression of ovarian activity is related to early volume reduction. Similar effects were seen by DCE-MRI. It has previously been demonstrated that uterine fibroids are hormone-dependent, with reductions in oestradiol (e.g. following the menopause) causing fibroids to decrease in size <xref rid="pone.0089809-Buttram1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089809-Englund1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. While the underlying mechanism of GnRH analogue-induced fibroid reduction is not well-understood <xref rid="pone.0089809-Sreenan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, recent work by Khan <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0089809-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> found that GnRH agonists reduced the inflammatory reaction, angiogenesis and micro-vessel density and induced apoptosis in uterine fibroids. Our data support the hypothesis that shrinkage is caused by suppression of ovarian activity and mediated by a reduction in perfusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data demonstrate that structural MRI can detect small, early responses to treatment prior to detection by standard clinical ultrasound. DCE-MRI allows the measurement of a vascular treatment response in fibroid tissue complementary to structural changes following 2&#x02013;3 months of treatment and may also be a predictor of treatment response. Our data would suggest that MRI should be considered an important imaging modality for assessment of response to novel therapeutic interventions for this important and potentially debilitating condition.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0089809.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
