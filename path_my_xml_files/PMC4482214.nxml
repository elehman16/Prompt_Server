As the midface ages, volume loss occurs in the skin, bone, muscle, and superficial and deep fat.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="SJV050C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Volume loss of deep midfacial fat reduces support for the medial cheek compartment, diminishing projection of the midface.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Gravity, coupled with volume loss of buccal fat, results in inferior migration of fat compartments, leading to deepening of the nasojugal fold and development of a crescent-shaped hollow beneath the lower edge of the orbicularis oculi muscle.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition, the suspensory ligaments elongate, resulting in a lowering of the malar fat pad and cheek skin.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Tonal changes to individual muscles and changes in skin quality, such as the development of wrinkles and drooping skin, may also contribute to the appearance of aging.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Nonsurgical aesthetic procedures, such as those aimed at restoring volume to the midface, are voluntary; therefore, patient satisfaction is critical for evaluating treatment effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In studies of facial aesthetics, outcomes that measure factors such as patient satisfaction, perception of overall aesthetic change, and impact on quality of life are key components. In addition to directly assessing patient satisfaction, such outcomes measure experiences, preferences, and perceptions that affect satisfaction with treatment.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A highly satisfied patient may reflect positive impacts of aesthetic procedures, such as improved self-image and self-esteem.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="SJV050C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> It has been noted that the desire to improve self-image is a key motivator for deciding to undergo an aesthetic procedure,<sup><xref rid="SJV050C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and a survey by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery lists a desire to appear younger and more attractive and feel more confident as consumers' top reasons for seeking aesthetic procedures.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are used in aesthetic procedures to reduce the appearance of sagging skin and skin folds by replacing skin HA and increasing the skin's water-binding capacity.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA) is an HA gel with lidocaine approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for midface volumizing to correct age-related volume deficit. While products designed with Hylacross technology (eg, Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus) comprise mostly high molecular weight HA, products developed with the patented Vycross technology, including Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC, utilize a proprietary mix of low and high molecular weight HA. Because of their unique composition and crosslinking process, Vycross-based products maintain a tightly crosslinked network of HA chains. Consequently, such products are less hygroscopic than Hylacross technology-based fillers, and exhibit minimal gel swelling.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In addition, Vycross technology allows for products with varied HA concentrations and physicochemical properties tailored to different indications. Together, these features help to provide lasting clinical duration despite the reduced concentration of HA.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> A pivotal, single-blind, randomized, controlled study demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC for treatment of midface volume deficit (MVD).<sup><xref rid="SJV050C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Primary effectiveness results were based on assessments of overall MVD on the validated 6-point Allergan Mid-Face Volume Deficit Scale (MFVDS). In this study, 85.6% of patients treated with Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC improved by 1 point or more on the MFVDS at month 6 (primary endpoint), and the difference in responder rates between the Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC treatment group and a no-treatment control group was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001).

Patients who had undergone cosmetic facial plastic surgery (other than rhinoplasty more than 2 years before enrollment), tissue grafting, or tissue augmentation with silicone, fat, or permanent or semipermanent fillers, as well as those who planned to undergo such procedures during the study timeframe, were excluded.</p><p>Patients were randomized to 20 mg/mL Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC (n = 235) or to a no-treatment control (n = 47). A no-treatment control was chosen because there were no products approved by the US FDA for an age-related MVD-treatment indication that could serve as an injection control. As each subsequent patient qualified for study entry, the investigator contacted Allergan for treatment assignment based on a previously generated randomization schedule. Control patients received treatment after month 6 (ie, after the primary study endpoint evaluation). Initial treatment was followed by an optional touch-up 1 month later if optimal cheek augmentation was not achieved based on investigator and patient assessment. Areas of treatment included the zygomaticomalar region, the anteromedial cheek, and the submalar region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="SJV050F1">1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="SJV050C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The study protocol was registered at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</uri> (NCT00978042) and was approved by applicable institutional review boards (ie, Quorum Review IRB, Seattle, WA; Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO; The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas IRB, Dallas, TX). All patients provided written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures.

Overall satisfaction with facial appearance was assessed with a questionnaire comprising 11 items rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all, never, or no, depending upon the question) to 4 (completely, always, definitely). For the LAFM assessment, patients evaluated their level of concern about the look and feel of their cheeks while relaxed and in motion on an 11-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very much); this 9-item questionnaire was patterned after the Facial Lines Outcomes (FLO-11)<sup><xref rid="SJV050C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="SJV050C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and Look and Feel questionnaires.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The SPA, a single-item validated questionnaire, was used to assess whether patients felt they looked their chronological age, looked younger, or looked older, and, if applicable, the number of years younger or older they felt they looked.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Safety</title><p>Using diaries, patients in the treatment and control groups reported the presence, location, severity, and duration of any common treatment-site responses (CTRs) for 30 days after each treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistics</title><p>Compared with baseline (pretreatment) scores, a mean improvement of 3 points on the LAFM or a statistically significant improvement (demonstrated by a lower confidence limit of the change in mean score greater than 0) in mean posttreatment satisfaction with facial appearance score were considered clinically significant.

A majority of patients were highly satisfied across a number of different measures, with more than 75% of treated patients completely satisfied with overall facial appearance for up to 2 years. Patients also perceived themselves to appear younger than their chronological age. These results were also reflected in the attainment of treatment goals and indicate that individuals seeking treatment with Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC are likely to achieve the younger midface appearance they desire.</p><p>There are a limited number of published studies focusing on patient-reported outcomes with volumizing HA fillers. High levels of patient-reported improvement on the GAIS regarding the use of volumizing HA fillers for MVD have been previously reported.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Authors studying volumizing HA fillers have also reported patient satisfaction, patient likelihood of returning for additional treatment, and patient willingness to recommend treatment to friends.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The current study is unique in that the authors report on multiple patient-reported outcome measures to fully assess facial aesthetic outcomes from the patient's perspective.</p><p>A clinically significant response in facial aesthetics can support treatment satisfaction, providing further evidence of successful outcomes from the patient's perspective. In this study, a clinically significant response refers to the point at which patients perceive and report meaningful improvements in their midface volume. Based on predefined criteria, the authors of the current study found that patients treated with Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC perceived clinically significant improvement in the look and feel of their midface and also experienced a clinically significant increase in overall satisfaction with their facial appearance.</p><p>In addition to high rates of satisfaction with treated midfacial regions, increases in patient satisfaction were also observed in untreated areas of the midface, including the tear troughs, the nasolabial folds, and areas on either side of the nose. These observations are likely associated with the impact of midface refilling on the surrounding anatomy. For example, adding filler to the midface may restore structural support to the medial cheek compartment, reducing the prominence of tear troughs and the nasolabial folds. Thus, the benefits of treatment are not centered on the exact area of injection but extend in a multitiered fashion.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that not all of the patient-reported outcomes were validated. Further, clinical significance is largely a qualitative assessment, and predefined criteria for the determination of clinical significance were subjective. Because patients were not blinded with regard to treatment, the outcomet measures may have been slightly biased. However, it should be noted that patient-rated improvement on the GAIS at 6 months was consistent with blinded investigator ratings at this time point (with 82.2% of investigators and 92.8% of patients rating midface volume as improved or much improved at 6 months), as previously reported.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Another limitation was the lack of blunt cannula use, as the researchers employed a variety of injection techniques using needles to inject into the subcutaneous and supraperiosteal planes. Additional study is required to determine the safety and effectiveness of Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC injection administered via blunt cannulae vs needles. The authors of the current study did not compare Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC with another filler. This limitation underscores the lack of an agreed-upon standard for midfacial filling; given that there is no US FDA-approved filler for the midface other than Juv&#x000e9;derm Voluma XC, the closest standard would be fat injection, which is a surgical alternative.</p><p>The safety profile observed in this study was comparable to that of other fillers.<sup><xref rid="SJV050C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="SJV050C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> CTRs were minor and of short duration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>High patient satisfaction and improvements in self-image may be the most essential outcomes and motivators for facial aesthetic procedures.
