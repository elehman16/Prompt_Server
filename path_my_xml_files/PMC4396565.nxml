Inadequate fruit and vegetable intake accounts for 5.8% of disability adjusted life years globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Similarly, increasing the consumption of non sugar-sweetened beverages, in particular water, on its own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] or accompanied by a reduction in sugar-sweetened beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], is associated with a lower risk of obesity and reduced total energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with socio-ecological perspectives on health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] recommends a settings-approach to improve public health nutrition, whereby environments and organisations in which people frequent are modified so that they are more supportive of making healthy food choices. While health promotion interventions have been found to be effective in improving the nutrition environments of settings including the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], or workplaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], maximising the public health benefits of setting based intervention requires implementation of nutrition initiatives across other community settings.</p><p>One setting that has been increasingly recognised as a promising environment to promote healthy eating is amateur community sport clubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], as well as countries such as Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], amateur sports participation is common. Sporting clubs therefore provide access to large numbers of adults each year. Furthermore, there is considerable scope to improve the nutrition promoting environment within sporting clubs. In Australia, for example, over 90% of sporting clubs sell sugar-sweetened drinks such as soft drink and sports drinks, just one-third sell fresh fruit or vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and only 20% promote healthier foods to club members and spectators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Despite the merits of promoting healthy eating at community sporting clubs a number of systematic reviews, for example, have found no controlled studies examining interventions to implement policies aimed at improving health behaviours in sporting organisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Similarly we have been unable to locate any such trials following an extensive search of the literature. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a multi-component intervention on i) the availability of fruit and vegetable and non sugar-sweetened drink products at community sporting club canteens, ii) the promotion of fruit and vegetable and non sugar-sweetened drink products at community sporting club canteens and iii) sporting club member purchasing of fruit and vegetable and non sugar-sweetened drink products from community sporting club canteens. Through supporting clubs to increase the availability and promotion of non sugar-sweetened drinks and fruit and vegetable products it is hypothesised that sporting club members will be more likely to purchase such products. Given sporting club representatives cite concerns regarding the perishability, cost and lack of customer demand for healthy foods from canteens as a potential unintended adverse effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the study also assessed the impact of the intervention on club income from the sale of foods and non-alcoholic beverages from the club canteen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>A repeat cross-sectional, parallel group cluster randomized controlled trial was undertaken with football clubs (clusters) randomized to either control or intervention groups. The study was nested within a trial of an alcohol management accreditation intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] undertaken in a region that included major cities and rural communities from the state of New South Wales, Australia. Healthy canteen strategies described in this manuscript were integrated into the first and second accreditation levels of the broader three-level alcohol management intervention, with progression of clubs from one level to the next being dependent on clubs implementing both the healthy canteen and alcohol strategies. In addition to working with the sporting club committee and bar staff on alcohol management, research staff (support staff) also assisted staff responsible for canteen operation to implement targeted healthy canteen availability and promotion strategies. The trial findings are reported consistent with the CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Clubs</title><p>All community level, amateur clubs from four football codes (Australian Rules football, Rugby League, Rugby Union and soccer/association football (hereafter referred to as &#x02018;football&#x02019;) in the study area were eligible to participate if the club had over 40 members and sold food and alcohol (criteria of the broader randomised controlled trial). In Australia, amateur community football clubs are managed by voluntary club committees and officials. Players participate in weekly organised competition, typically at publicly owned venues during sporting seasons lasting approximately five months per year. A representative was nominated by each identified club to participate in eligibility screening and data collection on behalf of the club. Club representatives from all 328 identified clubs within the study area were interviewed by telephone and, if eligible, invited to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Club members</title><p>Club members were eligible to participate in the study if they were at least 18 years of age, spoke English and were current members of the club (e.g. players, committee members, spectators/fans or coaches). A quasi-random selection process was used to recruit club members for both the baseline and post-intervention cross-sectional surveys, with study information sheets and consent forms distributed by club management to up to 30 members of the club with the most recent birthdays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These members were telephoned by trained research personnel to formally confirm eligibility and consent to participate in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Random allocation and blinding</title><p>Following the completion of baseline data collection clubs were randomly allocated to intervention or control conditions using simple randomization in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by football code and geographic area (based on the postcode of the club). The randomization procedure was performed by a statistician who did not have access to club baseline data, and was not involved in intervention delivery or data collection. Allocation was undertaken using a random-number generator in Microsoft Excel. Research personnel involved in post-intervention data collection were blind to the group allocation of the participating football clubs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p>Like most amateur sporting clubs in Australia, the sale, promotion and pricing of food and beverages through interventions club canteens was managed by volunteer staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Football sporting club canteens typically operate out of publically owned kiosks, are operational only during sporting events, and have limited food preparation, cooking, or food storage facilities. The intervention for this study sought to improve the availability and promotion of fruit and vegetables and non-sugar sweetened drinks in sporting club canteens, strategies which have been found to be effective in changing consumer purchasing behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The intervention was developed based on social-ecological models of health which suggest that individual, social, cultural and physical environmental factors that operate at multiple levels are key determinants of health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There is little evidence regarding effective strategies to improve the selection of healthy foods in a community sporting club context. As such intervention strategies suggested to be effective in improving healthy food selection in analogous settings (e.g fast food restaurants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were identified from the literature and selected to address physical, social, cultural and individual factors considered important in influencing club member&#x02019;s canteen purchasing decisions by the research team. Such strategies were broadly characterised as those that targeted the availability and/or promotion (including pricing) of healthy food and beverages purchased. Specifically, over two and a half sporting club seasons, intervention clubs were supported by research staff to implement the following evidence based strategies:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><bold>Availability of healthy food and beverage options</bold></p><p><italic>Physical environment strategies</italic><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><label/><p>To improve the physical environment, clubs were to increase availability of fruit and vegetable and non-sugar sweetened beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] by providing a total of six fruit and vegetable (such as fresh fruit, salads or salad sandwiches) and non sugar-sweetened drink (such as water and plain milk) products for sale at their club canteen.

Pricing strategies were also encouraged to ensure that fruit, vegetable and non-sugar sweetened drink products were priced competitively compared to similar less healthy products (such as pricing non-sugar sweetened beverages lower than sugar sweetened beverages) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, clubs were to ensure fruit and vegetable and non sugar-sweetened drink products were displayed within view of consumers at all times and prominently positioned either at eye level, upper half of the fridge or on the counter within the canteen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><label/><p><bold>Social and cultural strategies</bold></p></list-item><list-item><label/><p>To improve the social-cultural environment, the intervention targeted sporting club coaches and the club executive/committee as important sociocultural change agents within the clubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Furthermore, club executive committee were required to develop a written food and nutrition policy that formally documented the club&#x02019;s commitment to ongoing implementation of the healthy food intervention strategies as well as any additional related strategies the club may be undertaking such as limiting the involvement of the fast-food industry in club fundraising, sponsorship and advertising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

The fact sheets promoted the benefits of healthy foods and water consumption for sporting performance, and recovery as well as for good health generally.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p><p>Clubs could progressively work towards full implementation of the canteen strategies over the 2.5 sporting seasons or could implement all practices simultaneously. In keeping with the notion of developing a health promoting setting, clubs were also encouraged to adopt other strategies consistent with a healthier club canteen such as substitution of higher fat/energy products with lower fat/energy products (e.g. low fat pies and diet soft drink) and introduce other &#x02018;healthier&#x02019; products (lower in energy, fat or sodium) for sale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention implementation strategies</title><p>The following strategies were employed by the research team to support clubs implement the intervention:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Human resources:</italic> Each club was allocated a support officer to assist the club in implementing required healthy food and drink practices consistent with the criteria described above. Support officers attended a two-day training workshop prior to the delivery of the intervention followed by top-up training sessions and fortnightly supervision meetings with the research manager over the course of the intervention. Support was provided in the form of at least one face-to-face meeting with the club management committee, a face-to-face meeting with the canteen manager, and a follow-up telephone call and email to both club committee and canteen management staff over the 2.5 year intervention period. More frequent contact was provided (including face-to-face, email or phone contact) in instances where clubs requested support or where support staff noted clubs were experiencing difficulty implementing the canteen strategies and clubs were receptive to further contact. During contact with the club committee or canteen managers, support officers would assess current practice/progress toward strategy implementation, set strategy implementation goals, assist action planning and undertake problem solving.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Recognition and Reward:</italic> Implementation of required healthy food and drink practices were recognised and rewarded through an accreditation framework. Accreditation was achieved when clubs made available and promoted fruit, vegetable and non sugar-sweetened beverage products consistent with that required by the intervention. Incentives such as a certificate of accreditation and merchandise (e.g. counter mats, posters) were provided to clubs when accreditation standards were met.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Resources</italic>: All clubs received a comprehensive hardcopy resource kit that included an implementation manual as well as sample polices, pricing guides, recipes, templates for promotional signs and nutrition and sport information.

Specifically to assess availability, club representatives were asked to report if their club canteen sold fruit and vegetable products including fresh fruit, vegetables, salad or salad sandwiches; and if they sold the following non sugar-sweetened beverages: water, plain milk, diet soft drink (soda). To assess promotional strategies, club representatives were asked to report: if they used promotional strategies such as &#x02018;meal deals&#x02019; or price discounting of fruit and vegetable products to encourage their consumption; whether coaches at their club recommend players consume fruit and water; and the proportion of refrigerator space dedicated to healthy drink products, which was estimated through a process of counting shelves.</p><p>Baseline and post-intervention CATI surveys were also conducted with club members from intervention and control groups to assess their purchase of healthy food (fruit and vegetable products) and unsweetened drink products (water, plain milk or diet soft drink) at the sports club.

Fisher&#x02019;s Exact and Wilcoxon tests were used to assess potential bias due to differences in clubs lost to follow-up across the two treatment groups. Fisher&#x02019;s Exact and Wilcoxon tests were also used to test the assumption of blinding of research staff.</p><p>For the trial outcomes, intention-to-treat analyses examining between-group differences over time (controlling for baseline) were undertaken using logistic regression for the dichotomous outcomes and linear regression for continuous outcomes. Availability, promotion and revenue outcomes were analysed at club level. Equivalent non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test) were conducted to confirm findings for revenue measures as data were not normally distributed. Analyses of data to assess club member purchasing of fruit, vegetable and non sugar-sweetened beverages was assessed at an individual club member level, accounting for clustering within clubs using regression models within a Generalised Estimating Equations framework. Between group differences were assessed through an interaction of group and time variables in the model. The &#x003b1;-value for significance testing was 0.05.

Adjusting for baseline, there was no significant difference in club annual revenue between intervention AU$29,669 (SD: AU$31,205) and control group clubs AU$26,529 (SD: AU$33,465) following the intervention (<italic>p&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;0.910).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To date, community sporting club canteens have been mainly characterised by the sale and promotion of energy dense, nutrient poor foods and beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The findings of this study demonstrate that the intervention can improve the availability and promotion of fruit and vegetable products and non sugar-sweetened beverages and increase the purchase of these products by sporting club members. As the first randomised controlled trial of a nutrition intervention in this setting, the trial makes an important and novel contribution for researchers, policy makers and sporting organisations interested in improving public health nutrition.</p><p>At follow-up, 82% of intervention clubs provided fruit and vegetable products for sale, a marked improvement relative to control clubs (45%). This effect size is comparatively larger than that reported for initiatives to improve fruit and vegetable availability in schools, where availability of these products has typically increased between 0-20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These findings support previous research indicating that sporting clubs may be amenable to becoming more health promoting environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the intervention enabled clubs to overcome previously reported barriers to introducing fruit and vegetables products such as a perceived lack of consumer demand and concerns regarding profitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, consistent with research in the school canteen setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], this study found fruit and vegetable and non sugar-sweetened drinks were commonly purchased (by 19% and 49% of club members respectively) and no evidence that the introduction of healthy products such as fruit and vegetables reduced club income from non-alcoholic food and beverage sales.</p><p>The increase in purchasing of non sugar-sweetened drinks by members of intervention clubs was surprising given that the availability of these products in club canteens was high (&#x0003e;90%) at baseline, and that there was no significant improvement in the amount of fridge space allocated to these products. Potentially, the increase in purchasing of non sugar-sweetened drinks reflects significant increases in the use of &#x02018;meal deal&#x02019; promotions by intervention clubs (47% of intervention clubs conducted such pricing promotions post-intervention compared with 3% of control clubs), which anecdotally often include the discounting of a healthy food and drink combination (e.g. a salad sandwich and a bottle of water). If so, the findings are consistent with previous research indicating that price is a key driver of consumer purchases and a reduction in prices is a powerful tool in encouraging healthy choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>The primary limitation of the trial was its reliance on self-report assessment of trial outcomes. Direct observation or sales data would have provided more valid estimate of product availability, promotion and purchase. The internal validity of the trial would have also been strengthened had the survey items in this study been validated. The trial was nested within a broader randomised trial assessing the impact of an intervention to improve alcohol management at community sporting clubs. As such, there is potential that the simultaneous implementation of interventions in these clubs may have interacted in a way that impacted on the trial findings. For some clubs, for example, having to address alcohol management practices may have reduced the available resources within the club to implement healthy canteen strategies. If this was the case, support targeting canteen strategy implementation only may have yielded greater intervention effects than reported in this manuscript. Finally, the study recruited clubs from major football codes in Australia. The generalizability of the findings to other sporting clubs, or sporting clubs in other jurisdictions requires further study. Given the limitations of the study, future research should seek to confirm the trial findings using more objective measures of fruit and vegetable and sugar-sweetened drink availability and promotion, such as data collected through canteen audits, and on a more diverse sample of sporting clubs. Extending the research to sporting clubs with junior participants has also been identified as an important area for future research given the importance of childhood in establishing healthy dietary habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and the promotion of unhealthy foods to children in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>Despite its limitations, the trial identifies an effective model of improving the sporting club nutrition environment, as is recommended as part of a settings based approach to health promotion. Such findings should be of particular interest to health policy makers and sporting club organisations/management.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The study was approved by The University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (reference: H-2008-0432).</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviation</title><def-list><def-item><term>CATI</term><def><p>Computer-assisted telephone interview</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LW was lead in the drafting of the manuscript.
