program on increasing an individual&#x02019;s self-management and decreasing the risk factors of
metabolic syndrome in the older adult population. [Subjects] A total of 31 older adults
participated in this study. Eighteen participants in the experimental group and 13
controls completed the pretest and posttest measures. A walking exercise and health
education were provided for the experimental group. Data were analyzed by ANCOVAs to
examine group differences. [Results] At the end of the 12-week study period, the
experimental group showed a significant improvement in individuals&#x02019; ability to self-manage
their health compared to the control group. Also, there were significant differences
between the two groups in the total numbers of risk factors of metabolic syndrome,
systolic blood pressure and BMI. No significant difference in blood sugar levels, HDL-C,
waist circumference, and triglyceride levels were found between the experimental and
control group. [Conclusion] This study revealed that a combination of health education and
for walking exercise can lead to improved lifestyle management and reduce risk factors of
metabolic syndrome for the elderly population of Korea.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Metabolic syndrome</kwd><kwd>Walking program</kwd><kwd>Older adults</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Metabolic syndrome is a collection of symptoms that leads to increased risk of
cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Each risk factor, on its own, may not cause significant
health issues, but a combination of these risk factors may lead to serious health
implications for an individual. The Framingham Offspring Study showed that metabolic
syndrome contributed to almost half of the population-attributable risk of diabetes, and
approximately a quarter of all incidents of cardiovascular disease<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The incidence of metabolic syndrome is rapidly increasing in people over the age of 60<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Metabolic syndrome appears to affect
approximately 10 to 25% of adult populations worldwide<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Analysis of data of 6,423 adult men and nonpregnant women, from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), showed that the
age-adjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 34.2% among U.S. adults, and higher
prevalence of metabolic syndrome was noted with increasing age. An endeavor to prevent the
increase in the number of metabolic syndrome cases among the elderly is needed.</p><p>Walking is recommended for the elderly because walking is an easy exercise to practice<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking is a simple exercise, which does
not require special equipment. As walking can be performed anywhere regardless of season or
weather, compared with other kinds of sports, the practice rate of walking exercise was
reported to be the highest for the elderly<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking offers the perfect combination of exercise and a feeling of
immense satisfaction<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a positive
effect on body composition and lipid profiles of women aged over 65&#x02005;years old<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nuri et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that supervised walking and standard resistance training
program can improve metabolic syndrome parameters after 15 weeks. Their results show that
walking exercise was effective at ameliorating metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Previous research has focused on exercise as the sole intervention for the elderly with
metabolic syndrome<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. As metabolic syndrome correlates directly with obesity and
sedentary lifestyles, health education for patients is of significant importance in the
self-management of risk factors, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and smoking<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Self-management is defined as the factor
of self-care related to cognitive decision-making in reaction to patients&#x02019; symptoms or
signs<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it is a very complicated
process that requires acute perception and evaluation of subtle changes in an individual&#x02019;s
own health condition. Self-management is a term applied to educational programs aimed at
teaching the skills needed to carry out medical regimens specific to a disease, guide change
in behavior regarding health, and provide emotional support for patients to control their
disease and increase their quality of life<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. As self-management encourages the patients to actively take part
in managing their illness, patients&#x02019; self-management is closely related to improved health
behavior and health status<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
few studies of the effect of both exercise and health education on metabolic syndrome have
been performed<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we designed
a walking program composed of walking exercise and health education, and conducted walking
programs for older adults with metabolic syndrome.</p><p>In Korea, the majority of studies regarding the effect of exercise on metabolic syndrome
have been conducted in health centers in urban regions, and little is known regarding the
rural population. In Korea, 72% of the rural population do not have access to gym
facilities, fitness classes or exercise equipment<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, rural people have little opportunity to receive health
education and counseling. Therefore, this study introduced a combination of a walking
exercise and health education to rural residents to improve their self-management abilities,
and to decrease risk factors of metabolic syndrome.</p><p>The aim of the study was to determine the effects of a 12-week walking exercise and health
education program on self-management and risk factors of metabolic syndrome of older
adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants were 36 older adults aged over 60&#x02005;years old who volunteered to participate

the walking program. The walking program consisted of walking exercise and health education.
Walking exercise was provided three times per week for 12 weeks. Walking exercises were
performed in 3 stages. Participants exercised with an instructor through stages 1&#x02013;3. Stage 1
was the initial stage where subjects walked 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;km for 30&#x02013;40 minutes, while maintaining 40%
of maximum heart rate (HRmax) in the 1st&#x02013;2nd week. Stage 2 was the enhancement stage which

maintaining 50% of HRmax. Stage 3 was the maintenance stage in which participants walked
5&#x02013;6&#x02005;km for 50 minutes, while maintaining 60% of HRmax. The times noted above exclude the

The experimental group received health education and counseling once a week,
regarding dietary principles and disease control. Health education focused on
self-management of metabolic syndrome, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Health
education and counseling were provided 12 times, and lasted 60 minutes per session. The mean
attendance rate for the experimental group was 94.7%. The control group did not participate
in other health promotion programs.</p><p>Before we began collecting data, we explained the purpose of this study and received the
consent of all of the participants. This study was approved by Namseoul University, and the
approval number is Research-20121205. Data were collected to measure participant&#x02019;s general
characteristics, self-management, and risk factors of metabolic syndrome. Body measurements
were evaluated before and after the 12-week walking program by trained research assistants,
and blood tests were conducted by a researcher who was a nurse.</p><p>The participant&#x02019;s self-management of their health was assessed using a self-management
scale<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The self-management scale in
this study was composed of 17 items, coded from 1 to 3, with 1 representing &#x0201c;strongly
disagree&#x0201d;, 2 representing &#x0201c;agree&#x0201d; and 3 representing &#x0201c;strongly agree.&#x0201d; The items covered
dietary treatment, weight control, drinking, smoking, exercise, sleep, and medication status
related to essential metabolic syndrome patients&#x02019; self-care. One item regarding sleeping,
which is closely related to metabolic syndrome, was added in this study. The revised
self-management scale was examined by three experts for content validity. Higher scores
directly correlate with better self-management. The reliability (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;) of the
instrument was 0.72 in Lee<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>&#x02019;s study and
0.91 in the present study.</p><p>Subjects&#x02019; height was measured in millimeters using a portable height scale, their weight
was measured to an accuracy of 100&#x02005;g using a digital weight scale (CASS digital, Korea), and
their body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height squared
(m<sup>2</sup>). Participants&#x02019; blood pressure was measured at the health center after a 30
minute rest on the test day. Following a 5-minute rest period, arterial blood pressure of
the right arm was measured by a mercury sphygmomanometer while the subject rested in a
seated position. Two measurements were taken at each time point and the mean of both the
systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressures were recorded for later analyses. The waist
line was measured with a tape measure on the belly button line in a comfortable standing
position. Fasting blood sugar, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and
triglyceride levels were tested by collecting blood after fasting at the baseline, and at
the end of the 12-week intervention.</p><p>Data were analyzed, using SPSS for Windows, v18.0. Descriptive statistics were used for
demographic variables and major study variables. A homogeneity test was used to detect any
significant group differences in the demographic data and pretest measures. ANCOVAs were
used to examine group differences in outcome variables. The level of significance used in
all statistical analyses was &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Group comparisons were made of changes in the outcome variables between pretest and

the number of risk factors of metabolic syndrome, the total number of risk factors of
metabolic syndrome differed significantly between the two groups (<italic>F</italic>=7.98,

improved BMI (<italic>F</italic>=5.81, p&#x0003c;0.05) and systolic blood pressure
(<italic>F</italic>=4.16, p&#x0003c;0.05). Group differences in blood sugar, HDL-C, diastolic
blood pressure, and waist circumference were found not to be significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we conducted a 12-week walking exercise and health education program for
older Korean adults, who showed at least three components of metabolic syndrome. The
experimental group showed a significant improvement in self-management and metabolic
syndrome symptoms at the end of the 12-week walking program.</p><p>The walking exercise and health education were effective at improving self-management of
older adults. Few studies have investigated the direct effect of a walking program on older
adults&#x02019; self-management of metabolic syndrome. Chang et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that nurse-led empowerment strategies for hypertensive
patients with metabolic syndrome improved metabolic syndrome symptoms and self-management
behaviors. In Korea, Lee<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> found that a
self-care program for hypertensive outpatients improved self-management compliance with
diet, exercise, regular medication intake, blood pressure, and stress management. Our
present study showed that health education could help the elderly with medical management,
promote good food habits, help manage negative emotions, reduce alcohol intake, and reduce
smoking. In addition, health education can provide older adults with the necessary
knowledge, skills, and confidence to deal with metabolic syndrome-related problems.
Considering that older adults&#x02019; self-management is closely associated with health behavior,
it is necessary to incorporate health education in health promotion programs for older
adults.</p><p>The number of metabolic syndrome risk factors in the experimental group was significantly
reduced from 4.00&#x000b1;0.97 to 2.33&#x000b1;0.97. These findings are consistent with previous studies
that have examined the relationship between walking exercise and metabolic syndrome in older
adults<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study confirmed that walking and health education effectively
ameliorated the risk factors of metabolic syndrome. Considering that metabolic syndrome is
related to the prevalence, onset rate, and mortality rate of diabetes and cardiovascular
diseases<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, a walking program is
recommended for older adults as an effective approach for combating the harmful risk factors
of metabolic syndrome.</p><p>In this study, after performance of the 12-week walking program, the BMI of the
experimental group significantly decreased from 25.97&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> to
25.00&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Our results are consistent with a previous study, which reported
that a 12-week walking program, plus individual motivational sessions, significantly reduced
the BMI of Thai patients<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Musto et
al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> found that an active walking
group with a pedometer program showed significant reductions in BMI and systolic blood
pressure. These results confirm that walking exercise for older adults is effective at
decreasing BMI.</p><p>In this study, systolic blood pressure significantly decreased in the experimental group
after the program, therefore, the walking program can be considered an appropriate exercise
for reducing blood pressure. Farinatti<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced by 6 and 9 mmHg,
respectively, after an aerobic exercise program of 30 minutes walking 3 times a week;
however, Stevenson and Topp<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not significantly changed after elderly
subjects performed a low intensity exercise program for 9 months. This difference is likely
due to the selection of study subjects, the length of the exercise program, and the
individual characteristics of the elderly subjects.</p><p>In this study, there were no significant differences in blood sugar, HDL-C, triglyceride,
or waist circumference between the two groups. Although statistically not significant,
positive trends in blood sugar and in HDL-C were observed in the exercise group. The walking
program was deemed to be not long enough to reduce blood lipid levels or blood sugar levels.
Koutroumpi et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that
moderate-intensity exercise needs to be performed most days of the week to produce favorable
changes in blood cholesterol levels.</p><p>To sum up, this study provides new evidence linking walking and health education with
metabolic syndrome. For effective secondary prevention, health care providers may use a new
strategy and intervention, such as a walking regime and health education for the older
adults with metabolic syndrome living in rural areas. In conclusion, a 12-week walking
program that combined walking exercise with health education is effective at maintaining
good health and ameliorating metabolic syndrome among the elderly. However, it was difficult
to distinguish between the effects of walking exercise and health education based on the
experimental design of this study. Further studies are needed to identify the independent
effects of walking exercise and health education, and the combination effects of walking
exercise and health education on metabolic syndrome in the elderly.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was financially supported by the research funding of Namseoul University in
