Hormone therapy is the most common treatment. Due to the contraindications and side effects of it and the increasing demand for alternative medicine substitutes, <italic>Mentha longifolia L.</italic> was used in this study. <italic>Mentha longifolia L.</italic> is a known medication in Iranian traditional medicine to induce menstrual bleeding in women with secondary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study was conducted in 120 women with secondary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea. Treatment consisted of sequential oral syrup, 45 ml (15 ml three times a day) for 2 weeks. If the patients did not have menstruation after 2 weeks of taking the medication, we would wait for two more weeks. If the patients had menstruation at each stage of using the drug, we started it one week after the end of menstruation. But if the patients had not menstruate after four weeks (two-week using of drug and waiting for two more weeks), the previous steps were repeated. The drug and placebo were repeated in three cycles of menstruation. Bleeding was documented by the patient on diary cards. The primary outcome variable was the occurrence (yes/no) of bleeding during the first treatment cycle. The secondary efficacy outcome was the regularity of bleeding pattern during the three cycles of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The number of women with bleeding during the first cycle were higher in the drug group as in the placebo group (68.3% vs. 13.6%; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The regularity of bleeding throughout the study was markedly better in the drug group compared with those given placebo (33.3% vs. 3.3%; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

It has, on the other hand, been specifically defined in various ways, some of which overlap with oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstrual flow at intervals of 39 days to 6 months or 5&#x02013;7 cycles in a year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The overall prevalence of secondary amenorrhea in among women of reproductive age is around 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and prevalence of oligomenorrhea is 10.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The most common form of secondary amenorrhea is hypogonadotrophic disorders caused by hypothalamic suppression, particularly functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA), due to various stressors with no evidence of systemic/endocrine causal factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Another common form of secondary amenorrhea is ovulatory disorders often associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of secondary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea is mostly based on empiric hormone with estrogen and progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Several complications have been reported by hormone therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>One of the most influential Iranian physician between 9th and 14th centuries AD was Ibn &#x02013;Sina or Avicenna (980 &#x02013; 1037 A.D).

The twenty-first chapter of third book of &#x0201c;Canon of Medicine&#x0201d; deals principally with various kinds of uterine diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In this section, amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea is described under a same title: &#x0201c;Ehtebas Tams&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. &#x0201c;Ehtebas tams&#x0201d; is defined as the absence of menstruation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Based on Iranian traditional medicine (ITM) texts particularly &#x0201c;Canon of medicine&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Al-Havi&#x0201d; (Rhazes 865&#x02013;925 A.D), <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> is one of the medicinal herbs that can influence menstrual periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p><italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> (L.) a member of the Lamiacea (Labiatae) family, whose habitat is from Southeast Asia and is known as Horse mint or wild mint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

A bleeding episode was defined as bleeding if it occurred after consumption of medicinal herb.</p><p>Sample size was determined as follows. Based on Altman nomogram when the level of significance was &#x003b1; =&#x02009;0.05 and the power to 80% and SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7, the number of patients required to complete each treatment arm was 30 to 35. Taking into account an expected dropout rate of 25%, the total number of patients required to investigate the primary efficacy variable was 84. In addition, in order to gain an insight into the regularity of bleeding in the cycles following one cycle bleeding, it was decided to recruit 120 patients.</p><p>The intention-to-treat (ITT) population used in the analysis of the primary endpoint comprised all randomized patients; those with missing diaries or missing data were considered as &#x02018;failures&#x02019;.</p><p>The secondary efficacy variable was the regularity of bleeding pattern during the three cycles of the study.</p><p>The ITT population for this analysis included all randomized patients who had documented data in the diary for three cycles (drug intake and bleeding data). The regularity of bleeding was scored by an index for each cycle as follows: an index of zero if no bleeding episode occurred, index of 1 if only one bleeding episode occurred, index of 2 if two times bleeding episode occurred and index of 3 if bleeding occurred in three consecutive cycles. The indices of all cycles were added together, resulting in a score ranging from 0 (absence of bleeding) to 3 (regular bleeding during all three cycles). These regularity scores were compared between groups using the Chi square test.</p><p>Further exploratory analyses were performed to compare the effects of mint and placebo on hormonal plasma levels, to determine the effects of stratification by &#x0201c;PCOS and FHA&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;secondary&#x0201d; amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea to evaluate any correlation between bleeding pattern and &#x0201c;PCOS and FHA&#x0201d; and&#x0201d;&#x0201c;secondary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea&#x0201d;. The basis of these evaluations was the ITT population.</p><p>Comparisons between two groups were carried out by the student <italic>t</italic>-test and by the Chi square in the case of categorical data.</p><p>All tests in the exploratory analyses were carried out two-sided and a result with a <italic>p</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 was explained as significant. However due to multiple testing, the <italic>p</italic> values cannot be interpreted in a confirmatory sense as can the outcome for the primary efficacy variable.</p><p>All randomized women who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis. Safety parameters included adverse events, physical examination findings, body weight, ultrasound scan of uterus and ovaries, concomitant medication, laboratory tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Initially 208 patients were interviewed from which 120 patients were recruited and randomized in two groups of 60 patients.
