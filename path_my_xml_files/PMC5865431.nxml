Patients received rituximab plus bendamustine or rituximab plus chlorambucil every four weeks for six cycles. Rituximab plus chlorambucil-treated patients without a complete response after Cycle 6 received chlorambucil monotherapy for at least six additional cycles or until complete response. The primary endpoint was complete response rate (confirmed by bone marrow biopsy) after Cycle 6 in first-line patients. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease, and safety. Overall, 357 patients were randomized (rituximab plus bendamustine, n=178; rituximab plus chlorambucil, n=179; intent-to-treat population), including 241 first-line patients (n=121 and n=120, respectively); 355 patients received treatment (n=177 and n=178, respectively; safety population). In first-line patients, complete response rate after Cycle 6 (rituximab plus bendamustine, 24%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 9%; <italic>P</italic>=0.002) and median progression-free survival (rituximab plus bendamustine, 40 months; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 30 months; <italic>P</italic>=0.003) were higher with rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil. Overall response rate and overall survival were not different. In first-line patients with a complete response, minimal residual disease-negativity was higher with rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil (66% <italic>vs</italic>. 36%). Overall adverse event incidence was similar (rituximab plus bendamustine, 98%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 97%). Rituximab plus bendamustine may be a valuable first-line option for fludarabine-ineligible patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rituximab plus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC) is standard treatment for medically fit chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients,<sup><xref rid="b1-1030698" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-1030698" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> with high response rates in previously untreated patients (first-line; 1L) and treated patients (second-line; 2L).<sup><xref rid="b3-1030698" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-1030698" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, many CLL patients are elderly and have comorbidities, making them ineligible for fludarabine-based treatment.<sup><xref rid="b6-1030698" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Chemotherapy options for these patients include bendamustine (B) and chlorambucil (Clb).</p><p>In treatment-na&#x000ef;ve CLL patients, phase II studies showed promising efficacy with rituximab plus B (R-B)<sup><xref rid="b7-1030698" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> or Clb (R-Clb),<sup><xref rid="b8-1030698" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-1030698" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> while the phase III CLL11 study demonstrated improved efficacy with R-Clb and obinutuzumab plus Clb (G-Clb) <italic>versus</italic> Clb monotherapy.<sup><xref rid="b10-1030698" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-1030698" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> G-Clb also increased progression-free survival (PFS) and complete response (CR) rates <italic>versus</italic> R-Clb,<sup><xref rid="b10-1030698" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-1030698" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> although infusion-related reactions and neutropenia were more common; infection rates were not increased, however.<sup><xref rid="b10-1030698" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> While a phase III study demonstrated superior efficacy in terms of CR and PFS with B <italic>versus</italic> Clb in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve CLL,<sup><xref rid="b12-1030698" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-1030698" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> the activity of R-B <italic>versus</italic> R-Clb has not been directly compared.</p><p>Herein, we present results from the randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase IIIb MABLE study, which aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of R-B and R-Clb in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>Patients received rituximab (intravenous 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> Day [D] 1, Cycle [C] 1 and 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> D1, C2-C6) plus B (intravenous 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [1L] or 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [2L] D1 and D2, C1-C6) or Clb (oral 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> D1-D7, C1-C6) every four weeks for six cycles.

ORRs were similar in the two arms.

Two explanations for this might be the different Clb doses used (MABLE, 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; CLL11, 0.5 mg/kg), which resulted in a higher median cumulative dose (MABLE, 720 mg; CLL11, 366-400 mg), and differences in the study populations, with patients in MABLE having fewer active comorbidities than those in CLL11 (medians of 3 and 5, respectively) and a better performance status.<sup><xref rid="b10-1030698" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Earlier phase II studies in elderly CLL patients treated 1L with R-Clb reported CR rates of 10-17% and ORRs of 82-84%.<sup><xref rid="b8-1030698" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-1030698" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The CLL2M trial, a phase II study of CLL patients treated 1L with R-B, at the same B dosage as the current study, reported a CR rate of 23% and an ORR of 88%.<sup><xref rid="b7-1030698" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>In 1L patients in the study reported herein, the median PFS of 39.6 months in the R-B arm was significantly longer (by 10 months) than the value in the R-Clb arm.

Grade &#x02265;3 AE incidence was slightly higher with R-B <italic>versus</italic> R-Clb, driven by a higher incidence of infections and infestations. Few patients in either arm discontinued therapy due to AEs. Treatment withdrawal due to AEs was reported for 18% of patients receiving 1L R-B and 12% receiving R-Clb.</p><p>As previously noted, the results of the CLL11 study show that, in unfit CLL patients, G-Clb was associated with higher response rates and longer PFS than R-Clb, with more frequent MRD eradication and an acceptable toxicity profile.<sup><xref rid="b10-1030698" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In addition, current guidelines, (European Society for Medical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network), recommend Clb in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody as standard 1L therapy in unfit CLL patients.<sup><xref rid="b20-1030698" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-1030698" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, in MABLE and previous studies, R-B was associated with a good response rate and improved PFS compared with R-Clb. Currently, evidence to guide the choice between R-B and G-Clb in 1L unfit patients with CLL is limited, although a recent meta- analysis of PFS and OS results in five studies showed a trend towards better efficacy for G-Clb than R-B;<sup><xref rid="b22-1030698" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> however, the difference was not significant despite a significant difference between G-Clb and other comparators such as R-Clb, Ofa-Clb, Clb, and fludarabine. A randomized trial comparing these combinations could resolve this question.</p><p>Some limitations of our study should be acknowledged. Since we relied only on investigator assessments of tumor response to evaluate efficacy, and did not include assessments by an independent review committee, this might have introduced a potential bias in the efficacy results. Comparison of our results with those of other studies in CLL patients is potentially complicated because the selection of patients based on fitness was based on a judgment made by the investigator that the patients were not eligible for fludarabine, according to a set of pre-defined criteria that were based on the prescribing information for fludarabine at the time of study design; the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale scoring was not used. However, a recent randomized study comparing the efficacy of ibrutinib with Clb used an age cut-off of 65 years as the only criterion for selecting &#x0201c;older&#x0201d; patients, and did not carry out any assessment of comorbidities.<sup><xref rid="b23-1030698" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Although the efficacy of immunochemotherapy combinations such as R-B, Ofa-Clb, and G-Clb in CLL have been shown,<sup><xref rid="b7-1030698" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b11-1030698" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b19-1030698" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> obinutuzumab plus B (G-B) needs to be evaluated further, although it is likely that future clinical studies will focus more on the combination of anti-CD20 antibodies with novel agents such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax. Indeed, these agents have shown promising efficacy when combined with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (including rituximab) in the relapsed/refractory CLL setting,<sup><xref rid="b24-1030698" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-1030698" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and are now being evaluated in 1L.<sup><xref rid="b23-1030698" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, additional safety data for 1L B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitors are required. In March 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration alerted healthcare professionals about safety concerns with idelalisib when used in combination with rituximab or R-B in CLL and follicular lymphoma. This was related to a high rate of viral and fungal infections that led the sponsor to discontinue six trials.<sup><xref rid="b30-1030698" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>However, given the economic burden associated with new agents and the fact that BCR inhibitors are not yet available in many European countries, immunochemotherapy combinations are likely to continue to be valuable treatment options for 1L patients with CLL.<sup><xref rid="b31-1030698" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients, 1L R-B treatment significantly improved CR rates and median PFS <italic>versus</italic> R-Clb, and increased MRD-negativity rates, with no new safety signals reported. R-B may be a valuable 1L option for fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients and this combination continues to be widely used in clinical practice in Europe, reinforcing the interest of this large randomized study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the patients and their families, and the study investigators, study coordinators, and nurses who assisted with the rituximab clinical program.
