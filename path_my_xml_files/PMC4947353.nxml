However, the burden of work-related diseases and injuries was high in developing countries. An estimated 2 million people die each year from work-related diseases causing an economic loss of about 2.8 trillion USD annually, or 4.0&#x000a0;% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In these countries only 5&#x000a0;%&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% workers have limited access to basic occupational health services aiming for the primary prevention and control of occupational and work-related diseases and injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In China, rapid industralisation has been associated with the rapid increase in internal population. Most of the migrants work in the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), contributing to the tremendous economic development, but also exposed to great occupational risks and hazards. In China, the number of reported cases of occupational diseases have increased from 11,718 in 2000 to 29,972 in 2014, with an annual growth rate of 7.0&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The majority of victims were migrant workers in SMEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is estimated that about 100 million migrant workers in SMEs were exposed to occupational hazards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, due to their limited education, migrant workers tend to have poor occupational health knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. Lack of use of personal protective equipment (PPE) makes them prone to occupational diseases. Previous studies showed that among migrant workers in SMEs, only 16.8&#x000a0;%&#x02013;22.4&#x000a0;% have used PPE effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is an urgent need to improve the use of PPE, as a primary prevention to protect workers against occupational hazards, among migrant workers. Organic solvents rank as the top cause of chronic occupational poisoning, which is the second most common occupational disease in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this study, we aim to design a multi-level behavioural intervention to promote PPE utilization among migrant workers in SMEs who are exposed to organic solvents.</p><p>Behaviour change cannot be achieved without first recognizing and understanding the complex factors that affect behaviours and the mechanisms by which migrant workers change and maintain their behaviours. Behavioural change theories, such as the Health Belief Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Bandura&#x02019;s Social Cognitive Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and the Theory of Reasoned Action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and Andersen&#x02019;s Behavioral Model of Health Services Use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], highlight the interaction of individual and contextual factors to influence the process of human behaviour change and health services use. In terms of workers&#x02019; PPE utilization, factors influencing the behaviour at the individual level include demographic characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], health education and awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], attitude towards the behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], self-efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and interpersonal factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. At the organizational context level, factors can include implementation of regulation and occupational health service provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and an enabling environment to allow for effective PPE utilization behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Combining the factors at the individual and organizational levels, and based on behavioural models mentioned above and our exploratory study on the occupational health of migrant workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], we proposed a conceptual model to reflect the dynamics of individual and organizational factors in achieving the behaviour outcome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These variables are interrelated in a theoretically meaningful way, and have reciprocal effects on each other in predicting individual PPE use behaviour.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual model to reflect dynamics of factors in achieving the PPE use of migrant workers</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3268_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The intervention design will correspond to the conceptual model, addressing the barriers related to the influencing factors and PPE use behaviour. Traditionally, behavioural interventions have often been delivered in a passive and &#x02018;top-down&#x02019; manner, such as health education by providing lectures, posters and leaflets. However, a previous review about effectiveness of occupational safety and health interventions has shown that general health education and training may not suffice to lead to occupational health behavioural change, especially for workers in SMEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The effectiveness of education programmes is compromised by the difficulties education providers face in reaching migrant workers in SMEs as a result of the limited access to workplaces, lack of trust, and cultural and/or literacy barriers. Over the last decade, mobile phones have widely been embraced as an integral part of our daily lives. Consequently, mobile Health (<italic>mHealth</italic>) interventions were applied to help to improve physical and mental health, especially for people who have barriers or limited access to health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To our knowledge, mHealth intervention has not been developed in the field of occupational health for migrant workers in SMEs. Whether it works for occupational health behaviour change for migrant workers is one of questions we are going to answer in this trail.</p><p>In addition, a more bottom-up approach such as volunteers and peer support can empower individuals and maximize their potential to achieve behaviour change. Peer education was found to be effective at reducing HIV-related risk behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Peer supports are particularly important for migrants who tend to be less integrated with the local communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Enhancing the support and education between workmates may help improve their social integration, develop positive social norms and promote healthy behaviour.</p><p>In this study, we aim to compare the effectiveness of a top-down intervention (which combines general health education and mHealth intervention provided by the research team) and a more comprehensive intervention (which includes both top-down intervention and peer education), on improving the use of PPE among migrant workers in the SMEs in China. Specifically, we will:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Assess whether the intervention, either top-down or comprehensive, can significantly improve migrant workers&#x02019; knowledge, attitude, and behaviour of PPE utilization, compared to the control group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Examine whether the comprehensive intervention will be more effective than the top-down intervention.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This is a single blind, three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to be conducted in SMEs in China. A &#x02018;cluster&#x02019; is defined as a SME, which is an enterprise employs between 300 and 1000 employees and has an annual turnover of RMB 20&#x02013;400 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Outcome assessors will be blinded to the intervention or control status. Migrant workers will be the unit of analysis although we will take account of clustering by enterprises (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3268_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting</title><p>This trial will be conducted in Baiyun district in Guangzhou. Guangzhou is one of the most industrially developed cities and a major destination for migrant workers in China. By the end of 2013, there were 8.37 million migrants in Guangzhou, accounting for 50.1&#x000a0;% of total population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We will recruit 60 out of 861 SMEs where organic solvents are the major occupational hazard in Baiyun district as study settings. We select common organic solvents as the study parameter mainly for the following two reasons. First, organic solvents rank as one of the top occupational hazards in Guangzhou [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], as well as in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Second, workers exposing to various kinds of organic solvents share similar working environments and use similar PPE, e.g. organic respirator and rubber gloves, across various enterprises, thus allowing for comparison across enterprises. In this study, organic solvents include but are not limited to benzene and benzene series, n-hexane, trichloroethylene, trichloromethane and dichloroethane.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The recruitment process will be assisted by our collaborators, namely the local government and administration of work safety, who are responsible for occupational health and safety in the district. With a list of 861 SMEs where organic solvents are used in Baiyun District, provided by local administration of work safety, a total of 60 SMEs which meet inclusion criteria will be randomly selected by the researchers. Manager of these SMEs will be approached one week before the trail, with the help of our collaborators. An informed consent form that includes participant information sheet outlining the purpose, interventions, timing of assessments and main contents of questionnaires, will be sent to managers.

We chose an enterprise-level cluster randomized design to reduce contamination between the interventions and control conditions. Randomising migrant workers does not ensure migrant workers in the control arm will not receive any intervention information by working and communicating with others in the intervention arm. The Trial Statistician will use computer-generated random numbers to select 60 out of 861 SMEs where organic solvents are the major occupational hazard in Baiyun district and assigned them to intervention or control arms of the trial with a 1:1:1 ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study interventions</title><p>The preliminary intervention plan was designed based on our previous exploratory study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and literature review on behavioural change theory and influencing factors of PPE utilization behaviour (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A qualitative study was then conducted in three SMEs to 1) provide details about the mechanisms through which individual and organizational factors affect the target behaviour; 2) understand the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed intervention; and 3) seek the suggestions of occupational health personnel and migrant workers on improving the intervention.

Data administrator, who will not be involved in the implementation of the project, will determine whether migrant workers have effectively used PPE or not based on the types and frequency of PPE utilization. Given the lack of feasibility of long-term and continuous workplace observation and the potential for disrupting workflow and introducing additional biases, such as Hawthorne effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the primary outcome will be measured through self-report method instead of observation by researchers.

Migrant workers and SMEs who are lost to follow-up will be recorded, and the reasons for workers&#x02019; and SMEs&#x02019; drop-out will be reported by enterprise managers and local administration of work safety, respectively. Before data can be analysed, data will be processed, including correcting data-inputting errors by using double data entry method and range and logic checks.</p><p>All personal information about enrolled participants will not be shared with any third party during and after the trial to protect confidentiality.

According to our previous study, among migrant workers exposed to organic solvents in SMEs, the rate of effective utilization of PPE was16.8&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Based on a pilot study we did in three SMEs in Guangzhou in 2014, we expected the rate will be increased to reach 60 and 70&#x000a0;% in top-down and comprehensive intervention arm, respectively. Based on an estimated intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05(previous literature reported that ICCs for participants&#x02019; behaviours and intent to change those behaviours were generally less than 0.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]), an alpha of 0.05(one-side) and a beta of 0.20, we need 684 samples and 54 enterprises. We estimated the dropout rate will be 20&#x000a0;% as our exploratory study showed that annual turnover rate of migrant workers exposed to organic solvents in study SMEs was 26&#x000a0;%. In addition, considering that SMEs are sensitive to economic depression and based on experience of local administration of work safety, we also estimated 10&#x000a0;% of study SMEs may close down during intervention period. Therefore, we aim to recruit a total of 60 enterprises (20 for each arm) and at least 920 migrant workers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We will follow CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] to analyse and present the data. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] will be used to estimate effectiveness of intervention. Therefore, all SMEs and migrant workers that are initially randomized and provide data at baseline will be included in the analysis. Migrant workers missing at baseline but present at follow-up surveys will be excluded from the ITT analyses.</p><p>The analysis will be conducted at the individual level. The baseline characteristics, e.g. demographic characteristics, occupational health knowledge and attitude and PPE utilization behaviour, of migrant workers will be described using mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range) or proportions as appropriate and compared across three arms. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used for the primary outcome adjusted for baseline PPE utilization behaviour to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention. A sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to adjust for the number of intervention sections received during the trial, which will be calculated based on general health educators, peer education group leaders and migrant workers&#x02019; feedback. In addition, subgroup analyses by migrant workers&#x02019; sex, age and education status, and SMEs&#x02019; occupational health practice, e.g. occupational health supervision, will be performed. For the secondary outcomes, linear mixed effects models will be applied for occupational health knowledge and attitude and GEE will be used for participation in occupational health check-up. Results from all secondary analyses will be treated as exploratory and presented as estimates with confidence intervals.</p><p>Although drop outs are expected, missing data will not be imputed. Because GEE and linear mixed effects models assume that missing data are missing at random. Under this assumption, the complete-case analysis by including predictors of missing observations will provide consistent estimates of the parameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Migrant workers are one of the main sources of labor force and a vulnerable group for occupational health. To our knowledge, this is the first behavioural intervention programme targeting PPE utilization of migrant workers exposed to organic solvents in SMEs in China. Our intervention is based on theoretical models, previous exploratory study and participants&#x02019; feedback. This study will contribute to the limited evidence on behavioural intervention for occupational health prevention in SMEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our study will also contribute to the evidence base of developing basic occupational health services in China and elsewhere with similar industrialization contexts. In addition, this intervention has good replicability as they can be implemented by migrant workers themselves with relatively low cost. Ensuring the fidelity of a complex intervention is challenging, although we have developed stringent monitoring and reporting system. Sustaining the effects of behavioural change intervention will also be difficult. However, this problem will be mitigated given this is a theory-based pragmatic trial that also aims to strengthen the capacity of enterprise managers and workers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>GDP, Gross Domestic Product, GEE, Generalized Estimating Equations, ICC, intra-class correlation coefficient, ITT, Intention-to-treat, PPE, Personal Protective Equipment, RCT, Randomized Controlled Trial, SMEs, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge all migrant workers and SMEs who have participated in this study and the support of Administration of Work Safety of Guangdong Province, Administration of Work Safety of Baiyun District, Guangzhou and People&#x02019;s Government of Zhongluotan Town, Guangzhou.
