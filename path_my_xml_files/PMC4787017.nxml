Because of unfamiliar with the environment and medical procedures and unaware of the reasons for hospitalization, it can result in children&#x02019;s anger, uncertainty, anxiety, and feelings of helplessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Anxiety is the most commonly reported of these negative responses, and high levels of anxiety can be harmful to children&#x02019;s physiological and psychological health. Excessive anxiety also impedes children&#x02019;s efficacy in coping with medical treatment, and increases their uncooperative behaviour and negative emotions towards healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Play has long been regarded as a vital element in the normal growth and development of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and is widely used in many Western countries to alleviate the stress experienced by paediatric patients and their families during hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Through play, children are given the opportunity to develop mastery of self and the environment and to enhance their understanding of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, emphasized the essential nature of play for hospitalized children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. She also pointed out that it is the responsibility of healthcare professionals to create and maintain a therapeutic environment for paediatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Florence Erikson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] was one of the first nurses to conduct a study of play interventions for hospitalized children. In exploring the reactions of children to the hospital experience, she showed that they found it easier to express their feelings about hospital when they were given the opportunity to play with clinical equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, she demonstrated the benefits of using play interviews and dolls to prepare hospitalized children for invasive medical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Wolfer and Visintainer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] conducted an influential study to examine the stress responses and adjustment to hospitalization of paediatric surgical patients. The results showed that children who received psychological preparation, including hospital play interventions, in contrast to those who did not, reported fewer upset behaviour and post-hospital adjustment problems, but more cooperation with the hospital. Since then, a number of studies on hospital play interventions have been carried out preparing children for invasive medical procedures and helping them cope with the stress of hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nonetheless, a review of the literature reveals that the majority of such studies were case studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and there is little scientific evidence to find out the precise clinical effectiveness of hospital play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Zahr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] conducted a study on preparing pre-school children to undergo surgery by means of hospital play interventions. The researcher found that children who received such interventions pre-operatively experienced fewer adverse behavioural changes and were significantly calmer post-operatively than children who received only routine care. One limitation of this study was that only pre-school children were involved, the benefits of hospital play for school-age children remaining uncertain. Li and his colleagues conducted the first randomized controlled trial to test the effects of hospital play interventions on children undergoing day surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The researchers found that these children experienced less anxiety and exhibited fewer negative emotions than children receiving only information preparation in the pre- and post-operative periods. Nevertheless, the generalizability of this study was limited because only minor elective surgery was involved and the children did not stay in hospital overnight. Another similar randomized controlled trial was conducted by He and colleagues to test the effectiveness of hospital play interventions on the outcomes of children undergoing in-patient elective surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The results were consistent with Li&#x02019;s study, showing that patients who received the interventions had fewer negative emotions and experienced less anxiety than those receiving routine nursing care. Nevertheless, both studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] were focused on preparing children for surgery, and the effects of hospital play interventions in helping children cope with the general stress of hospitalization remain uncertain. There is an imperative need for rigorous quantitative research into the efficacy of hospital play interventions in hospitalized children.</p><p>It is widely thought that Chinese people are influenced by Confucianism, which emphasizes balance and harmony achieved through the concepts of &#x02018;chung&#x02019; and &#x02018;yung&#x02019; in everyday life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this way, disease is regarded as arising from &#x02018;bad spirits&#x02019;, and that exercise will only aggravate it and break the rules of harmony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Under this cultural influence, Hong Kong Chinese parents or even healthcare professionals are accustomed to advise hospitalized children to take more rest and not to engage in any energy-consuming activities, such as playing. Traditionally, most Chinese parents and some healthcare professionals view play as less important than medical treatment or physiological care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is unclear therefore, whether it is appropriate or feasible to incorporate play as a psychological intervention for hospitalized children into the Hong Kong Chinese context. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of hospital play interventions in minimizing the anxiety levels and negative emotions of hospitalized Hong Kong Chinese children.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypotheses of the intervention</title><p>The two hypotheses were:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Children who received the hospital play interventions would exhibit fewer negative emotions when compared with children who received usual care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Children who received the hospital play interventions would experience lower levels of anxiety when compared with children who received usual care.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>The theory of cognitive appraisal, stress and coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] was used to guide the study. This transactional model is frequently applied to research on children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. According to Lazarus and Folkman, cognitive factors are primarily responsible for determining the impact of stress and the experience of stress is dependent on individuals&#x02019; interpretation of a potentially threatening event and their psychological, behavioural and emotional responses to it.</p><p>It is well known that hospitalization is highly stressful for children and can have adverse effects on their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Lazarus and Folkman claim that individuals&#x02019; evaluation of a potential threat is influenced by their perceptions of control over that threat. Previous studies have indicated that a lack of control over the hospital setting and upcoming medical procedures is a major source of stress, which may cause substantial anxiety for hospitalized children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There is evidence that individuals with adequate self-control over a potential threat would encourage a positive coping strategy, consequently improve their psychological health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The goal of the hospital play interventions in this study was therefore to help children maintain control through familiarization and rehearsal over the hospital setting and medical procedures. We also believed that through participating in hospital play activities children would enhance their interpersonal skills and social and creative abilities. Children not only had fun, but were also encouraged to desensitize stressful situations and to instil greater self-control over the new situation that they were involved in. The interventions gave the children an opportunity to practice medical or nursing routines through play and allowed them to interact actively with the environment in a non-threatening way.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p>A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two public hospitals in different areas of Hong Kong, with one assigned as the &#x02018;control&#x02019; and the other as the &#x02018;experimental&#x02019; hospital. The two hospitals have similar paediatric specialties, settings, and medical and nursing care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p>The participants were recruited from these two public hospitals, and were eligible if they were Chinese children aged between 3 and 12, able to speak Cantonese, and required to stay in hospital for at least three consecutive days. We excluded those children with identified cognitive and learning difficulties.</p><p>To ensure sufficient power to detect differences between the groups, power analysis was used to estimate the sample size. With reference to the previous study that had examined the effects of hospital play interventions on children&#x02019;s anxiety levels and emotions when undergoing day surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], we predicted a medium effect size for the differences between the two groups. To predict this effect size at a 5&#x000a0;% significance level (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and power of 0.80, we calculated that 64 subjects would be required in each group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We allowed for a potential attrition rate of 15&#x000a0;% and thus 11 additional participants per group were needed, giving a total sample size of 150. However, according to Piaget [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], children aged 3-7 and 8-12 are at the preoperational and concrete operational stages of development, respectively. Because children&#x02019;s cognitive development is linked to their age, different methods of assessment were used for the two age groups. Data analyses were therefore performed separately for the two age groups, 3-7 and 8-12. For these reasons, we aimed to recruit at least 300 subjects (150 in each age group) to this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><p>In the control group, children received standard medical and nursing care, such as vital signs observation, pharmacological treatment and wound and pain management.</p><p>In the experimental group, participants received hospital play interventions, conducted by hospital play specialists. To ensure that the play intervention dosage &#x02013; in terms of the frequency and duration&#x02013; would adequately assess outcomes such as children&#x02019;s anxiety levels and emotions, a meeting was set up between the Playright and research team. The Playright is a professional organization that organizes a variety of children&#x02019;s play programs for the public, and offers education and training to different professionals and organizations in Hong Kong. Taking into consideration the busy clinical setting and the adequate dosage of play interventions, we proposed each participant to receive continuously 30&#x000a0;min of hospital play interventions each day. Such interventions (sometimes referred to as &#x02018;therapeutic play interventions&#x02019;) are activities designed for preparing children psychologically for hospitalization according to their levels of psychosocial and cognitive development and to health-related issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The interventions in this study consisted of structured and non-structured activities. Most hospitalized children received play interventions together in a playroom, except those required to stay in bed would be given play interventions at bedside. Parents were encouraged to stay with their children during play interventions. Although the intervention protocol was standardized for different medical procedures, play specialists would select appropriate play activities based on the age, diagnosis and physical condition of the children, who were also given a choice of activities. For example, play specialists would engage younger children in play, such as puppets and toy blocks, to obtain more sensory experiences. For older children, play specialists would offer them activities with high cognitive demand, such as word and board games. The specialists also logged the timing, duration, and nature of play for each child. Examples of the interventions are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Examples of the Hospital Play Interventions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Type of Play</th><th>Objectives</th><th colspan="2">Activities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Preparation Play</td><td>&#x02022;&#x02009;To increase children&#x02019;s understanding of medical procedures<break/>&#x02022;&#x02009;To give children a sense of control over threatening events and help to clarify their misconceptions</td><td>Go through every step of a medical procedure using different instruments, such as tailor-made pretend medical dolls, procedural orientation books, real medical equipment, and miniature medical equipment</td><td>

Higher scores represent higher levels of anxiety. Children aged between 5 and 7 used a movable indicator to indicate their levels of anxiety. However, as children aged 3-4 could be confused by the scale because of their limited verbal expression and cognitive capacities, their anxiety levels were assessed and rated by their parents, using the VAS. The VAS is a widely used assessment tool as it is not complicated to administer, easy for children to understand, and is a valid method for assessing subjective feelings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. One advantage of using the VAS is that it is unaffected by the limited test-taking skill of young children. Previous studies have shown the VAS to be a valid, reliable, and sensitive tool for assessing individual subjective feelings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale for Children (CSAS-C)</title><p>Anxiety levels of children aged between 8 and 12 were assessed by using the short-form Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale for Children (CSAS-C). This consists of 10 items scored from 1 to 3, with total scores ranging from 10 to 30. Higher scores represent greater anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The short form of the CSAS-C has undergone psychometric testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and results showed satisfactory internal consistency reliability (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.83).

The CEMS consists of five categories, each category scored from 1 to 5, with summed scores from 5 to 25. Higher scores represent more negative emotional behaviour. The CEMS has undergone psychometric tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and results show satisfactory internal consistency reliability (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.92) and adequate inter-rater reliability (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.96).

They were randomly selected to attend a short one-to-one semi-structured interview according to the serial codes generated by a computer. The process evaluation could help to optimize the quality of the interventions, and to determine whether its delivery is feasible and acceptable to participants. All of the interviews were conducted by a full-time research assistant, who had substantial knowledge and experience in conducting interviews. The interviews were taped-recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data collection</title><p>A research assistant collected demographic data from the parents and from the children&#x02019;s medical records after obtaining the consent form. The children&#x02019;s baseline anxiety levels were also documented. For the experimental group, the interventions started after the baseline data had been collected. The emotional behaviour of each child was observed by a research assistant for two consecutive days, at the end of which a research assistant documented the child&#x02019;s overall emotional behaviour, using the CEMS. The child&#x02019;s anxiety levels were reassessed and documented. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected children and their parents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software, IBM version 20.0 for Windows was used for the data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the means, standard deviations, and ranges of the scores on the various scales. The homogeneity of the two groups was examined using inferential statistics (independent <italic>t</italic>-test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>). The interrelationships among the scores on the different scales and the demographic variables were assessed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Differences in the mean scores on the CEMS and the children&#x02019;s anxiety levels between the two intervention groups were investigated by an independent <italic>t</italic>-test and mixed between-within subjects ANOVA, respectively. Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the effects of participants&#x02019; demographic and clinical characteristics on the outcome measures.</p><p>The following measures were taken to reduce potential bias during the data collection. First, the research assistant responsible for data collection received training from the researcher, in particular concerning the method of assessment. Second, the research assistant was requested to follow the guidelines strictly in every assessment. Additionally, the researcher periodically checked the correctness of the assessment method used by the research assistant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>To conduct this study in the two public hospitals, ethical approval from the Hospital Authority, West Cluster Research Committee (KWC-REC) was sought.

The results of the multiple regression analyses indicated that demographic and clinical factors, including the children&#x02019;s age and gender, diagnosis and time of hospital admission, did not make a statistically significant contribution to the prediction of anxiety and CEMS scores.</p><p>The mean anxiety and emotional manifestation scores of children aged 3-7 and 8-12 in the experimental and control groups are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.

Compared with previous studies using the same scale to assess the anxiety of Hong Kong Chinese children of a similar age, the anxiety scores of children on admission to hospital in this study were similar to those of children immediately before undergoing surgery, but higher than those of school children before an academic assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The results also showed a high positive correlation between the CSAS-C and CEMS. The findings concur with those of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], in which children with high anxiety levels had more negative emotional responses. The findings provide further evidence that anxiety impedes children&#x02019;s ability to cope with hospitalization and medical procedures, and increases negative emotions toward healthcare.</p><p>There is an assumption that the number of hospital admissions might strongly affect children&#x02019;s anxiety levels and emotional responses. Nevertheless, the results of the multiple regression analysis did not find any effects from the number of hospital admissions on children&#x02019;s outcomes. The findings suggest that hospitalization is a stressful experience for children whether they have had previous hospital admission experience or not.</p><p>The overall findings support the effects of hospital play interventions in minimizing the anxiety levels and negative emotions of Hong Kong Chinese children who have been hospitalized. Indeed, providing play for hospitalized children has special advantages as illness, stress and physical restriction hinder their accustomed play and socialization, which are crucial for the normal growth and development of children. Most importantly, involvement in play activities while in hospital can enhance children&#x02019;s coping skills and relieve their stress, leading to improved psychosocial adjustment both to their illness and to the fact of hospitalization.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Implementation potential of hospital play in clinical settings</title><p>Although the overall results support these interventions in reducing children&#x02019;s anxiety and negative emotions, it is essential to assure the implementation potential of such interventions in clinical settings. Allowing flexible time for the interventions with repeated sessions is crucial to assure hospitalized children are able to engage in play activities. Children in this study were only invited to join the play activities when they were not occupied in any medical and nursing procedure. It would be practical, therefore, for healthcare professionals to consider incorporating hospital play as a routine psychological preparation for children in their care.</p><p>Most of the children interviewed reported that the hospital play interventions helped to relieve their anxiety because they gained more knowledge about their illness and familiarized themselves with the medical procedures. Most children were pleased to know that most of the medical or nursing procedures would not cause them pain, or that any pain that might occur would be well controlled. Most importantly, the children enjoyed play in the hospital and found the activities fun and interesting.</p><p>Although Chinese parents have traditionally overlooked the importance of play for hospitalized children, most parents in the experimental group appreciated the availability of play activities within the hospital. A previous local study showed that parents were reassured as they saw their child participate in plays activities and interacted with other children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Some healthcare professionals may have concerns that extra manpower is required and more support from the hospital administration is needed if play is implemented within the hospital. However, using hospital play specialists (HPS) may be one of the best solutions to the shortage of manpower. Indeed, most hospitals in Australia, the United States, and other Western countries employ HPS, who play an important role in promoting psychological care for hospitalized children through the provision of play activities. Although it may require some extra resources in the short term, it would certainly enhance quality health delivery. Indeed, it only takes 30&#x000a0;min a day to implement play activities to make the life of a hospitalized child less difficult. Certainty, it would be economically feasible for health organizations to consider and implement play interventions as standard practice for hospitalized children.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are some limitations to this study. First, although a randomized controlled trial is the most sophisticated method of testing causal relationships between independent and outcome variables, to randomize individual patients within a hospital paediatric unit is not feasible as there is a chance of contamination between different treatment groups in the same setting, and because some parents might be confused if they realize their child is receiving a different form of interventions. A quasi-experimental design was therefore used. Second, the use of convenience sampling and play interventions was only implemented in one hospital, which limits the ability of the study to generalize its results<bold>.</bold> Third, the study only observed children&#x02019;s anxiety levels and emotional responses on two consecutive days, which may not have been long enough to assess fully the effect of hospitalization on their psychological well-being. Nevertheless, as short-stay hospitalization is recommended in today&#x02019;s healthcare policy, many children will be discharged home after one to three days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Practical implications</title><p>Play is instinctive, voluntary, and spontaneous; children play just as birds fly and fish swim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The findings of the study generate new knowledge and evidence about hospital play, with major clinical implications. We believe that hospital play interventions can be applied to all children, regardless of different cultural backgrounds or settings. Given the importance of play to children&#x02019;s psychological health, it is recommended that the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong should recognize this importance by providing more resources and establish more space and facilities for children to play when they are in hospital. Most importantly, it is crucial to employ HPS to facilitate the integration of play into routine care for hospitalized children.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite some possible limitations, this study has bridged a gap in the literature by examining the effects of hospital play interventions on the outcomes of hospitalized children. The results emphasize the significance of incorporating hospital play to provide holistic and quality care to ease the psychological burden of hospitalized children. It also promotes the knowledge and understanding among both healthcare professionals and parents that play is of paramount importance to children&#x02019;s lives, and that they need to play even when they are sick.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All authors contributed to the study design.
