Due to a short length of stay, emergency patients are often managed by a sole physician &#x02013; in contrast with other specialties where they can benefit from multiples handover, ward rounds and staff meetings. As some studies report that the rate and severity of errors may decrease when there is more than one physician involved in the management in different settings, we sought to assess the impact of regular systematic cross-checkings between physicians in the ED.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The CHARMED (Cross-checking to reduce adverse events resulting from medical errors in the emergency department) study is a multicenter cluster randomized study that aim to evaluate the reduction of the rate of severe medical errors with implementation of systematic cross checkings between emergency physician, compared to a control period with usual care. This study will evaluate the effect of this intervention on the rate of severe medical errors (i.e. preventable adverse events or near miss) using a previously described two-level chart abstraction. We made the hypothesis that implementing frequent and systematic cross checking will reduce the rate of severe medical errors from 10 to 6&#x000a0;% - 1584 patients will be included, 140 for each period in each center.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The CHARMED study will be the largest study that analyse unselected ED charts for medical errors.

In the United States, medical errors are thought to be responsible of 100,000 deaths per year and more than one million injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In France, 10 000 deaths and up to 3&#x000a0;% of all hospitalizations may be associated with medical errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For more than a decade, the rate of harm caused by medical errors has remained constant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], although it is thought that more than a third of them could have been avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Emergency Departments (EDs) are busy places, where rapid decisions are made on the basis of incomplete information. Simultaneous management of multiple complex patients and lack of continuity of care can increase the likelihood of medical errors. Conditions in EDs replicate these risks for making medical errors and may amplify their consequences. Rising ED attendance rates in western countries, and subsequent ED overcrowding compounds the situation and further increases the risk of medical errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For these reasons, EDs are considered one of the most high risk environments for adverse events (AE) and serious AE resulting from medical errors. There are sparse data on the rate and severity of AE in the ED. Most previous studies have included passive or self-reporting method for error detection, which is associated with an underestimation of harm and frequency of medical errors. Reported rates of medical errors in the ED vary from 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] to 32&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a large prospective study reported that severe medical errors (with the potential to provoke harm) occurred in 10&#x000a0;% of visits in the ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] in the US. In France, we conducted a preliminary study, for ED patients that were subsequently admitted, that corroborated these findings, with a medical error rate of 42 %, and an AE rate of 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study rationale</title><p>Due to the patient&#x02019;s short length of stay, ED physicians often make independent management decisions. This is in contrast to other specialties, which may benefit from ward rounds, staff meetings, and handover. In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the single protective factor we found, i.e reducing the risk of AE, was the participation of more than one physician in the ED management. This included either the involvement of a resident or trainee in the patient care in addition to the senior physician, or a handover of the patient case in the ED. Recently, Kajdacsy-Balla Amaral et al. reported that night time cross coverage in intensive care unit (ICU) was associated with a significant decrease in mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], with an odds ratio of 0.77 per 1 day of cross coverage. Interestingly, these findings are consistent with high-risk industrial settings, such as aviation setting, where every important decision, calculation or action needs to be cross checked by a peer. These high risk industries have a global mortality rate less than 1 per 100,000.</p><p>All these results question the time-honoured paradigm that associates handover and the involvement of more than one decision maker in the process of care with worse outcomes. To explain this, we aim to evaluate the influence of crosschecking physician decision and management in the ED with a peer. Our hypothesis is that the implementation of a systematic and frequent crosschecking within the ED between colleagues decreases the rate of medical errors and AE.</p><p>Cross checking may be a rapid and easy intervention to implement even in an overcrowded ED. Thus, this study will also report the feasibility of the implementation of systematic Cross Checking in the ED. We intend to include large numbers of centres in France, that treat diverse patient populations. Consequently, if our hypothesis is confirmed, this will confer a strong argument for future generalization of our intervention .</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The CHARMED study is a prospective, multicenter, cluster-randomized cross-over study in six EDs in France (NCT02356926).

The local investigator will undergo formal training by the study coordinator including a 60 min training session by telephone; live slides presentation; and practice chart reviews with feedback. This method of training has been used in a previous study by Camargo et al. and is detailed in his previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For all selected patients, a CRT will retrieve the complete medical chart pertaining to the ED visit, and if the patient was admitted into hospital, discharge summaries following hospital discharge. Repeat attendance in the ED within the next 7 days will be recorded. All charts will be blinded to date, period and group. Chart review for SME will then be assessed in a validated two phase review process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>This first chart review phase will use a an adapted validated questionnaire, derived from the NEDSS study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], as a screen to detect adverse events and near misses (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Any chart that screens positive for at least one item at the first review phase will be sent for external validation and confirmation in the second review phase. These screen-positive charts will be centralized at the methodology and research department and will be independently reviewed by two physicians from a review expert panel in the second chart review phase. This panel will include board-certified emergency physicians and experts in patient safety. Some of the panel members are already trained to chart abstraction and errors validation and classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The others from the panel will complete a specific training session, with practice chart review and presentation of classification of error in their severity (according to NCCMERP). In cases of disagreement after discussion with the paired reviewer and failure to reach consensus, a third expert, faculty member emergency physician, will be sought to make a final decision. The preventability of any potential adverse event will be reported on a Likert scale as follows: 0) highly unlikely 1) unlikely 2) likely 3) highly likely.</p><p>This two-level reviewing system has been widely used in previous studies on medical errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], although rarely in the ED setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To evaluate whether the first level is reliable, we will randomly select 100 charts that were initially screened negative on the first level, and send them for external reviewing. If the rate of SME is higher than 2&#x000a0;% (i.e. upper 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) bound&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;%), all charts will undergo the second level of reviewing to limit selection bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Patient characteristics will be reported in each period, and we will calculate number (rate), mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) when appropriate. Normality will be tested with Kolmogorov-Smirnov method. Proportion of SME will be expressed as percentage and its exact 95&#x000a0;% CI. Characteristics of the two periods will be compared, and differences in any of the following variables will be sought: characteristics of patients and physicians, daily census and severity of patients (triage level, admission rate and ICU admission rate).</p><p>The effect of cross-checking will be estimated through a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model, which will take into account the independence of intracluster observations. Factors associated with SME will also be sought with a GEE Model. Severity of SME will be described and compared between the two periods with a chi square test or Fisher exact test when appropriate.</p><p>Based on previous literature, we estimate a rate of SME of 10&#x000a0;%, with a potential avoidance rate of more than 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

In 2013, a systematic review reported a substantial variation in the proportion of patients that experienced AE from ED care, ranging from 0.2 to 6&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Since this review, two other studies confirmed that the actual rate of AE in the ED may vary from 5 to 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Of note, more than 50&#x000a0;% of them are preventable, highlighting the importance of intervention to reduce this rate. The CHARMED study will be the first intervention study that aims to reduce the proportion of patients that experience adverse events from a medical errors in the ED. Studies reporting lower rates were those without systematic reviewing of charts to detect endpoints, but rather a declarative or a passive system, whereas the highest rate of AE (6&#x02013;10&#x000a0;%) were reported in those that employed the systematic two levels reviewing methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to detect adverse events. Thus, we belive that our chosen methodology for chart review is the gold standard for the detection of adverse events and seems adapted in the settings of ED.</p><p>In other settings, simple interventions, such as the implementation of checklists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] , have been reported to significantly reduce the rate of adverse events. These kind of interventions intended to reduce errors are difficult to implement in the ED setting, considering the broad variety of patients and medical problems. Although handover might be a source of loss of information and medical errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], protocolized handover can reduce the rate of AE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Handover can provide an EP with an opportunity to consider their patient&#x02019;s care with fresh eyes, and may therefore constitute a barrier to human errors. As suggested by Kajdacsy-Balla Amaral et al., a new physician (in the case of this trial, the crosschecker) may be more prone to reevaluate a patient and its management. This hypothesis was expressed in 1982, when Cooper et al. reported that adverse events occurred less when a relieving anesthetist was involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This is also in line with the results of our pilot study in which the involvement of a second physician (a resident, or a peer for handover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) was the only protector from AE due to medical error in the ED. The risk-benefit balance between the risk of missed information, and the advantage of a second opinion may warrant the involvement of a second physician, hence our intention to introduce systematic cross checks.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Limitations</title><p>There is a potential bias of classification in the adjudication of the primary endpoint. Although the method we will employ to detect and validate AE has already been described, our study may underestimate the incidence of SME. The inherent limitations of chart review is a potential cause of bias, but we are not aware of any other better method.</p><p>A Hawthorne effect might occur in the intervention period. Being approached every 3 hours for crosschecking, in the presence of a CRT, may increase the EPs&#x02019; awareness of the risk of medical errors and AEs. Crosschecking will not be the only factor that influences EPs in their ED care: being observed and analyzed on their risk of errors, EPs could be more careful, and less prompt to error. To reduce this effect, we will advertise the study in the six participating centers, and a CRT will still be present during the control period to remind emergency physicians that a prospective study on medical errors is taking place. Consequently, we will reduce bias by creating the circumstances that predispose to a Hawthorne effect in both periods of the study.</p><p>There is a possibility of contamination bias between the two periods, especially in the centers randomized to have the intervention period before the control period: EPs that found the concept of cross checking useful may pursue its application in daily care. To limit this bias, there will be a 4-week wash out interval between the two periods.</p><p>Finally, our study will take place in six urban, academic adults ED. For this reason, we cannot generalize to other settings, especially small rural, or pediatric EDs.</p><p>The CHARMED study, a randomized cluster cross-over study, will evaluate the efficacy of the implementation of systematic crosschecking, in reducing the rate of severe medical errors in the ED. CHARMED will be the largest study including unselected ED charts reviewed for detection of adverse events.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec12"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12873_2015_46_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
