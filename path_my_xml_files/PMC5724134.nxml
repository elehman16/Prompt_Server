While around 25% of cancers progress to invasion and metastases, the remaining majority of tumours remain within the bladder. It is uncertain whether patients with HRNMIBC are better treated with intravesical maintenance BCG (mBCG) immunotherapy or primary radical cystectomy (RC). A definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) is needed to compare these two different treatments but may be difficult to recruit to and has not been attempted to date. Before undertaking such an RCT, it is important to understand whether such a comparison is possible and how best to achieve it.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>BRAVO is a multi-centre, parallel-group, mixed-methods, individually randomised, controlled, feasibility study for patients with HRNMIBC. Participants will be randomised to receive either mBCG immunotherapy or RC. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of performing the definitive phase III trial via estimation of eligibility and recruitment rates, assessing uptake of allocated treatment and compliance with mBCG, determining quality-of-life questionnaire completion rates and exploring reasons expressed by patients for declining recruitment into the study. We aim to recruit 60 participants from six centres in the UK. Surgical trials with disparate treatment options find recruitment challenging from both the patient and clinician perspective. By building on the experiences of other similar trials through implementing a comprehensive training package aimed at clinicians to address these challenges (qualitative substudy), we hope that we can demonstrate that a phase III trial is feasible.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has ethical approval (16/YH/0268).

The two main treatment options for HRNMIBC are intravesical immunotherapy (using a maintenance regime of intravesical maintenance BCG&#x000a0;(mBCG)) and radical cystectomy (RC). The former aims to induce an immune response against the tumour and may reduce the risk of progression to muscle invasion.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> While mBCG avoids bladder removal, it leaves patients at risk of local progression and may impact on quality of life (QoL) through local symptoms and anxiety. RC removes the risk of local disease progression and may have the best oncological outcomes but could be overtreatment for non-progressing tumours. Many patients develop short-term postoperative complications after RC, and others have a reduction in QoL following surgery. To date, RC and mBCG have not been directly compared. Their comparative risks and benefits are unknown, hampering decision&#x000a0;making, clinical care and exposing patients to both overtreatment and undertreatment.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Current knowledge</title><p>The natural history of HRNMIBC is unpredictable. Rates of progression to muscle invasion and metastases vary between 25% and 75%,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and long-term outcomes suggest around 20%&#x02013;25% of patients with HRNMIBC may die from BC.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> mBCG avoids bladder removal, and meta-analyses report potential reductions in progression by 5% at 2.5&#x02009;years<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. However, mBCG can be poorly tolerated, its impact on progression is debated<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and there are manufacturing problems.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> mBCG involves 27 intravesical instillations and 10 cystoscopies over 3 years. Many (74%) patients report local and systemic toxicity,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> so only 30% of patients complete mBCG.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Furthermore, there are few data to support that mBCG with bladder preservation preserves a good QoL. With regards to oncological outcomes, reports of BCs&#x000a0;failing mBCG find upstaging to invasion in 27%&#x02013;63% of tumours and the cancer-specific survival is worse than for BC with de novo muscle invasion (eg, 37% vs 67%/3 years).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;15</xref> RC includes removal of the bladder and adjacent organs and reconstruction of urinary drainage. Many patients develop short-term bowel, respiratory or cardiovascular problems, including up to 20% require intervention.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Prospective studies report that&#x000a0;recovery of QoL following RC takes 6 months or longer to recover to preoperative levels.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Recurrence-free survival rates following primary RC for HRNMIBC cancers appear superior to those from mBCG (eg, 79%/10&#x02009;years).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Surgical RCTs</title><p>As contemporary data challenge the role of mBCG<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and lessons have been learnt from large surgical randomised controlled trials&#x000a0;(RCTs),<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> we believe it is time to compare mBCG with RC. This is an important comparison, and this opportunity may be lost as RC for HRNMIBC becomes more popular.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Importantly, the 2015 NICE BC guidelines selected this comparison as one of the highest-ranked research priorities in the disease.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The BRAVO study aims to compare surgical and non-surgical treatments. Trials of similarly disparate treatments in BC have previously failed to recruit (eg, CRUK-SPARE trial).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> Here we propose the preliminary work necessary to understand if we can undertake a large RCT of mBCG versus RC. Anticipated barriers to recruitment include patient and clinician&#x000a0;preferences, BC treatment pathways, a lack of high-quality information<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> and the need for staff training in equipoise and communicating RCT methods.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> To address these issues, we will develop a tailored staff training package to facilitate informed decision making about participation and to better understand RCT methodology. The development work will be informed by existing knowledge<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 27 28</xref> and context-specific evidence derived from interviews with patients and healthcare staff exploring: (a) treatment perceptions, (b) patient pathways to treatment, (c) barriers to participation&#x000a0;and (d) training needs of site staff. This qualitative work to develop and deliver the training package is described in a separate protocol (see&#x000a0;online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>). We will then undertake a feasibility study to assess whether recruitment could be achieved in a definitive trial, embedding a qualitative component to establish patient experience.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017913.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1</label><p>

A formal power calculation is not appropriate as effectiveness is not being evaluated.

We therefore plan to recruit 60 patients over an 18-month period in the feasibility study. For the phase III trial, we anticipate either a single primary endpoint (cancer-specific survival) or coprimary endpoints (cancer-specific survival and averaged quality-adjusted life years&#x000a0;(QALYs)). We estimate that&#x000a0;506 participants are required to have 80% power to show a superiority HR of 0.626 (based on an improvement in 5-year cancer-specific survival from 70% in the BCG arm to 80% in the RC arm), assuming a 3-year accrual period, 5 years of follow-up and accounting for 5% loss-to-follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Setting</title><p>Participants will be recruited from six cancer centres (and seven neighbouring district hospitals) within Yorkshire and Northumberland.

This approach may be at any hospital involved in their care and by medical or nursing staff. The team will introduce the trial when treatment options are being discussed, provide the introduction leaflet and ask permission (and contact details) for a research nurse to contact the patient with more information. The number of eligible and screened patients will be recorded. Interested participants will be invited to attend an appointment at the research site and/or receive telephone calls, to be given a full explanation of the BRAVO study. Experience in similar studies suggests that&#x000a0;patients can be overwhelmed by information given in clinic and that telephone contact can help and provides another opportunity to support patients. Up to five attempts will be made to contact the participant by telephone, after which it will be assumed they have decided to not participate. Eligible patients can be contacted by post if the immediate care team deem this best. No contact information will be shared outside of the team directly caring for the patient unless consent has been obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Consent</title><p>Informed consent takes place in a face-to-face setting at the research site. Patients will have at least 24&#x02009;hours to consider participation and will be encouraged to discuss the study with their family and other healthcare professionals. A full verbal explanation of the study, a written Patient Information Sheet (detailing rationale, design and personal implications of trial entry) and informed consent form will be provided. Participants may withdraw at any stage of the trial. Consent will be obtained prior to collection of baseline assessment data and subsequent randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Staff training</title><p>We recognise the challenge of comparing these two treatment choices and that the patient pathway includes interaction with numerous healthcare providers. To minimise bias and to maintain equipoise, a training package will be developed from interviews with patients and clinicians and delivered to staff who are likely to care for patients before and during the study. Training will incorporate lectures and role play exercises with simulated patients. A careful explanation of the potential risks and benefits of the two treatment interventions is crucial; such risks will be clearly explained to interested patients in an unbiased and fair way, assisted by written study-specific patient information.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients will be randomised, using a 24-hour centralised telephone or web-based randomisation system, on a 1:1 basis to receive either RC or mBCG.

Delays and deferrals are common and allowed within this study. BCG induction should include at least 4 (of 6) doses of BCG, and induction should be completed within 10 weeks. The presence of an invasive BC requires the cessation of mBCG and a change in treatment intent. Maintenance BCG may continue in the presence of low-risk NMI and HRNMI BC&#x000a0;at the first cystoscopy; thereafter, these are managed as recurrences and require patient discussion. Rigid cystoscopy with bladder biopsy and bladder washings is mandated at the first check. After this, bladder surveillance is performed as per local protocol (flexible or rigid instruments). All cystoscopies will be undertaken or directly supervised (with a visual check) by a consultant urologist who manages HRNMIBC. Fluorescence or narrow band imaging may be used, as per local protocols. Histological review of the bladder biopsies and urinary cells should be performed to determine the presence or absence of BC.</p><p>Local and systemic complications are common in mBCG regimens and should be managed as per local protocol. The study will collect data on the frequency of expected BCG toxicities and whether this leads to the cessation of BCG treatment. Cystectomy may be performed within BRAVO for severe BCG-related toxicities, if these warrant such an intervention. Patients undergoing BCG treatment may stop treatment due to disease progression, disease recurrence, serious BCG intolerance or side effects or patient choice. Disease progression: patients who have confirmed progressive disease after any of the check cystoscopies (presence of pT2 tumours, cancer in lymph nodes or metastases) should stop BCG and be offered curative treatment for muscle invasive BC. Disease recurrence is defined as the presence of low-risk NMI or HRNMIBC from the second check cystoscopy onwards. Participants with recurrence should be offered the option of changing treatment, including RC&#x000a0;or using second-line intravesical approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Intervention: RC</title><p>RC should be performed at each cancer centre by teams specialising in this service.

Individual surgeon data will act as surrogate measures for the entire surgical team and require accreditation from the trial management group before entry into BRAVO. Submitted data for surgical accreditation should reflect the practice to be undertaken within this study (eg, open or robotic approaches). Surgery should take place within 8 weeks of randomisation.</p><p>Cystectomy should include removal of adjacent organs. In males, this includes the prostate and seminal vesicles. In females, this should include a section of adjacent anterior vaginal wall, the uterus, cervix and fallopian tubes and, if no bladder reconstruction is planned, the urethra. Oophorectomy is optional, as per local practice and individualised for each patient. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is mandated within BRAVO. The template should at least include the regional lymph nodes up to the level of the ureteric crossing of the common iliac vessels. This includes the obturator fossa, the external iliac and internal iliac nodes. A more extended lymphadenectomy is acceptable. Excised lymphatic tissue should be submitted for histological analysis.

Primary analysis will include summaries of the number of patients at each stage of the recruitment pathway (screening, eligibility, consent and randomisation) and assessment of the overall monthly recruitment rate. Secondary analysis will include summaries of acceptance of randomised treatment and mBCG treatment compliance. Participant retention and self-reported QoL outcomes during follow-up, including withdrawal data (timing and reason), will also be summarised overall and by time&#x000a0;point.

Within this feasibility study, we are attempting to understand, address and develop methodology to allow such a comparison. This will require several key issues to be addressed. First, it is clear from other surgical versus non-surgical treatment trials<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> that the most important element for RCT recruitment is keeping equipoise when discussing the treatment options by medical and nursing staff. While previous studies used research nurses to keep equipoise, this is not viable across many centres within the current research funding climate. In an attempt to replicate this model, we ran a number of educational days to train relevant medical and nursing staff about the importance of equipoise and to discuss their beliefs about HRNMIBC. All staff had opinions about the efficacy of BCG and QoL&#x000a0;with RC, and so it was important to discuss these in an open forum to challenge these views and use evidence to dispel prior beliefs. We proposed a six-stage consultation plan to help staff keep patients at equipoise and so facilitate trial entry and treatment acceptance.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Within this feasibility study, we will determine if this approach is possible and successful. Second, UK data do not accurately identify the number of patients with HRNMIBC, what proportion of these are suitable for both RC and mBCG and how many of these would accept randomised treatment options. Within this feasibility study, we will establish accurate data about the number of eligible cases across this population and understand what proportion accepts their randomised treatment allocation. We will use these findings to power the phase III comparative study. Finally, there are very few reliable data about QoL&#x000a0;with mBCG and none that compare this directly to RC. Within this study, we will produce these data within 60 patients (30 for each arm) and so allow this endpoint to be modelled for the larger phase III study.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has ethical approval from Research Ethics Service Committee Yorkshire &#x00026; Humber&#x02013;South Yorkshire (reference no.&#x000a0;16/YH/0268).
