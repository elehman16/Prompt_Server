Morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl are currently used in Japan as Step 3 opioid analgesics (<xref rid="hyy046C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The selective &#x003bc;-opioid receptor agonist analgesic hydromorphone is currently used clinically in 45 countries and regions in the world (<xref rid="hyy046C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>); however, despite being a standard alternative for morphine (<xref rid="hyy046C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="hyy046C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), hydromorphone has not been developed for use in Japan. The metabolites of hydromorphone are inactive (<xref rid="hyy046C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), so it could potentially be used for patients with renal impairment who cannot tolerate morphine, and its approval in Japan would increase the treatment options for pain relief.</p><p>There is no fixed opioid dose for cancer pain relief. The appropriate dose for each patient is considered to be that which produces a successful analgesic effect with tolerable adverse drug reactions. The converted dose is customarily calculated at the time of opioid switching for each opioid based on its conversion ratio from morphine, the standard drug. This is because of a lack of guidelines for established doses for other opioids. As shown in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="hyy046TB1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="hyy046TB2">2</xref>, several conversion ratios of morphine to hydromorphone have been reported and range between 2.7- and 8-fold (<xref rid="hyy046C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), so a definite ratio has not been established. A ratio of ~1:5 has been reported in many papers (<xref rid="hyy046C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="hyy046C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="hyy046C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), while a conversion ratio of 1:8 (or 1:7.5) reportedly decreases the exposure (<xref rid="hyy046C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="hyy046C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="hyy046C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="hyy046C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We therefore conducted a study in Japanese cancer patients to confirm the morphine to hydromorphone conversion ratio for hydromorphone immediate-release tablets and to confirm pain control by opioid switching using these two typical conversion ratios.

multicenter, active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison study, enrolling 71 patients at 39 sites in Japan (participating sites are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental File 1</xref>). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each study site and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to study participation.</p><sec id="hyy046s7"><title>Participants</title><p>The study participants were cancer patients over 20 years of age receiving opioid analgesics for pain relief in whom pain control was achieved with regular administration of oral morphine either at 60 mg/day or 90 mg/day for at least 3 days before enrollment. Pain control was defined as patients reporting a pain intensity score of 0 (none) or 1 (mild) and administered rescue medication no more than twice daily. Exclusion criteria included patients for whom morphine is contraindicated or relatively contraindicated, patients receiving treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 14 days of registration, patients participating in another clinical trial within 28 days of registration, and patients with serious hepatic, renal or respiratory disorders of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3.</p></sec><sec id="hyy046s8"><title>Study design</title><p>Patients that had achieved pain control by administration of morphine were randomly allocated 1:1 to hydromorphone immediate-release tablets (DS-7113b; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) at a conversion ratio of either 1:5 or 1:8. The study drug was provided by Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. The computer-generated random allocation sequence was provided by Bell Medical Solutions Inc. (Tokyo, Japan), and was stratified according to the daily morphine dose prior to beginning the study (60 or 90 mg/day). A double-dummy method was employed for blinding, and subjects in the conversion ratio 1:5 group received 12 mg/day of hydromorphone when their oral morphine dose was 60 mg/day during the pre-treatment observation period, and hydromorphone 18 mg/day when their oral morphine dose was 90 mg/day. Similarly, the subjects in the conversion ratio 1:8 group received hydromorphone 7.5 mg/day (oral morphine dose at 60 mg/day during the pre-treatment observation period) or 12 mg/day (oral morphine dose at 90 mg/day during the pre-treatment observation period). The dose of study drug was to remain unchanged and the study was discontinued as &#x02018;pain control not maintained&#x02019; if a dose increase or decrease was required. The study drug was administered if pain control was maintained, or for 5 days, whichever was shorter. The study drug was orally administered six times daily in both groups with two tablets of the active drug with or without additional placebo tablets to maintain blinding, as one dose, but administration of two doses before retiring was allowed in cases where midnight administration would be difficult. Treatment was switched to appropriate analgesics after achieving pain control or completion of study drug administration, and the post-study observation was conducted.</p><p>Every day from baseline to treatment completion (or discontinuation), patients evaluated their mean pain severity over the previous 24 h using a 4-step pain intensity scale [&#x02018;0, none&#x02019;, &#x02018;1, mild&#x02019;, &#x02018;2, moderate&#x02019;, &#x02018;3, severe&#x02019;], and visual analog scale (VAS) and recorded their score in a diary once daily at a predetermined time. Sleep was evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = very unsatisfactory or did not sleep at all; 1 = markedly unsatisfactory; 2 = slightly unsatisfactory; 3 = satisfactory.</p><p>Oral morphine hydrochloride solution was used as rescue medication when additional analgesia was required because of breakthrough pain. However, the following were prohibited throughout the study: co-administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, opioid analgesics other than rescue medication, and narcotic antagonists. Similarly, new administration of systemic non-opioid analgesics, supplementary analgesics, bisphosphonates, anti-RANKL antibody preparations and changes in dosage and administration were prohibited. New initiation of radiotherapy, nerve block, percutaneous vertebroplasty, surgery, or cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy was also prohibited.</p></sec><sec id="hyy046s9"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the pain control ratio. The criteria for pain control were satisfaction for 2 days in all of the following items: study treatment continued at the same dose; pain intensity either &#x02018;0, none&#x02019; or &#x02018;1, mild&#x02019;; and administration of rescue medication twice daily or less.</p><p>Secondary efficacy endpoints were changes in VAS and sleep evaluation on each evaluation day, number of days required to achieve pain control, and use of rescue medication. Sleep evaluation was performed immediately prior to study drug administration, each day during the study, 2 days after the study, and if/when patients discontinued. Safety endpoints were adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).</p></sec><sec id="hyy046s10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated based on the assumptions that the pain control ratio would be 90% for the 1:5 group and 80% for the 1:8 group. The target sample size was determined with reference to previous clinical studies of oxycodone in Japan. Based on these results, the pain control ratio was estimated to be 85&#x02013;90% in patients that were switched with an appropriate conversion ratio. If the pain control ratio in the conversion ratio 1:5 group was also between 85% and 90%, it was estimated that the pain control ratio would be 10&#x02013;20% lower in the conversion ratio 1:8 group. This was examined using 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations; therefore, 35 subjects in each group were required to achieve a probability of &#x0003e;80% for obtaining a difference of &#x02265;10% when the difference in the true pain control ratio was 20%, and for obtaining a difference of &#x02265;0% when the difference in the true pain control ratio was 10%. On this basis, 35 patients in each group were required to achieve a &#x0003e;80% pain control ratio that would be used to detect the difference of the point estimates between groups (conversion ratio 1:5 group &#x0003e; conversion ratio 1:8 group).</p><p>In the efficacy analysis, the full analysis set (FAS) based on the intention-to-treat principle was defined as the primary analysis set. The primary analysis was to calculate the pain control ratio and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for each group. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare the pain control ratio between groups, and the difference in the pain control ratio (conversion ratio 1:5 group &#x02212; conversion ratio 1:8 group) and its 95% CI (two-sided, normal approximation) were calculated. The number of days required to achieve pain control in each group was calculated.</p><p>As secondary analyses, summary statistics were calculated for the change in VAS scores at treatment completion/discontinuation from baseline. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was also conducted using the baseline VAS scores as a covariate, and difference in the least square means (conversion ratio 1:5 group &#x02212; conversion ratio 1:8 group) and its 95% confidence interval (two-sided), and corresponding <italic>P</italic> value were calculated. As sleep data analyses, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare groups at completion of treatment/discontinuation. SAS System Release 9.2 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="hyy046s11"><title>Results</title><sec id="hyy046s12"><title>Patients and treatment exposure</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="hyy046F1">1</xref> shows patient disposition.

The pain control ratios (83.3% and 95.0% in the conversion ratio 1:5 and 1:8 groups, respectively) in this study were comparable to those in the above reports, and efficacy was confirmed to be clinically unproblematic. Both groups showed high pain control after switching to hydromorphone in VAS scores as the secondary endpoint and no intergroup difference was observed.</p><p>Prior to clinical use in Japan, the conversion ratios versus morphine ranged widely from 2.7- to 8-fold, so a more appropriate conversion ratio had to be confirmed. Based on the dose conversion ratios of 1:5 for the currently marketed hydromorphone products Exalgo (<xref rid="hyy046C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and Jurnista (<xref rid="hyy046C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), 1:7.5 for Palladone (<xref rid="hyy046C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and ~1:8 recommended in the WHO guidelines (<xref rid="hyy046C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), we investigated two groups with conversion ratios of 1:5 and 1:8 in this study. Some reports investigated the conversion ratio at switching, whereas others investigated the conversion ratio based on the final dose and the subsequent dose adjustment period. We evaluated pain control at the time of switching for the purpose of confirming information for safely conducting opioid switching. The results in both groups in our study showed that opioid switching was not clinically problematic, so the conversion ratio of hydromorphone from morphine was determined in the range of 1:5 and 1:8, and effective and safe switching was considered possible by calculating the converted dose. These findings indicate that the conversion ratio from morphine falls in the range of 1:5&#x02013;1:8, suggesting that the conversion ratio to hydromorphone is not fixed to a specific value but can vary within a certain range. This range is consistent with any conversion ratios (1:5 for Exalgo, Jurnista, etc. and 1:7.5 for Palladone) calculated based on the converted doses listed in the package inserts of currently marketed hydromorphone formulations. However, the optimal dose after switching should be determined at the time of actual opioid switching and should include considerations of the reasons for switching and patients&#x02019; conditions, rather than by a mere numerical conversion using the conversion ratio.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, our data do not apply to patients requiring opioid switching in a clinical situation, because the subjects in our study had achieved pain control with morphine and had no safety problems. Second, the study was designed to switch the total morphine dose to hydromorphone only in patients receiving daily morphine doses of 60 or 90 mg, and switching at high doses exceeding morphine 90 mg/day and stepwise switching were not investigated. Finally, the study was completed by confirming successful pain control after switching, and the relationship with the optimal dose after switching, including subsequent titration, was not investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="hyy046s16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Successful pain control was maintained when switching from morphine to hydromorphone with a conversion ratio of 1:5 or 1:8 in Japanese cancer patients who had achieved pain control with oral morphine, with no significant difference between groups. No intergroup difference was observed in the incidence of adverse events or serious adverse events. A conversion ratio between 1:5 and 1:8 is considered clinically appropriate for a switch from morphine to hydromorphone for pain control in cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="j201-ds7113-a-rw_supplementary_data_rev23r.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="hyy046ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all of the investigators at the participating centers for their contributions to this study (this information is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data File 1</xref>).
