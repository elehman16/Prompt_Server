Introduction</title><p>Aside from the stress that accompanies illness, hospitalization is a stressful life event that brings about changes in one's daily life and the activities that they engage in. Consequently, patients often encounter psychological and social stress [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Stress manifests itself because of the interaction between one's internal propensities and external stimuli that is determined by their environment. This determines an individuals' coping response. Humans exhibit various symptoms in stressful situations, including an increase in physiological symptoms such as headaches and exhaustion; emotional symptoms such as anger, sadness, and helplessness; and behavioural symptoms such as crying and criticizing [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Most patients admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) experience more severe symptoms and a higher likelihood of death. This increases their nursing needs and requires the patient to undergo continuous and intensive observation. The ICU is surrounded by medical teams and a variety of mechanical devices. The fear of being an ICU patient, uncertainty about the future, isolation from family, financial pressure, and exposure to an unfamiliar environment result in severe emotional imbalances in patients [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the ICU, a hospital's entire medical capacity is concentrated on providing patients with life-threatening illnesses with a chance at recovery. In the ICU environment, most patients experience stress due to anxiety about their prognosis; the unfamiliarity of the ICU and its treatment; limited visiting hours; the pressure of the inspection process; and cognitive, emotional, and behavioural stress depending on the dispositions of medical team members. This can cause the patient to resort to inappropriate coping methods [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Relatives of ICU patients report high levels of anxiety, depression, and feelings of panic, chaos, and a need for constant vigilance [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Psychological instability typically occurs when exhaustion starts to accumulate from stress, and the sympathetic nervous system, which maintains the body's state of equilibrium, is activated. This results in problems such as increased blood pressure, heightened tension, and sleep disorders [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is unclear how stress affects sleep; however, the intimate temporal relationship between the stress of sleep architecture and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis plays a vital role [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This axis and sympathetic nervous system activity are positively correlated with the total amount of rapid-eye-movement sleep [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Sleep is a basic human need, and maintaining good sleep quality is extremely important in preserving a healthy lifestyle [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Intensive care unit patients may result in problems such as decreased cognitive function, irritability, aggression, and disruptions in the sleep-wake cycle, which are associated with symptoms of disorientation and are reported to lead to the development of ICU syndrome [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There is a high correlation between stress and sleep quality; therefore, there is an urgent demand for nursing intervention to decrease stress and increase sleep quality in ICU patients with weakened immune systems [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Until now, stress studies addressed effect of inhalation of lavender essential oil on vital signs in open-heart surgery ICU [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the effect of providing advanced information on the ICU environment and its impact on anxiety and environmental stress in open-heart surgery patients [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and effect of inhalation aromatherapy with lavender essential oil on stress and vital signs in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Studies such as giving information as nursing interventions claim that these are partially effective for treating anxiety and stress. However, these studies were limited because they only focus on the effects of anxiety and stress on sleep. Studies on sleep quality in ICU patients have attempted to determine the phenomenon of sleep itself by examining sleep patterns, sleep disorder characteristics and factors [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and factors related to sleep among ICU patients. However, there have been virtually no studies that attempt to improve sleep quality in these patients. ICU patients who are in a lucid state experience elevated levels of stress resulting from fear about survival due to their illness, concerns about their family and finances, limited movement, and the noise of the ICU. They also experience a loss in sleep quality. Because of the severity of their illness, however, patients are more interested in their condition than their basic need for quality sleep. A method to enhance sleep quality must be developed since a loss in sleep quality leads to increased stress. Nurses who have the most direct and continuous contact with ICU patients can play a key role in alleviating patients' stress and improving sleep quality.</p><p>Aromatherapy has recently gained traction as an alternative therapy. It perceives humans as holistic beings and focuses on their balance and harmony as components of nature [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Aromatherapy is a type of complementary alternative treatment that promotes physical, emotional, and psychological health by using the therapeutic elements of essential oils found in the flowers and leaves of various natural plants, stems, and roots [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Aromatherapy is a combination of aroma, treatment, and therapy that uses aroma essential oils to achieve balance in the patient by calming the mind, body, and spirit. It is also used in treatments to instil vitality [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast to chemicals, aromatherapy is a relatively effective and safe treatment that does not accumulate in the body, but is discharged from the through the respiratory system, liver, and kidneys [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Aromatherapy is a noninvasive treatment that directly affects the brain, and individuals can self-administer the treatment regardless of time or place [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, depending on the oil's characteristics, aromatherapy has been recognized to have antibacterial, wound-healing, immune enhancing, antidepressant, and calming curative effects [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Studies on the clinical effects of aromatherapy have shown that it alleviates stress and increases sleep quality. This includes studies on stress responses and sleep in hospitalized elderly patients [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], sleep and pain in cancer patients [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], sleep in children with autism, and quality of sleep in heart disease patients of hospital [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Studies on ICU patients have examined the effects of aromatherapy on sleep in heart disease patients [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], high blood pressure [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], stress, and anxiety. However, these studies [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] examined patients who had undergone treatment for only 1 day and took place only in coronary care units. Studies that examine stress and sleep quality in ICU patients for more than 2 days are lacking. Therefore, this study examined ICU patients who underwent aromatherapy treatment for more than 2 days and verified its effects of alleviating stress and improving sleep quality.</p><p>The explicit purposes of this study are to investigate the effect of aromatherapy on ICU patients' stress, blood pressure, heart rate, and sleep quality.</p><p>The research hypotheses were as follows.</p><p>
<italic>(1) Primary Hypothesis</italic>. There will be significant differences in stress between the experimental group that undergoes aromatherapy treatment and the control group that does not.</p><p>

<italic>(i) Perceived Stress Using a Numeric Rating Scale</italic>. The scale ranged from 0<italic> (no stress at all)</italic> to 10<italic> (severe stress)</italic>; participants self-reported felt stress.</p><p>
<italic>(ii) Stress Index</italic>. The stress index is a value that quantifies stress levels with standard derivations. This measurement was based on heart rate variability, which was measured with Canopy9 professional 4.0 (IEMBIO, USA), an automatic nervous system measuring device. This index measures miniscule changes in periodic heart rate on a scale of 1&#x02013;10. </p><p>
<italic>(iii) Blood Pressure</italic>. The Philips Intellivue MP50 patient monitor was used to measure blood pressure in participants. The monitoring system was placed on the upper arms of the patients at the same height as the heart, and the lower cuff covered 2&#x02009;cm of the elbow. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were then measured and expressed as mmHg units according to the measurement guidelines of the automatic sphygmomanometer. </p><p>
<italic>(iv) Heart Rate</italic>. The Philips Intellivue MP50 patient monitoring system was used to measure heart rate. After participants rested, heart rate was recorded and expressed as beats/minute.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5.2"><title>2.5.2. Sleep Quality Measurements</title><p>We used scores from the Verran &#x00026; Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale, which measured sleep quality over the course of 2 days at 8 a.m. when patients awoke. Kim and Kang [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] translated this tool. The scale comprises 9 questions including the number of times one wakes up during the night, how much one tosses and turns, total hours spent sleeping, the depth of sleep, how long it takes to fall asleep, how one feels when waking up, how one awakes from sleep, and level of satisfaction with sleep. The final question is a short-answer question. Excluding the short-answer question, the remaining 8 questions ranged from 0 to 10 points with a lowest possible score of 0 points and highest possible score of 80 points. Higher scores indicated higher quality of sleep. The reliability of this tool was measured using Cronbach's alpha: pretest, .87; first night of sleep, .97; second night of sleep, .98.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6.

The Effect of Aromatherapy on Sleep Quality in ICU Patients</title><p>The Verran &#x00026; Snyder-Halper (VSH) measurement tool was used in order to verify the effect of aromatherapy on sleep quality. Measurements were taken within 1 hour (D<sub>0&#x02009;&#x02009;Adm</sub>) of hospitalization, on the first morning (D<sub>1&#x02009;&#x02009;8am</sub>) after patients had awoken, and on the second morning after patients had awoken (D<sub>2&#x02009;&#x02009;8am</sub>). The sleep quality of the experimental group and the control group within 1 hour (D<sub>0&#x02009;&#x02009;Adm</sub>) of hospitalization had scores of 65.13 and 61.03, respectively (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;0.640, <italic>p</italic> = .524). Sleep quality measurements were taken again on the first morning (D<sub>1&#x02009;&#x02009;8am</sub>); sleep quality scores were 52.90 for the experimental group and 33.56 for the control group (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;11.638, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001). Sleep quality on the second morning after patients had awoken (D<sub>2&#x02009;&#x02009;8am</sub>) was 57.73 points for the experimental group and 25.80 points for the control group (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;19.577, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001).

Discussion</title><p>This study investigated the effect of aromatherapy on stress and sleep quality in patients who had been admitted to the ICU and were being treated there. The experimental group consisted of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 30) breathing in lavender essential oil, which began after conducting a pretest.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>4.1. Aromatherapy and Stress</title><p>Perceived stress and objective stress index were measured before and after the aromatherapy treatment to verify the effect of aromatherapy on stress. The results showed that perceived stress and the objective stress index in the experimental group that received aromatherapy decreased on both the first and second days. Conversely, perceived stress and the objective stress index in the control group increased on both the first and second days. Stress typically increases in patients when they are admitted to the ICU; however, stress decreased in the experimental group. This result demonstrates the antistress effect of lavender. This study verified that lavender aromatherapy is a significantly effective method for alleviating perceived and objective stress in ICU patients. This result is in line with preceding research that claims aromatherapy is effective in alleviating stress in heart disease patients [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The results of the perceived level of stress and objective stress index measured as heart rate variability in patients were identical, and the objective stress index was an indicator of perceived stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>4.2. Aromatherapy and Blood Pressure</title><p>Systolic blood pressure decreased in both the experimental and control group between the time of admittance to the ICU and before bedtime at 8 p.m. This may reflect the initial stress of hospitalization, which caused systolic blood pressure to increase, and the effect of half a day's bedrest, which decreased stress and lowered systolic blood pressure. The experimental group used lavender and exhibited decreased systolic blood pressure on the first and second mornings. Conversely, the control group experienced an increase in blood pressure during this same period.</p><p>In addition, systolic blood pressure in the experimental group increased before bedtime without the lavender; however, it decreased by roughly 10&#x02009;mmHg after using the lavender in the morning. Blood pressure typically undergoes periodic changes, and there is a tendency for blood pressure to rise due to a morning surge [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, a rise in blood pressure reflects the morning surge that occurs before 8 a.m. The experimental group, however, exhibited low blood pressure readings in the morning, which may demonstrate the effect of lavender in lowering blood pressure. These results show that aromatherapy using lavender is effective and is consistent with preceding research showing that systolic blood pressure drops after inhaling aroma essential oils [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>As stress in the experimental and control groups decreased after hospitalization, diastolic blood pressure also decreased after a half day's rest. There was no dramatic change in diastolic blood pressure on the first and second days of the experiment that followed. These results are similar to previous results where systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased in concert [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This may show that autonomic arousal is suppressed with the use of lavender [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>4.3. Aromatherapy and Heart Rate</title><p>Both groups exhibited a decrease in heart rate over time, which may be a result of resting their bodies after admittance to the ICU. The experimental group showed a continuous decrease in heart rate on the first and second days after the application of aromatherapy. These results also show the effectiveness of aroma inhalation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>4.4. Aromatherapy and Sleep Quality</title><p>Subjective sleep quality scores were measured to verify the effect of aromatherapy on sleep quality. The intensive care unit has various external stimuli such as consciousness evaluation, blood pressure measurement, and blood sampling. Therefore, in this study, objective sleep quality was not measured and subjective sleep quality was measured. It is very meaningful to measure the quality of sleep that the patient feels during the period of admission treatment in ICU.</p><p>The results of this study show that there was no difference between groups in the pretest, which examined average sleep quality; however, sleep quality decreased in both groups following hospitalization. This is likely a natural result of the hospitalization itself affecting sleep quality. Sleep quality in the control group dropped by 50% in both the first and second nights of hospitalization. Sleep quality in the experimental group, however, decreased only by roughly 10% after the experimental treatment. This indicates that lavender prevents extensive reductions in sleep quality in hospitalized patients and is consistent with preceding research that demonstrates lavender's effectiveness in promoting sleep quality [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>4.5. Strengths</title><p>This study has three meaningful strengths:<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>We verified the effect of aromatherapy on stress and sleep quality in ICU patients from a variety of aspects.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We used aromatherapy to measure and verify its effect on stress and sleep quality throughout patients' treatment, rather than just measuring its effects on day-to-day stress and sleep quality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We presented subjective and objective data when measuring stress in patients.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec4.6"><title>4.6. Limitations</title><p>This study has some limitations. First, we collected data from the control group first to prevent diffusion and contamination of the experimental treatment. As such, the study could be affected by a difference in data collection periods. In addition, it was difficult to completely hide the information regarding which group the subject belongs to because of the aroma-like nature of the experimental procedure. Lastly, the intervention was only performed at one hospital, which limits the generalizability of the results. More research is necessary on whether aromatherapy is effective throughout the treatment process for ICU patients required to undergo long-term treatment. There also needs to be further studies on stress relief and improvements in sleep quality in both ICU patients and patients who are moved to other wards.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>This experimental study used a nonrandomised, pre- and posttest design to address the effect of aromatherapy on stress and sleep quality among ICU patients. The results showed significant differences in perceived stress, objective stress index, blood pressure, heart rate, and sleep quality between the experimental group who received aromatherapy treatment and the control group who did not. Overall, the above research results demonstrate that aromatherapy, which was administered over two days, reduced stress and improved sleep quality in ICU patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT &#x00026; Future Planning (NRF-2015R1A1A3A04001441).</p></ack><sec><title>Disclosure</title><p>This paper was partially presented as a poster abstract in the 38th Asia-Pacific Nursing and Medicare Summit.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Eun Hee Cho and Mi-Young Lee contributed equally to this work.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>J.
