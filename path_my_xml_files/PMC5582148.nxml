intercourse without using contraceptives methods
(<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). According to the World Health Organization&#x02019;s
report, infertility affects approximately 8
million couples around the world and its rate varies
from 5 to 30% in different countries (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). According
to Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis conducted
on the infertility in Iran, the prevalence of
primary infertility has been reported to be 10.6%
(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Infertility is considered as a sign of failure and
implies that the person is not perfect. Most people
do not think that they are infertile, so an infertility
diagnosis is a shock for them (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Anxiety, loss of
self-esteem, shame, and depression caused by infertility
damage the infertile couples' sexual function.
Also, diagnosis, investigation, and treatment
of infertility may interfere with their sexual satisfaction
(<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It is estimated that 80% of marital conflicts
and incompatibilities are caused by couples'
lack of sexual satisfaction (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>According to the results of Iranian reports, many
couples suffer from lack of satisfaction in their
sexual relations and 50 to 60% of divorces as well
as 40% of sexual infidelity are caused by this factor
(<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Infertility can be adversely associated with relational,
sexual and psychosocial wellbeing (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It
has been reported that infertile couples only think
about having children during their intercourse;
therefore, constant concern about the issue of facing
another failure leads to their increased level of
stress (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Psychosocial and social stress leads to
decreased life satisfaction, increased marital problems,
and reduced sexual confidence among infertile
couples (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Based on Berg and Wilson (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)
conclusions marital adjustment is reduced with increasing
number of years of infertility and marital
distress created. Marital distress is affected by intra
couple coping method (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Marital difficulties
in infertile men and women cause the self-blame
and detachment (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and marital functioning is decreased
in infertile couples with treatment process
(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>For this reason, physical infertility treatments are
not enough by themselves, and paying attention to
the mental needs of infertile couples is an essential
element in infertility treatment (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Most therapists
regard training couples in communication
skills as the first step to improve the performance
of couples, because communication problems are
the most widespread complaints expressed by
the couples who seeking (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). There are multiple
approaches preventing marital difficulties or improving
marital compatibility, one of which is the
marital relationship promotion program known as
"marital preparation and enrichment" that was first
introduced by Olson and Olson (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This program
is one of the most successful ones whose efficacy
has been reported in different works (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The
Enrichment program is one that seeks to improve
couples&#x02019; relationships and could determine the factors
and conditions upon which marital satisfaction
and compatibility can be predicted after marriage.
This program includes 4 preventive characteristics;
first, it identifies the factors required by
marital success. Second, it assists couples needing
help to achieve growth and health criteria. Third, it
requires feedback and training for the progress of
couples. Finally, it provides some practices to couples
that could affect their conflict resolution and
communication skills. This program has 6 objectives
and contains some exercises to help couples
achieve these objectives with the purpose of encouraging
them to do planning and cooperate with
each other to deal with major issues (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Considering that a desirable sexual relationship
can increase the chance of fertility (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Infertility
itself can be an important factor in marital dissatisfaction
(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and marital satisfaction can have a
mutual influence on sexual satisfaction (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This
study was conducted to determine the effect of an
enrichment program on marital and sexual satisfaction
as well as marital intimacy of infertile couples
using Enrich marital satisfaction, Linda Berg
sexual satisfaction, and marital intimacy questionnaires
in order to specify the effect of this preventive
program on the satisfaction rate of infertile
couples in terms of the expressed variables.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this randomized controlled clinical trial participants
were selected from the infertile couples referring
to IVF Center of Fatemieh Hospital, Hamedan,
for treatment in 2013. Using data from the study
by Choobforoushzadeh et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), considering the
sample size at confidence interval (CI) 95%, statistical
power of 0.90, and sample loss, finally, 50 couples
were selected (25 couples in the intervention
group and 25 couples in the control group).</p><p>First, the researcher prepared a list of the couples
who had at least one history of failure in the use
of assisted reproductive methods. After additional
investigations, it was found that only 60 couples
had all the inclusion criteria. From among these individuals,
50 couples who were willing to participate
in the study were selected based on Helsinki
principles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig .1</xref>). The random stratified sampling
method was used to randomly assign these individuals
into two experimental and control groups.
For this purpose, the couples were first divided
into two groups with monthly incomes of less than
5 million Rials and equal to or more than 5 million
Rials. Then, they were divided into two subgroups
in terms of infertility duration (less than 5
years and 5 years or more) and each of these subgroups
was divided into three other subgroups
according to education level (elementary, middle
and high school, college). Finally, randomization
was done based on drawing lots in the education
sub-group and the participants were assigned into
two studied groups with the ratio of 1:1. So, the assignment
sequence was pre-determined. Assigning
individuals to the groups was done by drawing lots
and someone blind to the research, which led to
proper concealment of assignment, but due to the
intervention nature, blinding of the researcher and
participants was not possible. Design, implementation,
and reporting of the study were set based on
the CONSORT statement (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Inclusion criteria included: i. Infertile couples
with at least one failure history in infertility treatment
using assisted reproductive methods, ii. Primary
infertility, iii. Risk of infertility with female,
male, both, and unknown factors, iv. Willingness to
participate in the study, v. Having reading and writing
literacy, and vi. Having less than 40 in marital
satisfaction score in basis of Enrich marital satisfaction
questionnaire. The participants were excluded
from the study for the following reasons: lack of
regular attendance at all sessions, attendance of
only one of the marital partners, or pregnancy occurred
during the treatment because the volunteers
did not complete all of the survey instruments.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Int-J-Fertil-Steril-11-197-g01"/></fig><p>The data collection tool included demographic characteristics,
Persian Enrich marital satisfaction, Linda
Berg sexual satisfaction, and marital intimacy questionnaires.
Persian Enrich marital satisfaction questionnaire
contained 47 questions, 5 of which were related
to children. Since the questionnaire was used for
infertile men and women, these 5 questions were removed
in the expert panel formed based on the related
specialists (2 Ph.D. holders in reproductive health, 2
epidemiologists, 2 Ph.D. holders in health education,
and 1 Ph.D. holder in nursing) and the infertile couples
answered 42 questions. The validity of this questionnaire
is confirmed in previous studies conducted in this
field (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The Linda Berg sexual satisfaction questionnaire
has 17 questions, whose validity was confirmed
by Salehi Fedardi (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The marital intimacy questionnaire&#x02019;s
content validity was confirmed the Oulia
et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) study. Regarding reliability of each of the
employed questionnaires, we obtained acceptable reliability
for all tools examined by the Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha
coefficient analysis (Persian Enrich marital satisfaction,
0.87; Linda Berg sexual satisfaction, 0.91; and
marital intimacy questionnaire, 0.85).</p><p>The participants in the study were contacted and
asked to return to the center in order to complete the
pretest questionnaires after assigning the individuals
into two above-mentioned groups. The questionnaires
were given to 100 people (50 men and 50
women) as intervention (25 men and 25 women) and
control (25 men and 25 women) groups. The provisional
norm of these questionnaires were calculated
separately for the interventional and control groups.
Before performing the research, written informed
consent was obtained from all participants. One session
of the expert panel was held, in which the respective
professors attended (1 social prevention specialist,
1 statistician and epidemiologist, 1 psychiatrist,
and 1 reproductive health specialist) to determine the
best intervention method to promote the marital relationship
of infertile couples. Finally, it was decided
to use the couples' relationship enrichment model.
For the experimental group and based on the couples'
relationship enrichment model, training classes
seven 90 minutes sessions as a group with couples
(men and women at the same time) were held twice
per week, which included indeed, the fourth session
(training on sexual relationship promotion) was held
separately for men and women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Marital relationship enrichment program</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">First session</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Objective: Familiarity with the members and expression of the

of sphericity was not significant (P=0.62). So repeated
measure test was used to compare the mean
scores of marital and sexual satisfaction as well as
marital intimacy at different times of investigation
in both groups. Findings showed that the mean
score of marital satisfaction had a significant difference
(P&#x0003c;0.001) at different times between the
two groups. The Bonferroni post-hoc test demonstrated
statistically significant difference in marital
satisfaction scores between immediately after
completing the training courses and the pretest
(P&#x0003c;0.001) as well as 8 weeks after completion
of the training courses and the pretest (P&#x0003c;0.001).
These results were repeated in the case of sexual
satisfaction. Investigating the marital intimacy
mean scores showed statistically significant difference
between the experimental and control
groups (P&#x0003c;0.001). The Bonferroni post-hoc test
demonstrated that, immediately after the completion
of the courses, the marital satisfaction score
was significantly increased compared with the pretest
(P=0.04). Also, the investigation conducted 8
weeks after the course completion showed significant
increase of marital intimacy scores in comparison
with the pretest (P&#x0003c;0.001, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>ANCOVA was used to eliminate the effect of pretest
on the results obtained in the posttest. The findings
showed that, by controlling for the pretest effect,

the effect of enrichment program on marital as
well as sexual satisfaction and marital intimacy of
infertile couples. As far as the effect of the program
on marital satisfaction was concerned, individuals
in the control group attained a higher mean
score of marital satisfaction before the intervention,
but after the test and two months later, these
scores were decreased, which was probably due to
the marital satisfaction effect of time and continued
duration of infertility. The mean score in the
individuals of the experimental group was higher
immediately after the intervention in comparison
with the pretest. Two months after the intervention,
although this mean score was higher than the
pretest, it was decreased compared with the study
conducted immediately after the intervention.</p><p>A drop after 2 months proved the necessity of
continuing the enrichment trainings. Providing
continuous training either in person, through mass
communication means, or by family, and friends,
and other relatives could have a major role in increasing
marital satisfaction. Maintenance and
skills help couples maintain and apply what they
have learned during the sessions and expand them
to other areas of their life such as work environments
(<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Laub et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) concluded that the
longer-term the enrichment program and the more
emphasis on the formation of skills, the higher
and more stable its positive effect on the couples
and their life satisfaction would be. As mentioned,
among infertile couples undergoing infertility treatment,
couples relationship enrichment program
could increase the level of marital satisfaction in
the experimental group. The findings of this study
were consistent with the results of other works (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>); in the study by Isanezhad et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) conducting
on 36 couples in Comprehensive Medical and
Counseling Center in Isfahan, the relationship enrichment
program could significantly improve the
total score of couples&#x02019; marital quality, including
marital agreement, satisfaction, and marital cohesion.
This effect persisted in the follow-up carried
out 1 month later. Ghasemi Moghadam et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)
in their study which was conducted on married
women in Tehran during 2010 to 2011 observed
that marital relationship enrichment training using
Olson&#x02019;s method could significantly increase the
mean score of overall marital satisfaction, even
when husbands did not participate in the training
program.</p><p>The results of the current study showed that
the marital relationship enrichment training was
effective in increasing the infertile couples&#x02019; intimacy
in the pretest and 2 months later. The finding
that satisfaction with marital relationship could
have an effect on marital intimacy was consistent
with Etemadi&#x02019;s finding in 2005 on the application
of cognitive-behavioral techniques and increased
marital intimacy (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In another hypothesis by
these authors representing the role of applying
therapeutic communication techniques to increase
marital intimacy, it was found that use of the therapeutic
communication techniques could increase
affective, psychological, intellectual, spiritual, social,
and entertainment intimacy. This finding was
consistent with our research results.</p><p>Another objective of the present study was to
determine the effect of this program on the couples'
sexual satisfaction. The marital relationship
enrichment training increased sexual satisfaction
in infertile couples. In support of this finding,
Shams Mofarahe et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) also demonstrated
that the sexual satisfaction of women, 1 month
after consultation, was higher in the intervention
group than the control group. In fact, if sexual
relations between spouses are not satisfactory,
this leads to feelings of deprivation, frustration,
insecurity and lack of happiness. Dissatisfaction
with sexual relationship might cause problems
such as depression (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) or divorce (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Satisfactory
sexual relations could contribute to family
strengthening and become the basis for acquiring
and consolidating a solid relationship (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).
Laub et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) investigated the effectiveness of
a relationship enhancement program on couples&#x02019;
relationships in the long run and concluded that
the spouses attained higher sexual and physical
intimacy as well as more communication stability
than the control group. To prevent sample loss
due to the large number of training sessions, the
sessions were held twice per week.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Considering the positive impact of the enrichment
program at posttest and follow-up stages on
marital and sexual satisfaction and sexual intimacy
in the infertile couples, it can be concluded that the
program can be appropriately used in infertile couples with sexual problems. Enrichment skills are the
skills that help satisfy the strongest desires of families
(sexual desires) and are used in almost all cultures.
Considering the fact that enrichment training
is a preventive and non-invasive program and can
prevent deterioration into marital conflict, establishing
and developing a center to provide such training
is recommended, especially for vulnerable groups
such as infertile couples who need special attention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This article was extracted from a student research
