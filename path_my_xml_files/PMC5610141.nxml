The risk of transmission of type 2 poliovirus or Sabin 2 virus on re-introduction or resurgence of type 2 poliovirus after this switch is not understood completely. We aimed to assess the risk of Sabin 2 transmission after a polio vaccination campaign with a monovalent type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did an open-label cluster-randomised trial in villages in the Matlab region of Bangladesh.

After completion of enrolment, we implemented an mOPV2 vaccination campaign that targeted 40% of children younger than 5 years, regardless of enrolment status. The primary outcome was Sabin 2 incidence in the 10 weeks after the campaign in per-protocol infants who did not receive mOPV2, as assessed by faecal shedding of Sabin 2 by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The effect of previous immunity on incidence was also investigated with a dynamical model of poliovirus transmission to observe prevalence and incidence of Sabin 2 virus.

Faecal shedding of Sabin 2 in infants who did not receive the mOPV2 challenge did not differ between children immunised with bOPV and one or two doses of IPV and those who received tOPV (15 of 252 [6%] vs six of 122 [4%]; odds ratio [OR] 1&#x000b7;29, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;45&#x02013;3&#x000b7;72; p=0&#x000b7;310).

This search identified 511 reports, of which only 81 were transmission studies. Findings of studies from the 1950s and 1960s showed that Sabin strains that constitute trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) are transmissible among intimate contacts and within communities, even in the presence of naturally acquired immunity. Since 2001, it is well understood that transmission of oral polio vaccine can persist in under-immunised populations and regain neurovirulence to cause circulating vaccine-derived outbreaks that, in turn, cause paralysis indistinguishable from that caused by wild poliovirus. Findings of clinical trials in which participants were given challenge doses of monovalent type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2) showed that mixed immunisation schedules of bivalent types 1 and 3 oral polio vaccine (bOPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) provide superior protection from infection relative to IPV alone, but the protection is inferior to that produced by a full course of tOPV. We do not know of any published studies that describe Sabin 2 transmission in the context of mixed tOPV and bOPV and IPV population immunity.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>Our study reports novel data at the population level from the first synchronised switch from tOPV to bOPV and IPV routine immunisation in a cluster-randomised trial, observing community transmission of poliovirus in a low-income rural community setting. 9 months later, after immunisation with either tOPV or bOPV and IPV, we implemented a mass vaccination campaign with mOPV2 to 40% of enrolled infants and community participants younger than 5 years as a novel approach to elicit community dynamics of massive exposure to oral polio vaccine in a trial setting. The switch from tOPV to bOPV and IPV facilitated more transmission of Sabin 2 in the first 10 weeks after an mOPV2 campaign and increased the quantity of virus shed in recipients of bOPV and IPV and their contacts who were not directly vaccinated with mOPV2. Adding a second dose of IPV to the end of the routine immunisation schedule did not mitigate these changes.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Our data confirm historical observations that, on withdrawal from routine use, Sabin 2 will persist only for limited durations in well-immunised populations irrespective of living conditions and socioeconomic status. The risk of epidemic Sabin 2 transmission remains small in well-immunised communities within 1 year of tOPV cessation, but the increased quantity of virus shed in populations with birth cohorts receiving bOPV and IPV relative to those receiving tOPV indicates that the transmission potential of Sabin 2 will increase as the birth cohort receiving bOPV and IPV grows. This risk should be mitigated by maintaining high population immunity with IPV, improved environmental surveillance for vaccine-derived poliovirus transmission, and maintenance of mOPV2 stockpiles and protocols to respond to vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks.</p></boxed-text></p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, transmission experiments with oral polio vaccine showed that the Sabin strains are transmitted easily among close contacts and within small communities, and that Sabin 2 is the most transmissible of the three strains.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These historical studies were done in southern USA under variable sanitation conditions in the context of natural immunity, and with limited exposure to IPV, and it is not known how representative they are in the post-eradication era.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Widespread tOPV vaccination eliminated type 2 transmission wherever sufficient coverage was achieved. bOPV and at least one dose of IPV provides inferior intestinal immunity to type 2 relative to tOPV,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and the degree to which cross-immunity to type 2 poliovirus<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> will protect against the increased risk of community transmission of Sabin 2 is not known.

Medical officers enrolled infants to participate in stool surveillance if they were aged 6 weeks at the time of their first polio vaccination, their parent or guardian's primary residence at the time of vaccination was a participating village, and written informed consent had been obtained before the infant's first polio vaccination. We excluded infants from enrolment for surveillance if they had known hypersensitivity to any component in the vaccines, uncorrected congenital malformation, or known or suspected immunodeficiency. Irrespective of enrolment for stool surveillance, all infants born during our study and without medical contraindication received the immunisation schedule assigned to their village of residence as part of the routine health services provided by icddr,b in the HDSS service area. For each enrolled infant, we also enrolled the two youngest household contacts among the infant's extended family&#x02014;as defined by their siblings, caregiver, and anyone sharing a cooking pot (<italic>khana</italic>) with the caregiver&#x02014;to participate in stool surveillance. We enrolled household contacts if their primary residence was in a participating village and written informed consent was obtained before their infant's first polio vaccination. Finally, community participants were children who received mOPV2 but were not enrolled for stool surveillance. To be a community participant, a child had to be younger than 5 years on Jan 24, 2016, have their primary residence in a participating village, and be randomly assigned from HDSS census data as a potential participant. Also, written informed consent must have been obtained by a field worker or study doctor before mOPV2 administration.</p><p>Finally, we selected at random 40% of all children younger than 5 years and living in all villages to be community participants and obtained consent to receive mOPV2 as part of a campaign done 2 weeks after completion of enrolment.

We defined incidence as the proportion of infants in the per-protocol cohort who did not receive mOPV2, were negative for type 2 poliovirus at the time of mOPV2 challenge, and provided at least one stool sample positive for Sabin 2 at any point during the 10 weeks after, adjusted for within-village correlation. The primary hypothesis was that incidence would be higher in infants treated with bOPV and either one or two doses of IPV relative to those treated with tOPV. The two groups treated with bOPV and one or two doses of IPV were combined in the preplanned analysis of the primary objective because any potential difference between the two IPV-containing treatments was expected to be small by comparison with the difference between bOPV and tOPV.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>Secondary objectives were to test the hypothesis that two doses of IPV would reduce transmission in infants treated also with bOPV relative to those treated with bOPV and one dose of IPV, and to measure the intestinal immunogenicity (incidence of shedding) in individuals who directly received mOPV2. Descriptive outcomes included incidence of Sabin 2 transmission in household contacts and the average concentrations of poliovirus shed (viral copy number per g of stool) in each trial arm.

We calculated the significance of differences between tOPV and both bOPV and IPV schedules using a one-sided Wald test (&#x003b1;=0&#x000b7;05) for the hypothesis that the combined mean incidence over the first 10 weeks in both bOPV and IPV groups (assuming normal residuals) was higher than the incidence with tOPV.

In households in which no one was given mOPV2 directly, infants were more likely to be index cases (at 10 weeks: bOPV and IPV, 13 of 231 [6%] <italic>vs</italic> tOPV, five of 115 [4%]; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4C</xref>) than were older contacts (at 10 weeks: bOPV and IPV, four of 441 [1%] <italic>vs</italic> tOPV, one of 221 [&#x0003c;1%]; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4D</xref>). Community transmission in infants was highest with bOPV and one or two doses of IPV, reflecting the greater susceptibility of these individuals to naturally acquired infection, and no systematic differences were noted in community-acquired incidence of contacts by trial group. In both infants and contacts, incidence of Sabin 2 shedding accumulated steadily over the first 10 weeks, consistent with the transmission motif that households not receiving mOPV2 were exposed to a couple of generations of transmission from social contacts.<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Incidence by household structure</p><p>bOPV=bivalent types 1 and 3 oral polio vaccine.

Although the small observed increase in transmission does not pose an immediate threat of uncontrolled transmission of type 2 poliovirus in our well-vaccinated community, principled extrapolation from a biologically plausible polio transmission model showed that, as population immunity to Sabin 2 declines, re-introduction will be capable of seeding poliovirus transmission at intensities comparable with those seen during wild poliovirus transmission (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>). This intrinsically high transmission potential of Sabin 2 has much greater effect in communities in which population immunity is low. In infants who received mOPV2, we recorded an increase in Sabin 2 excretion in the combined bOPV and IPV groups compared with the tOPV group after the mOPV2 challenge. Moreover, administration of bOPV and two doses of IPV did not provide better mucosal immunity compared with bOPV and one dose of IPV. Our findings provide further evidence that, in the context of inducing primary intestinal mucosal immunity to type 2 poliovirus, the bOPV and IPV vaccine regimen is less effective compared with the previous tOPV vaccine regimen.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>These findings suggest that the low intestinal immunity to Sabin 2 due to the bOPV and IPV vaccine regimen in routine immunisation, relative to tOPV in routine immunisation, decreases population immunity against Sabin 2 transmission within a short time after tOPV cessation. After completing a routine immunisation schedule of bOPV and IPV, individuals remain more susceptible to Sabin 2 infection from either mOPV2 vaccination or transmission, and those infected shed more poliovirus and drive increased transmission to contacts previously immunised with tOPV. In our well-immunised population, we recorded Sabin 2 infection attributable to the mOPV2 campaign for at least 10 weeks, and one new infection was noted 22 weeks after the campaign and, thus, 8 weeks after cessation of tOPV use in Bangladesh.</p><p>In all trial groups, transmission of Sabin 2 was limited at the community level. Household transmission typically took place within 5 weeks of the index infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>), and community transmission lasted roughly 10 weeks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4C, 4D</xref>), suggesting that only a couple of generations of transmission occurred in this well-immunised community. Our results of low baseline prevalence and sporadic transmission in rural Bangladesh support the expectation of the assured fadeout of Sabin 2 after April, 2016, in all settings with high intestinal immunity for polio irrespective of other risk factors for enteric disease transmission.</p><p>Data from the modelling study were similar to estimates previously reported in a comparable study from Houston in 1960,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> in which observed incidence of Sabin 2 shedding in household contacts was roughly 60% in the absence of substantial intestinal immunity.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> In Matlab in 2016, incidence was restricted to a few percent by immunity from tOPV completion rates of greater than 93% since 1990.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> As time accumulates after tOPV cessation and the age cohort with low intestinal immunity grows, household transmission after mOPV2 re-introduction will increase substantially in households with multiple children born after cessation, approaching levels seen before introduction of widespread oral polio vaccine immunisation<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> by 2021, and wild poliovirus-like levels from the prevaccine era by 2030,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> with highest risk in the post-cessation birth cohort.</p><p>The main limitation of this study was the very low (&#x0003c;1%) baseline prevalence of Sabin 2 faecal shedding in unvaccinated infants in Matlab by comparison with published prevalences from Egypt (5%),<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Chile (2%),<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and a multicentre study in Latin America (4%).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Our study results are from a rural community in Matlab, Bangladesh; therefore, they might not be directly applicable to other settings (ie, urban, less intensive health surveillance) with higher levels of baseline Sabin 2 transmission.</p><p>The small changes seen 9 months after local cessation of tOPV are potentially a harbinger of larger changes to come as birth cohorts without Sabin 2 vaccination accumulate over time. The inherent transmissibility of Sabin 2, coupled with its genetic instability and capacity to cause paralytic poliomyelitis, poses a long-term threat to polio eradication. As population immunity declines, enhanced surveillance will be necessary for timely detection and response to unexpected type 2 transmission, to prevent circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks in addition to maintaining high coverage with IPV. Furthermore, to guarantee the long-term stability of polio eradication, it is imperative that the research community continues to develop alternative polio vaccines<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> that have comparable intestinal immunogenicity to Sabin 2 without the risks of epidemic transmission and paralysis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
