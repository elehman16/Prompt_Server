The active CPP is a naturally occurring molecule that can bind to calcium and phosphates and at the same time stabilize ACP. In the oral cavity, calcium and phosphate ions are released from CPP as the pH in the plaque decreases resulting in supersaturation which reduces demineralization and promotes remineralization.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>A mean decrease of 1.6 &#x000b1; 0.9 for group II which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) was observed. The mean change in Group II was significantly higher than the mean change in Group I (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) showing that CPP&#x02013;ACP had a better anticariogenic potential compared to fluoride varnish.</p><p>Caseinophosphopeptides stabilizes ACP, which in turn localizes ACP in dental plaque, acting as large calcium reservoir within plaque that slows the diffusion of free calcium ions providing a source of calcium for remineralization, and thus restricting mineral loss during a cariogenic episode.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Therefore, the mechanism of anticariogenicity for CPP&#x02013;ACP is that this bioactive peptide substantially increases the level of ACP in plaque, thus depressing enamel demineralization and enhancing remineralization. Because the concentration of CPP&#x02013;ACP in contact with tooth enamel increases so does remineralization. Reynolds[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed an increased concentration of free and bound calcium in 0.5 and 1.0% CPP&#x02013;ACP preparations, which was most effective at remineralization of the dental enamel.</p><p>There is reduced enamel subsurface demineralization when enamel plaque is exposed to solutions of tryptic peptides of casein. Thus, incorporating casein peptides into enamel plaque increases the plaque's content of calcium and phosphate.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The tryptic peptides responsible for caseinate's anticariogenic activity are the calcium phosphate stabilizing CPPs. These CPPs contain a specific sequence, which markedly increases the apparent solubility of calcium phosphate by stabilizing ACP, forming solutions that are supersaturated with respect to calcium phosphates.</p><p>In a caries study, using 0.5% weights per volume (w/v) solution of CPP&#x02013;ACP nanocomplexes with a 500 ppm fluoride solution, the anticariogenecity of CPP&#x02013;ACP and fluoride together was additive, when compared to either CPP&#x02013;ACP or fluoride alone.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The advantage of using CPP&#x02013;ACP complexed with fluoride is the simultaneous availability of calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. The calcium phosphate in these complexes is biologically available for remineralization of subsurface lesions in tooth enamel. In addition, in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, Reynolds <italic>et al</italic>. found that the enamel remineralization potential of mouthwash containing CPP&#x02013;ACP and 220 ppm fluoride was superior than CPP&#x02013;ACP and fluoride mouth rinse.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The distribution of participants according to the <italic>S. mutans</italic> score pre-application as 12 in class 2 and 18 in class 3 in group III for application of CPP&#x02013;ACP plus fluoride (<italic>P</italic> = 0.60) changed to 15, 12, 3, and 0 in class 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). The mean score before treatment was 2.6 &#x000b1; 0.5 which decreased to a mean score of 0.6 &#x000b1; 0.7, drawing attention to the fact that CPP&#x02013;ACP and fluoride together is more proficient than either of the materials used independently, which was also observed by Sudjalim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Erdam <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Further, in the present study, no significant differences were reported among experimental and control groups in relation to incidence of adverse reactions. This is in accordance with the work of Rao <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Sitthisettapong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Well-documented evidence of fluorides reducing caries by various mechanisms has been clearly established, however, its hazardous effects cannot be overlooked.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various nonfluoride caries preventive and remineralizing agents including CPP&#x02013;ACP and CPP&#x02013;ACP plus fluorides. Literature regarding the caries preventive and remineralization action of CPP&#x02013;ACP and CPP&#x02013;ACP plus fluorides is scarce, and the current review papers and meta-analysis focus on the requirement of further well-designed clinical trials and also advocate that the use of these materials must be encouraged by practicing dentists in day-to-day oral hygiene practices and dental materials.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study indicate that the use of the materials fluoride varnish, CPP&#x02013;ACP, and CPP&#x02013;ACP plus fluoride prevents the loss of tooth structure, preserving the integrity of primary dentition with the most encouraging results with CPP&#x02013;ACP plus fluoride.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>With the ever changing scenario of preventive dentistry, the efficacy of newly introduced materials such as CPP&#x02013;ACP in preventing enamel demineralization against the established material fluoride warrants further clinical trials. Therefore, the present study using fluoride varnish, CPP&#x02013;ACP, and CPP&#x02013;ACP plus fluoride was conducted, and the results revealed that there was a statistically significant reduction in the counts of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in the plaque biofilm after a period of 24 hours.</p><p>Although the clinical trials on CPP&#x02013;ACP and CPP&#x02013;ACP plus fluoride are still in the infancy stage, the results of the present study stress the continued need for the long-term efficacy of these materials in changing the dynamics of dental caries towards remineralization, consequent to significant reduction in the counts of cariogenic bacteria both in children and adults.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
