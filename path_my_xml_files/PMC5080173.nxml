manipulation therapy on respiratory function including forced vital capacity and forced
expiratory volume in one second in young healthy individuals. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty young healthy subjects recruited from a local university participated in this
study. Subjects were randomly allocated into an experimental group (n=15) and a control
group (n=15). The experimental group received thoracic spinal manipulation and the control
group received placebo thoracic spinal manipulation. Respiratory function tests, including
forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second, were measured before and
after intervention. [Results] The values for both tests were significantly higher in the
experimental group. The control group showed no changes after the intervention.
Differences in pre- and post-intervention values for both tests were significantly
different between the 2 groups. [Conclusion] Spinal manipulation therapy applied to the
thoracic region improved respiratory function test results of participants in this
study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Thoracic vertebrae</kwd><kwd>Spinal manipulation</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function tests</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Impaired respiratory function shows a high correlation with morbidity and mortality, and is

patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impaired respiratory function is also a common cause of death in
patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
elderly, impaired respiratory function is one factor leading to declining physical function
and eventually to increased morbidity and mortality<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several methods used to improve respiratory function have been
studied, including pulmonary rehabilition<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, medicine therapy<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>,
operative methods<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, respiratory muscle

manipulation therapy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, evidence supporting the use of spinal manipulation to improve respiratory function
is lacking, and further research is required<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Spinal manipulation has also been used to increase rib cage
mobility to improve respiratory function. However, in prior studies, spinal manipulation was
administered to the cervical and thoracic regions and the ribs<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, or to a designated level of the thoracic spine that is
not related to joint mobility<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, the spinal level at which manipulation affects respiratory function is not clear.
In this study, manipulation was only applied to the thoracic region with reduced joint
mobility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate effect of spinal thoracic
manipulation on respiratory function tests in healthy young subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-five healthy participants between the ages of 20 and 38&#x02005;years who were not currently
taking any medication for a respiratory condition and had no pain in the thoracic region
were recruited from the local university. Social smokers and anyone with contraindications
to spinal manipulation were excluded from the study. Allocation to groups was randomized and
concealed from all participants, with each participant selecting a sealed envelope from a
set of prepared envelopes. Each envelop had a group number written inside. Number 1 assigned
participants to the experimental group and number 2 assigned participants to the control
group. Before thoracic spinal manipulation, all participants underwent respiratory function
testing. Participants then rested for 10 minutes before undergoing thoracic spinal
manipulation. After manipulation, respiratory function tests were immediately
reevaluated.</p><p>The experimental group received thoracic spinal manipulation. The participants were
instructed to lie in a supine position with their arms folded horizontally across their
chest. The therapist positioned a stabilizing hand in a pistol grip. The thoracic spinal
manipulation component involved both high-velocity and low-amplitude (HVLA) maneuvers, and
was restricted to the thoracic region to maximize the effect on chest wall rigidity. The
control group received placebo thoracic spinal manipulation in the same position, except
that the therapist&#x02019;s hand was open and not in a pistol grip. Because no force was applied,
no actual manipulation was performed.</p><p>The respiratory function measurements included forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and were evaluated with a spirometer (SP-1,
Schiller, USA).</p><p>The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test variables for normality, and the independent t-test
was used for comparisons of respiratory function between the experimental and control
groups. Comparison of pre- and post-spinal thoracic manipulation respiratory function in
each group was analyzed using the paired t-test. SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
Windows was used for all analyses, and p values of &#x0003c;0.05 were regarded as significant.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sahmyook University, and all participants
provided informed consent before participation in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty-five healthy volunteers participated in this study. However, 5 volunteers were
excluded from the study because they refused to receive spinal manipulation. The basic
characteristics did not differ between the experimental and control groups. After the
intervention, the FVC and FEV1 were significantly increased in the experimental group
(p&#x0003c;0.05). However, the control group showed no difference after the intervention.
Differences between the 2 groups in pre- and post-intervention FVC and FEV1 were significant

respiratory function (FVC and FEV1). After the intervention, only the experimental group
showed improved respiratory function test results for both FVC and FEV1. These results are
in agreement with those of previous studies. Henley et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> proposed that manipulation therapy promotes autonomic activity,
causing associated vasodilation, smooth muscle relaxation, and increased blood flow, leading
to improved range of motion, decreased pain perception, and/or changes in the tissue. It
would seem reasonable to consider manipulation therapy as an adjunctive therapeutic approach
to increase thoracic mobility, reduce the work of breathing, and manage pain. The
administration of manual therapy to the thoracic region may regulate the autonomic nerve
supply to the respiratory muscles<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, a number of studies have shown that increasing thoracic joint mobility
improves lung function in the short term in normal individuals<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, spinal manipulation was only applied to the thoracic region with reduced
mobility. Thoracic spinal manipulation may have increased thoracic joint mobility, and thus
improved respiratory function test results in this study. However, the improvements in
results after intervention in the experimental group were very small. This small amount of
change in test results may be the result of treating healthy young volunteers. Changes in
respiratory function after thoracic spinal manipulation may be much greater in individuals
with respiratory dysfunction.</p><p>There are some limitations of this study. First, a larger and more diverse population of
participants, including older individuals and patients with respiratory dysfunction, such as
those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, will be necessary. In addition,
measurements of thoracic joint mobility are necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Celli</surname><given-names>BR</given-names></name><name><surname>MacNee</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group>, ATS/ERS Task Force: <article-title>Standards for the diagnosis and
