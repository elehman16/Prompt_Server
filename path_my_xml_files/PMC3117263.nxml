Several studies have shown that free malignant cells collect on circular stapling devices during anterior resection and suggested that the use of staplers could result in a higher rate of recurrence after surgical anastomosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Rectal stump washout has been recommended to prevent the implantation of exfoliated malignant cells in the anastomosis after anterior resection for rectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In patients with colon cancer, the mechanism and prevention of anastomotic recurrence have not been sufficiently investigated, because the rate of anastomotic recurrence in those patients appears to be lower than that in patients with rectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Functional end-to-end anastomosis (FEEA) following bowel resection has many advantages, including simplicity, reduced procedure time, and the relative cleanliness of the operative field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, with the popularization of FEEA, reports concerning anastomotic recurrence along the staple line after resection in patients with colon cancer have increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These reports imply that the implantation of exfoliated malignant cells during FEEA contributes to the local recurrence of cancer along staple lines. Therefore, we aimed to assess the impact of surgical bowel occlusion around the tumor and intraluminal lavage on the presence of exfoliated malignant cells at anastomosis sites in patients with colon cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Thirty-two consecutive patients (median age, 71&#x000a0;years; range, 54&#x02013;84&#x000a0;years; 12 men, 20 women) with colon cancer requiring surgical treatment by right hemicolectomy, who were seen in the Department of Surgery, Osaka Rosai Hospital, between January 2007 and September 2008, were prospectively studied.

A Foley catheter was introduced through the holes, and warm saline in a 50-ml plastic syringe was used to irrigate the intraluminal space at the anastomosis sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

This finding may be explained by the fact that exfoliated malignant cells collected by the circular stapler are implanted on the staple lines during anastomosis, causing anastomotic recurrence in patients with rectal cancer. Using irrigation-fluid specimens from patients with colon cancer, Umpleby et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] demonstrated that exfoliated malignant cells existed at the oral and anal stumps in 57% and 84% of their patients, respectively. In the present study, we cytologically examined the lavage fluid obtained from both bowel sections in the cross-clamped regions and detected exfoliated malignant cells in the terminal ileum and distal colon anastomotic site samples from 11.1% and 55.6% of the control patients, respectively, after right hemicolectomy. The transfer of exfoliated malignant cells from a colonic tumor to the end of the ileum can be prevented via the control of reflux by the ileocecal orifice and bowel peristalsis, explaining the lower frequency of exfoliated malignant cells at this site in our study. However, exfoliated malignant cells were present at a higher frequency at the distal colon anastomosis site, suggesting that occasional implantation and growth of these cells may be responsible for the recurrence of even colon cancer. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate exfoliated malignant cells at the staple lines during FEEA for colon cancer, as well as during the use of the double-stapling technique for rectal cancer.</p><p>Exfoliated malignant cells are cells that disseminate from the tumor to the lumen of the colon. Therefore, factors causing the spread of malignant cells in the lumen are of some concern. We assumed that tumor cells would be detectable more often in patients with bulky tumors but found no significant correlation between the tumor size and the presence of exfoliated malignant cells (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition, the presence or absence of exfoliated malignant cells was not statistically significant with respect to other clinicopathological factors, such as depth of tumor invasion.</p><p>MBP is generally not performed in patients undergoing elective right hemicolectomy nowadays. However, we performed MBP with PEG solution in the patients without preoperative bowel obstruction by the tumor to examine the cleaning effect of this procedure on the presence of exfoliated cells. Our results suggest that the preoperative MBP might have drained exfoliated cells along with feces, because exfoliated malignant cells tended to be absent at the anastomosis sites in both groups of patients who underwent MBP with PEG solution (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p>Exfoliated malignant cells were not found in both the control patients who underwent the laparoscopic approach, but 11 (68.8%) of the 16 patients who underwent open laparotomy had free malignant cells at the anastomotic sites. Dissemination of malignant cells into the lumen of the colon is thought to occur mainly during surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Technically, open right hemicolectomy through a large incision compared with laparoscopic surgery might involve traumatic handling of the tumor and possibly promote the dissemination of malignant cells into the lumen of the colon. However, only a few laparoscopic procedures were performed in the present study. A randomized study between laparoscopic and open approaches with an adequate sample size is essential to determine whether a laparoscopic procedure reduces the presence of exfoliated malignant cells.</p><p>Some studies that indicated the effectiveness of occlusive ligatures, placed around the colon early in the operative procedure to prevent the spread of malignant cells into the lumen, have also indicated reduced recurrence at the suture line following resection and primary anastomosis for colon carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the present study, the bowel lumen proximal and distal to the tumor was occluded by using a linear stapler before any operative manipulation. The no-touch group, in which intraoperative occlusion of the bowel lumen was performed, did not demonstrate exfoliated malignant cells external to the occlusion sites except for two patients in whom adequate MBP could not be performed because of bowel obstruction by the tumor (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p>Intraoperative irrigation of the rectum during anterior resection has been shown to eliminate exfoliated malignant cells collected on a circular stapler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and is a long-standing surgical tradition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the completeness of cleaning with rectal washout was found to be volume-dependent, and a total volume of 500&#x000a0;ml of saline did not ensure the disappearance of malignant cells in all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The irrigation volume needed for complete eradication of exfoliated cells in colon cancer has not previously been defined. Our results indicate that intraoperative colonic irrigation with a total saline volume of 400&#x000a0;ml is enough to eliminate exfoliated malignant cells. However, unlike rectal irrigation during anterior resection, it might be difficult to adopt intraluminal irrigation in colon cancer surgery routinely because irrigation of anastomosis sites with a syringe and catheter is associated with gross contamination of the operating field and prolongation of the operating time. Povidone&#x02013;iodine, chlorhexidine&#x02013;cetrimide, and mercuric perchloride are often used as tumoricidal agents in surgical practice for colorectal cancer, and the clinical importance of these agents in destroying malignant cells has been well described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, an easier, safer, and inexpensive procedure to eliminate exfoliated malignant cells, such as cleaning with a cotton ball containing these tumoricidal agents, is a possibility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Exfoliated malignant cells were quite frequently present at the anastomosis sites in the patients with colon cancer. The results suggest that measures such as surgical bowel occlusion around the tumor and intraluminal lavage can prevent or eliminate exfoliated malignant cells at these sites. However, the local recurrence rate in patients with and without such protective measures will need to be compared for ascertaining the impact of these measures on the anastomotic recurrence of colon cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was supported by a grant from the Osaka Medical Research Foundation for Incurable Disease and a research fund to promote the hospital functions of the Japan Labor Health and Welfare Organization.
