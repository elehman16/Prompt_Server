The use of plates for the fixation of these fractures allows early aggressive hand therapy post-operatively, reducing post-operative stiffness. Traditionally, bicortical fixation is the standard practice, where both dorsal and palmar cortices of the metacarpal are drilled through, with screws engaging both cortices. Recent biomechanical studies have shown that unicortical fixation, where only the near cortex is drilled and engaged by the screw, results in no difference in stiffness, load to failure or failure mechanism, when compared with bicortical fixation.

Surgery is reserved for cases in which an adequate reduction of both angular and rotational deformity cannot be maintained or where an adjacent ray is damaged. Metacarpal shaft fractures may be transverse, where the deformity is typically apex&#x02013;dorsal. Fractures may also be spiral or oblique; these are more unstable, and reduction must restore rotational alignment as a first priority.</p><p>A variety of surgical strategies exist, including percutaneous Kirschner wiring, intramedullary fixation, and osteosynthesis with plate and screw construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The use of plates for the fixation of metacarpal fractures was first documented by Burton and Eudell in 1958 and became widespread in the 1970s and 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A plate secured along the dorsal midline of the metacarpal has been shown to be the best biomechanical method of fixation, with significantly more stability than Kirschner wiring or intramedullary fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As a result, metacarpal plating allows earlier aggressive hand therapy post-operatively than alternative treatment methods, reducing post-operative stiffness. This is now the standard of care for unstable or displaced diaphyseal metacarpal fractures.</p><p>Traditionally, bicortical fixation is the standard practice, where both dorsal and palmar cortices of the metacarpal are drilled though and the screws engage both cortices. However, such practice is not without risk. In this method, the flexor tendons and neurovascular bundles are at risk from over-zealous drilling through the palmar cortex. Correct screw size selection is critical, as overly long screws can irritate and cause rupture of the flexor tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More recently, the biomechanical superiority of bicortical fixation over unicortical fixation in metacarpal fractures has been questioned, as the predominant force acting on the metacarpal is apex&#x02013;dorsal loading (bending in a palmar direction), owing to the action of the flexor tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unicortical fixation is a surgically less complex operation, can theoretically cause less damage to surrounding soft tissues and avoids the complications associated with incorrectly sized screws. This is currently the standard treatment for the fixation of maxillofacial fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>There is a paucity in the literature of studies comparing unicortical and bicortical internal fixation of fractures in the hand, with no clinical or <italic>in-vivo</italic> evidence. In cadaveric studies, Dona <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] showed that there was no difference in the stiffness, load to failure or failure mechanism between unicortical and bicortical fixation of fractures in 18 freshly frozen human metacarpals. The mean load to failure was 596&#x000a0;N for the unicortical group and 541&#x000a0;N for the bicortical group, using a four-point bending protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Afshar <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] showed that bicortical fixation had a load to failure one-fifth greater than unicortical fixation in 20 cadaveric human metacarpals, with a mean load to failure of 370&#x000a0;N for unicortical fixation and 450&#x000a0;N for bicortical fixation, using cyclic loading. However, Afshar <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] did not take into account the biomechanical advantage of an intact soft tissue envelope and conceded that they could not correlate their findings with the loads experienced by the patient during rehabilitation following surgical fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Khalid <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed that bicortical fixation resulted in higher pull-out strengths in 40 cadaveric human proximal phalanges, but recommended unicortical fixation for diaphyseal fractures, as the pull-out force far exceeds that generated by the flexor tendon in passive and active finger flexion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In an animal fracture model, Ochman <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] found that the stability of unicortical and bicortical locking and nonlocking plate fixation differed, with the maximum load to failure greater in locking fixation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Locking plates can create unique problems in the hand, however. The stability of conventional bone plating systems is achieved when the head of the screw compresses the fixation plate to the bone as the screw is tightened, generating a precisely contoured fit. Locking plate and screw systems circumvent the need for precise plate adaptation and achieve stability through a device that &#x02018;locks&#x02019; the screw to the plate while the screw shaft secures the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Imprecisely contoured plates that are offset from the bone can interfere with the extensor mechanism, inhibiting tendon glide and causing bursa formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to compare union rates between unicortical and bicortical screw and plate fixation of diaphyseal metacarpal fractures. Patients will be assessed for fracture union 6&#x000a0;months after their fracture fixation using radiographs, assessed by an independent musculoskeletal radiologist and a senior consultant hand surgeon; a third consultant hand surgeon will be consulted for verification in cases where there is disagreement.</p><p>The secondary objectives are to compare the implant failure rate, complication rate and functional outcomes between the two groups. Functional outcome measures will include scores on the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Outcome Measure, the Patient Evaluation Measure, the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire, and a visual analogue scale for pain, function, movement and satisfaction, as well as a range-of-motion assessment of the affected wrist and finger.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p>This is a prospective, pragmatic, multi-centre, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial.

A member of the surgical team will introduce the trial to eligible patients; if patients would like more information, they will be given the trial patient information documentation and a member of the research team will be informed. Patients will usually have 24&#x000a0;hours to consider participation but will have a minimum of 60&#x000a0;min in exceptional circumstances (e.g. trauma theatre space available on the day of presentation). Written consent will be obtained by a member of the research team, which will include consent for the randomized data of the study to be published in scientific peer-reviewed journals. Baseline pre-operative assessments will be obtained following consent. Randomization will take place immediately before surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Trial interventions</title><p>All of the hospitals involved in this trial currently use both of the methods of fixation and all of the surgeons involved will be familiar with both techniques. Operative fixation of fractures will take place under an axillary brachial plexus regional anaesthetic block or a general anaesthetic block, according to the anaesthetist&#x02019;s preference. Patients will be randomized immediately pre-operatively to the method of fixation using a trial management database program entitled &#x02018;Clinical Research Tool&#x02019; (CREST), designed by University Hospitals Birmingham computer and information technology developers and the trial statistician. Patients will be blinded to their treatment throughout the trial duration.</p><p>In this trial, the details of the surgery will be left to the discretion of the surgeon to ensure that the results of the trial maintain external validity.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Fixation method</title><p>A 2.0&#x000a0;mm straight plate will be applied through an incision over the dorsal aspect of the hand. The details of the surgical approach will be left to the discretion of the surgeon. A minimum of two screws will be used on each side of the fracture to hold the fracture. For patients assigned to unicortical fixation, only the near cortex will be drilled and nonlocking screws only engaging the near cortex will be used to hold the reduction. For patients assigned to bicortical fixation, both the near and far cortices will be drilled and nonlocking screws will engage both cortices. The same type of plate and screws will be used for both fixation methods.</p><p>Patients will be blinded to their treatment regardless of the type of anaesthetic used. For patients undergoing a regional anaesthetic block, a visual drape will be used and audio-visual distraction will be available.</p><p>The method of closure will be left to the discretion of the surgeon. Both patient groups will have a bulky dressing following the operation; the dressing will not inhibit the movement of the fingers and will allow early controlled range-of-movement exercises.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participant timeline</title><p>Patients randomized into the two groups will receive standardized, written hand therapy advice detailing the exercises they need to perform for rehabilitation following their injuries. All participating patients in both groups will be advised to move their wrist and finger joints within comfort limits. Dressings will be removed after between 5 and 7&#x000a0;days in a dressings clinic. Two weeks after surgery, patients will be assessed by a hand therapist and begin formal, standardized, active range-of-movement exercises according to a pre-defined protocol. Hand therapists will be blinded to the method of fixation. Rehabilitation for both treatment groups will be the same. A record of any additional rehabilitation input (type of input and number of additional appointments), together with a record of any other investigations or interventions, will be requested as part of the 2&#x000a0;week, 6&#x000a0;week and 6&#x000a0;month clinical follow-ups and this will also form part of the trial dataset. Clinicians will assess the patients at 6&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months post-operatively and will not be blinded for the purpose of assessing radiographs for complications (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant timeline.

In situations where there is conflict, a third senior hand surgeon will be asked to assess the radiographs and cast a deciding vote. The initial fracture assessment will include fracture displacement and angulation measured on a standard Picture Archiving and Communication System workstation (Agfa Impax 6, Agfa Healthcare), and pre-existing osteoarthritis in the hand. Union assessment on post-operative radiographs will be based on visibility of fracture lucency on each view. Fracture union will be defined as &#x02018;united&#x02019; if trabeculae are seen crossing sclerosis at the fracture, &#x02018;partially united&#x02019; if part of a lucent fracture line is still seen, &#x02018;probably united&#x02019; if there is no clear gap but the fracture cannot be defined as &#x02018;united&#x02019; based on the criteria, and &#x02018;not united&#x02019; if fracture lucency can be clearly seen. If the fracture is partially united, the ratio of width of bridging trabeculae to the entire fracture length will also be recorded as an objective measure of degree of fracture union. Assessment of surgical plate and screws will be recorded for lucency at the metal bone interface, migration or breakage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Intra-operative parameters</title><p>Surgical time and fluoroscopy time will be recorded for each patient.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Outcome Measure</title><p>This is a 30-item, self-reported questionnaire designed to provide a more general measure of physical function and symptoms in people with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>The Patient Evaluation Measure</title><p>This consists of 11 self-reported questions relating to subjective hand function, scored on a Likert scale of 1 to 7.
