motion (ROM) of ipsilateral hip joints into specific patterns based on the differences
between them, and clarify the distribution of these patterns. [Subjects and Methods] A
total of 222 healthy Japanese medical students (162 males, 60 females) with a mean age of
21.2 &#x000b1; 4.0&#x02005;years were enrolled. The ROM of internal and external rotation at the hip were
randomly measured with the subjects in the prone position. Thereafter, the difference
between internal and external rotations was assessed. Hip ROM patterns were classified
into 3 types based on the differences in the rotation ROM on each side. A total of 9
overall patterns were then determined based on the combination of patterns on both sides.
[Results] Although all the subjects were healthy, an asymmetrical ROM between internal and
external rotation in ipsilateral hip joints could be detected via pattern classification.
Moreover, the distribution of each hip ROM pattern was clarified. [Conclusion] Pattern
classification based on differences in internal and external rotation ROM could serve as a
useful evaluation method for clinical manipulative therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hip rotation</kwd><kwd>ROM</kwd><kwd>Pattern</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In general, a normal condition in humans is considered to indicate a healthy state, whereas
an abnormal condition is considered to indicate a state of illness. However, the boundary
between healthy and pathological conditions is not always clear, and diagnoses cannot be
considered accurate in all instances. The precision of diagnoses can be represented by their
positive or negative predictive value, as well as the sensitivity, specificity, and
likelihood ratio<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Accordingly, it means that there is the probability of diagnosing a condition as a disease
in an individual without any abnormality. In contrast, it is also possible that an
individual with an abnormality is diagnosed as not having any disease. Besides such
potential errors in diagnosis, a state exists in humans that may be classified neither as
healthy nor as diseased. This state is referred to as non-illness<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> in oriental medicine. Even if an abnormality is present in
such cases, medical examination may not identify it as such. Some types of musculoskeletal
system disease may present in such a state of non-illness.</p><p>Several explanations for cases of musculoskeletal system disease, typically citing the term
subluxation, have been suggested by Gatterman<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In fact, there are a total of 105 such terms, including
hypermobility, hypomobility, and sprain. These terms are considered to refer to joints that
are not normal. Thus, musculoskeletal system disease is an important target in physical
therapy. The concept of an intermediate boundary between the normal and abnormal state of a
joint has not yet been fully established. Nevertheless, the prevention of progression to
clear abnormality in cases at this intermediate state can be useful.</p><p>Internal and external rotations of the hip occur in the same axis with a typical 45&#x000b0; range
of motion (ROM). Hence, it is important to assess the deviation in the ROM between internal
and external rotation in clinical physical therapy. The ROM of internal and external
rotation of the hip have been used as an indicator of manipulative therapy in the clinical
setting. In fact, some methods in clinical physical therapy are used to treat unbalanced
rotational ROM at the hip, including stretches and muscle strengthening exercises.</p><p>A previously reported special technique is based on a conventional theory of the
interlocking movement of hip joint rotation. The principle underlying this technique is that
the rotational ROM of the hip joint of the left and right sides are linked with each other.
Thus, the ROM of internal rotation will increase on one side when external rotation
decreases on the same side. In contrast, on the contralateral side, internal rotation will
decrease, whereas external rotation will increase. Thus, in such cases with an abnormality
on one side, the treatment approach could be initiated from the other side. This method
could be used to adjust the unbalanced rotational ROM at the hip joint.</p><p>These patterns in external and internal rotation are reported to be linked in certain
studies, whereas no linkage has been found in other studies. Kishi et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that left hip rotational ROM was
lower in subjects with low back pain than in subjects without low back pain. Uritani et
al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that isometric strength,
measured at three different positions, was affected by hip flexion during hip internal
rotation.</p><p>With regard to the classification of patterns of the rotational ROM in the hip, studies on
patterns in individuals with low back pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, on the pattern and strength of ROM in healthy individuals<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and on the laterality and measurement
position of rotational ROM<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> have been
reported. Although these studies have compared the pattern of difference between internal
and external rotation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, none of the
previous studies have simultaneously investigated the patterns only on one side.
Furthermore, no studies investigating the classification of patterns of hip rotation ROM in
healthy Japanese male and female subjects have been reported. Although the subjects may be
healthy, the presence of a deviation in hip rotation ROM, i.e., asymmetric internal and
external rotation, should prompt an investigation.</p><p>The present study aimed to classify the rotational ROM of the hip based on the difference
in patterns of internal and external rotation, and to determine the distribution of
rotational balance patterns of ipsilateral and bilateral rotational ROM at the hip among
healthy Japanese male and female subjects. Moreover, the presence of asymmetry in hip
rotation and the distribution of the patterns on the same side were determined. In addition,
the presence or absence of antagonizing patterns and the proportion of individuals with such
antagonizing patterns were identified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 222 healthy Japanese medical students (162 males, 60 females) with a mean age,

The inclusion criteria, the presence of independent movement and ability to
walk in daily life, were self-reported by the subjects. Subjects who were pregnant; those
with paralysis or fractures to the pelvis and lower extremities, or arthritis of the lower
limbs; those undergoing treatment for sprains; and those aged &#x0003e;60&#x02005;years were excluded
from the study.</p><p>The ROMs of internal and external rotation of the hip were measured on the right and left
sides with the subject in the prone position<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The measurements were recorded in 1&#x000b0; increments, using metal
goniometers.</p><p>The measurements were performed according to the &#x0201c;Methods and guidelines for the
measurement of joint range of motion (in Japanese)&#x0201d;<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> by the Japanese Association of
Rehabilitation Medicine and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association. Accordingly, the basic
axis was considered as the vertical line drawn from the patella, whereas the moving axis was
considered as the center line of the lower leg. Measurements were obtained by second- or
third-year physical therapy or occupational therapy students under the guidance of a
physical therapist.</p><p>During measurement, a double-blind method was used, wherein the examiner and subject were
not informed of the values until the end of the examination. The order of measurement of the
different ROMs was determined by drawing lots. Each ROM was measured three times for each
item (internal and external rotation on both sides) using a passive method. With regard to
measurements in the prone position, the subject was placed so as to avoid an unbalanced
position of the neck and trunk.</p><p>During the measurement of internal and external rotation ROM of the hip, the ipsilateral
knee joint was flexed to 90&#x000b0;. To prevent the lifting of the hip from the table during hip
rotation, the pelvis was stabilized using manual pressure. Simultaneously, the ipsilateral
lower leg was moved to the end of the hip&#x02019;s internal rotation ROM. When the contralateral
lower extremity impeded the external rotation ROM, the contralateral hip joint was placed in
an abducted position.</p><p>The mean values of the three measurements were calculated by Microsoft Excel.</p><p>A one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze ipsilateral
hip rotation ROM in male and female subjects, and the significance level was set at 5%.</p><p>The patterns of hip rotation ROM were classified based on the differences between internal
and external rotation on the same side. The criteria for the classification of the rotation
ROM of the hip joint to a specific pattern was a difference of 10&#x000b0;. As the ROM is measured
in the clinical setting in 5&#x000b0; intervals, the use of a value of 5&#x000b0; could lead to potential
errors in classification. The differences in the patterns of ipsilateral hip rotation ROM
were classified based on the differences between internal rotation and external rotation as
follows: balanced pattern (IR&#x02248;ER), when almost no difference (0&#x02013;9&#x000b0;) was observed between
internal rotation and external rotation; internal rotation greater pattern (IR&#x0003e;ER), when
the value of internal rotation was &#x0003e;10&#x000b0; relative to the value of external rotation; and
external rotation greater pattern (IR&#x0003c;ER), when the value of external rotation was
&#x0003e;10&#x000b0; relative to the value of internal rotation (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>The patterns of ipsilateral rotational range of motion in the different hip

classified among healthy Japanese subjects, and the presence of asymmetric states between
internal and external rotation in the ipsilateral hip joint, along with its distribution,
was determined. Although the presence of hip rotation ROM patterns on both sides has been
examined in the United States and Europe, the present study appears to be the first such
study to be performed in Asia<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. With regard to hip rotation ROM in healthy adults in
Japan, external rotation was greater than internal rotation in male subjects, whereas
internal rotation was greater than external rotation in female subjects. Such differences in
the rotational ROM patterns of the ipsilateral hip joint clearly indicate variations between
male and female subjects (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A total of
47.3% subjects showed a balanced pattern, where the difference between internal and external
rotation was&#x0003c;10&#x000b0;. The greater external rotation pattern and greater internal rotation
pattern (i.e., unbalanced patterns) showed different trends between genders.</p><p>In particular, among male subjects, the greater external rotation pattern was observed in
46.6%, whereas the greater internal rotation pattern was observed in 6.8%. In other words,
there was a trend towards the greater external rotation pattern in male subjects. In
contrast, in female subjects, the greater internal rotation pattern was observed in 36.7%
subjects, whereas the greater external rotation pattern was observed in 14.2% subjects,
i.e., there was a trend towards the greater internal rotation pattern in female subjects.
However, no significant difference in the ipsilateral hip rotation ROM patterns between the
left and right sides was observed both in male and female subjects.</p><p>Based on these patterns, it could be noted that antagonizing contrasting patterns were
linked between the left and right sides.</p><p>With regard to pattern classification, a trend towards the greater external rotation
pattern was observed in male subjects and a trend towards the greater internal rotation
pattern was noted in female subjects.</p><p>Lee Sang Wk et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
ROM of hip flexion and internal rotation is limited in cases where the lumbar region is
unstable. Harris-Hayes, who assessed the strength of the hip external rotators in some hip
postures, reported<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> that individuals
with unilateral chronic hip joint pain exhibited significant weakness in their uninvolved
hip. Takemasa et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> described the
relationship of the ROM between internal rotation and external rotation of the hip joint;
the authors stated that one may be larger than normal, whereas the other one may be smaller
than normal, which could result in an increase in ROM in one direction and decrease in ROM
in the opposite direction. Subjects who exhibited a significant difference between internal
and external rotation in the present study were considered to represent such cases.</p><p>The presence of an antagonistic relationship in the rotational ROM of the hip joint on both
sides was confirmed in this study. When the left and right combination patterns were
examined based on the difference between internal and external rotation ROM in the
ipsilateral joint, the proportion of subjects with asymmetry in the rotational ROM of the
hip was found to be approximately 70% (<xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
Male subjects tended to have greater external rotation, whereas females tended to have
greater internal rotation; these findings agree with those of Ellison et al<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, Tamari et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that preventive exercises to
maintain the internal rotation of the hip may be important for elderly male subjects to
avoid knee deformities. In fact, Cibulka et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> mentioned that patellofemoral joint problems are the most commonly
observed overuse injury of the lower extremity and that altered femoral or hip rotation may
play a role in patellofemoral pain.</p><p>A significant difference between internal and external rotation can be considered to affect
performance, including the control of posture and contractile function of the muscles.
Hence, further assessments of the difference between internal and external rotation, as in
the present study, could help prevent non-illness. The evaluation of asymmetry in hip
rotation ROM in healthy individuals may be useful to determine such trends; this could then
lead to the assessment of such findings in pathological conditions or in non-illness
conditions such as in cases of musculoskeletal system disease.</p><p>However, asymmetry of the rotational ROM of the hip may likely be associated with problems
in the adjacent joints. Hence, the pattern classification determined in the present study is
expected to be useful in the evaluation of such conditions. For instance, in cases with
inflammation of the involved joint and pain during the therapeutic approach, this
classification pattern can be used as a basis to indicate the potential for approach from
the uninvolved side rather than the involved side.</p><p>Manipulative therapy in physical therapy is expected to prevent non-illness and play a role
in preventive medicine in the future. The findings of the present study can serve as a guide
when considering the evaluation and approach towards asymmetry in the rotation ROM of the
hip joint.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Joshua</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group>: (Takakura Y, Katou G): Chapter 1.The Reliability and Diagnostic Utility
