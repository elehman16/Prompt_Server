computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR) on the relative brain wave ratios and
activities of daily living (ADL) of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Forty-four
participants were randomly allocated to the NFB (n=14), CACR (n=14), or control (CON)
(n=16) groups. Two expert therapists provided the NFB, CACR, and CON groups with
traditional rehabilitation therapy in 30-minute sessions, 5 times a week, for 6 weeks. NFB
training was provided only to the NFB group and CACR training was provided only to the
CACR group. The CON group received traditional rehabilitation therapy only. Before and
after 6 weeks of intervention, brain wave and ADL evaluations were performed, and the
results were analyzed. [Results] The relative ratio of beta waves, only showed a
significant increase in the frontal and parietal areas of the NFB group. Significant
changes in ADL were shown by all three groups after the intervention. However, there were
no significant differences between the NFB and CACR groups and the CON group. [Conclusion]
Our results suggest that CACR and NFB are effective at improving cognitive function and
ADL of stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neurofeedback (NFB)</kwd><kwd>Computer assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR)</kwd><kwd>Brain wave</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Rehabilitation improves the affected functions of patients and aims to maximize their roles
as members of society. Patients develop the ability to perform higher stages of functional
activity through repetitive and concentrated rehabilitative training, which results in the
improvement of the sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Activities of daily living (ADL) are an important part of occupational performance together
with work, productive activity, leisure, and play, and are also an important goal of
rehabilitation. Should a cerebral infarction also affect the cognitive ability of a patient,
independent performance of basic ADLs, such as eating, dressing, and toileting, may be
disturbed<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Improvements of attention,
memory, visual perception, and sequencing through rehabilitation elicit improvements in
functional ADL performance ability and in the quality of life of the patients and their
families. Furthermore, it has a positive effect on learning ability, shortening the duration
of the hospitalization period, and decreasing rates of depression, as well as other possible
benefits<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it is important to
understand the interrelation between damage to the cognitive ability of stroke patients and
subsequent restriction of activity, and to identify cognitive problems affecting the
restoration of ADLs for recovery<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Strategies for cognitive therapy are widely used to improve cognition after stroke or other
brain damage, but rarely for the acquisition of motor skills. Motor learning, however, is
required for the re-acquisition of motor skills, and cognitive factors such as memory,
perception, and problem solving play important roles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Computer assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR) training focuses
on similar neuropsychological processes, but utilizes computer training of attention and
concentration through the use of games or other programs to improve problem-solving
ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The task of traditional
cognitive therapy involves tackling the problem of lost confidence or decreased interest due
to increased difficulty of control, leading to failure to perform the task, whereas CACR
allows increased possibility of control of the different levels of task difficulty for the
patient<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>More recently, cognitive rehabilitation therapies have tried various approaches including
neurofeedback through electroencephalogram (EEG) training<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This process provides
training for a certain period and is based on neural plasticity, it is based on the theory
that effective learning of motor control requires a certain ratio of brain waves, the
arousal level of patients reaches an optimum level activating the brain, therby influencing
many functional factors<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To date, there is insufficient research examining the relationship between improvements in
ADL independence and changes in brain waves of stroke patients undergoing either NFB or
CACR. Furthermore, despite the fact that it is important to demonstrate that rehabilitation
for patients with brain injury involves the use of each brain area differently, using an
objective evaluation like EEG<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, this has
seldom been attempted. The aim of this study was to identify the most effective
rehabilitation method for stroke patients by comparing the effects of NFB and CACR on brain
waves and ADLs during cognitive rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants were chosen from among 48 stroke inpatients who were undergoing physical
and occupational therapy at an I hospital in Kyeongki-do. Participant selection criteria
were: hemiplegic stroke patients with onset 3 months to 1&#x02005;year before the study, and the
abilities to follow verbal instructions and to communicate. The participants were chosen
from among patients with a mild cognitive deficit who scored 18&#x02013;23 on the mini mental state
examination (MMSE) and were able to perform all the tests. Patients who had never attended
school or had undergone NFB or CACR within the past year were excluded from the study. After
being informed about the study, all subjects agreed to participate and signed a consent
form. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gachon University.</p><p>The participants were randomly assigned to either the NFB, CACR, or control (CON) group.
Participants were provided traditional rehabilitation therapy in 30-minute sessions, twice
weekly for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks of intervention, a test was performed, and the results
were analyzed.

electrodes were attached to the scalp at positions determined by the Standard International
10&#x02013;20 system and oscillograph records<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The patients sat on a comfortable chair, and one electrode was attached at C5 or C6, on the
side of scalp for mono polar training, while the other two electrodes were attached to each
ear. A repeater switched the analog signal of the brainwave imported via each electrode into
a digital signal separated by frequency. The monitor used for treatment showed the original
brain wave of the patient and that of each frequency band, and the therapist chose which
frequencies to compensate and restrict. Controlling the threshold voltage allowed the
brainwaves of the patients to be conditioned.</p><p>The NFB training program of the study used the beta-SMR training mode, which was performed
with open eyes and provided two types of compensation for feedback: acoustic and visual. The
compensation brain wave was a 12&#x02013;15&#x02005;Hz SMR-wave, or a 15&#x02013;18&#x02005;Hz mid-beta wave at the selected
location of the cerebral cortex. The restraining brain waves were applied simultaneously a
0.5&#x02013;4&#x02005;Hz delta-waves and 22&#x02013;36&#x02005;Hz high-beta waves<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The experimental training time was 30 minutes within which 10 sets
of 3 minute training mode periods were performed.</p><p>CACR was developed by RehaCom (Hospi, Seoul, Korea) for computer-based cognitive
rehabilitation and is used clinically<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Patients perform tasks while sitting, looking at a monitor, and respond using a keyboard. In
this study, we chose the attention, concentration, and memory programs of RehaCom, running
the tests for 30 minutes per period according to the functional level of the patient.</p><p>We collected brain wave data using QEEG-8 (Laxtha Inc., Daejeon, Korea). The patients were
repeatedly informed about the electrode attachment, measuring equipment, application of the
analysis program, and measuring process before the test. The brain waves were measured prior
to the other tests executed in this study, with the patient in a comfortable condition and
without any training to prevent interference from the other tests.</p><p>The brain waves were measured at a brain wave laboratory that had no windows, to maintain
constant light and temperature, and no noise, since brainwaves are affected by internal and
external environmental factors. The patients sat on a comfortable chair, and listened to the
instructions and the method of the experiment with the electrodes attached to their scalp to
verify the normal functioning of the equipment. After a 3-minute rest period, the patients
were asked to look forward and their brain waves were measured for 3 minutes. During
measurement, the patients were asked not to talk or move to improve accuracy.</p><p>The brainwaves were analyzed quantitatively using Complexity 2.0 (Laxtha Inc., Daejeon,
Korea). One hundred eighty seconds of raw data, excluding the initial and final 10-second
periods, of only the 4&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz frequency bandwere selected for the analysis, since the
0.5&#x02013;4&#x02005;Hz delta wave is often corrupted by noise arising from instability of posture or
eye-blinking. The raw data was transformed using the fast Fourier transform, which expresses
the contribution by the frequency property on the frequency space, with the value calculated
as the amplitude of the sine raised to the 2nd power or as the absolute band power. The
relative band power was calculated as the ratio of the absolute power rate of a certain
frequency band to the absolute band power and has a value between 0 and 1. Relative power
analysis is used to identify factors leading to personal brainwave differences, such as
skull thickness or level of tension at the time of measuring. The frequencied determined by
the relative power analysis analyzed as a relative theta wave (4&#x02013;8&#x02005;Hz/4&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz), relative
alpha wave (8&#x02013;13&#x02005;Hz/4&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz), relative beta wave (13&#x02013;20&#x02005;Hz/4&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz), and relative gamma wave
(30&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz/4&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz).</p><p>The functional independence measure (FIM) assesses three functional performances of
self-care, motor skill, and cognition, and consists of 18 items of basic ADLs which are
scored on a 7-point scale. The scores range from 18 to 126, with the lowest score reflecting
complete dependence, and the highest score reflecting complete independence. FIM scores
correlate well with motor skills (r=0.77) and cognition (r=0.83)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study analyzed the FIM total score, and the motor
and cognitive subtotal scores.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0. The Shapiro-Wilk test showed the
data was normally distributed. Student&#x02019;s t-test was performed to examine the significance of
within the group differences between before and after training. One-way ANOVA was performed
to examine the significance of differences in the dependent variable among the 3 groups with
the Scheffe method as the post-hoc test. Results were considered statistically significant
for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The brainwave and ADL values before and after NFB or CACR are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the relative beta waves of each group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" valign="middle" align="center" colspan="1">Channel</th><th colspan="2" valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1">NFB</th><th colspan="2" valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1">CACR</th><th colspan="2" valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1">CON</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pre</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">post</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pre</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">post</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pre</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">post</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fp1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.07 &#x000b1;

following NFB or CACR training. Attention and judgment related tasks mainly activate the
frontal area of the brain, and tasks requiring language and spatiotemporal information
mainly activate the parietal region<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The prefrontal area of the brain is mainly involved in cognitive activities, such as direct
attention on new situations, and the frontoparietal area is involved in attention for space
and control of intentional movement<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the relative beta wave values showed a significant difference (p&#x0003c;0.05)
between before and after training at Fp1, Fp2, and F3 in the frontal area of the NFB group,
and between F3 of the NFB group and the control group at post-test (p&#x0003c;0.05). In the
parietal area of the NFB group, brain waves at F3 and P4 showed significant differences
(p&#x0003c;0.05) between before and after training and a significant difference from the control
group at P4 post-test (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>Kim et al. evaluated patients with brain injury and normal controls after CACR cognitive
training using 10 ComCog attention ability tasks, which activate the frontal area and
temporoparietal area more than the front area of the temporo-occipital area, supplementary
motor area, and cingulate gyrus as determined by fMRI, and compared them with a control
group<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Their results showed NFB
training improved the spatiotemporal attention of patients with brain injury. They proposed
that NFB training may induce spread of brain activity to other brain areas eliciting
long-term improvement. Furthermore, the brain activity differed in the injured area and they
also suggested that further research was required in this area.</p><p>Cederfeldt et al. explored the effect of cognitive functions on the restoration of ADLs
1&#x02005;year after discharge of stroke patients. They reported that the patients with cognitive
functional impairment showed a difference in the restoration speed of ADLs compared to the
normal group, and that understanding the relationship between cognitive damage and activity
restraint is necessary, since it is very important to identify the cognitive problem
influencing ADL restoration and to rectify this<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Likewise, the improvement of the cognitive-recognition function is
related to ADL performance in stroke patients, and cognition-recognition training of certain
areas appropriate to the patient&#x02019;s condition is necessary for independent ADL performance,
as well as for a functional training approach in rehabilitation. In addition to hospital
treatment, constant stimulation of cognitive functions by family and the surrounding
environment may also be a motivating factor leading to successful rehabilitation.</p><p>This study found that in terms of ADL performance, as measured by the FIM score, all three
groups showed significant improvements in motor and cognition subtotal scores, and their FIM
total score, and that self-care showed especially significant improvement as part of the
motor skill area (p&#x0003c;0.01). Walker et al. examined the effect of intervention using QEEG
in patients with mild brain damage and found that 88% of patients showed an overall
improvement in ADLs, and all of them returned to their occupations<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kado et al. revealed that CACR therapy for brain damaged
patients improved ADLs such as activity at home, occupational performance, and driving
ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There was no difference in the FIM values among the three training methods. This seems to
result from the fact that NFB, CACR, and traditional rehabilitation therapy aim to be
performed independently from ADLs such as self-care, dressing, or mobility. Traditional
rehabilitation therapy, as well as NFB or CACR, are all considered to be able to lead to
improvement of cognitive function. More rapid rehabilitation seems to be possible, and NFB
and CACR, which are beneficial for stroke patients with cognitive impairment, It is also
necessary to develop and activate NFB and CACR programs and to conduct further research on
the damaged brain areas in patients with cognitive impairments.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cirstea</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Ptito</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Levin</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Feedback and cognition in arm motor skill reacquisition
