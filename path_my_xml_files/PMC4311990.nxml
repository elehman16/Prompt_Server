Forty-eight elderly adults and 45 young adults were assigned to three groups and performed a cognitive control task (Simon task), which was followed by 3 different manipulations of social priming (i.e., thinking about an 82 year-old person): 1) negative&#x02014;characterized by poor cognitive abilities, 2) neutral&#x02014;characterized by acts irrelevant to cognitive abilities, and 3) positive&#x02014;excellent cognitive abilities. After the manipulation, the Simon task was performed again. Results showed improvement in cognitive control effects in seniors after the positive manipulation, indicated by a significant decrease in the magnitude of the Simon and interference effects, but not after the neutral and negative manipulations. Furthermore, a healthy pattern of sequential effect (Gratton) that was absent before the manipulation in all 3 groups appeared after the positive manipulation. Namely, the Simon effect was only present after congruent but not after incongruent trials for the positive manipulation group. No influence of manipulations was found in young adults. These meaningful results were replicated in a second experiment and suggest a decrease in conflict interference resulting from positive cognitive state priming. Our study provides evidence that an implicit social concept of a positive cognitive condition in old age can affect the control process of the elderly and improve cognitive abilities.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported in part by a Kreitman Scholarship from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/kreitman_school/Pages/default.aspx">http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/kreitman_school/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>) and a grant from the Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute of Gerontology and Human Development and Eshel, the association for the planning and development of services for the aged in Israel (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brookdale.jdc.org.il/">http://brookdale.jdc.org.il/</ext-link>).

Cognitive control is related to conflict monitoring&#x02014;the ability to suppress irrelevant information [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and engage selective attention. Commonly, we orchestrate among conflicting sources of information or demands. For example, we may have to decide which object, dimension of an object or event needs to be attended to, and which should be ignored, inhibited, or deferred for later processing. These situations require cognitive control, particularly inhibition. Hasher and Zacks [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have suggested that age-related cognitive impairments result from the weakening of a general inhibitory system. This notion has been supported by other studies as well [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, Maylor, Birak, and Schlaghecken [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found evidence that age- related deficits in inhibitory control generalize to conflicts arising at different levels of perceptual and motor processing.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Simon Task</title><p>One of the simplest tasks employed in studies of control and inhibition is the Simon task [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a visual Simon task, participants are presented with a colored stimulus that appears on the left or the right of fixation, and are required to press a left or right key to report its color [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This arrangement creates two trial types: 1) congruent trials, when the stimulus is presented on the side of the required key-press; and 2) incongruent trials, when the stimulus is presented on the side opposite of the required key-press. Participants respond faster to congruent than incongruent stimuli, a reaction time (RT) difference called the Simon effect. Adding a neutral stimulus (third trial type, positioned at the central vertical meridian of the screen) allows for examining components of the Simon effect. Since a neutral stimulus should not present a conflict [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we expect that performance in response to it should be better than for conflict trials, and worse than for facilitated trials. This set-up allows for distinguishing between components of facilitation (neutral vs. congruent) and interference (incongruent vs. neutral) that are present in the Simon effect, and for testing the magnitude of each component. A neutral condition was introduced as a mean of manipulating control [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The authors suggested that proportionally more neutral trials would induce a lenient attitude in participants, and reduce control. In line with this suggestion, they found that increasing the number of neutral trials increased interference magnitude, suggesting a reduction of control.</p><p>The most common explanation for the Simon effect is related to inhibitory control processes, as a means of solving the spatial conflict created [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Accordingly, one would expect changes in the Simon effect with aging. Indeed, previous results suggest that aging negatively impacts Simon task performance. Van der Lubbe and Verleger [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] found a larger Simon effect in older individuals, which could not be accounted for by generalized psycho-motor slowing due to aging. Bialystok, Craik, Klein, and Viswanathan [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that monolingual elderly adults showed an increased Simon effect compared to bilingual adults and suggested that aging effects on an inhibitory process can be modified by lifelong habits and practice with inhibition of interference from competing languages. Aisenberg, Sapir, d&#x02019;Avossa and Henik [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] compared young and elderly adults in the Simon task using a neutral condition and found a greater Simon effect, particularly due to a greater interference component, in elderly adults.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Effects of Social Priming on Automatic Cognitive Processes</title><p>There is evidence that priming a social concept triggers automatic behavior that is consonant with the primed concept [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, after Bargh, Chen, and Burrows [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] primed participants with the social concept &#x0201c;elderly,&#x0201d; participants behaved like elderly people and walked at a slower pace for 5 minutes. Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] found that when participants were primed with the social concept &#x0201c;professor&#x0201d;, they performed better in a general knowledge task. Also, when participants were primed with the social concept of &#x0201c;soccer hooligans&#x0201d; who are perceived as stupid, a decrease in performance in a general knowledge task was viewed. These changes lasted up to 15 minutes. The replication of these studies is mixed, showing failure [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and success, described by Stroebe, and Strack [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as successful conceptual replications of the study of Bargh et al [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the study of Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Levy [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] primed elderly individuals with age stereotypes (e.g., wisdom, decrepit). She found that participants primed with negative age stereotypes performed worse than those primed with positive age stereotypes in memory tasks. Recently, Goldfarb, Aisenberg, and Henik [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] conducted a Stroop task, priming participants with a social priming concept of dyslexia. In their study, participants were asked to perform a Stroop task (they were presented with colored words and requested to respond to the printed colors while ignoring the meaning of the written words), followed by a manipulation of a dyslectic person, a painter, or a writer, and then they performed another session of the Stroop task. It was found that the known Stroop effect (RT difference between incongruent conflicting word and color trials and congruent matching word and color trials), created because reading is an automatic process, was eliminated for participants primed with dyslexia, in the first block after manipulation. This study was fully replicated recently [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This strongly suggests that social priming can affect automatic processing, particularly inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>The Present Study</title><p>In line with the notion that social priming has an effect on automatic cognitive processes, the present study examined whether social priming could affect the cognitive process of inhibition in healthy elderly adults. Levy [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] suggested that aging stereotypes are beliefs about elderly people as a category, that can operate &#x0201c;below awareness&#x0201d; (p. 203) and become self-stereotypes in old age. In a study by Levy, Slade, Murphy, and Gill [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], elderly adults with positive age stereotypes were44% more likely to fully recover from severe disability than those with negative age stereotypes. We used a Simon task under conditions of social priming. As a social priming manipulation we used the concept of an elderly adult in a negative, neutral, or positive cognitive state. Our hypotheses are specific to the positive manipulation influence but we employed neutral and negative manipulations as well as controls. If a social concept influences inhibitory control, we would expect a decrease of conflict interference after a positive manipulation, compared to neutral and negative manipulations, resulting in a smaller congruency (Simon) effect. In order to better understand the impact of social priming on inhibitory control we shall, by using a neutral condition, address the effects in terms of facilitation and interference.</p><p>Sequential dependencies are another measure of cognitive control. Larger congruency effects are found in trials following congruent than incongruent trials, suggesting that cognitive control is engaged not only at the time of stimulus presentation, but also affects preparatory processes that follow it [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Congruency effects following neutral trials were found to resemble those after congruent trials in the Simon task [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], though Lamers and Roelofs [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] showed them to resemble the after-incongruent effects in the Stroop and flanker tasks, challenging the view of Botvinick et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>In the above-mentioned studies, young adults showed a significant congruency effect after congruent trials that decreased to a non-significant effect after incongruent trials. This effect is also called the adaptation effect (or Gratton effect), as it reflects improved performance from one conflict trial to the following conflict trial. Aisenberg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found impaired sequential dependencies in elderly adults, as they showed a significant Simon effect both after congruent and incongruent trials. This was taken as an indication of a relatively less efficient inhibitory process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>In the context of the present study, if social priming affects cognitive control, we would expect a smaller Simon effect and interference following the implementation of the positive manipulation compared to the negative manipulation. Additionally, we would expect a normal pattern of sequential dependencies after receiving the positive manipulation, as elderly adults will show no Simon effect after incongruent trials, but will show it after congruent trials.</p><p>At the beginning of the experiment, participants performed a two-session Simon task. During the break between the two sessions, they were asked to fill out a &#x0201c;social psychology&#x0201d; questionnaire supposedly related to another study. Three social priming manipulations (negative, neutral, or positive) were used, asking participants to write, within a five-minute period, their thoughts regarding the following: [Negative] <italic>&#x0201c;Joseph, 82 years old, senses a deterioration of his abilities. His memory is impaired and his thinking is not as fast as it used to be. Joseph is frustrated about this, and about the fact that he can no longer solve crossword puzzles as he always loved.&#x0201d;</italic>
</p><p>[Neutral] <italic>&#x0201c;Joseph, 82 years old, is going to his routine examination in a health maintenance organization (HMO). He lives across the street from the HMO, and before an examination he wakes up early and packs an apple and a bottle of water in his bag.&#x0201d;</italic>
</p><p>[Positive] <italic>&#x0201c;Joseph, 82 years old, is enjoying his retirement. Every once in a while he meets friends who tell him they don&#x02019;t feel as well as they used to feel, and that their memory is impaired. Joseph doesn&#x02019;t share this sense at all. His memory is as good as ever, he easily solves cross-words puzzles, and he enjoys thinking games.&#x0201d;</italic>

The Negative manipulation scored 1.7 (SD = 0.8), the neutral manipulation scored 4.9 (SD = 0.5) and the positive manipulation scored 10 (SD = 0).</p><p>It is important to distinguish effects of cognitive social priming from effects of motivation and mood. Social priming of motivation was found to have a positive effect on executive control (see [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]; word puzzles consisting of motivational words improved performance in the Wisconsin Cards Sorting Test&#x02014;WSCT). Additionally, effects of positive and negative mood were found to influence executive function performance. However, the results of mood studies were inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To insure that our priming manipulation did not affect motivation or mood, we conducted a manipulation check in which elderly adults filled mood and motivation questionnaires before and after responding to the five-minute neutral or positive manipulation (see <xref rid="pone.0117151.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). No motivation or mood-induced differences were found.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was conducted under a protocol approved by the Soroka Helsinki Ethics Committee.

A block of 91 trials was created pseudo-randomly, containing at least 30 trials of each condition (congruent, incongruent and neutral), to allow generating the sequence of trials so that each of the nine possible sequential pairings between trial types was present at least 10 times (previous trial congruent and current trial congruent; previous trial congruent and current trial neutral and so on).

Before the beginning of the experimental blocks, the participants practiced on 16 Simon trials. Each trial started with a blank screen for 500 ms, followed by a 500 ms presentation of a fixation black cross at the center of the screen. After the fixation point disappeared, the stimulus appeared either to the right, left, above or below the central position of the screen for 400 ms. The target stimulus was followed by a 600 ms blank screen during which the participant had to respond (see <xref rid="pone.0117151.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

The Gratton pattern of sequential analyses that was present in young adults was not observed in elderly adults. Nevertheless, a healthy Gratton pattern appeared after the positive manipulation. Namely, the Simon effect was only present after congruent but not after incongruent trials. This implies that positive priming allowed elderly adults to benefit from solving one conflict after another.</p><p>The idea that thinking can influence behavior in a way that is outside of awareness is a striking, but not novel, idea [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; (see also [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] for a review). In Smith and Queller&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] review of mental representations, semantic priming was discussed in the context of schema representations. Priming of a schema-relevant stimulus can activate a whole schema (e.g., &#x02018;doctor&#x02019; priming can activate a whole schema of a hospital or medical environment). Higgins, Bargh, and Lombardi [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] proposed a <italic>synapse metaphor</italic>, according to which the activation of a schema is like a charge that decays with time. When one uses a schema it becomes fully &#x0201c;charged&#x0201d; with activation, which will then decay with time. Importantly, the synapse model suggests that frequency of use slows the decay of activation. This suggestion fits the aging self-stereotypes theory of Levy [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and it is possible that the positive manipulation strengthens a positive age self-stereotype. This idea might have implications for considering rehabilitation interventions which make use of social priming.</p><p>Another way of understanding our results emerges from research related to the <italic>resting state default mode network</italic>. Since our results did not yield a significant difference between the blocks in the second session, it looks like the positive priming lasted longer and might have created a more constant change. Raichle et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] suggested the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors. Damoiseaux et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] demonstrated decreased activity in older versus younger participants in resting-state networks (RSN), containing the superior and middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate, middle temporal gyrus, and the superior parietal region. The authors found a correlation between reduced activity in RSN and less effective executive functioning/processing speed in the older group. It is plausible, then, that the positive manipulation in our experiment influenced the RSN by increasing certain activations and decreasing others, thereby allowing for improved executive functioning while performing the second session of the Simon task. This hypothesis needs to be explored in future research.</p><p>Because previous findings testing cognitive functions [<xref rid="pone.0117151.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] showed that social priming effects last for only a few minutes, in contrast to our results, the duration of this influence must be further tested to lay the groundwork for social priming-based interventions.</p><p>In conclusion, our study supports the hypothesis that the implicit social concept of a positive cognitive condition in old age affects the inhibitory control process of the elderly and improves their cognitive abilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117151.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Experiment 1: Interference effect magnitudes for every participant in the senior group before and after each manipulation.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117151.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117151.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Experiment 1: Interference effect magnitudes for every participant in the young adults group before and after each manipulation.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117151.s002.TIF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117151.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Experiment 2: Interference effect magnitudes for every senior participant before and after each manipulation.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117151.s003.TIF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117151.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Experiment 2: Positive manipulation&#x02014;histogram of sequential effects for each showing Simon effect and interference effect for each participant after congruent and incongruent trials.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117151.s004.TIF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117151.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Experiment 2: Neutral manipulation&#x02014;histogram of sequential effects for each showing Simon effect and interference effect for each participant after congruent and incongruent trials.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117151.s005.TIF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117151.s006"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting information: detailed description of a manipulation check, examining the influence of our manipulation on mood and motivation.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117151.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0117151.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
