The attempts that have been made all include behavioural cues, as physiological measures cannot stand alone (Price et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Pritchett et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Bussieres et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lindegaard et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Graubner et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Challenges in pain assessment are numerous including problems with recognizing early or subtle signs of pain and possible suppression of pain behaviour due to potentially threatening stimuli (Taylor et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>Humans are endowed with an evolutionarily developed skill for recognizing emotions through facial expressions (Deyo et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Kadosh &#x00026; Johnson <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). These expressions change when experiencing pain, making them sensitive pain indicators. Even when adult persons are asked to conceal their pain, facial expressions will continue to leak that information (Prkachin &#x00026; Mercer <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Furthermore, facial expressions are considered to be the most consistent pain expression in children (Poole &#x00026; Craig <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>).</p><p>Charles Darwin predicted that nonhuman animals could exhibit similar facial expressions in response to emotional states as humans do (Darwin <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">1872</xref>), but only recently have facial expressions been proposed as a method for evaluating pain in animals (Flecknell <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). A Mouse Grimace Scale (Langford et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and later a rat and rabbit scale have been developed (Sotocinal et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Keating et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Facial expressions of pain in horses have previously been based on observations by experienced horse practitioners, rather than on systematic investigations (Fraser <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Sanford et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Taylor et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Love et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) used kinematic analysis to determine that certain facial expressions of horses changed during injections and these findings were very recently corroborated in a study describing the Horse Grimace Scale for horses undergoing castration (Dalla Costa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Facial expressions of pain may be a valuable addendum to existing pain evaluation tools. However, it is of great importance to differentiate changes in facial expressions due to pain from changes due to stress (Love <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), analgesics, anaesthetics (Seibert et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Ashley et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and other interfering factors, such as the influence of humans.</p><p>The objectives of the present study were to investigate the facial expressions in horses during induced acute pain and to describe these facial cues in detail. In order to be able to identify the facial expressions of pain, this study was planned to preclude stress and to avoid treatment with anaesthetics or analgesics. Pain was induced using two noxious stimuli, a tourniquet on the antebrachium and topical application of capsaicin. These methods are well described in human pain research but are to the authors&#x02019; knowledge novel methods for pain induction in horses. Our hypotheses were that horses display facial expressions of pain similar to other mammals and that these expressions are moderated in the presence of humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The experimental protocol was approved by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate.</p><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was conducted as a semi-randomized, controlled, crossover trial, which was randomized into two blocks on the parameter observer; in the &#x02018;no-observer&#x02019; trials, the observer was not visible or audible to the horses. The treatment sequence was the same for all horses (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). Each horse participated in six trials, two control trials with no noxious stimulus and four pain trials with two different noxious stimuli; each noxious stimuli with and without an observer present. All trials were performed with the horses standing in a narrow, rectangular area of the stable, restrained by a neck collar and with a grey screen on the right side. The three youngest horses displayed very exploratory behaviour due to the degree of freedom allowed by the neck collar and wore an ordinary halter in some trials. The time of treatment was constant for each individual horse, with three horses before midday and three horses after midday. Two horses, one from each block, received a noxious stimulus every day for four consecutive days; four horses had one resting day between trials.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Block randomization and treatment sequences for all horses</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trial</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Block 1 (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Block 2 (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control I (no noxious stimuli)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With observer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No observer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control II (no noxious stimuli)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No observer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With observer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tourniquet I (right thoracic limb)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With observer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No observer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Capsaicin I (right shoulder&#x000a0;/&#x000a0;left thigh)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No observer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With observer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tourniquet II (left thoracic limb)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No observer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With observer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Capsaicin II (left shoulder&#x000a0;/&#x000a0;right thigh)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With observer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No observer</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Six healthy horses of different breeds, five mares and one gelding, aged 3&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years were included in the study. The horses were housed in the research facility of the University of Copenhagen in 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;m stalls at a constant temperature of 13&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. They were fed a grain mixture twice daily as well as hay and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> and were turned out into a paddock for approximately 2&#x000a0;hours prior to the training and trial procedure each day. The horses were stabled at the research facility for at least 10&#x000a0;days prior to the study. During this period the horses were groomed and trained with positive reinforcement to accept standing in the trial area, wearing a neck collar. Horses were under constant observation during all trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Trials</title><p>Pain was induced using two noxious stimuli applied to the horses for 20&#x000a0;minutes. The time T0 started the moment the application was completed and finished at T20. Baseline values were measured before the initiation of the noxious event. The first noxious stimulus was an application of a tourniquet (a pneumatic blood pressure cuff) placed around the antebrachium as proximal as possible, applying pressure to the extensor and flexor muscles of the forelimb. The cuff was inflated to 240&#x000a0;mmHg while the limb was lifted. After fitting the cuff the horses were free to bear weight on the leg, which increased the pressure of the cuff. After 20&#x000a0;minutes the horses were examined and the cuff was deflated.</p><p>The second noxious stimulus was a topical application of capsaicin cr&#x000e8;me 10% (Capsaicin 62%, USP 31; Inga Pharmaceuticals, India, formulated by the university pharmacy, in Essex cr&#x000e8;me; Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme B.V., Holland). The capsaicin cr&#x000e9;me was applied on the lateral aspect of the hindlimb, above the hock in the area of the proximal part of <italic>m. extensor digitalis lateralis</italic> of the first two horses. For safety reasons, the four other horses had capsaicin applied on the lateral aspect of the shoulder, caudoventrally to the scapula at the junction of <italic>m. deltoideus</italic> and <italic>m. tricipitis brachii</italic>. A 10&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;cm area was clipped bilaterally 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days prior to the procedure to facilitate skin contact. The capsaicin cream was applied to the skin and covered with a plastic sheet and two layers of self-adhesive bandage (Animal Polster; Sn&#x000f6;gg AS, Norway) to secure occlusion and prevent the horses from getting in contact with the capsaicin. The equivalent contralateral area was covered with plastic and self-adhesive bandage to function as the control site. After 20&#x000a0;minutes, the horses were examined and the capsaicin cream was removed mechanically and cleansed with vegetable oil.</p><p>Control trials were performed with the horses standing undisturbed in the trial area. These trials lasted 30&#x000a0;minutes and T0 was the start of the video recording.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical examination</title><p>A clinical examination was performed prior to applying the noxious stimuli (baseline), before removing it (T20) and 60&#x000a0;minutes after removal (T80). The clinical examination included: heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (<italic>f</italic><sub>R</sub>), rectal and skin temperature (RT and ST, respectively) measurements. The skin temperature was measured with an infrared thermometer (Raytek Raynger MX4; Raytek, CA, USA) below the tourniquet and in the area of the capsaicin application. Skin sensitivity was evaluated with soft touch (cotton bud) and pin pricks, in the area of the treatment before and after the capsaicin challenge. Four horses had continuous electrocardiography recorded (Televet 100 ECG recorder; J&#x000f8;rgen Kruuse A/S, Denmark) and non-invasive mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) measured with a tail cuff (Mindray PM-9000 Vet monitor; Mindray, China) at baseline, T20 and T80.</p></sec><sec><title>Video recordings</title><p>Video recordings were performed with a camera (Canon Legria HF S21, Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan) placed on a tripod on the left side of the horses. The camera was placed at a distance of two meters, allowing primarily the head of the horses within the video frame. The neck collar allowed the horses a wide range of head motion, occasionally out of the video frame. The observer hid behind a wall during the &#x02018;no observer&#x02019; trials and stood approximately one meter from the horses, not facing them and behaving as neutrally as possible during the &#x02018;with observer&#x02019; trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Observations of pain behaviour</title><p>During all experimental sessions the horses were observed for pain behaviour using a modified version of the composite measure pain scale (Lindegaard et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Composite measure pain scale modified from Lindegaard et al.

What humans interpret as a worried expression in the horse appears to be a result of the characteristic angled appearance of the eye due to the tension of the <italic>m. levator anguli oculi medialis</italic>. This facial action has not previously been described in details but the painful horse has been described to have &#x02018;slightly puckered eyes&#x02019; (Fraser <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>) or to have a &#x02018;tension&#x02019; above the eye (Dalla Costa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Dalla Costa et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) also found orbital tightening in painful horses which is inconsistent with the widening of the eyes and the increased exposure of the sclera found in this study. This orbital tightening and the backwards ears of castrated horses however, resembles the appearance of the horses dozing off in the present study, suggesting that the Horse Grimace Scale describes a combination of pain and fatigue as a consequence of the surgical stress response. Fatigue may be an important factor when evaluating horses post-surgically and it may explain the differences in facial expressions between the castrated horses and the horses in this study.</p><p>The change in the quality of the glance characterized by a withdrawn appearance of the eye with a tense stare has previously been described for equine pain behaviour (Fraser <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Sanford et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Taylor et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Sutton et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Pain in horses has previously been reported to result in flared, dilated or strained nostrils (Fraser <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Sanford et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Dalla Costa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The medio-lateral dilation of the nostrils observed in this study has previously been reported as a result of kinematic analysis of facial movements during injections in horses (Love et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Looking at the horses during pain inductions, on first impression, the nostrils were perceived just as dilated or strained. A thorough inspection revealed that the movements of the nostrils during inspiration originated from the middle of the medial and lateral wings. This resulted in a dilation of the nostrils in a square-like form which can be differentiated from the more rounded dilation seen during respiration in pain free horses. The movement of the medial wing of the nostril was characteristic and could be recognized during acute pain, even when the respiration rate was normal. The tightened lips have previously been linked to fear and pain response in horses (Casey <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Dalla Costa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The increased tension of the <italic>m. zygomaticus</italic> and the <italic>m. caninus</italic> seen in this study may be the same tension that is reported as &#x02018;strained chewing muscles&#x02019; for castrated horses (Dalla Costa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The horses in this study displayed increased interaction with the observer during pain stimulation. This is in contrast to previous research, reporting a reluctance to interact with humans when in pain (Price et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Pritchett et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Bussieres et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lindegaard et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Graubner et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Sutton et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This discrepancy in behavioural response may be explained by the intensity of the noxious stimuli and the habituation prior to the study. The observer was a familiar person associated with positive reinforcement training, which has been shown to increase contact seeking behaviour (Sankey et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Though the reluctance to be handled when in pain is obviously a very important observation, the contact-seeking behaviour may be interesting in relation to the early detection of pain by horse owners. Horses with acute or low grade pain may increase their contact-seeking behaviour when they percieve themselves to be in a safe environment.</p><p>The noxious stimuli used for the present study were chosen because they reliably induce pain in humans. Ischemic pain induction with a tourniquet is used as a model for deep tissue pain in man (Smith et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; Tuveson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The routine use of a tourniquet in horses is presumably painful as it causes a pronounced rise in blood pressure (Abrahamsen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Copland et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). A tourniquet pressure of 240&#x000a0;mmHg was chosen in this study because the blood pressure of the standing horse is similar to the blood pressure of humans, and for the submaximal effort tourniquet test in humans, a pressure of 200&#x02013;300&#x000a0;mmHg has been applied (Smith et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; Pertovaara et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). The tourniquet is suggested to induce both pressure pain and ischemic pain due to accumulation of metabolites caused by the compromised circulation distal to the cuff (Pertovaara et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). As expected the tourniquet induced moderate pain in all horses although two horses with a very low start temperature of the induced leg (18.3 and 16.4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) were less affected. Some indications of reperfusion pain such as very low head positioning were noticed.</p><p>Capsaicin is the pungent constituent of chilli peppers. Applied to the skin, it causes neurogenic inflammation and a local, burning pain sensation (Farina et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) by activation of the nociceptive C-fibres (Baumann et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Topically applied capsaicin is used as a pain model in humans (Baron et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) to mimic clinical pain (Le Bars et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and a topical application of low concentration capsaicin cream has been reported to cause a pain reaction in horses (Seino et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). A 10% capsaicin cream evokes pain levels up to 10 on a VAS scale in humans (Robbins et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Capsaicin 8% patches used for analgesia in humans with neuropathic pain evoke an increasing, burning pain sensation throughout the 60&#x000a0;minutes that the treatment lasts (Knolle et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The apparently shorter lasting pain expression in the horses in this study may be explained by the use of a capsaicin cream and not the specially formulated matrix for continuous release. In the present study, the capsaicin effectively induced moderate acute pain and the horses recovered fully within hours. No hypersensitivity to light touch and pin pricks was noted. Both types of noxious stimuli applied were easy to administer and could be used for repeated inductions, which was important as the horses acted as their own controls in this study.</p><p>The findings of this study indicate that facial expressions of pain in horses can be considered a suitable tool for recognizing and evaluating pain in horses. If these facial expressions of acute pain in horses are as comprehensible as those reported for mice (Leach et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), they may be a potential addendum for a behaviour based pain evaluation scale to improve recognition of pain and horse welfare. It is uncertain whether the facial expressions of pain demonstrated in this study are sensitive for grading pain in a more quantitative manner, and further investigation into sensitivity and intra- and inter-observer reliability is warranted.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that horses exhibit facial expressions of pain during periods of induced acute pain. The equine pain face involves: &#x02018;low&#x02019; and/or &#x02018;asymmetrical&#x02019; ears, an angled appearance of the eyes, a withdrawn and/or tense stare, mediolaterally dilated nostrils and tension of the lips, chin and certain mimetic muscles and can potentially be incorporated to improve existing pain evaluation tools.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by grants from
