This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study was registered at the Korea Clinical Research Information Service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cris.nih.go.kr/">http://cris.nih.go.kr</ext-link>; permit number, KCT 0002215). Inclusion criteria were age &#x0003e;19 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to II, and patients scheduled for elective nasal surgery under general anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were known adverse response to nefopam, history of convulsive disorders, tachyarrhythmia, coronary artery disease, glaucoma, dysuria, prostatitis, and cognitive dysfunction.</p><p>Patients were allocated randomly (allocation ratio 1:1), using sealed envelopes indicating the allocation, to receive 20&#x0200a;mg/2&#x0200a;mL of nefopam (Acupan; Pharmbio Korea, Seoul, Korea) mixed with 98&#x0200a;mL of normal saline (nefopam group) or 100&#x0200a;mL of normal saline alone (control group).</p><p>All patients arrived at the operating room without premedication. Routine monitoring, including pulse oximetry, noninvasive automated blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiography, and bispectral index (BIS), was started.</p><p>Before induction of anesthesia, the study drugs (nefopam 20&#x0200a;mg/2&#x0200a;mL in 98&#x0200a;mL of normal saline for the nefopam group or 100&#x0200a;mL of normal saline for the control group) were prepared by an anesthetic nurse who was blinded to the group allocation.</p><p>Anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol (2&#x0200a;mg/kg) and end-tidal concentration of 5% to 7% desflurane. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by rocuronium bromide (0.6&#x0200a;mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide:oxygen (1:1) and desflurane. Controlled mechanical ventilation and end-tidal concentration of desflurane were adjusted to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration of 30 to 35&#x0200a;mm Hg and BIS 40 to 60 during surgery, respectively. Immediately after induction of anesthesia, the study drugs were infused intravenously and administered for 20&#x0200a;minutes. Study drug infusion and anesthesia management during surgery were conducted by an anesthesiologist who was blinded to both the patient's group allocation and prepared study drugs. Various types of nasal surgery were performed after induction of anesthesia, ending with intranasal packing using Guardcel (Genewel Co., Seongnam, Korea). After completion of nasal packing, desflurane and nitrous oxide were turned off, and manual ventilation was performed with 100% oxygen at 6&#x0200a;L/min. Reversal of neuromuscular block was performed with pyridostigmine (0.2&#x0200a;mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.01&#x0200a;mg/kg). Extubation was performed after confirming the response to verbal stimulation, spontaneous respiration (tidal volume &#x0003e;5&#x0200a;mg/kg, respiratory rate &#x0003e;12/min), and BIS &#x0003e;75. The durations of anesthesia and surgery, and time to extubation (time from turning off desflurane to extubation) were recorded.</p><p>Emergence was defined as the time interval from turning off desflurane to 3&#x0200a;minutes after extubation. EA was evaluated using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS: +4, combative; +3, very agitated; +2, agitated; +1, restless; 0, alert and calm; &#x02212;1, drowsy; &#x02212;2, light sedation; &#x02212;3, moderate sedation; &#x02212;4, deep sedation; &#x02212;5, unarousable),<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> and each patient's highest score during emergence was recorded. EA was defined as any RASS score &#x02265;+2, with severe EA defined as RASS &#x02265;+3. Cough during emergence was assessed on a 4-point scale (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no cough; 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;single cough; 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;more than 1 episode of unsustained [&#x02264;5&#x0200a;seconds] coughing, grade 3; sustained [&#x0003e;5&#x0200a;seconds] bouts of coughing).<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>After arrival at the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), residual sedation (RASS &#x02264;&#x02212;2) and postoperative pain using numerical rating scale (NRS) scores (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no pain; 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;worst pain imaginable) were assessed continuously.

Through this study, we identified the efficacy of nefopam in preventing EA.</p><p>Despite its high incidence rate after general anesthesia, the precise etiopathogenic mechanism of EA has yet to be elucidated. A possible explanation is that NMDA postsynaptic potential-induced excitatory hyperactivity at the thalamolateral nucleus of the amygdala synapse enhances the uncomfortable stimuli-induced behavior.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup></p><p>The presence of an endotracheal tube, male sex, inhalation anesthetics, age (&#x0003c;40 and &#x0003e;64 years), postoperative pain (NRS &#x02265;5), benzodiazepine premedication, administration of doxapram, recent smoking, history of social drinking, type (oral cavity and ENT surgery) and duration of surgery, chronic lung disease, voiding urgency, and the presence of a urinary catheter and/or gastric tube are known to be etiological risk factors of EA in adults,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> although there is controversy regarding study design (prospective or retrospective), type of surgery, and assessment parameter of EA (eg, RASS, Riker sedation-agitation score, Aono scale). In previous studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> the presence of an endotracheal tube was shown to be 1 of the most important risk factors for EA. In addition, the incidence of EA was higher when assessed in the operating room during extubation than in the PACU after extubation.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Most previous studies regarding EA in pediatric<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> and adult patients<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> involved evaluation at the PACU. However, this study showed that administration of nefopam prevents EA during endotracheal tube extubation in the operation room where the risk of EA is relatively high. Although EA can lead to serious problems, it resolves spontaneously as the patient recovers consciousness. Thus, prevention of EA is more important than medication therapy after its occurrence.</p><p>The pathophysiological mechanism underlying the reduction in incidence of EA by nefopam is uncertain, but may be explained as follows. Nefopam has a potent analgesic effect by inhibiting serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake, and by modulating glutaminergic transmission via inhibition of postsynaptic NMDA receptors.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Consistent with our results, the administration of NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine and magnesium sulfate, showed a reduction in incidence of EA compared with placebo controls.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> However, despite the direct activation of NMDA receptors by remifentanil,<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> infusion of remifentanil resulted in smooth awakening from anesthesia and was also effective in decreasing the incidence of EA.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> These findings suggest that potent analgesic activity may be more important in preventing EA than NMDA receptor inhibition. Previous studies support this suggestion. Adequate postoperative pain control using potent analgesics, such as fentanyl or remifentanil, showed efficacy in reducing EA,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> but weak analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ketorolac) alone did not reduce EA after anesthesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Notwithstanding the EA-preventive effect of nefopam infusion during emergence, pain score and analgesic requirements in the PACU were similar between the 2 groups in the present study. This may have been due to the low pain score in the control group (median value of NRS 2) and the target sample size calculation, which was performed to detect a difference in the incidence of EA, but not pain score in the PACU. Similar to our results, in a previous study,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> dexmedetomidine infusion decreased the incidence of EA compared with the placebo group after nasal surgery, but showed no difference in pain NRS or need for analgesics in the PACU.</p><p>Apart from its analgesic effect, nefopam has anticonvulsant properties, although convulsions and seizures can occur when administered at an excessive dose.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> The anticonvulsant properties of nefopam may contribute to the reduction of EA. Abdulatif et al<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> postulated that the anticonvulsant potential of magnesium sulfate could prevent EA by impacting the inhalation anesthetic-induced seizure activity. Furthermore, antidepressant and antishivering effects of nefopam may contribute to reducing EA, but the specific roles of these effects in reduction of EA are still not clear. Further studies are required to elucidate the pathophysiology of nefopam on EA.</p><p>The timing and methods of administration (bolus or continuous infusion), and also dosage, are important to gain the maximum expected effect while reducing drug-related side effects. In a previous study performed in a pediatric population, a bolus injection of propofol at induction of anesthesia was not protective, whereas continuous infusion with a bolus injection of propofol at the end of surgery was effective at preventing EA.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Moreover, a bolus of 0.03&#x0200a;mg/kg midazolam before the end of surgery had similar efficacy in preventing EA while reducing the emergence time compared with a dose of 0.05&#x0200a;mg/kg.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Intravenous nefopam at a dose of 20&#x0200a;mg has an analgesic efficacy equipotent to 6 to 12&#x0200a;mg of morphine.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> The onset of action, peak effect, and duration of action of nefopam are 15 to 30&#x0200a;minutes, 30 to 60&#x0200a;minutes, and 4 to 6&#x0200a;hours, respectively.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Bolus intravenous injection or rapid infusion and use during the postoperative period have been shown to increase the rate of adverse events.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> In this study, a dose of 20&#x0200a;mg slowly infused over 20&#x0200a;minutes immediately after induction of anesthesia was used, taking into consideration the pharmacological properties of nefopam and anticipated duration of surgery.</p><p>Patients receiving nefopam may manifest anticholinergic or sympathomimetic effects, such as tachycardia, sweating, hypertension, dilated pupils, voiding difficulty, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, confusion, and seizure, as adverse drug reactions.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Among these, signs of overdose present as neuropsychiatric symptoms and cardiac conduction abnormalities, including tachycardia.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> In the present study, although HR was higher in the nefopam group than in the control group during emergence, we do not believe that it was induced by nefopam overdose or rapid infusion, because there were no cases of tachycardia in the PACU in the nefopam group. Instead, we propose that this was a transient phenomenon caused by the elevated sympathomimetic potential of nefopam due to rapid awakening from anesthesia. If increased HR resulted from overdose, tachycardia should have occurred in the PACU when considering the duration of anesthesia and duration of action of nefopam. In addition, despite the slow infusion of 20&#x0200a;mg of nefopam for 30&#x0200a;minutes in the intensive care unit (ICU), HR was increased by &#x0003e;15% compared with the baseline in 29% of patients in a previous study.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> On the contrary, before induction of anesthesia, 40&#x0200a;mg of nefopam infusion for 20&#x0200a;minutes did not lead to tachycardia within 24&#x0200a;hours postoperatively.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> However, caution is required regarding administration of nefopam in patients with limited coronary reserve, such as coronary artery disease, because of its potential to increase HR. If a patient is not contraindicated for nefopam, slowly infusing 20&#x0200a;mg nefopam for more than 20&#x0200a;minutes after induction of anesthesia may be appropriate for preventing EA and reducing nefopam-related side effects in a patient who is at risk for EA.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, differences in the sex ratio, age, type of surgery, and duration of surgery between the groups may have influenced the outcome of this study,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> despite the lack of statistically significant differences in these factors between the groups. In addition, we did not assess potential factors contributing to the incidence of EA,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> such as preoperative anxiety, history of smoking or drinking alcohol, or presence of chronic lung disease before patient allocation. However, these factors should have had little influence on our results because patients were allocated at random, and so their influence would be equivalent in both groups. Second, although the validity and interobserver reliability of RASS for assessing agitation-sedation in adult ICU patients have been confirmed,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> its validity is uncertain for assessing EA in the operating room during awakening from general anesthesia. There is still no gold standard for EA assessment in adult patients during emergence. However, unlike previous studies that assessed EA in the PACU, our study excluded the effects of rescue analgesics or antiemetics on EA because we evaluated the incidence and severity of agitation during emergence in the operation room.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, infusion of 20&#x0200a;mg of nefopam over 20&#x0200a;minutes immediately after induction of anesthesia is effective at reducing the incidence and severity of EA in patients undergoing nasal surgery without a delay in time for extubation. However, caution is required regarding the potential risk of tachycardia, especially in vulnerable patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BIS = bispectral index, EA = emergence agitation, ENT = ear, nose, and throat, HR = heart rate, ICU = intensive care unit, MBP = mean blood pressure, NMDA = <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-aspartate, NRS = numerical rating scale, PACU = postanesthesia care unit, RASS = Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="presented-at"><p>Presentation: This report was presented, in part, at the 94th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, November 2 to 4, 2017, The-K Hotel, Seoul, Korea.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was registered at the Clinical Research Information Service, Republic of Korea (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cris.nih.go.kr/">http://cris.nih.go.kr</ext-link>; permit number, KCT 0002215).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Chai</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
