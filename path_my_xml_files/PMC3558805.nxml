The World Health Organization (WHO) have declared malaria control a global development priority and estimate that in 2009 there were 225 million cases of malaria worldwide, 93% caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the same year there were 781 000 deaths caused by malaria and 89% of the mortality was in Africa, with children less than 5 years of age attributing 85% of deaths worldwide [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These statistics are similar to those reported for the year 2006 [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, 70 to 80 million cases of relapsing <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria occur per year adding to the morbidity even if not to the mortality [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>While global efforts have led to significant progress in the prevention, diagnosis and management of malaria, a number of potential threats to progress still exist, including resistance to insecticides and antimalarial medicines and a lack of alternative treatments [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>To combat increasing levels of resistance, the WHO currently recommends artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) as the first line therapy in areas with high prevalence of resistance, whereas chloroquine (CQ) and primaquine (PQ) are the treatments of choice against CQ sensitive <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The antimalarial peroxide artemisinin and its derivatives are the most potent and rapidly acting antimalarial agents available to date [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] with high parasite kill rates and broad-stage activity producing more rapid clinical and parasitological response than other classes of antimalarial agents. However, due to their short half-life, artemisinins have been associated with high recrudescence rates when used as monotherapy with 3&#x02013;5 days of treatment [<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Combination of artemisinin derivatives with other longer acting agents has allowed for shorter courses of ACT therapy, improved treatment outcomes and enhanced patient compliance.</p><p>Like artemisinin and its derivatives, ozonides have been proposed to react with Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the parasite to produce free radicals leading to alkylation of key parasitic proteins [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The first synthetic ozonide, arterolane (RBx11160/OZ277), was identified in a collaborative drug discovery project [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and found to be safe and well tolerated in humans [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Arterolane has been launched in combination with piperaquine phosphate in India by Ranbaxy Laboratories for the treatment of <italic>P. falaciparum</italic> malaria as a 3 day treatment. However there remains some concern surrounding low exposure of the drug in patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because of this finding, a programme to identify and develop new ozonides without this potential liability was initiated. OZ439 (mesylate salt) is a new, orally active, synthetic ozonide that has been shown in both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<italic>P. falciparum</italic>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (rodent; <italic>P. berghei</italic>) models to have potential value as a peroxide anti-malarial agent [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In preclinical animal models, OZ439 exhibited a prolonged exposure profile resulting in improved efficacy relative to arterolane, artesunate and other comparator antimalarials in murine malaria models (11).</p><p>The primary objective of the current study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple escalating oral doses of OZ439 in healthy male and female volunteers. The secondary objectives were to characterize the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic properties of OZ439 and its metabolites and to investigate the effect of food on the PK profile following a single oral dose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A phase I, single centre, multipart, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy male and female subjects was conducted. The study was conducted at Comprehensive Phase One Miramar (3400 Enterprise Way, Miramar, FL 33025, USA) and sponsored by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), Switzerland. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by an independent ethics committee (Independent IRB, Inc., 6738 West Sunrise Blvd, Suite 102, Plantation, Florida 33313, USA) and carried out under a US Investigational New Drug application (IND). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to the start of any protocol-specific procedures and after full explanation.</p><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy, non-smoking, male or female (non-pregnant or lactating) subjects, as determined by pre-study medical history, physical examination (including body temperature) and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), who were between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive, with body mass index between 18 and 30 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, inclusive, and body weight &#x0003e;60 kg were eligible for enrolment. Subjects were not allowed to consume alcohol within the 72 h period preceding any dosing period and were to refrain from caffeine, xanthine and grapefruit-containing products for 7 days prior to screening and during admission and follow-up.</p><p>The human dose equivalent to the lowest no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in dogs (20 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was calculated to be 10.8 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Introducing a safety factor of 10-fold, the maximum recommended starting dose was therefore 1.08 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, equating to 64.8 mg for a 60 kg human or 75.6 mg in a 70 kg human. Conducting these same calculations based on the NOAEL in the rat (30 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) led to a maximum recommended starting dose of 0.48 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or 29 mg for a 60 kg human (34 mg for a 70 kg human). Based on these considerations, the proposed starting dose was 50 mg. Using the same 10-fold safety factor and the predicted human pharmacokinetic parameters, a similar starting dose was obtained by calculating the anticipated human dose that would give an exposure level (i.e. AUC) comparable with that at the NOAEL in animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><sec><title>Part A &#x02013; Single rising dose (SRD) escalation</title><p>Single oral doses of OZ439 (50&#x02013;1600 mg OZ439 mesylate) were investigated in a partial crossover, ascending dose study comprising three cohorts (planned eight subjects each). Subjects in cohorts 1 and 2 were enrolled in an alternating panel design. Each subject was randomized to a treatment sequence in which she/he received doses of OZ439 (administered as capsule(s) or as an oral dispersion) on four occasions and placebo on one occasion over a period of at least 9&#x02013;11 weeks. Progress from one cohort to the next occurred once safety and PK data of the previous cohort were reviewed. A third cohort was added to investigate further the administration of OZ439 as an oral dispersion. All doses were administered at least 1 week apart. Doses were administered after an overnight fast of at least 8 h and standardized meals were commenced from 3 h post-dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Part B &#x02013; Food effect (FE)</title><p>The effect of food was investigated in an additional group of 12 healthy subjects in a two cohort, single dose, open label, two period crossover design, separated by a washout period of at least 7 days. Six subjects were randomized to each sequence group (fasted/fed or fed/fasted). Subjects received a single dose of 800 mg OZ439 as an oral dispersion under either fed or fasted conditions. Both groups were fasted for at least 8 h overnight on the day prior to dosing. In the fed group, dosing occurred 30 min after the start of consumption of a standard high fat meal [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Subjects were fasted for at least 8 h prior to dosing in the morning, and standardized meals were commenced from 3 h post-dosing, on each dosing day.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Formulations</title><p>Two oral formulations of OZ439 were used in the trial; one was a capsule in which OZ439 mesylate powder was filled into gelatine capsules with no additional excipients and the other was an oral dispersion formulation. Capsules were administered with 240 ml water, and the oral dispersion was prepared just prior to dosing by dispersing OZ439 powder in a bottle in either 30 (50&#x02013;400 mg dose), 60 (800 mg dose), or 120 (1600 mg dose) ml of vehicle comprised of polysorbate 80 (0.8% v/v), sucralose (0.5% w/v), ethyl vanillin (0.05% w/v) and water.

Blood samples (5 ml) were collected into tubes containing potassium EDTA as anticoagulant and kept chilled on crushed ice. Plasma was separated within 30 min of sample collection by centrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C. Plasma samples were immediately transferred to polypropylene tubes and stored frozen at &#x02212;25&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>Urine was collected in the SRD study and pooled during the intervals 0&#x02013;12 h, 12&#x02013;24 h, 24&#x02013;36 h and 36&#x02013;48 h post-dosing. Immediately after collection of each void (total urine volume recorded), a 5 ml urine aliquot from the pooled sample was transferred into a polypropylene tube and 2.5 ml of 100% ethanol (2 : 1, v/v) was added to ensure full, quantitative recovery of OZ439. Samples were stored frozen at or below &#x02212;25&#x000b0;C prior to assay for OZ439 and its metabolites.</p><p>During the MRD study, bioactivity measurements were conducted in a subset of subjects using serum samples collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after administration of a single oral dose (three subjects receiving 200 mg, two subjects receiving 800 mg) of OZ439. Blood samples (2.5 ml) were collected into serum separation tubes (Greiner Vacuette Chemistry Serum Gel Evacuated Tubes no. 454243). The blood was allowed to clot for 30 min on crushed ice (to prevent degradation of the compound) after which the tubes were centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C and 1500&#x02013;2000 &#x000d7; g for 15 min.

The mobile phase consisted of water containing 0.1% formic acid (phase A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (phase B). For chromatographic separation, a Hydrosphere C18, 2.1 &#x000d7; 33 mm, 3 &#x003bc;m column (YMC Co.

The composition was held for 0.9 min before reconditioning at the initial conditions. The heated electrospray ion source was used in positive ion mode and data were acquired in the selected ion monitoring mode (SRM) using the following parent and product ions: the SRM transitions were m/z 470.3 to m/z 304.1 for OZ439, m/z 444.3 to m/z 278.1 for OZ564, m/z 486.3 to m/z 320.1 for OZ577, m/z 484.3 to m/z 318.1 for OZ543 (internal standard), m/z 486.3 to m/z 304.1 for OZ567 and OZ579 and m/z 502.3 to m/z 304.1 for OZ580, AA2 and AA3.</p><p>The precision, expressed as the coefficient of variation, of the assay was shown to be 5.9&#x02013;9.3% for plasma OZ439, and ranged between 5.9% and 11.8% for the metabolites.

In the SRD and MRD parts of the study, continuous lead II ECG monitoring was performed for a minimum of 4 h after dosing and QT<sub>c</sub> interval was determined from read out of the ECG machine. The ECG readings were reviewed by the Investigator and any significant abnormality referred for review by a single independent cardiologist. Audiometry assessment (vestibular, middle ear and cochlear function, otoscopy and pure tone audiometry) and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were performed during the screening period and at 10 (&#x000b1;2) days after the last dose of study medication. Safety and tolerability results were analyzed descriptively only.

For the SRD (day 1 for each period), FE and MRD (day 1 only) studies, AUC(0,<italic>t</italic>) and AUC(0,&#x0221e;) were calculated, where AUC(0,<italic>t</italic>) is the area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve to the last measurable time point and AUC(0,&#x0221e;) is the area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve extrapolated to infinity. For the MRD study, the AUC within the dosing interval (AUC(0,24 h)) on day 1 and day 3 was calculated. The total amount of OZ439 and its metabolites excreted in urine from time zero to 48 h after dosing (Ae(0,48 h)) was calculated. The primary PK variables for assessing dose proportionality following single dose administration were AUC(0,<italic>t</italic>) (capsule formulation), AUC(0,&#x0221e;) (oral dispersion) and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, and after multiple dosing were AUC(0,24 h) and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> on day 3. A non-linear power model was used to assess dose proportionality. The proportional relationship between each parameter and dose was written as a power function: variable = a &#x000d7; dose<sup>b</sup> where a is a constant and b is the proportionality constant of the variable of interest. Dose proportionality was also explored graphically by plotting dose-normalized AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> against dose.</p><p>The primary PK variables for assessing the effect of food (part B) were AUC(0,&#x0221e;) and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>. An equivalence approach was used to investigate whether a statistically relevant difference existed in the PK of OZ439 when administered under fasted or fed conditions. The PK variables AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> were log(e) transformed prior to fitting a model. Fixed effect terms for sequence, state (fed/fasted) and treatment period and a random effect for subject were fitted in the model. Least squares geometric means were calculated with the ratio of least squares geometric means (fed/fasted) for AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and 90% confidence limits (CL) for the ratio. In the MRD study, the time to attain steady-state plasma concentrations was assessed visually from plots of mean pre-dose concentrations against sampling day. On multiple dosing, an effect of gender was explored graphically by plotting individual dose-normalized values for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC(0,24h).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><sec><title>Single rising dose</title><p>A total of 26 subjects were enrolled in the SRD study, 10 in cohort 1, eight in cohort 2 and eight in cohort 3.

Although no evidence of autoinduction was seen in this study, the dosing duration was relatively short for the impact to be fully assessed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><sec><title>Single rising dose</title><p>The overall incidence of AEs was highest in the 1600 mg OZ439 oral dispersion group (5/6 subjects) and ranged from 0&#x02013;2 subjects out of 6&#x02013;8 in the other groups. In the 1600 mg oral dispersion group, the only AEs experienced by more than two subjects were diarrhoea (3/6 subjects), nausea (3/6 subjects) and gastrointestinal hypermotility (2/6 subjects). All were rated as related to study drug. In all other dose groups, no specific AE was experienced by more than one subject. The only other AEs considered to be related to study drug were abdominal discomfort (1/6 subjects; 1600 mg oral dispersion), dyspepsia (1/17 subjects; placebo), headache (1/8 subjects; 200 mg capsule and 1/6 subjects; 1200 mg capsule) and vasovagal syncope (1/8 subjects; 800 mg capsule).</p><p>All AEs were mild or moderate in severity except for one event of first degree atrioventricular block (pre-dose placebo; unrelated) and one of vasovagal syncope in one subject which was considered severe and led to premature discontinuation. One further subject had clinically significant ECG changes, experiencing two episodes of sinus tachycardia (1 h 40 min and 2 h 40 min, respectively) after receiving 800 mg OZ439 capsule and an episode of sinus arrest 3 h 9 min after dosing. Two further subjects were discontinued, one due to an SAE of influenza after dosing with placebo (considered unrelated to study drug) and one following a positive drug screen prior to the fourth period. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in mean clinical laboratory parameters, ECG findings, physical examinations, vital signs or audiometry/BAEP findings. Clinically significant increases in creatine kinase were recorded in a single subject (highest value 1950 U l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) following OZ439 200 mg capsule and OZ439 800 mg capsule doses which were recorded as mild/moderate AEs. This subject had undertaken recreational physical exercise prior to admission to the corresponding dosing period. The adverse events resolved with hydration and rest and were classified as not related to study drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of food</title><p>OZ439 was generally well-tolerated in both the fed and fasted regimens. All AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Three of 12 subjects experienced a total of nine AEs in the fed regimen and 4/12 subjects experienced a total of three AEs in the fasted regimen. The only AE reported by more than one subject in either regimen was headache (2/12 subjects in the fed regimen, 1/12 subjects in the fasted regimen, all possibly treatment related). Nausea and oropharyngeal pain (1/12 subjects each) in the fasted regimen were also possibly treatment related. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful changes in the other safety parameters measured, nor clinically significant differences between the fed and fasted regimens. One subject out of 12 had clinically significant increases in creatine kinase results during follow-up on days 18 and 19 which were recorded as an AE of moderate severity not related to study drug and resolved by day 26.</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple rising dose</title><p>Three of six subjects in the 200 mg group, 1/6 subjects in the 400 mg group and 4/6 subjects in the 800 mg group experienced AEs during the study. The only AEs reported by more than one subject in any group were headache (2/6 subjects in the 200 mg group) and flushing (2/6 in the 800 mg group). All AEs were considered to be mild or moderate in severity. Flushing and throat irritation were the only AEs considered to be related to study drug which occurred in more than one subject (2/6 for each AE in the 800 mg group). Treatment-related AEs experienced by only one subject included one event each of nausea and dizziness in the 200 mg group and one event of nausea in the 800 mg group. No clinically meaningful findings, nor differences between treatment groups, were observed for clinical laboratory parameters, ECG findings, physical examinations vital signs or audiometry/BAEP findings, and there was no significant effect on QT<sub>c</sub> interval.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This first-in-man study was designed to explore the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the synthetic ozonide OZ439 after oral administration to healthy subjects.</p><p>The SRD and MRD parts of the study employed an alternating panel and sequential group design, respectively. These designs permitted the safety of a lower dose of OZ439 to be evaluated before proceeding to a higher dose. Pharmacokinetic data were also reviewed before proceeding to a higher dose. In the SRD part, six single dose levels were investigated which allowed an estimation of dose proportionality. The starting dose was 50 mg and the maximum single dose to be administered was not to exceed 1600 mg. Doses were reviewed for safety and pharmacokinetics before proceeding to the next higher dose level. Predefined dose escalation criteria were provided in the protocol.</p><p>Based on preclinical data, this clinical study of OZ439 focused on the routine monitoring of subjects for clinical signs, haematology (red blood cell count, haematocrit, haemoglobin, reticulocyte count, differential leucocyte count, RBC indices and coagulation parameters) and indicators of haemolysis, liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT), kidney function tests (BUN and creatinine), ECG (including QT<sub>c</sub>), electrolyte estimation (sodium, chloride and phosphorus) and urinalysis. Continuous ECG monitoring was conducted at all doses in the SRD study and in at least the two higher doses in the MRD study.</p><p>After both single and multiple dose administration, the plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles of OZ439 showed that maximum plasma concentrations were reached approximately 3 h after administration and thereafter, OZ439 concentrations decreased in a multiphasic way. Ninety-six hours after a single administration, the mean OZ439 concentration was above 10 ng ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a dose of 800 mg of the oral dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>C) (note that preclinical studies indicated that plasma concentrations need to remain above 10&#x02013;20 ng ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for approximately two parasite cycles to be efficacious). The terminal <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of OZ439 of approximately 30 h is 15-fold greater than that reported previously for the peroxide antimalarial dihydroartemisinin (DHA, <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003c; 1&#x02013;2 h) following oral administration of either artesunate [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or DHA [<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to healthy volunteers. Exposure to OZ439 (based on both <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC) increased with increasing dose, being approximately dose proportional or deviating only slightly from dose proportionality after both single and multiple dose administration of the oral dispersion formulation.</p><p>Following single dose oral administration of OZ439, plasma concentrations were higher and variability was lower following administration of an oral dispersion formulation compared with a capsule formulation containing no excipients. Furthermore, administration of the oral dispersion formulation in the presence of food led to a further increase in exposure, reduction in variability and a delay in <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> from 3 to 5 h, with no effect on the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of OZ439. Collectively, these results suggest that formulation excipients are necessary to aid in the dispersion and dissolution of OZ439 to ensure reproducible absorption and that administration in the presence of food further increases the solubilization of OZ439 within the gastrointestinal milieu. Studies are currently underway to develop an oral formulation which provides high and reproducible exposure with a reduced food effect.</p><p>Following multiple dose administration of the oral dispersion, the mean <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of OZ439 varied from 37.8 to 41.7 h after 3 days dosing. Steady-state conditions were not attained following 3 days of dosing, as evidenced by higher trough concentrations on day 4 compared with day 3. Ninety-six hours after dosing on day 3, OZ439 plasma concentrations were approximately 17 ng ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a dose of 400 mg, a concentration which exceeds the <italic>in vitro</italic> I<italic>C</italic><sub>50</sub> value against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> by approximately 10-fold [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The shapes of the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curves for the metabolites were generally similar to that of the parent compound, and all but three metabolites had relatively low exposure compared with OZ439. However, as the volumes of distribution of the metabolites is not known, relative plasma exposure may not be reflective of relative total body expposure. As the exposure (i.e. AUC) of OZ439 increased with increasing dose, with the oral dispersion (compared with the capsule) or in the presence food, there was a trend towards a reduction in the metabolite : parent AUC ratio possibly indicating a degree of saturable metabolism that occurs with increasing concentration of the parent compared.</p><p>For the principle metabolites (OZ580, OZ579 and AA3), there was minimal antimalarial activity with <italic>in vitro</italic> I<italic>C</italic><sub>50</sub> values against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> being more than 10-fold higher than that of OZ439 (data not shown). The antimalarial activity profiles of serum samples collected from five healthy subjects after intake of a single oral dose (200 or 800 mg oral dispersion) of OZ439 were very similar to the respective pharmacokinetic profiles of OZ439 determined by LC-MS/MS analysis, suggesting that the major antimalarial activity originates from parent OZ439 and not from any of its metabolites.</p><p>Following single dose administration, the renal excretion of OZ439 and most metabolites was negligible. The total amount of OZ580 (the highest concentration metabolite in urine) excreted in urine could not be calculated due to the collection interval of 48 h being too short. Only 0.12% of an administered dose of 1600 mg was recovered in urine as OZ580 during this collection interval, indicating that renal excretion is a minor pathway in the elimination of OZ439 and its metabolites.</p><p>The safety assessments used in this study were standard and generally recognized as reliable, accurate and relevant for a phase I study. The study included routine monitoring of subjects for clinical signs, haematology parameters and indicators of haemolysis, liver function tests, kidney function tests, ECG (including QT<sub>c</sub>), electrolyte estimation and urinalysis.</p><p>Although there was no preclinical evidence of central nervous system toxicity in the 14 day toxicology or central nervous system safety pharmacology studies conducted with OZ439, artemisinin anti-malarial drugs, which share the same peroxide pharmacophore as OZ439, have been shown to be associated with ototoxicity in some animal models. In addition, there has been a recent report of a retrospective study of adults with uncomplicated malaria treated with lumefantrine&#x02013;artemether developing a minor degree of change on audiometric testing compared with control subjects when in a noisy environment [<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Audiometry was therefore carried out before and after dosing in the single dose and repeat dose parts of the study and no clinically significant changes were seen.</p><p>In the SRD part of the study, single doses of OZ439 were safe and well tolerated from 50 mg up to 1200 mg given as a capsule and as an oral dispersion up to 1600 mg. Only one subject who received OZ439 was prematurely discontinued due to an AE (vasovagal syncope). This event was preceded by two episodes of sinus tachycardia and was most likely a vagally driven sinus arrest that was associated with a drop in blood pressure (coinciding with standing soon after a blood draw). The sinus arrest occurred 3 h 9 min after the subject received 800 mg OZ439 (the third administration of the sequence). The PK properties of OZ439 suggest that this event occurred at around the <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> and so an association with OZ439 cannot be ruled out, especially as the subject appeared to have no underlying cardiac condition. The duration of the sinus arrest would have been sufficient to cause the syncope. However, this event was an isolated incident and no other subjects who received this or higher doses exhibited anything similar. Follow-up of this subject by a cardiologist confirmed the possibility of underlying sick sinus syndrome which might provoke the reaction after taking the study medication. The final assessment from the cardiologist was that the event was an isolated vasovagal event with no underlying pathology.</p><p>In the food effect part of the study, a single dose of 800 mg OZ439 was safe and well tolerated given as an oral dispersion either in the fasted or fed state. In the multiple dose part of the study, OZ439 doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg were safe and well tolerated during once daily dosing for 3 days.</p><p>OZ439 did not induce the levels of CYP3A4, as evidenced by no significant changes in the 24 h urinary 6&#x003b2;-hydroxycortisol : cortisol ratio either by comparing the change in the ratio from baseline with that on day 1 and day 3 or by comparison on those days with the ratios in the placebo group. Therefore it is probable that OZ439 will not affect the exposure of any co-administered medications that are CYP3A4 substrates via induction of CYP3A4. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in human hepatic microsomes also indicated that OZ439 had a low potential to inhibit the major CYP450 isoforms.</p><p>In all three parts of the study, no clinically meaningful results were observed for clinical laboratory parameters, physical examinations, vital signs or ECG findings (with the exception of one subject who received OZ439 [vasovagal syncope] and one who received placebo [atrioventricular block] in the SRD study) and in particular, there appeared to be no effect on the QT<sub>c</sub> interval. No effect on audiometry/BAEP was observed.</p><p>In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of OZ439 in both single and multiple dose studies in healthy subjects provides confidence to progress this agent to patient studies in the target population of acute uncomplicated malaria. This study demonstrated that OZ439 was safe and well tolerated at dose levels that provided prolonged plasma exposure with concentrations exceeding the estimated minimum effective concentration for &#x0223c;96 h. Furthermore, the prolonged exposure profile of OZ439 considerably exceeds that of available peroxide antimalarials, thereby having the potential to result in an improved efficacy profile. The variability seen with the capsule formulation and the effect of food on the exposure profile are currently being addressed through reformulation and the authors are confident that the food effect seen in the phase 1 study can be overcome with appropriate formulation management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all volunteers and the staff at Comprehensive Phase One, Miramar, FL., USA.
