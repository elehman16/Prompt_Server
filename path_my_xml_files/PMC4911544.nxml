to hospital with a hip fracture every year.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Recovery from a hip fracture requires
substantial resources from health and social services, and has implications
on the quality of life and social support network for the individual.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These patients rarely
recover their pre-injury state.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Parathyroid hormone
(PTH) is licensed for the treatment of osteoporosis, however, a
number of animal studies suggest it can also accelerate fracture
healing.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Its effectiveness
in patients who have sustained hip fractures is currently unknown.
A short course of PTH has the potential to improve the rate of functional
recovery and consequently reduce the length of hospital stay and
period of dependence on health and social care services. Two published
human studies investigating PTH in fracture healing (osteoporotic wrist
fractures and pelvic fractures)<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> have shown encouraging
results, demonstrating an increased proportion of early unions in
the intervention groups. A number of methodological concerns exist,
however, including the use of daily injections in older acutely
injured patients. The potential impact of this treatment on patients
and their recovery is currently unclear.</p><p>The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility of daily
injections of PTH in a population of patients with trochanteric
hip fractures and to pilot the study design in terms of eligibility,
acceptability, more specifically the acceptability of the intervention
and outcome measures, consent and defining the standard care for
the comparator arm. This was to assess the potential to deliver
a randomised controlled trial with the hypothesis that intermittent
PTH injections could improve functional recovery after a trochanteric
hip fracture through the mechanism of accelerated fracture healing.</p><p>Our objectives were to establish: </p><p>- the potential recruitment, compliance with the intervention
and the protocol and to inform methodological planning for the full
study, including;</p><p>- to assess the acceptability and validity from the patients&#x02019;
perspective of the outcome measures intended for use in the full
study;</p><p>- to clarify and define &#x02018;standard&#x02019; drug therapy for osteoporotic
fractures received by the comparison group;</p><p>- to establish the feasibility and acceptability of injection therapy
over six weeks in this population. </p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The design was an open label, prospective feasibility and pilot
study with randomised treatment allocation, comparator controlled
with blinded outcome assessment and a nested qualitative sub-study
as previously published by the study group.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The study was approved by South West
2 Research Ethics Committee (10/H0206/34) and registered with EudraCT
(2010-020081-22) and ISRCTN (03362357). Funding was provided by
a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient
Benefit grant (PB-PG-0408-16292) and sponsored by North Bristol NHS
Trust (R&#x00026;I 2185). </p><p>Recruitment was undertaken from a continuous sample of patients
screened to meet the inclusion criteria from admissions to the trauma
and orthopaedic services at six National Health Service teaching
hospitals in the United Kingdom. Patients aged 60 years or older
admitted with a trochanteric hip fracture were included. Exclusion
criteria included contraindications to the study medication, lack
of capacity to give informed consent or the inability to comply with
the study protocol. Consenting participants were randomised between
the intervention group and standard care using an internet-based,
computer-generated random allocation provided by Sealed Envelope
(London, United Kingdom) on a 1:1 ratio in blocks of ten. Randomisation
was performed by the research associate at the recruiting site following
the consent of the participant.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The
intervention group was prescribed a daily subcutaneous injection
of PTH 1-34 (Teriparatide) for 42 days, commencing within ten days
of surgery. Other medications related to bone-health (except vitamin
D and calcium), including bisphosphonates and denosumab, were withheld
for the duration of the intervention in this group. Participants
were taught by the study team to self-administer the injections,
with assistance from relatives or carers if required. The standard care
group received treatment according to National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Adherence to this guidance was monitored
as part of the study.</p><p>Standardised data collection was undertaken at screening, on
recruitment to the study, on discharge from the acute hospital stay
and at six and 12 weeks, and six months after surgery. Hospital
systems were checked for occurrence of any further fractures within
12 months of surgery. Outcome measures including the Short Physical
Performance Battery (SPPB),<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> the Short Form
(SF)-36,<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> EuroQol
5-D (EQ-5D)<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> general
health questionnaires and visual analogue scales (VAS)<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> for pain on bearing
weight (0 to 10 scale where 10 was the worst pain imaginable and
0 was no pain) were completed with participants by an assessor blinded
to treatment allocation, at outpatient appointments at six and 12
weeks post-operatively. The general health questionnaires were repeated
in a telephone consultation with participants at six months. Pre-
and post-operative radiographs were used to classify the fracture
according to AO/OTA system,<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> ascertain
the type of operative intervention, measure the amount of collapse
as measured on the anteroposterior final post-operative radiograph,
assess union and identify any failure of fixation.</p><p>As this was a pilot study to determine the appropriateness of
the proposed methodology for a main study with adequate power, no
formal sample size calculations were performed and groups of 20
participants were deemed suitable.</p><p>On this basis, statistical comparison of outcomes in the intervention
and comparison group were not carried out. Instead, we report measures
assessing the feasibility and acceptability of the study (such as
eligibility, retention, compliance and data completeness).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 724 patients screened to meet the inclusion criteria, 143
(20%) were eligible for the study; of these, 123 were approached,
and 29 (20%) of those eligible consented to participate (4% of the
total patients screened) (Fig. 1). These numbers were significantly
lower than the 50% of the population originally predicted to be
eligible. Lack of capacity precluded 314 of the 581 (54%) of those
screened as eligible from giving informed consent. Recruitment took place

of eight patients (75%) under 75 years of age on entry to the study
were referred for a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan in line
with NICE guidance. One of the remaining two had undergone a recent
scan and the other died a month into the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>PTH has been shown to improve bone mineral density (BMD) and
reduce subsequent fractures in those with osteoporosis.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Despite evidence
of benefit from animal studies in the treatment of fractures<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> the dose, duration and cost effectiveness
of treatment remain in question.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Subcutaneous
injection remains the only licensed route of administration<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and although other
delivery systems are under investigation, they are not yet licensed.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> While it is increasingly
frequently prescribed, evidence from human studies is lacking.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Patients with trochanteric fractures were chosen, as hip fractures
represent the most costly fracture with large socio-economic costs.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Assessing union
and measuring an impact on the recovery of function in lower limb
fractures is very difficult<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and
so this study tested the option of a surrogate measure such as the
SPPB.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This requires patient
contact and can be influenced by other physical comorbidities, which
are common in this frail group of patients.</p><p>This study has highlighted important challenges that should be
considered when designing research studies in patients with hip
fractures. These challenges could be extrapolated to any frail,
elderly trauma patient population where the combination of age,
comorbidities and an acute injury requiring surgery present a unique
situation in which to conduct research. The greatest challenge of
delivering this study was that of identifying a sufficient number
of eligible patients and gaining informed consent in this elderly population,
with only 4% of those 724 patients who met the inclusion criteria
sustaining trochanteric fractures being both eligible and willing
to consent.</p><p>If a patient was recruited, the protocol has been shown to be
deliverable across multiple sites. Once enrolled and taught the
injection technique, the compliance and adherence to the injection
intervention was good. Data completion to six weeks was good but
dropped at the later time points.</p><p>As a non-blinded study it was important to define the care received
by the comparison group. Since the design of the study, the implementation
of a national tariff through the National Hip Fracture Database
has standardised the care of this patient group.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Surrogate markers
of the outcome of rehabilitation, such as discharge destination
and length of stay were successfully recorded. It was difficult, however,
to obtain measures of other aspects of rehabilitation such as the
intensity of therapy and social support required, due to lack of
access to and detail of recorded data.</p><p>Limitations of the study included its pilot nature, and the small
groups which precluded objective assessment of the value of PTH
in this injury. Recruitment was only open to those with no cognitive
impairment, no contraindications to PTH and the ability to comply
with the study protocol, which excluded 80% (581) of the patients
screened. Follow-up of these patients was difficult and seven (24%) failed
to complete the study. This makes the results difficult to generalise
to the whole population. </p><p>With these difficulties in mind, expansion into a large multicentre
trial should be undertaken with caution. Any definitive study recruiting
a representative cohort would need to include the population unable
to give informed consent. Sample size calculations using the data
from this study based on detecting a one-point change in the SPPB
at 12 weeks as the primary outcome, assuming an 80% completion rate,
would require 405 patients. Any design should, therefore, include
strategies to maximise retention and completion such as follow-up
in the community or by telephone.</p><p>If PTH is given to aid bone healing in trochanteric fractures,
it should still be considered experimental.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Melton LJ</surname>
