About half of the patients with these injuries receive medical treatment, and 40&#x000a0;% of injuries result in chronic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Of the patients who play sports, around 60&#x02013;90&#x000a0;% resumed sports after 12&#x000a0;weeks at the same level as before the trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Especially basketball, football, soccer and volleyball have a high incidence of ankle injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The lateral ankle ligament complex consists of the anterior talofibular, the calcaneal fibular and the posterior talofibular ligaments (respectively, ATFL, CFL and PTFL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the number of ligaments injured does not affect the prognosis and is therefore not considered relevant for the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most common mechanism of injury is supination and adduction (usually referred to as inversion) of the plantar-flexed foot. Ankle inversion injuries are usually classified according to a three-stage grading system: grade I is a mild stretching of the ligament without instability of the joint, grade II is a partial rupture of the ligament with mild instability of the joint and grade III involves complete rupture of the ligaments with instability of the joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Due to pain and swelling, classification of patients is often only possible after 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The three main modalities of treatment for inversion injuries are as follows: (1) surgical treatment, (2) conservative treatment by immobilization with a plaster cast or splint and (3) functional conservative treatment with tape, semi-rigid brace or lace-up brace.</p><p>A Cochrane systematic review (20 RCTs, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2562) of surgical versus conservative treatment for acute ankle ligament injuries was inconclusive (due to insufficient evidence) with regard to the superiority of surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is recommended to consider surgical treatment for (top professional) sports players on an individual basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>A second Cochrane systematic review (21 RCTs, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2184) showed that functional treatment is superior to immobilization as conservative treatment for patients with acute lateral ankle ligament injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>According to the Cochrane systematic review (9 RCTs, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;892) concerning different functional treatment options (tape, semi-rigid brace, lace-up brace) for acute ankle ligament injuries, &#x02018;there is no most effective treatment either clinically and in costs based on currently available randomised trials&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. High quality, sufficiently powered randomized trials are warranted to compare the effectiveness of different functional strategies for treatment of an acute ankle sprain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The objective of this study is to determine the foremost optimal functional treatment by comparing tape versus semi-rigid support versus lace-up brace treatment for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries with regard to clinical outcome. Our hypothesis was that (lace-up and semi-rigid) bracing was superior to taping in the treatment of acute lateral ankle ligament injuries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Of all patients with an ankle inversion injury presenting at the emergency department of our hospital, the injury mechanism and general history were acquired. The lower extremity was examined. The presence or absence of an ankle fracture was initially assessed according to the Ottawa ankle rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. If a fracture could not be excluded, radiographs (mortise and lateral) of the ankle were made. When the diagnosis &#x02018;acute ankle sprain&#x02019; was made, RICE therapy (Rest, Ice application, Compression with a pressure bandage and Elevation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] was started and patients were advised not to bear weight on the injured leg and to walk with crutches until the first visit. During this first visit, which was between 4 and 7&#x000a0;days after the initial trauma, a delayed physical examination was performed. The physical examination was performed as described by Van Dijk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The most important items to assess were pain on palpation, haematoma, and instability evaluated with the anterior drawer test. Patients qualifying for grade II or III ligament injury at this delayed physical examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] were eligible and asked to participate in the study.

The use of additional treatment (ultrasound, cryotherapy, laser, homeopathy and physiotherapy) was not allowed. Analgesics were allowed, and although nowadays there is evidence to support the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], these and morphine&#x02013;mimetic drugs were not allowed.

This score is widely used to assess ankle function after ligament injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The patients are asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding the function of the ankle joint. The score includes eight items based on a subjective evaluation of stability, pain, swelling and stiffness in relation to activities of everyday life, sports and recreational activities, running, stair climbing and working ability. The minimum is score is 0, and the maximum is 100.

The FAOS consists of five subscales: pain, other symptoms, function in daily living (ADL), function in sport and recreation (Sport Rec) and foot- and ankle-related quality of life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questionnaire. Standardized answer options are given (% Likert boxes), and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The result can be plotted as an outcome profile.

Functional treatment is favoured over immobilization treatment and is considered the optimal non-surgical treatment for acute lateral ankle ligament injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The purpose of this study is to determine whether tape, brace or lace-up brace treatment is the optimal functional non-surgical treatment for acute lateral ankle ligament injury. In all treatment groups, patients scored better functional results (Karlsson and FAOS) compared to baseline at follow-up, but there were no difference between the groups at 6-month follow-up. These conclusions are similar to those drawn in the Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The patients were followed for 6&#x000a0;months because the most recovery occurs within the first 6&#x000a0;months after the injury, and re-injury rates stabilize thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Most ankle sprain patients (75&#x02013;100&#x000a0;%) have a 1-year outcome that is excellent or good and fully acceptable to the patients irrespective of the therapy they received. Therefore, achieving optimalization of treatment is relevant especially for the short and intermediate terms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although economic benefits of the treatment options are not an outcome in our study, the cost of brace treatment is presumably lower than the cost of tape treatment. The costs of the brace itself are higher, but the patient can apply the brace himself after the initial period immediately following the trauma. Patients treated with tape need to visit the hospital and general practitioners or physiotherapist need to reapply the tape every 2&#x000a0;weeks. Lardenoye and colleagues show that treatment of acute lateral ankle ligament injury with a semi-rigid brace leads to fewer complications, higher patient satisfaction and similar functional outcome compared to treatment with tape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Based on our trial and currently available evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], applying a below-knee cast for a short period of time and subsequent use of a semi-rigid or lace-up brace for a period of up to 6&#x000a0;weeks is recommended as treatment for a grades II or III lateral ankle ligament injury.</p><p>When this study was designed, great effort was made to minimize potential sources of confounding and bias. The strength of current randomized trial is that it was initiated after a proper sample size calculation. The outcome assessor was blinded. In contrast to other trials, grade 1 ankle sprains were not included because these injuries do not need a supportive treatment.</p><p>A limitation of current study is that the treatment providers and study participants were not blinded to assignment status after allocation because we were unable to conceal the specific external support the subject was wearing. Comparisons between the findings from this study and those of prior reports in the literature and other populations in society need to be done carefully, considering differences in the patient populations studied. An ankle sprain is considered a typical sport injury, but the Tegner score was only 1 or 2 in 75&#x000a0;% of patients included in this study. Another limitation is that it was not possible to measure compliance with the supports accurately.</p><p>Form previous research, there is known that the majority of the patients can be treated with a functional type of treatment. From current research, we know that there is no difference in outcome between these types of functional treatments and therefore is all an option to treat patients with an acute lateral ankle ligament injury in clinical practice. A potential advantage of the braces (semi-rigid and lace-up) may be that these braces can be given to the patients when they visit the emergency department. Patients can apply this brace themselves 4&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days after trauma while patients who are treated with tape have to see somebody who can apply this tape. This potential advantage cannot be concluded from current trial because all patients were evaluated at the same time points and all patients were evaluated during these follow-up visits.</p><p>A future trial should be a large multicentre trial with patient reported outcome measures, patient satisfaction analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis. The treatment options should be compared after an initial short period of immobilization. After the Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the unpublished update of this review including this trial, no major functional differences can be expected between the different types of functional treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The most important finding of current study was that there is no difference in outcome 6&#x000a0;months after treatment of acute lateral ankle ligament injury with a tape, semi-rigid brace and a lace-up brace.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Special thanks to Janine Benning, Ronald Harleman, Jan-Peter Goudzwaard, Jeroen te Wechel and Jan IJseldijk for their support to realize this trial.
