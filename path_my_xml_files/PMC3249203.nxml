The aim of most medical therapies is to decrease the symptoms in order to improve quality of life, but many are associated with adverse effects that restrict their long-term use.</p><p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are associated with symptoms of estrogen deprivation (e.g., hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headache and decreased libido) and with bone demineralization that restricts use to 6&#x000a0;months in the absence of add-back therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, the duration of symptom relief following treatment cessation is typically short, decreasing the cost-effectiveness of GnRH agonists as compared to other approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Combined oral contraceptives, while widely used to manage symptoms of endometriosis, are not approved for this indication in most countries and their use is largely unsupported by solid clinical trial evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One study has demonstrated that the use of a low-dose oral contraceptive pill is an effective treatment for dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The widespread use of danazol in endometriosis is limited by adverse effects typical of androgenic steroids, such as alterations in lipid profile, weight gain, edema, acne, hirsutism and oily skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], although, in deeply infiltrating endometriosis, vaginal use may increase compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Progestins are a recommended treatment for the pain associated with endometriosis, but a number of agents in this class are associated with androgenic effects and weight gain at the doses that are required for efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Long-term use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate preparations impacts adversely on bone mineral density (BMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Norethisterone acetate is a potent progestin derivative of 19-norethisterone and is valid for use in patients with endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; however, its main side effects include breast tenderness, weight gain, acne and hirsutism, in addition to breakthrough bleeding. Levonorgestrel (LNG) has also been used for treating women with symptomatic minimal-to-moderate endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], leading to improvements in the severity and frequency of pain and menstrual symptoms. The LNG-intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) is an effective treatment for rectovaginal endometriosis in women who have previously undergone conservative surgery without excision of deep lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the LNG-IUD is not approved for the treatment of endometriosis.</p><p>There remains, therefore, a need for an effective, safe and well-tolerated medical therapy that can be used in the long-term management of endometriosis. Dienogest is a selective progestin that combines the pharmacologic properties of 19-norprogestins and progesterone derivatives, offering a potent progestogenic effect at the endometrium. Clinical trials of 12&#x02013;24&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; duration have shown that dienogest (at a dose of 2&#x000a0;mg/day) provides effective pain relief equivalent to GnRH agonists, a reduction of endometriotic lesions and a favorable safety and tolerability profile in endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A recent Japanese study investigated the efficacy of 52&#x000a0;weeks of dienogest administration for the treatment of endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and reported a marked or moderate improvement in symptoms in 90.6% of patients, with low rates of adverse event-related discontinuations and little impact on BMD.</p><p>In a recent, double-blind, placebo-controlled European study of 198 women with endometriosis, dienogest for 12&#x000a0;weeks was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP), with low rates of treatment-related adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. With the aim to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of continuous dienogest treatment of endometriosis in this European network, a 1-year, open-label extension study to this placebo-controlled study was performed. In addition, at completion of the extension study, a subgroup of women was followed for 24&#x000a0;weeks without dienogest treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis who participated in a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of dienogest treatment at 2&#x000a0;mg once daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] were offered and accepted participation in an open-label, single-arm extension study of dienogest treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;168). The extension study was conducted at 28 centers in Germany (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17), Italy (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5) and Ukraine (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) between July 2004 and November 2007. The duration of treatment was initially planned to be 36&#x000a0;weeks, but was extended to 52&#x000a0;weeks during the course of the study. Twenty-six patients completed the study before this prolongation was introduced to the protocol. For the final visit, a deviation of +1 week was allowed, resulting in a maximum treatment duration of 12 weeks (in the placebo-controlled study) plus 53&#x000a0;weeks in the current study (total 65&#x000a0;weeks). An additional 24&#x000a0;weeks, treatment-free follow-up was conducted in a patient subgroup (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;34) at six study centers on completion of the extension study. Therefore, an overall total of 90&#x000a0;weeks of study was conducted.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by local independent ethics committees and all participants provided written, informed consent before study enrolment. The study was conducted in accordance with the amended version of the Declaration of Helsinki and complied with Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in the placebo-controlled study are described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In brief, the inclusion criteria for women aged 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years included histologically proven endometriosis (stages 1&#x02013;4) at laparoscopy &#x02264;12&#x000a0;months before study entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and an EAPP score of at least 30&#x000a0;mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) at screening and baseline visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. All women, who completed their allocated treatment with either dienogest or placebo in the placebo-controlled study, without major protocol violations, were eligible for inclusion in the extension study. All patients at specific study centers who successfully completed the extension study were subsequently eligible for inclusion in the follow-up study.</p><p>Dienogest was administered at a dose of 2&#x000a0;mg once daily, orally, for up to 53&#x000a0;weeks to all women during the extension study. The first dienogest tablet during the extension study was taken on the day after medication ended in the placebo-controlled study. Women completed a daily diary card throughout the extension study to monitor treatment compliance. Investigators recorded the use of any concomitant medications.</p><p>The main study variables were (1) EAPP, which was assessed by VAS score every 4&#x000a0;weeks to summarize the previous 4-week period (where 0&#x000a0;mm represents absence of pain and 100&#x000a0;mm indicates unbearable pain); (2) uterine bleeding pattern, which was assessed over 90-day periods according to the method of Gerlinger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Women documented the presence and intensity of bleeding on daily diary cards, from which the frequency and duration of bleeding events were calculated.</p><p>Patient visits were planned at baseline and at weeks 2, 13, 25, 36 and 52 of the extension study, as well as at weeks 12 and 24 during the treatment-free follow-up.</p><p>Adverse events were documented at all study visits and coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Primary System Organ Class. Adverse events were rated treatment-related at the discretion of the investigator. Laboratory assessments included hematology, blood chemistry, liver enzyme, lipid and estradiol concentration measurements (Laboratorium f&#x000fc;r Klinische Forschung, Kiel, Germany) and dipstick urinalysis (&#x0201c;Combur-9&#x0201d;; Roche, Germany). Gynecologic examination (including cervical cytological smears), breast examination, vital sign assessments (blood pressure and heart rate) and body weight measurements were performed at predefined study visits. Abnormal findings at gynecologic and breast examination were reported as adverse events. Urine pregnancy testing was performed at home every 4&#x000a0;weeks and at study visits.</p><p>Quality of life assessments by the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) were performed at the baseline and the end of the follow-up study to measure changes in mental and physical components.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Analyses are based on the full analysis set (FAS), which included all women who took at least one dose of study medication and provided at least one observation after dosing. Subgroup analyses are reported for women treated with dienogest or placebo during the previous placebo-controlled study (&#x0201c;prior-dienogest&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;prior-placebo&#x0201d; groups, respectively).</p><p>The efficacy and safety analyses in the extension and follow-up studies are presented primarily as descriptive statistics. The null hypothesis of whether the change in EAPP from randomization in the placebo-controlled study to the end of the extension study was equal to 0 was exploratively tested using the one-sample <italic>t</italic> test.</p><p>The sample size of the extension study was determined by the number of women who were eligible and willing to participate at completion of the placebo-controlled study. According to the guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization, the extent of population exposure to assess clinical safety requires at least 100 patients studied over 1&#x000a0;year. Assuming a dropout rate of 25%, the extension study, therefore, required inclusion of a minimum of 133 women.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Results</title><p>Among women who completed the placebo-controlled study (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;188), 168 entered the extension study and were included in the FAS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

(<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5; 3.0%) and irritability (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4; 2.4%). The maximal intensity of treatment-related adverse events was rated mild or moderate in the majority (92.5%) of cases. Three women (1.8%) experienced one serious adverse event each of cholelithiasis, chronic sinusitis and depression; of these, only the case of depression, which developed after approximately 4&#x000a0;months of study drug treatment, was considered to be possibly treatment related. Four women (2.4%) experienced four adverse events (i.e., weight increase, migraine, depression and breast pain) that led to premature study discontinuation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Two women (1.2%) discontinued the study due to bleeding-related events (amenorrhea and polymenorrhea), which were not recorded as adverse events. Abnormal cervical smear findings were recorded in two women, which were considered unlikely to be treatment related.</p><p>During treatment-free follow-up, 7/34 women (20.6%) developed de novo adverse events, including headache in two women (5.9%). One woman developed an ovarian cyst at the end of the follow-up period that was considered to be unrelated to previous study drug intake. Another woman had a successful, planned pregnancy, with conception estimated at approximately 6&#x000a0;months after ceasing treatment. Quality of life assessment by the SF-36<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> indicated minimal change in mental or physical sum scores during the follow-up period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study shows that dienogest treatment for up to 65&#x000a0;weeks is associated with reduced pelvic pain in women with endometriosis, and that this effect persists for at least 24&#x000a0;weeks after the end of treatment. Previous studies of dienogest treatment for periods of 12&#x02013;24&#x000a0;weeks reported superior efficacy relative to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and equivalent efficacy compared with leuprolide acetate and buserelin acetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in relieving the symptoms of endometriosis. The present findings suggest that dienogest represents an effective treatment over the long term. The observation that pain relief is also largely maintained during the 24&#x000a0;weeks after treatment cessation may indicate that dienogest&#x02014;at least for a certain period&#x02014;sustains a beneficial effect that exceeds the period of symptomatic treatment. One plausible explanation for this effect is the reduction in endometriotic lesions observed during dienogest treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], although additional explanations for the sustained reduction in pain are possible. Dienogest and other progestins have a number of putative mechanisms of action in endometriosis, including reduced growth, proliferation and neoangiogenesis of lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] as well as an antiinflammatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Assessment of uterine bleeding by a number of analyses showed that dienogest is associated with a desynchronized uterine bleeding in the short term, but with a progressive reduction in the frequency and intensity of bleeding during continued treatment. Irregular bleeding has also been reported in short-term studies of dienogest treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The bleeding pattern associated with dienogest appeared to be generally acceptable, as only 2 of 168 women in the extension study discontinued treatment due to changes in their bleeding pattern. The incidence of menorrhagia was lower in this study than in the Japanese long-term study, which reported a 71.9% incidence of menorrhagia; in that study, 18 of 135 patients (13.3%) discontinued treatment for various reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Irregular uterine bleeding is a known common adverse effect of all long-term progestin treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Informing women of the bleeding profile of dienogest before they initiate treatment will likely enhance their long-term adherence to therapy in light of the accompanying improvement in painful symptoms.</p><p>The safety variables included in the extension study also indicated an acceptable profile for dienogest. The lack of changes in laboratory parameters supports previous trials that investigated the metabolic effects of dienogest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, there were minimal changes in mean body weight, consistent with the previous dienogest experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>This study contributes to the evidence base on medications investigated for the long-term treatment of endometriosis. The strengths of the current study include the assessment of clinically relevant outcomes, the long-term (1&#x000a0;year) treatment duration, and a treatment-free follow-up, which are pertinent for the management of patients with endometriosis. The data from the follow-up period may be especially relevant for patients who wish to become pregnant after a course of medical therapy. Potential weaknesses of the study are its open-label design and the recruitment of patients who had participated in an earlier placebo-controlled study, which included a proportion who responded favorably to prior dienogest therapy. The low and comparable discontinuation rates in both subgroups, during and at the end of the placebo-controlled study indicate that this theoretical concern did not introduce a major bias.</p><p>In summary, this large-scale, long-term study showed that dienogest treatment induces a sustained reduction in EAPP associated with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The observation of prolonged pain relief even after the return of normal menses suggests a sustained effect on endometrial lesions. Bleeding irregularities demonstrated a tendency toward reduced frequency and intensity during continued treatment. Therefore, dienogest may represent an effective long-term treatment option for women with endometriosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support was provided by PAREXEL.
