Effective pain control is essential during taking care of surgical patients. However, in spite of great improvements in pathophysiology and pharmacology of analgesics, many patients suffer from the debilitating post-operative pain. Obviously, the main goal of pain control is providing comfort to patients and decreasing the complications caused by inappropriate pain control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>According to the results obtained in different studies, it is believed that analgesic activities are more effective if they are carried out prior to injury, compared to being carried out after injury.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Preemptive analgesia is an analgesic treatment preventing central sensitization and the central pain process, called hyperalgesia and limits the patients&#x02019; pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Administration of opioids prior to the first phase could prevent the development of the late phase. Hence, preventing the early nervous cascade could lead to the elimination of central sensitization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Preemptive analgesia theoretically decreases post-operative pain and may prevent the development of chronic pain as well.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Though the basis for &#x0201c;preemptive analgesia&#x0201d; is widely known, different reports are available about its effectiveness.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] On the other hand, many different definitions have been proposed for preemptive analgesia. This has led to many ambiguities and controversies in this field. According to some studies, if active treatment is used, long and severe pain will develop and remain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, different and controversial results have been reported in the studies that have evaluated the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systematic opioids, ketamine, dextromethorphan, local anesthesia and epidural anesthesia agents on the body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine anesthesia has been approved in post-operative pain control and it has been reported that low-dose ketamine significantly reduce the amount of morphine required and also nausea after abdominal surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Propofol is a short-acting intravenous (IV) hypnotic agent used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia and sedation for surgical operation and mechanical ventilation in adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The mechanisms of action are as follows: Potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor activity by increasing channels block time and also playing the role as a sodium channel blocker.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Remifentanil is a potent ultra-short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic drug, used during the surgical operation for pain relief and its anesthetic effects.

The present clinical trial was carried out on 75 people, divided into three groups of 25 patients. The participants were in the age range of 18-65, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II (ASA I: Normal healthy patient, ASA II: Patient with mild systemic disease; no functional limitation) and were a candidate for lower abdomen elective surgery. All participants had normal values of blood urea nitrogen, Cr and liver function tests and were negative for history of psychological problems, convulsion or alcohol and opioid addiction. In addition, they had to be able to use verbal rating scale (VRS: 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, 3 = severe pain, 4 = extremely severe pain) or visual analog scale (VAS: Patient explain the severity of his pain with numerical 0-10 scale). The participants were randomly divided into three groups using sealed envelopes with 25 patients in each group respectively.</p><p>(The sample size was estimated based on a power calculation, which showed that at least 25 patients per group were necessary to achieve 80% power to detect a 20% difference between the two groups in the VAS scoring with &#x003b1; equal to 0.05).</p><p>In each group, one drug was used as the preemptive analgesic. One group received remifentanil (GSK Glaxosmith Kline Italy) (R) while the two other groups received propofol (Claris Lifescience Limited India) (P) and ketamine (Rotex Medica Germany) (K). Regarding the differences between colors and volumes of the drugs, the individual who injected the drugs was different from the one who evaluated and also all of our syringes were covered, to fulfill a double-blind study. The anesthesia method was the same in all three groups; thiopental 5 mg/kg, fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg combined with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg, followed by morphine 0.2 mg/kg.</p><p>Maintenance of anesthesia was accomplished by 50% N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub> through orotracheal tube in conjunction with propofol 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/min IV infusions. In case of complicated operation or prolonged anesthesia (more than 3 h), the participant was excluded from the study. Immediately after induction of anesthesia, 0.3 mg/kg ketamine, 0.25 mg/kg propofol and 0.25 &#x003bc;g/kg remifentanil were administered in groups (K), (P) and (R) as preemptive anesthesia, respectively.</p><p>Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (BP), pulse and respiratory rate of patient with 15-min intervals were monitored and recorded during the operation. Furthermore, these variables were measured and recorded 2, 6, 12, 24 h post-operation. Post-recovery pain intensity of patients was measured and recorded in VAS and VRS tables in the recovery room immediately after the operation and also 2, 6, 12 and 24 h after the surgery. Furthermore, time interval between operation ending and first post-operative opioid dose received (pethidine 0.1 mg/kg or morphine 0.15 mg/kg, providing VAS reaches above 3) and recovery duration were recorded in three groups. The amount of opioid used was recorded in three groups in the first 24 h after the surgery. Sleep scores (according to the Ramsey Sedation Scale) were recorded in three groups 2, 6, 12 and 24 h after the operation as well. Meanwhile, complications which seemed to be caused by the drugs such as bradycardia (heart rate (HR) &#x0003c; 60), tachycardia (HR &#x0003e; 120), hypertension (BP &#x02265; 140/90 mmHg), hypotension (BP &#x02264; 90/60 mmHg) and hallucination were recorded. The data were analyzed by SPSS software version 20 and all dependent quantitative variables were compared and analyzed in three groups. The variables include sleep score, respiratory rate, HR, arterial BP, VAS, VRS, amount of post-operative opioid used and time interval between end of the operation and the first post-operative opioid dose received.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the Chi-square test results, the three groups were not significantly different in gender (<italic>P</italic> = 0.713), job (<italic>P</italic> = 0.419), ASA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.853), type of surgical operation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.126) and post-operative analgesic method (<italic>P</italic> = 0.284).

However, the lowest post-operative opioid dose belonged to propofol and then to remifentanil.</p><p>In another clinical trial carried out in 2004, it was shown that performing preemptive analgesia during the surgical operation by ketamine leads to a desirable anesthesia after recovery. However, the duration is not sufficient (about 1 h); it also enhances the post-operative analgesic effect of tramadol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Regarding the findings of the present study, ketamine had the lowest analgesic effect within the first 12 h after anesthesia.</p><p>In a clinical trial, combination of remifentanil and ketamine was administered in laparoscopic cystectomy. The most desirable preemptive analgesic effect was observed in patients who received 0.75 &#x003bc;g/kg remifentanil after anesthesia induction up to the suture time and 100 &#x003bc;g/kg ketamine from induction to 6 h after anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A low dose of remifetanil (0.25 &#x003bc;g/kg) immediately after induction of general anesthesia provide better post-operative pain relief in comparison with ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) or propofol (0.25 mg/kg) in lower abdominal surgery.</p><p>The principal limitation of this study was the specific setting for post-operative pain relief and the relatively low number of patients, so this observation should be replied in further surveys in a large number of patients and different setting and in our study median sleep score was different between three groups in some times after the recovery; therefore, our findings about VAS and VRS are reliable in patients who were cooperative.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to all those who gave us the possibility to complete this research.
