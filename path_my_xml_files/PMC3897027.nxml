If the required length of normal vaginal mucosa was not provided, we continued the strip along the opposite vaginal wall edge to achieve the minimum required length for passing the strip from endopelvic fascia bilaterally. Two small punctures were made suprapubically and trocar is passed under finger control through the fascia and retropubic space. Check cystoscopy was carried out to rule out bladder or urethral injury at this point. The previously placed nylon sutures from the sling strip are transferred to the suprapubic incision.

Advantages of this technique are that there is no need for additional incision for harvesting a strip of fascia, and retro pubic dissection is not necessary versus other classic autologous slings. However, despite the classic sling procedures, harvested tissue is not &#x0201c;fascia&#x0201d; and its integrity and strength is questionable.</p><p>In this study, patients with severe SUI (ICIQ-SF more than 25/12) were selected in order to obtain more precise and practical results. The subjective outcomes of the two procedures were not significantly different; whereas the objective outcomes were better in the T-Sling group during the medium term (6 months) follow-up period. When compared with the studies that have used facial sling, our autologous tissue shows inferior results.</p><p>Sharifiaghdas and Mortazavi have investigated the medium-term subjective and objective outcomes and satisfaction rates of TVT and autologous rectus fascia sling in the treatment of SUI in women. According to their findings, objective and subjective cure rates was not different significantly between studied procedures in the treatment of type II SUI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Amaro <italic>et al</italic>. in Brazil have compared outcomes of autologous fascial sling (AFS), arectus fascia strip, and TVT procedures in women with SUI and indicated that the results were similar between AFS and TVT, except for operative time, which was shorter in TVT. Cure rates were 71% at 1 month, 57% at 6 and 12 months in AVW Sling and 75% at 1 month, 70% at 6 months and 65% at 12 months in T-Sling. The quality of life at 36 months was similar in the two procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>In AVW Sling technique, not only is the operative time shorter, but also it has all the advantages of an autologous facial sling. It is due to our selected minimal invasive technique.</p><p>In another study in Brazil, Sartori <italic>et al</italic>. compared the rates of subjective and objective healing of classic pubovaginal sling and TVT for surgical treatment of SUI. They showed that in medium-term follow-up, the subjective healing was similar in the two groups, but in long-term follow-up (after 15 or 19 months), TVT surgery provided better subjective healing. The rate of objective healing was not different significantly in both procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>According to the report of American Urological Association, slings are the most effective treatment procedures for severe SUI because of their high long-term success rates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Recently, the use of autologous sling has increased due to its low-cost and similar cure rate in compare with synthetic slings, which has been reported in several studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>In long-term, the difference between the two procedures (T-Sling and AWV Sling) becomes insignificant and one could conclude that the long-term outcomes are similar.</p><p>In fact the procedure could be considered as a modified Raz anterior vaginal wall sling.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>In our method, a 1.5 cm wide strip of the vaginal wall epithelium and sub mucosa was passed through endopelvic fascia, which may be wider fibrosis with similar efficacy that can be expected from a classical anterior vaginal wall suspension with prolene sutures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>UI is a multidimensional phenomenon, so in evaluating the outcomes of different treatment methods, various domains should be considered. Though, it seems that both subjective and objective testing are necessary in this field, some studies have indicated that urodynamic findings that evaluate the outcome objectively, have poor correlation with patient's symptoms and subjective improvement that are considered as the most salient outcomes for surgical treatment of SUI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>]</p><p>Evidence indicates that in cases with scar tissue around the urethra and atrophied pelvic floor including patients with a history of paraurethral surgery or atrophic vaginitis, fibrosis made by the sling could not have a good effect in treating SUI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]</p><p>Many studies have shown that the recurrence of SUI in TVT method is lower than autologous sling procedure.</p><p>In our study, 7/8 (87.5%) of patients in AVW. group with recurrence of SUI had a previous history of vaginal surgery and all of them were older than 55-year-old. Therefore, we could concluded that in younger patients (&#x0003c;55-year-old) with more appropriate vaginal tissue and without history of vaginal surgery, this method is more suitable as mentioned by Raz <italic>et al</italic>. too.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In addition, though the use of synthetic slings with minimally invasive procedures is growing rapidly, it seems that especially in young women, complication of extensive vaginal mesh prosthesis, for example dyspareunia and tethered vagina, is considered a serious problem. Using the autologus tissue could be an ideal method in this regard.</p><p>Despite their low cure rate, traditional methods such as anterior colporrhaphy have reported to produce more satisfaction in affected patients as reported by Freeman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>]</p><p>The rate of de novo urge incontinence as a complication of SUI surgery has reported to vary between 2.2% and 15%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Though, de novo urge incontinence in our study was not significantly different between the two groups, the rate was 0% in the autologous sling procedure. This finding may show one of the advantages of the AVW technique; however, more studies are needed to confirm it.</p><p>In sum, this pilot study confirms the safety and a 58% effectiveness of the vaginal wall wrap in simultaneous correction of POP stage &#x0003c;3 and severe SUI. Although, the recurrence rate of the vaginal wall wrap was higher than propylene sling, factors like better subjective outcome (that is important in quality of life of patients with SUI) and its low complication rate and cost, makes it an attractive transvaginal procedure for simultaneous correction of POP and SUI.</p><p>The anterior vaginal wall epithelium, which its use is safe, could make a sufficient fibrous tissue, which consequently results in reinforcement of pubourethral ligament and restoration of UI.</p><p>The success rate of AVW Sling can be improved by selection of young women (with better quality of vaginal mucousa) and exclusion of patient with a history of failed anti-incontinence surgery. For more conclusive results, more studies with larger sample size are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haylen</surname><given-names>BT</given-names></name><name><surname>de Ridder</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Swift</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Berghmans</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>An International Urogynecological Association (IUGA)/International Continence Society (ICS) joint report on the terminology for female pelvic floor dysfunction</article-title><source>Neurourol Urodyn</source><year>2010</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>4</fpage><lpage>20</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19941278</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Luber</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The definition, prevalence, and risk factors for stress urinary incontinence</article-title><source>Rev Urol</source><year>2004</year><volume>6</volume><issue>Suppl 3</issue><fpage>S3</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16985863</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Nager</surname><given-names>CW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Midurethral slings for stress urinary incontinence</article-title><source>Clin Obstet Gynecol</source><year>2008</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>124</fpage><lpage>35</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18303507</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>SW</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeon</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Relationship between stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse</article-title><source>Int Urogynecol J Pelvic Floor Dysfunct</source><year>2002</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>256</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12189431</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leach</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name><name><surname>Dmochowski</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name><name><surname>Appell</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Blaivas</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Hadley</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Luber</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Female Stress Urinary Incontinence Clinical Guidelines Panel summary report on surgical management of female stress urinary incontinence.
