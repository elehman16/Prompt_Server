Unfortunately, about 30&#x000a0;% of patients do not respond to adequate trials of antidepressants and/or psychotherapies. About 45&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% of such treatment-resistant patients will remit with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, relapse rates are high following ECT&#x02014;38&#x000a0;% after 6&#x000a0;months. There is a need for better relapse prevention strategies. One possibility is to use ketamine, a competitive glutamate receptor antagonist used for anaesthesia. A recent paradigm shift in treating depression and understanding its biology has been the finding that ketamine has a robust, rapid-onset, though short-lived, antidepressant effect that is possibly mediated through neuroplastic effects. However, ketamine has not previously been reported on for relapse prevention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The main objective of this study is to conduct a randomised controlled pilot trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) of a 4-week course of once-weekly ketamine infusions for relapse prevention following ECT for depression to assess trial procedures that will inform a future definitive trial. Participants with unipolar depression will be recruited prior to commencing ECT and be assessed weekly during the ECT course using the primary clinical outcome, the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24). Those who meet standard response criteria will be invited, on completing ECT, to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to a course of four once-weekly infusions of ketamine or an active comparator midazolam, which mimics some of the effects of ketamine and may improve blinding over inactive placebo. Participants will be followed up over 6&#x000a0;months using the HRSD-24 to assess for relapse.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first registered trial (NCT02414932, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02414932">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02414932</ext-link>) of ketamine for depression relapse prevention, an important possible use of this agent. The primary focus of the pilot trial is on feasibility. However, a 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval will be determined for the difference between ketamine and midazolam groups in 6-month relapse rates to help inform a future definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

It is the most costly brain disorder in Europe, accounting for 1&#x000a0;% (&#x020ac;118 billion annually) of the total European economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Indeed, depression is currently the second largest cause globally for years lived with disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>About 30&#x000a0;% of patients do not respond to antidepressants even after multiple trials with/without psychotherapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) offers up to 60&#x000a0;% of such treatment-resistant patients to complete remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. ECT is a medically safe procedure and is more acutely effective than psychotherapy or antidepressants for severe, often treatment-resistant, depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The major concerns are cognitive side effects, but for most people, these are transient and many cognitive functions improve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Treatments involve passing small electrical charges through the brain to induce a seizure lasting ~30&#x000a0;s under anaesthesia with a muscle relaxant. Six to 12 treatments are typically administered in a course, two to three times weekly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Worldwide, 1.4 million people receive ECT annually, including nearly 260 people in Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In a recent meta-analysis, we found that taking antidepressants following successful ECT halves the risk for relapse (risk ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.49, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, NNT&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.3) at 6&#x000a0;months from nearly 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but mean relapse rates remain high: 27.1&#x000a0;% after 3&#x000a0;months and 37.7&#x000a0;% after 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Even continuation ECT (C-ECT), albeit mostly at non-adjustable fixed schedules, does not seem to improve 6-month relapse rates (37.2&#x000a0;%). Notably, these relapse rates are similar to those for patients who respond only after &#x02265;3 antidepressant steps and most likely reflect the recurrent nature of treatment-resistant depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>A major challenge now is how best to prevent relapse after successful treatment of depression with ECT. However, remarkably, the evidence base for relapse prevention in depression following any successful treatment is small. For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK have identified that evidence on relapse prevention in depression is limited and recommended research in this area. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] To date, the reported randomised controlled trials for relapse prevention following successful antidepressant therapy have focused on the effect of 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; tricyclic or SSRI antidepressant therapy, showing consistent but limited reduction in relapse rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As discussed in our review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], there have been very few randomised, controlled trials focusing on relapse prevention after ECT. One study investigated the use of nortriptyline or nortriptyline and lithium for relapse prevention following successful ECT for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nortriptyline-lithium combination therapy had a marked advantage in time to relapse, superior to both placebo and nortriptyline alone. Other studies have focused on fixed-schedule continuation ECT, which has a relapse prevention effect in well-chosen groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ketamine as an antidepressant</title><p>Ketamine is a competitive glutamate <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist with a half-life of 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h. Ketamine has a remarkably rapid antidepressant effect, targeting core symptoms, in treatment-resistant depression when given as single sub-anaesthetic doses, usually a 40-min 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg intravenous infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thereafter, robust antidepressant effects (~70&#x000a0;% responder rates) occur within 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h and persist for a few days, i.e. beyond immediate NMDAR blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These findings have led to the most exciting development in treating and understanding depression in over 50&#x000a0;years and represent a paradigm shift away from conventional slow-acting monaminergic antidepressants. Preclinical studies have shown that within just 2&#x000a0;h, ketamine increases synaptogenesis and spine formation in rodent prefrontal cortex and rapidly reverses chronic stress-induced depressive behaviours and prefrontal neuronal atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These effects are mediated, at least in part, via Akt/GSK-3/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling and increased dendritic translation of synaptic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], as well as deactivation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, resulting in de-suppression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. BDNF mediates synaptic plasticity and is implicated in mechanisms of antidepressants and ECT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Changes in blood mononuclear cell levels of phosphorylated mTOR, eEF2 and GSK-3beta have also been associated with response to ketamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], suggesting potential as biomarkers for response.</p><p>Ketamine is psychotomimetic, but at low dosage, it is safe, with patients and healthy controls occasionally experiencing mild dissociative and psychotic symptoms that resolve soon after finishing infusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To control for these effects, and also avoid &#x0201c;carry-over&#x0201d; effects in crossover studies while improving blinding, midazolam, at the sub-anaesthetic dose of 0.045&#x000a0;mg/kg, has been used as a control in parallel-group design trials rather than inactive placebo saline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Ketamine can be a drug of abuse and chronic high-dose abuse can cause uropathy and dependency. However, repeated (e.g. 2&#x02013;3/week for 2&#x000a0;weeks) infusions of sub-anaesthetic ketamine are safe with more sustained antidepressant effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Two recent reviews of trials of ketamine for use as an antidepressant showed the most commonly used dosage is a 40-min infusion of 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Bioavailability of ketamine is highest when administered intravenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In sub-anaesthetic doses, ketamine is a medically safe drug but can cause transient rises in pulse and blood pressure during infusion and for up to 80&#x000a0;min afterward. However, a recent review of ketamine in depression concluded that outside recreational usage, there have been no reports of persistent adverse effects with sub-anaesthetic uses of ketamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The effect of ketamine on cognition is unclear and has only been studied in acute treatment of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There may be changes in visual and working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and an association between baseline neurocognitive performance and response to ketamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Optimum dosing and deliver of ketamine has not been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Ketamine has been used for ECT anaesthesia and is associated with earlier improvement and possibly fewer cognitive side effects but no overall better response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There have been insufficient studies of intramuscular, oral or intranasal ketamine for depression to currently warrant studying these preparations for relapse prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While the half-life of ketamine is 3&#x000a0;h, in previous studies, the antidepressant effect was maintained for up to 2&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. No trials have yet been reported, or registered, for using ketamine as an adjunctive treatment to reduce relapse rates following successful depression treatment&#x02014;a potential use of ketamine that this trial will explore.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study objective</title><p>The primary objective is to conduct a randomised, controlled, patient- and rater-blinded pilot study of ketamine vs. an active comparator (midazolam) for 4&#x000a0;weeks following successful ECT, to assess trial process to inform a future definitive trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary objective</title><p>To calculate a 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval for an unadjusted hazard ratio that will allow interpretation of statistical difference between ketamine and midazolam groups to assess ketamine for reducing 6-month relapse rates following successful ECT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Overview</title><p>This randomised, controlled pilot trial will take place over 30&#x000a0;months.

</p><p>Participants will be assessed weekly during ECT using the HRSD-24 and QIDS-SR. Response to ECT is defined as achieving &#x02265;60&#x000a0;% decrease from baseline HRSD-24 and score &#x02264;16 on two consecutive weekly ratings. Remission criteria are &#x02265;60&#x000a0;% decrease in HRSD from baseline and score &#x02264;10 on two consecutive weekly ratings. Those identified as being ECT responders will be invited to participate in the two-group parallel-design randomised controlled pilot trial. The advantages of randomisation and blinding in this group will also be used to perform studies of peripheral blood biomarkers as potential predictors of response to ketamine (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). During infusion sessions in the randomised treatment phase, HRSD-24 scores will be obtained 60&#x000a0;min before the infusion begins and at +120 and +240&#x000a0;min afterwards. Baseline scores on sleep and appetite items will be maintained for repeated measures within 1&#x000a0;day. The +240&#x000a0;min HRSD-24 scores will serve as the weekly post-ECT scores up to follow-up week 4.</p><p>Ketamine psychotomimetic effects and adverse events will be assessed using the following instruments before, during (+35&#x02013;40&#x000a0;min) and after (+240&#x000a0;min) infusions of ketamine or midazolam:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; four-item positive symptom subscale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; mood item) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient-Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Participants will be followed up for 6&#x000a0;months following ECT with repeated questionnaires comprising treatment review plus HRSD-24 and QIDS-SR at weeks 6, 8, 12 and 20 post-ECT. Criteria for relapse are &#x02265;10 point increase in HRSD-24 compared to baseline phase 2 score plus HRSD &#x02265;16; in addition, increase in the HRSD should be maintained 1&#x000a0;week later (if indicated, additional follow-ups will be arranged). Hospital admission, further ECT and deliberate self-harm/suicide also constitute relapse. Timing of these events will be recorded. A final follow-up session in week 26 will comprise HRSD-24, QIDS-SR and cognitive outcomes.</p><p>There are no published data on effects of ketamine on cognition in ECT responders. We will use the following battery pre- and post-ECT course, after the fourth infusion and at 6&#x02009;-month follow-up. The post-ECT assessment will serve as baseline for the randomised pilot trial. Where appropriate, parallel versions will be used to reduce practice effects. Global cognition will be assessed with the sMMSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Immediate short-term memory, attention and working memory will be measured using Forward and Backward Digit Spans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Motor and psychomotor speed will be assessed using the Trail Making Test (part A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Frontal-executive function will be rated by Trail Making Test (part B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] plus letter and category verbal fluencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Anterograde verbal memory will be tested using the verbal learning component of the Addenbrooke&#x02019;s Cognitive Examination III (delayed and immediate recall of a seven-item address) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Retrograde amnesia for autobiographical information will be measured using the Kopelman Autobiographical Memory Interview (K-AMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants in phase I will receive ECT and usual care and will be monitored weekly using the HRSD-24 for response. ECT will be administered twice-weekly with hand-held electrodes according to Royal College of Psychiatrists&#x02019; guidelines and as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Briefly, the Mecta 5000&#x000a0;M device (Mecta Corporation, USA) will be used and seizure duration measured by EEG monitoring. Methohexitone (0.75&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg) will be used for anaesthesia with suxamethonium (0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg) as muscle relaxant. Brief-pulse (1.0-ms pulse width; current amplitude 800&#x000a0;mA) ECT will be administered twice weekly (Mecta 5000&#x000a0;M device, Mecta Corp., Portland, Ore.; maximum 1200&#x000a0;mC), using methohexitone (0.75&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg) anaesthesia and succinylcholine (0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg) for muscle relaxation (16, 22). Seizure threshold (ST) will be established by a method of limits, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], at the first session, and subsequent treatments will be given at 1.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;ST for BL ECT and 6.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;ST for RUL ECT. Stimulus charge will be titrated upward as required during treatment courses following a standard stimulus dosing protocol. To reflect routine clinical practice, number of ECT treatments will be determined by referring physicians who will be blind to randomisation. ECT characteristics will be recorded.</p><p>Participants who have successfully responded to ECT in phase I and meet inclusion criteria to continue to the randomised controlled pilot trial in Phase II will be randomised (1:1) to receive four once-weekly infusions of either ketamine or midazolam. The regimen of four weekly infusions was chosen to facilitate subjects travelling for appointments and because ketamine has proven effects as a rapid-acting antidepressant but has not yet been studied as a series of infusions for relapse prevention. Patients and raters will be blind to treatment. The first infusion will be administered within 2&#x000a0;weeks of completing ECT and may be administered as an inpatient or outpatient; further infusions will take place as an outpatient. Each infusion will take 40&#x000a0;min, and monitoring will take place for 200&#x000a0;min post-commencement of infusion. Ketamine hydrochloride 10&#x000a0;mg/ml infusion at 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg (Pfizer Healthcare Ireland) or midazolam hydrochloride (Hypnovel) 10&#x000a0;mg/5&#x000a0;ml solution at 0.045&#x000a0;mg/kg (Roche Products Ireland Ltd) will be made up as 50&#x000a0;ml colourless saline solutions and administered intravenously via an infusion pump. This dose and administration was chosen based on a previous randomised controlled trial of ketamine and midazolam in which these dosages were well-tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>During each treatment session, participants will be monitored for heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram changes. Adverse or psychotomimetic effects of either agent will be monitored using the CADSS, BPRS (four-item positive symptom subscale), YMRS (mood item) and the PRISE administered before, during and after infusions. Cognitive outcomes will be repeated in week 4. All other assessment measures will be repeated weekly, including treatment review, HRSD-24 and QIDS-SR.</p><p>Participants will be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery for 24&#x000a0;h post-commencement of infusions and be provided with information on recent changes to the Road Traffic Act (Ireland) 2014, which includes provisions for roadside intoxication testing. Participants will be asked to ensure they have a nominated adult who can stay with them for 24&#x000a0;h on outpatient treatment days and will be contacted by a researcher 24&#x000a0;h after each session to enquire about side effects.</p><p>Treatment-as-usual will continue during the trial. Participants will continue to receive pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy or other therapeutic inputs as recommended by their treating team for the duration of the trial. There are no provisions for post-trial care or improving adherence due to the pilot trial design.

Only one other registered study proposes to investigate this issue; however, that study uses intranasal esketamine (NCT02493868). Previous studies have shown that ketamine has a rapid effect in acute depression, maintained up to 2&#x000a0;weeks, but repeated infusions have not been studied in a recovered population for the purpose of relapse prevention. The focus of this pilot trial is on process outcomes to help inform a future definitive trial. Strengths of the study include its double-blind design and use of independent randomisation. Notwithstanding the potential utility of the trial in assessing the safety and practicability of this treatment protocol, there are some limitations. The small number of proposed participants in this pilot trial (up to <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) limits the statistical analyses which can be confidently applied to the ones described here. The nationwide catchment area of the trial site may pose difficulties in retention of participants from phase I to phase II due to travel challenges. Treatment-as-usual will continue for all participants during the pilot trial, resulting in a heterogeneous participant group. This pragmatic design will, however, improve generalisability of the results and applicability to a future definitive trial.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment commenced</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Version III; BPRS, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; CADSS, Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale; CSTAR, Centre for Support and Training in Analysis and Research, University College Dublin; CTQ, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; DSM-IV, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition; ECT, electroconvulsive therapy; EHQ, Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire; HRSD-24, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 24-item version; K-AMI, Kopelman Autobiographical Memory Interview; MDD, major depressive disorder; MSTRD, Maudsley Staging for Treatment-Resistant Depression; NART, National Adult Reading Test; NMDA, <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate; PRISE, Patient-Rated Inventory of Side Effects; QIDS-SR, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, Self-Report, 16-item; SCID, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders; sMMSE, Standardised Mini Mental State Exam; YMRS, Young Mania Rating Scale</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional files</title><p>
