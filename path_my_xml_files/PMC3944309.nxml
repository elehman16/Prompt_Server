exercises on cross-sectional areas of abdominal muscles. [Subjects] Thirty healthy female
adults participated in this study. The exclusion criteria were orthopedic or neurologic
diseases. [Methods] The subjects of this study were assigned randomly to one of two
groups, each with 15 people. Each group performed a 60-minute exercise program, one
performed a bracing exercise, and the other performed a hollowing exercise, with both
groups performing the exercise three times a week for six weeks. [Results] The changes in
cross-sectional areas after the bracing exercise showed statistically significant
differences in the left rectus abdominis and both internal and external obliques. The
changes in cross-sectional areas after the hollowing exercise showed statistically
significant differences in the left and right transversus abdominis and left rectus
abdominis. [Conclusion] Performing bracing exercises rather than hollowing exercises is
more effective for activating the abdominal muscles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hollowing exercise</kwd><kwd>Bracing exercise</kwd><kwd>Cross-sectional area</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain can be felt around the waist from the 2nd lumbar vertebra to the sacroiliac
joints where the spinal nerve ending<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
causes of low back pain can be classified into structural, psychological, and biomechanical
factors of the dynamical musculoskeletal system<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The core is comprised of passive and active structures and a neural
control unit<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The core local muscles
include the transverse abdominis, multifidus, internal obliques, transversospinalis, and
pelvic floor muscles; the core global muscles include the erector spinae, external obliques,
rectus abdominis, and quadratus lumborum<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
One&#x02019;s sensorimotor ability is essential for stability and lumbar spine functioning<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with low back pain experience
spinal instability due to the weakness of these core muscles.</p><p>In one study, patients with acute low back pain performed spinal stabilization exercises as
a form of exercise therapy to strengthen weakened core muscles. The results indicated that
co-contraction of the transversus abdominis and multifidus was found in the experimental
group, and recurrence of low back pain was infrequent<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Koumantakis et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that once a stabilization exercise was applied to patients
with low back pain, the experimental group was more effective in resolving lumbar segmental
instability, and stabilization exercise improved the motor control of the abdominal and
trunk muscles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stabilization training
involves isolated local muscle contraction and integration of the local and global muscle
systems during particular movement patterns<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hollowing exercises, which concentrate on the contraction of local
muscles, draw the belly button toward the lumbar spine. On the other hand, bracing
exercises, which contract the local and global muscles at the same time, are performed by
pushing the abdomen out externally<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With regard to these two types of exercise, once Kavcic et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> discovered that a single trunk muscle alone cannot
contribute to stabilization, they recommended a mobility program, by which a patient&#x02019;s
entire mobility pattern, rather than a few specific muscles, can be strengthened. On the
other hand, Hodges and Richardson<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
focused on the functional importance of the transversus abdominis and multifidus in lumbar
instability. With regard to the two exercises, there have been many studies comparing
different muscle activities through EMG of superficial muscles (external obliques, rectus
abdominis) and deep muscles (transverse abdominis, internal obliques), but not many have
compared the cross-sectional changes in the superficial muscles with those in the deep
muscles. Therefore, this study attempted to determine which exercise is more efficient by
comparing cross-sectional areas of abdominal muscles such as the transverse abdominis,
internal obliques, external obliques, and rectus abdominis through CT image analysis after
applying the hollowing and bracing exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects of this study were 30 healthy female adults in their 30s to 40s. None of the

60-minute sessions of the exercise per week for six weeks. As a pretest, cross-sectional
areas of superficial and deep muscles such as the transverse abdominis, internal obliques,

was performed for 10 minutes, the main exercise was performed for 40 minutes. Each item in
the exercise was performed 20 times, each taking 15 seconds. This was repeated two times.
As a cool-down exercise after the main exercise, 10 minutes of stretching was done,
thereby making each session 60 minutes in length. <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table"> 3</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Bracing exercise program</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contents</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Abdominal bracing (1)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Breathe in and out.

Stabilization exercises consisting of hollowing and bracing exercises, which are the
opposite of each other, have shown different results in previous studies on exercise. For
instance, Grenier and McGill<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> claimed
that a bracing exercise showed better results than a hollowing exercise, whereas Richardson
et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> claimed that a hollowing

the effects of hollowing and bracing exercises on the cross-sectional areas of abdominis
muscles.</p><p>Allison et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> found a significant
difference in transverse abdominis muscle activity between hollowing and bracing groups. In
their study of muscle activity in the abdomen, Bjerkefors et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that stabilization exercises including a hollowing
exercise resulted in higher EMG activity in the transverse abdominis. In their study on
transverse abdominis activity, Urquhart et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that hollowing exercises resulted in more significant
improvements than bracing exercises. That is, during a hollowing exercise, abdominis muscles
such as the rectus abdominis, internal obliques, and external obliques showed no difference
in muscle activity, but the transverse abdominis showed significant improvements in
activation independently. The present study also showed that after applying the two
exercises, the cross-sectional muscle area of the right transverse abdominis showed a
significant difference between the two groups, and significant changes in the left and right
transverse abdominis were shown within the group after the hollowing exercise. This finding
proves that hollowing exercises can selectively and independently contract the transverse
abdominis, which is a deep abdominal muscle.</p><p>With regard to rectus abdominis activity, Allison et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> found no difference between the two groups. In their study on
abdominal muscle activity, Bjerkefors et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that a hollowing exercise caused single contractions
of the transverse abdominis because it did not act on the rectus abdominis. Urquhart et
al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> also showed no between-group
difference in rectus abdominis activity, which is similar to previous studies. However, the
cross-sectional area of the left rectus abdominis showed a significant within-group
difference in both groups, indicating that the hollowing exercise was also related to
contraction of the rectus abdominis, and the bracing exercise (a plank exercise) caused
co-contraction of the entire trunk muscle.</p><p>In their study on muscle activity, Urquhart et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> showed no significant difference in internal oblique activity
between subjects performing bracing versus hollowing exercises, but the bracing group had
higher muscle activity than the hollowing group in the external oblique, showing a
significant difference. In the present study, the cross-sectional muscle area of the left
internal oblique and both external obliques showed significant improvement in both groups.
Also, with regard to changes in cross-sectional muscle area within groups, the bracing group
only showed significant improvement in both internal obliques and both external obliques.
Thus, the plank exercise involved co-contraction of the entire abdominal muscles, and the
side bridge exercise acted on the internal and external obliques, thereby increasing the
cross-sectional muscle area.</p><p>Summarizing the above results, performing bracing exercises, which can contract both deep
and superficial muscles entirely, rather than performing hollowing exercises, which only
contract deep muscles independently, is more effective for activating the abdominal muscles.
One limitation of this study, however, is that we were not able to control subjects&#x02019;
physical activities outside of the exercise programs. Moreover, the multifidus and erector
spinae were not compared in the comparison of cross-sectional areas, and these and other
muscles will be addressed in a future study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Norris</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Spinal stabilisation: 5.
