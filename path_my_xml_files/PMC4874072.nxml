The safety and efficacy of drugs like dexmedetomidine and neostigmine as epidural medications have been sparsely investigated.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was performed in 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II patients who required lower limb surgeries of &#x02264;3 h duration. The epidural drug was administered at the end of surgery with patients randomized into three groups. Group I, II and III received 6 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine alone, with 1 ug/kg of neostigmine and with 0.5 ug/kg of dexmedetomidine + 1 ug/kg of neostigmine, respectively. The patients were prescribed 50 mg tramadol intravenous as rescue analgesic. Patients were assessed for hemodynamic parameters, pain scores, duration of analgesia, rescue analgesic requirements and the incidence of side-effects over the next 10 h. Data was analyzed using SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version 17.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Patients in Group III had significantly longer mean duration of analgesia (273.5 min) compared to Group II (176.25 min) and Group I (144 min). There was increased requirement of fluids to maintain blood pressures in Group III. Neostigmine did not cause significant incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Epidurally administered dexmedetomidine and neostigmine exhibit synergism in analgesic action.

Higher the volume and concentration, greater will be the incidence of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. Opioids as additives extend postoperative pain relief along with improving the quality of analgesia, but they result in urinary retention, sedation and pruritis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Nonopioids such as clonidine, ketamine, neostigmine, tramadol, midazolam and dexmedetomidine have been evaluated as epidural adjuvants.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Epidural neostigmine has been researched in doses ranging from 1 to 10 ug/kg.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The major drawback with neostigmine is a high incidence of nausea and vomiting. Dexmedetomidine as epidural adjuvant (1-2 ug/kg) exhibited good sensory analgesia in clinical trials. However, there have been conflicting evidence regarding drug-induced bradycardia and hypotension.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Because of the adverse effects, neostigmine and dexmedetomidine are not frequently used as neuraxial adjuvants by anesthesiologists. The effects are dose-dependent, and hence we presumed that combining the two drugs at low doses can effectively potentiate the analgesia without increasing the incidence of side-effects.</p><p>The present study was conceptualized to study the combined analgesic profile of dexmedetomidine with neostigmine compared to neostigmine alone. The analgesic synergism was evaluated for adverse effects and hemodynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>Sixty patients undergoing lower limb procedures, mainly hemiarthroplasty, dynamic hip screw, interlocking nail femur/tibia and malleolar fixation, between 18 and 50 years of age and American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical Status I and II were selected for the study. The study was approved by Institute Ethics Committee. The enrolled patients were explained about postoperative pain relief technique and written informed consent for epidural catheter placement and participation was obtained. Patients who refused participation, had moderate to severe cardiac, renal, pulmonary or neurological diseases, significant scoliosis or kyphosis, morbidly obese or had coagulopathy were excluded from the study. Randomization was achieved by applying Microsoft excel random sequence and results were sealed in envelope.</p><p>The patients were assigned to three groups:</p><p>Group I: 6 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine.</p><p>Group II: 6 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine + 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of neostigmine.</p><p>Group III: 6 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine + 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of neostigmine + 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Neostigmine is commercially available in 0.5 mg/mL concentration whereas dexmedetomidine is available as 0.1 mg/mL. Insulin syringe (40 units = 1 mL) was used for loading the required dose of study drugs, and this was added to 10 mL syringe containing 6 mL of bupivacaine. The markings on the syringe were concealed by a white plaster tape to ensure blinding. All patients were premedicated with Alprazolam 0.25 mg and Ranitidine 150 mg a night before and morning of surgery. Venous access was secured and Ringer lactate was started as coloading infusion. ASA prescribed monitoring was started and continued throughout the surgery.</p><p>Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was performed (Portex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> CSEcure&#x000e4;, SIMS Portex Inc) in L2-L3 or L3-L4 interspace with needle through needle technique in all patients in sitting a position. 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric Bupivacaine with 25 mcg of fentanyl was deposited in the subarachnoid space. A catheter length of 3-4 cm was left in the epidural space and the catheter fixation was secured with Lockit epidural fixator device. One hour into surgery, epidural was activated with 3 ml of 2% lignocaine in all patients. At the end of surgery, patients were given epidural medication according to the group assigned and shifted to the postoperative ward after 15 min. The primary investigator was blinded to the contents of epidural drug syringe.</p><p>Duration of sensory analgesia, hemodynamics, Bromage scores,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Visual analog scale (VAS) (zero for no pain to 10 for unbearable pain), sedation scores, nausea and vomiting were recorded after epidural injection and then hourly up to 10 h. Good pain relief was defined as VAS score &#x02264;4. Once this score was reached, rescue analgesic (Injection Tramadol 50 mg intravenous [IV]) was administered and an epidural patient-controlled analgesia pump (elastomeric infusion pump, Royal Fornia Medical Equipment Co., Ltd.) containing 0.125% bupivacaine with 2 ug/ml fentanyl was started at 5 ml/h (fixed dose, continuous infusion with no top up doses). The total dose of tramadol allowed in our study was 4 mg/kg/24 h. Bradycardia was defined as heart rate (HR) &#x0003c;50 bpm and blood pressures (BP) &#x0003c;20% of baseline (at the time of administration of epidural study drug) was hypotension requiring colloid boluses. The colloid chosen was voluven (6% hetastarch, fresenious kabi) as 100 ml bolus for managing hypotension.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size was determined based on estimates of the primary efficacy end point of &#x0201c;time to first patient request&#x0201d; for rescue analgesia, assuming a population mean difference of 2 h and a standard deviation (SD) of 2 h for all groups. Sixteen patients per group was considered necessary to detect statistical significance (&#x003b1; = 0.05) with power (1-&#x003b2;) = 80%.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package SPSS version 17.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical comparisons among the three groups were performed by using a two-way analysis of variance with subsequent comparisons of pairwise differences, where appropriate. VAS pain scores were analyzed by using repeated-measures analysis of variance with post hoc analysis using Tukey's post-hoc test. The proportion of patients that requested rescue medication was analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.

Our patients in Group II have received lower dose and hence, sedation was not proven to be statistically significant.</p><p>Hemodynamic profile-patients in Group I and II exhibited stable HR and BP than Group III patients. Neuraxial neostigmine increases sympathetic outflow, thus counteracts the hypotension caused by bupivacaine and bradycardia caused by alpha 2 agonists.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Dexmedetomidine epidurally causes sympatholysis, thereby decreasing HR and BP in a dose-dependent manner, documented in a systematic review and metaanalysis by Wu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Adverse effects profile-cholinergic gastrointestinal (GI) side effects are the major problems with neostigmine.
