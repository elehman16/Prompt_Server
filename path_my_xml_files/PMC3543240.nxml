In this study, the CCBD was integrated into a system that enables real-time data acquisition and the monitoring of the parameters relevant to the biophysics of dilation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Dilation dynamics directly depend on the flow of an incompressible fluid into the BD, which is an easily controllable parameter. Because it is an incompressible working fluid, distilled water was used with the addition of nonionic contrast medium (Ultravist-300; Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), which enabled the visual monitoring of dilation using a digital subtraction apparatus for angiography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><p>Incompressible fluid from the hydraulic cylinder is pumped to the BD via a flexible hose (hose) and one-way valve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Fluid flow is controlled by an electric motor that, via a spiral spindles/nut system, provides constant speed of the hydraulic cylinder piston and consequently constant fluid flow. The actual position of the hydraulic cylinder piston and the fluid pressure are monitored by displacement and pressure transducers. The unit for measurement and control collects signals from those two transducers. The pressure gauge is used for visual control of the current fluid pressure, while the pressure reduction valve represents a safety element. After finalization of the dilatation procedure, the choke valve is opened by remote command, which results in draining of fluid from the BD. Then the BD could be easily extracted from the cervical canal. Dilatation duration and maximum pressure in the BD represents parameters assigned by a PC-controlled unit for measurement and control. Those parameters could be monitored in real-time parameters by PC and appropriate acquisition software, which enable full controllability of the cervical canal dilatation process (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Histological evaluation</title><p>Tissue material for the histological evaluation of cervical damage was obtained from the endocervical mucosa by single curettage (Novac Curette, CooperSurgical, Trumbull, Connecticut, USA) before and after dilation using the HeD or CCBD.

The maximal recorded pressure in the BD during dilation was significantly lower than the test pressure for BD consistency and endurance.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative analysis of biophysical phenomena during cervical dilation by HeD and CCBD</title><p>The basic biophysical models of cervical canal dilation using the HeD and CCBD are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Under the action of an external force <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> (the force required to dilate the cervix at each stage of HeD cervical dilation), the HeD (with diameter <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) moves at speed <italic>v</italic> through the cervical canal (with length <italic>L</italic>). The external force <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> must overcome the resulting sum of the forces that appear in the direction of the moving HeD. The HeD motion leads to changes in the geometry of the cervical canal. In various ways, the tissue opposes these geometrical changes upon contact with the HeD, which is characterized by the pressure distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>). Because a relatively small zone of the cervical canal is affected by dilation at this time, high contact loads are produced in the tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). A detailed overview of the basic forces involved in the contact zones between the HeD and cervical canal tissue during dilation indicates that only one component of the applied external force is responsible for dilation. None of the other forces directly participate in dilation and may lead to a large number of side effects.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Biophysical phenomena during cervical dilations.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) Biophysical model of Hegar dilator (HeD) dilatation.

Another significant problem with current cervical dilators is a lack of control over the rate of dilation &#x02013; extremely rapid cervical dilation often leads to cervical laceration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>All of the aforementioned risk factors (the provider's inexperience, the lack of control over the rate of dilation, differences in uterine position and cervical immaturity) could be overcome using the CCBD. Dilation with the CCBD is fully controllable, safe and independent of the provider's experience. In the case of incompressible fluid BD breakage (which did not happen during our study), the leakage of only a few drops of fluid results in a sudden pressure drop in the BD; therefore, the risk for patient injury in this case is almost non-existent. Both the trainees and the experienced providers could use the CCBD without the risk for cervical laceration or uterine perforation. It is noteworthy that CCBD cervical dilation was successfully performed on all of the patients, regardless of the patient's age, cervical stenosis, uterine position and previous obstetric history. In addition, no side effects were observed during the procedure or after successful cervical dilation. However, it is important to note that due to limited number of patients enrolled in this study, a large prospective study should be conducted in order to confirm the effectiveness of CCBD dilation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We suggest the CCBD as a replacement for mechanical dilators, with the main purpose of preventing uterine and cervical injury during cervical dilation. Depending on the opinion of the physician, the CCBD could be used alone or in combination with cervical priming agents.</p><p>In the end, it should be emphasized that CCBD dilation is a new, original, non-invasive, fully controllable and safe technique for cervical dilation. However, because of the limited number of patients enrolled in this study, a large prospective study should be conducted in the future to further confirm the effectiveness of CCBD dilation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BD: Balloon dilator; CCBD: Continuous controllable balloon dilator; H&#x00026;E: Hematoxylin and eosin; HeD: Hegar dilator.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors state that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SA was aninventor of the CCBD, designer of the study and principal investigator, and was responsible for data collection and interpretation, manuscript editing and final approval of the manuscript.
