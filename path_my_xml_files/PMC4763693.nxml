</p></boxed-text><p>Melasma is an acquired disorder of skin pigmentation that is more common in people of Oriental, Hispanic, and Indo-Chinese origin and affects females much more commonly than males.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Melasma often causes a significant psychological impact with a negative effect on quality of life and emotional well-being.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] As with other skin disorders, valid and reliable scoring systems are needed to assess the severity of disease and efficacy of therapeutic options in melasma. Moreover as in other diseases, this scoring system should not only be able to assess the severity, but it should also aid us in predicting the prognosis and choosing the right treatment option.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) is the most widely used outcome measure in clinical studies on melasma.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] MASI score, proposed by Kimbrough-Green <italic>et al</italic>. in 1994, has been devised on the pattern of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Interestingly, MASI uses an almost similar formula for the face as is used for the whole body in PASI score. Moreover, the three variables of area, induration, and scaling in PASI are replaced by area, pigmentation, and homogeneity in MASI score.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] While the variables of &#x0201c;pigmentation&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;area of involvement&#x0201d; are certainly important to consider in melasma the fallacy lies in how these variables are applied in MASI.</p><p>If we take some examples like in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, patients of melasma with different intensities of pigmentation and area of involvement of face are shown. As clinicians, we appreciate that patients with more severe pigmentation not only need a more potent and prolonged treatment, but also have worse prognosis than the other cases. However, if we score these 4 patients with MASI, we can see that MASI score of the patients on the left [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>] comes out to be less than that of the patients on the right [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>] in spite of the former group having practically more severe disease than the latter. The reason for this is that the &#x0201c;area of involvement&#x0201d; gets a much higher share in calculating MASI as compared with the intensity of pigmentation and this constitutes one of the most important fallacies of MASI score.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>MASI scores do not represent the severity of disease correctly.

A 10% or 20% difference in the body surface area involvement between 2 patients of psoriasis carries a lot of significance for the treating physician with regard to overall prognosis and choice of treatment.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The same difference in percentage area involvement of face between patients of melasma does not hold such significance.</p><p>Finally, we appreciate that the severity of pigmentation in melasma is usually uniform over all the affected areas of the face. Moreover, if there is a nonuniform pigmentation or response to treatment, it is usually the central part of the face, especially the nose that is more pigmented or less responsive to treatment than other involved areas [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. However, nose is included as a part of the &#x0201c;cheek&#x0201d; in MASI scoring. This makes it impossible to score the pigmentation or response to treatment on the nose separately from that of the cheeks.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(a) Melasma with more severe pigmentation on nose as compared with other involved areas.

All the participating dermatologists had a thorough knowledge of MASI scoring and were involved with the routine treatment of melasma patients.</p><p>On a single day, all the enrolled patients were called to the institute and were individually examined by each of the trained dermatologists randomly in separate examination rooms. In the first round, all the raters calculated mMASI and MSI scores for each of the enrolled patients. Score sheets from all the raters were collected at the end of the first round. In the next round, every sixth patient in each rater's series was sent for re-examination, and both mMASI and MSI scores were calculated again in each of these cases. Thus, each rater examined and calculated mMASI and MSI scores for five patients in the next round.</p><p>After calculation of mMASI and MSI scores all the patients were photographed digitally in the front, left, and right side profiles using standard light settings. Each patient was then objectively assessed by means of a narrowband reflectance spectrophotometer (Mexameter<sup>R</sup> Courage and Khazaka, Germany) to quantify the degree of melanin pigmentation present on the affected areas of the face. All the affected areas like the forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin were assessed separately by the mexameter and the difference between involved and uninvolved areas was noted.

Ninety-five percent confidence interval (95% CI) for ICC was also reported to allow for comparison of ICC for mMASI versus MSI. For assessing the intra-rater reliability of mMASI and MSI scores, the values obtained from each of the raters during the 2<sup>nd</sup> round of examination were compared with the corresponding values from initial scoring by again using ICC (2,1).</p><p>Next, the validity of MSI and mMASI scores was tested by comparing the scores from individual raters with the objective values from the mexameter and ImageJ software.

MASI is the predominant outcome measure that has been employed in melasma over the last 2 decades to assess the severity of disease and response to treatment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Surprisingly, there is only a single clinical study available in the world literature on the subject of validity and reliability of MASI as a scoring system in melasma.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The authors of this study, while validating the score as a whole, found a high degree of intra- and inter-rater variability in rating the homogeneity component of MASI score and proposed mMASI score without this variable.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>MASI has been designed primarily on the basis of a scoring system used for psoriasis, and this approach has led to certain fallacies in MASI. Mostly, the choice between topical and systemic treatment in psoriasis is primarily made on the basis of percentage surface area of body involved. The same does not apply in melasma where it is not the area of involvement but the intensity of pigmentation that determines our choice of treatment. Algorithms published till date for treatment of melasma do not normally mention &#x02018;area of involvement&#x02019; as a criterion for selecting the appropriate treatment option.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In fact a simple easy to use scale known as Melasma Severity Scale (MSS) classifies melasma into three grades on the basis of the intensity of pigmentation alone. This scale scores melasma from 0 (none) to 3 (severe melasma) primarily on the basis of intensity/type of pigmentation.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In MASI scoring the &#x0201c;area of involvement&#x0201d; is calculated from 0 to 6 while the intensity and homogeneity of pigmentation are scored from 0 to 4 only. This approach provides more weightage to the variable of &#x0201c;area of involvement&#x0201d; in comparison with the other 2 variables, and this leads to many errors as pointed out in the earlier sections of this paper. A person with a really severe pigmentation involving a smaller area of face gets a lower MASI score as compared with a person who has a really mild pigmentation involving a relatively larger part of the face. This does not correlate with the clinical judgment of the burden of the disease.</p><p>To overcome the above-mentioned limitations of MASI, we have proposed a more practical MSI score for assessing the severity of melasma. Here, the score for the area of involvement is multiplied with the square of pigmentation score to give the latter variable its due importance in assessing disease severity. Secondly, the assessment is performed separately on the &#x0201c;nose&#x0201d; to take care of the nonuniform nature of pigmentation in some cases of melasma.</p><p>In assessing the area of involvement of face, we followed a slightly different scoring system than that used in MASI. While MASI uses a score from 0 to 6 for the area of involvement in different regions of the face, we propose a simpler score from 0 to 4 for the area involved. This modification, in addition to making scoring easier, has a definite idea behind it as well. Subjectively, if the area involved is about 1/10<sup>th</sup> (&#x02264;10%) the score given is 1 while if the area involved is assessed subjectively to be more than 1/10<sup>th</sup> but &#x0003c; 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the face the score given is 2 (11&#x02013;30%). Similarly, if the investigator feels that the area of involvement is between 1/3<sup>rd</sup> and 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the face, the score becomes 3 (31-60%). And finally, more than 2/3<sup>rd</sup> involvement of the face gets a score of 4 (&#x0003e;60%) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>While calculating mMASI and MSI scores in the present series of patients, we did find it difficult to give a single score to the &#x02018;severity of pigmentation&#x02019; to all the involved areas in 16.7% cases because there was a clear-cut difference in the intensity of pigmentation on the nose in comparison with the cheeks [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. This limitation is again taken care of by using MSI score as the &#x0201c;nose&#x0201d; area is assessed separately from the rest of the face.</p><p>In case of melasma, a positive response to treatment is most commonly seen as a gradual reduction in the intensity of pigmentation over all the areas of face simultaneously. Even a small reduction in pigment intensity is taken as an indicator of a positive response to treatment. However, because of the overdependence on the &#x0201c;area&#x0201d; variable MASI or mMASI score is not able to reflect this positive response to treatment sensitively. On the other hand, even a small change in the intensity of pigmentation alters the MSI score much more than MASI.</p><p>In this clinical study, we have tried to test the validity and reliability of the proposed MSI score and compare the same with mMASI score. Statistical analysis of our results indicates that MSI is not only a more practical score, but is also more reliable than mMASI score. The intra-rater reliability for MSI was better than that for mMASI in this study as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. Additionally, the validity of MSI score was also found to be superior to that of mMASI when both these scores were correlated with objective data from mexameter and ImageJ software readings.</p><p>An important modification that can make MSI score even easier to calculate in case the severity of pigmentation is uniform over all the affected areas of the face is just to multiply the total area of involvement of the whole face with the square of intensity of pigmentation as given below:</p><p>MSI = a &#x000d7; p<sup>2</sup> where &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; stands for the percentage area of involvement of the whole face.</p><p>We firmly believe that MSI score is a more practical and meaningful scoring system in comparison with MASI for assessment of melasma and for monitoring its response to treatment. Calculating MSI is a much easier and simpler task and can be easily performed in routine OPD practice [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Advantages of MSI over MASI and mMASI</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJD-61-39-g010"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-3"><title/><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study was performed in a single ethnic population with a limited number of patients and skin phototypes.
