SMART compares saline (0.9% sodium chloride) with balanced crystalloids (clinician&#x02019;s choice of lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution or Plasma-Lyte A&#x000ae;). Each intensive care unit is assigned to provide either saline or balanced crystalloids each month, with the assigned crystalloid alternating monthly over the course of the trial. All adults admitted to participating intensive care units during the study period are enrolled and followed until hospital discharge or 30&#x000a0;days after enrollment. The anticipated enrollment is approximately 14,000 patients. The primary outcome is Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30&#x000a0;days&#x02014;the composite of in-hospital death, receipt of new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (discharge creatinine &#x02265;200% of baseline creatinine). Secondary clinical outcomes include in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, vasopressor-free days, and renal replacement therapy-free days. Secondary renal outcomes include new renal replacement therapy receipt, persistent renal dysfunction, and incidence of stage 2 or higher acute kidney injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This ongoing pragmatic trial will provide the largest and most comprehensive comparison to date of clinical outcomes with saline versus balanced crystalloids among critically ill adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>For logistical reasons, SMART was prospectively registered separately for the medical ICU (SMART-MED; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02444988">NCT02444988</ext-link>; registered on 11 May 2015; date of first patient enrollment: 1 June 2015) and the nonmedical ICUs (SMART-SURG; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02547779">NCT02547779</ext-link>; registered on 9 September 2015; date of first patient enrollment: 1 October 2015).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-017-1871-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intravenous fluids</kwd><kwd>Crystalloid</kwd><kwd>Saline</kwd><kwd>Renal failure</kwd><kwd>Pragmatic trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR000445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernard</surname><given-names>Gordon R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K23GM110469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Self</surname><given-names>Wesley H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The administration of intravenous (IV) fluid is ubiquitous in the care of the critically ill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Globally, 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) is the most common resuscitation fluid, but recent data have associated saline with hyperchloremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], metabolic acidosis and renal vasoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although several observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a before-and-after trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] suggested increased rates of AKI, RRT receipt, and death with saline compared with balanced crystalloids, researchers in two recent randomized pilot trials found no difference between crystalloids in any patient outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The number of patients enrolled in these pilot trials was insufficient to exclude small but potentially clinically meaningful differences in patient outcomes between saline and balanced crystalloids. Thus, the optimal choice of isotonic crystalloid for the treatment of critically ill adults remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To determine the impact of balanced crystalloids compared with saline on clinical outcomes among critically ill adults, a large, prospective, controlled trial is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present trial is to compare the effect of balanced crystalloids with that of saline on the development of major adverse kidney events (the composite of death, new RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction) among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of balanced crystalloids with that of saline on laboratory values (serum chloride, serum bicarbonate, serum creatinine), organ injury (AKI, receipt of RRT), and additional clinical outcomes (ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, in-hospital mortality). We hypothesize that use of balanced crystalloids among ICU patients will reduce the incidence of major adverse kidney events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This manuscript was written in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (see SPIRIT checklist in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist.

</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) is a prospective, unblinded, pragmatic, cluster-level allocation, cluster-level crossover trial being conducted between 1 June 2015 and 30 April 2017 in five ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN, USA. SMART compares saline (0.9% sodium chloride) with balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution and Plasma-Lyte A&#x000ae; [Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA]) with regard to the primary outcome of Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30&#x000a0;days (MAKE30)&#x02014;the composite of in-hospital death, receipt of new RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction (discharge creatinine &#x02265;200% of baseline creatinine). Consistent with the concept of a pragmatic clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the eligibility criteria are broad, the sample size is large, and study procedures are embedded into routine care and executed by clinical personnel. The trial was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) with waiver of informed consent (IRB 141349). The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov prior to initiation of patient enrollment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02444988, NCT02547779). An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) is monitoring the progress and safety of the trial. The trial is investigator-initiated with funding provided by the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research through a Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (UL1 TR000445).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study sites and period</title><p>SMART is being conducted in five academic ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center: a 34-bed medical ICU, a 22-bed neurological and neurosurgical ICU, a 27-bed cardiovascular ICU, a 31-bed trauma ICU, and a 22-bed surgical ICU. Participating ICUs began enrollment sequentially over the first year of the study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Each ICU will enroll patients for at least 12&#x000a0;months and will enroll participants for an equal number of saline and balanced crystalloid months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Population</title><p>All adults (aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) admitted to a participating ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center during the study period are enrolled at the time of ICU admission. Enrolled patients who are discharged from the hospital are eligible again if they are admitted to a participating ICU again during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Consent</title><p>Saline, lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution, and Plasma-Lyte A&#x000ae; are all IV crystalloids currently used in the routine care of patients admitted to the ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Currently, no high-quality data suggest that choice of crystalloid affects clinical outcomes among critically ill adults. During the SMART trial, each time a study crystalloid is ordered, the study confirms that the treating clinician does not feel that a specific&#x000a0;study crystalloid is required for the safe treatment of that specific patient at that specific point in time (see <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Study interventions</xref> section below). The trial is felt to pose minimal risk because (1) exposure to the study crystalloids occurs only for patients whose treating clinician has already decided to administer an IV crystalloid, (2) all of the crystalloid solutions examined are already used in routine practice in the study environment, (3) no definitive prior data suggest clinical outcomes are better with one crystalloid relative to the others, and (4) the study confirms with every crystalloid order that the treating clinician does not feel any one crystalloid type is required for safe treatment of the patient. Given the minimal risk, the focus of the study on crystalloid use at an ICU level, as well as the impracticability of consenting each patient admitted to each ICU prior to the first administration of crystalloid, a waiver of informed consent was granted by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center IRB (IRB 141349).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization and allocation</title><p>During each month of the study, each ICU is assigned to either saline or balanced crystalloids. So that each ICU would experience an equal number of months assigned to saline and balanced crystalloids while minimizing monthly imbalances in the hospital&#x02019;s overall use of each crystalloid, we generated two sequences of study group assignment: (1) saline during odd-numbered months and balanced crystalloid during even-numbered months or (2) balanced crystalloid during odd-numbered months and saline during even-numbered months. We planned for three ICUs to be assigned to one sequence and the remaining two ICUs to the opposite sequence. To facilitate the early administration of the assigned crystalloid in the ED and operating room prior to the patient&#x02019;s physical arrival in the ICU, a single, computer-generated, simple randomization was performed in which the three ICUs that admit the majority of patients from the ED (medical ICU, trauma ICU, and surgical ICU) were randomized en bloc to one sequence of crystalloid group assignments, and the two ICUs that admit the majority of patients from the operating room (neurological ICU and cardiac ICU) were randomized en bloc to the opposite sequence of crystalloid group assignments (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Concealment and blinding</title><p>Because available laboratory values overtly reflect the crystalloid being used, and because prior studies have shown high levels of provider awareness of crystalloid assignment despite attempts at blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], patients, clinicians, and investigators are not blinded to crystalloid assignment. All study data, including the objective primary outcome, will be electronically extracted from the medical record in an automated manner unaffected by study group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study interventions</title><p>Study protocol determines only the choice of IV isotonic crystalloid: 0.9% sodium chloride (saline group) versus the treating clinician&#x02019;s preference of lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution or Plasma-Lyte A&#x000ae; (balanced crystalloid group). The composition of each crystalloid solution is displayed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1. Lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution and Plasma-Lyte A&#x000ae; are the balanced crystalloids commonly available in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution and Plasma-Lyte A&#x000ae; both offer a significantly lower chloride content than saline, but other minor differences in composition lead some clinicians to prefer one balanced crystalloid or the other for particular patients; for example, some clinicians prefer Plasma-Lyte A&#x000ae; over lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution for patients receiving blood transfusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Allowing clinicians to select either lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution or Plasma-Lyte A&#x000ae; when a balanced crystalloid is assigned is anticipated to improve compliance with balanced crystalloid assignment and emulate how balanced crystalloids are used in practice while maintaining relevant comparator groups consisting of crystalloid with a higher chloride content (saline) versus crystalloids with a lower chloride content (lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution and Plasma-Lyte A&#x000ae;). Decisions regarding crystalloid rate, volume, and additive content are deferred to treating clinicians.</p><p>Delivery of the assigned crystalloid to patients occurs via interventions in pharmacy supply and clinician order entry. Each month, the dispensing cabinets within the ICUs are stocked with 1000-ml bags of the assigned crystalloid. Additionally, any order for IV crystalloid for a patient located in a study ICU triggers an advisor application within the electronic order entry system. The advisor application informs providers about the study, asks about relative contraindications to the assigned crystalloid, and (if relative contraindications are not present) guides providers to order the assigned crystalloid. Accepted relative contraindications for patients assigned to balanced crystalloid include hyperkalemia and brain injury. The severity of hyperkalemia and brain injury at which saline will be used in favor of balanced crystalloids is determined by the treating clinician. The nonassigned crystalloid is also made available via the pharmacy if a formal statement is submitted that the attending physician feels the nonassigned crystalloid is required for the safe treatment of a specific patient.</p><p>Although the study is focused on crystalloid use in the ICU, crystalloid administration prior to ICU admission in the emergency department (ED) or operating room may introduce contamination and limit separation between study arms. Therefore, between 1 January 2016 and 30 April 2017, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center ED is coordinating their crystalloid use with the medical, surgical, and trauma ICUs such that patients admitted to those units from the ED begin receiving the assigned crystalloid during evaluation and management in the ED (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02614040). Clinical outcomes of patients treated with study crystalloids in the ED and hospitalized outside the ICU will be recorded and reported separately. Similarly, to the extent that it is logistically feasible, for patients identified in the operating room as coming from or being admitted to one of the participating ICUs, the request is made that they receive the fluid assigned to the corresponding ICU during their operative procedure. Fluid administered prior to enrollment by the emergency medical system and outside hospitals, as well as fluid administered after discharge from the ICU, is not controlled by the study.</p><p>Each day patients receive the crystalloid to which their ICU is currently assigned. The necessity that an IV crystalloid be clinically available at all times precluded the use of washout periods, and patients who remain in the ICU through a crossover (i.e., from one calendar month to another) may potentially be exposed to both types of crystalloid. Although this introduces the potential for contamination of study groups, in a pilot trial at the same institution, the total volume of nonassigned crystalloid administered because of the lack of a washout period was &#x0003c;125&#x000a0;ml per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As described in the Statistical analysis section below, patients will be analyzed in the group to which they were assigned at the time of study enrollment in an intention-to-treat fashion. For example, a patient admitted to an ICU during a month assigned to saline will be analyzed in the saline group even if that patient remains in the ICU after the ICU switches assignment to balanced crystalloids.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data collection</title><p>In this pragmatic trial, we are using data collected in routine clinical care and electronically extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). All data are stored confidentially in an institutional patient data management system. Data collected include prestudy renal function; demographic characteristics, admitting location and diagnosis, and severity of illness at enrollment; receipt of IV crystalloids, other fluids, and blood products; serum electrolyte and creatinine values; receipt of RRT, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressors; and vital status and serum creatinine at hospital discharge. Electronic extraction of these data from the EHR has previously been validated against the reference standard of two-physician manual chart review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For all patients who receive new RRT, study personnel will perform manual chart review to confirm the absence of prior RRT and identify the indication for RRT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients meeting one or more criteria for MAKE30: in-hospital mortality, receipt of new RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction defined as a final inpatient serum creatinine value &#x02265;200% of baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In-hospital mortality will be defined as death due to any cause prior to hospital discharge censored at 30&#x000a0;days after ICU admission. Receipt of new RRT will be defined as receipt of any modality of RRT between ICU admission and the first of hospital discharge or 30&#x000a0;days among patients not known to have received RRT prior to ICU admission. Persistent renal dysfunction will be defined as a final serum creatinine value before hospital discharge (censored at 30&#x000a0;days after enrollment) &#x02265;200% of the baseline creatinine value. The value for baseline serum creatinine will be determined using a previously described hierarchical approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The lowest serum creatinine between 12&#x000a0;months and 24&#x000a0;h prior to hospital admission will be used when available. If no such creatinine value is available, the lowest creatinine value between 24&#x000a0;h prior to hospital admission and the time of ICU admission will be used. If no creatinine value is available between 12&#x000a0;months prior to hospital admission and the time of ICU admission, a baseline creatinine value will be estimated using a previously described formula [creatinine&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.74&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.2 (if female)&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.08 (if African American)&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.003&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;age (in years)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Enrollment of 14,000 patients will provide 90% power at an &#x003b1; level of 0.05 to detect an absolute difference between the saline and balanced crystalloid groups in MAKE30 of 1.9%, as well as a relative risk reduction of 12%, which is comparable to the 12% relative risk reduction for in-hospital mortality reported in a recent pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (additional details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data and safety monitoring board and interim analysis</title><p>A DSMB was appointed to oversee the conduct of the trial and review two interim analyses.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>Upon completion, SMART will provide the most comprehensive data to date on the comparative effects of saline versus balanced crystalloids among critically ill adults. Given that isotonic crystalloid administration represents the most common intervention provided to hospitalized patients, saline and balanced crystalloids are the only available options for isotonic crystalloid administration, and also that the relationship between saline and AKI and death remains unclear, the results of SMART will have immediate implications for the care of a broad population of acutely ill patients. Results showing superior clinical outcomes in the balanced crystalloids group would provide compelling evidence that balanced solutions should be considered the preferred isotonic crystalloid for most acutely ill patients. Better clinical outcomes with saline would cement 0.9% sodium chloride as the first-line isotonic IV fluid and end the current debate about optimal crystalloid composition. In this comparative effectiveness trial of thousands of critically ill adults, a finding of no difference between groups would still have important implications for clinical care and future research. In a trial powered to detect absolute risk reductions as small as 2% in clinical outcomes, no difference between groups would imply that the effect of crystalloid choice for the majority of ICU patients is minimal, and any future research would need to be focused on select subpopulations.</p><p>While designing SMART, we weighed the relative advantages and disadvantages of multiple study designs, including a blinded, patient-level randomized trial. A major challenge to controlled studies of fluid administration in critical illness is the ability to enroll patients prior to the period of highest fluid exposure. Because the majority of fluid is administered as part of resuscitation in the ED and during the first 12&#x000a0;h of ICU admission, we selected a cluster-level allocation design that would allow enrollment immediately upon presentation and coordination between study ICUs and the ED to maximize exposure to the assigned crystalloid and minimize exposure to the nonassigned crystalloid. By basing study group assignment at the unit level, we ensured delivery of the assigned crystalloid even among unstable patients for whom fluid was being administered immediately upon presentation, because the assigned crystalloid would be the fluid most readily available in the study unit. The enrollment of all adults admitted to the participating ICUs examines the effects of saline versus balanced crystalloids in a real-world clinical environment, improving the generalizability of the study findings. Coupling group assignment at the level of the ICU with relatively short periods (1&#x000a0;month) and frequent crossovers (at least 11 in each unit) balances baseline characteristics and cointerventions better than a simple cluster-randomized trial or before-and-after trial with the same number of units, decreasing confounding by seasonal change or trends in usual care over time. Although blinding of treating clinicians and study personnel to the assigned intervention would be ideal, researchers in a prior pilot trial of the same topic found high rates of provider awareness of crystalloid assignment despite blinding, perhaps owing to the overt effect of the study crystalloids on clinically available laboratory values such as serum chloride and bicarbonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Use of an objective, patient-centered primary outcome abstracted automatically from the EHR increases the pragmatic nature of the design and diminishes the risk of observer bias.</p><p>Several potential threats to the validity of our trial exist. Including all patients admitted to each study ICU may produce a patient population with limited average exposure to the study interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On the basis of our preliminary data from the same units prior to this study, however, we anticipate that more than 90% of enrolled patients will receive isotonic crystalloid and at least 25% of patients will receive more than 4&#x000a0;L of isotonic crystalloid, which is comparable to or greater than that received in prior positive ICU fluid trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Additionally, we have prespecified analyses to evaluate for a dose-response relationship between the volume of isotonic crystalloid administered and clinical outcomes with saline versus balanced crystalloid. Similarly, the broad enrollment criteria may produce a study population at relatively low risk for adverse clinical outcomes. The anticipated incidence of the primary outcome of 15%, however, is comparable to that of other large ICU fluid management trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Treating clinicians are aware of study group assignment, which may permit a treatment bias in which clinicians administer less isotonic crystalloid and/or more nonisotonic crystalloids when assigned to one of the fluid groups. For this reason, we will record and report use of not only isotonic crystalloid but also nonisotonic crystalloid, colloid, and blood products during the trial. Group assignment at the level of the cluster with multiple cluster-level crossovers introduces the possibility for intracluster correlation, interperiod correlation, and intracluster intraperiod correlation, which may confound the relationship between group assignment and clinical outcome. In preparatory analyses using data from more than 10,000 patients admitted in the 1&#x000a0;year prior to the trial, we found the effect of intracluster correlation to be minimized by the short periods and frequent crossovers and the effects of intraperiod correlation and intracluster intraperiod correlation to be small (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Supplemental methods). Our primary analysis uses a generalized linear mixed-effects model to account for these aspects of the study structure. In the absence of a washout period, there will be carryover of crystalloid administration from one group assignment into the other; however, on the basis of pilot data, we anticipate the volume of nonassigned crystalloid received as a result of carryover will be low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and we prespecify secondary analyses to address the effects of carryover. Finally, although MAKE30 is a recommended outcome for clinical trials involving AKI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], use of a composite outcome presents potential challenges. Unlike death and new receipt of RRT, whether persistent renal dysfunction on hospital discharge is a patient-centered outcome remains a point of discussion. Persistent renal dysfunction also relies on the availability of serum creatinine measurements at baseline and before hospital discharge, potentially requiring imputation of missing data for one component of the composite primary outcome. Perhaps most important, although death, new receipt of RRT, and persistent renal dysfunction are weighted equally in the MAKE30 composite outcome, they may not represent equivalent outcomes to patients or providers. To address this, we will provide data on the MAKE30 outcome overall and for each of its separate components.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>SMART is an ongoing, pragmatic, cluster-level allocation, cluster-level crossover trial that will compare saline to balanced crystalloids with regard to major adverse kidney events among critically ill adults.
