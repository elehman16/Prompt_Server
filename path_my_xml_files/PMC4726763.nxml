The primary safety endpoint was incidence of hepatotoxicity: alanine aminotransferase of greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or Hy's criteria (alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase greater than three times the ULN and total bilirubin more than twice the ULN) after treatment of the first episode of malaria and re-treatment (&#x02265;28 days after first treatment) with pyronaridine-artesunate. Pyronaridine-artesunate efficacy was compared with artemether-lumefantrine with the adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) in an intention-to-treat analysis. WANECAM is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://PACTR.org" id="interrefs10">PACTR.org</ext-link>, number PACTR201105000286876.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Following first treatment, 13 (1%) of 996 patients had hepatotoxicity (including one [&#x0003c;1%] possible Hy's law case) versus two (1%) of 311 patients on re-treatment (neither a Hy's law case). No evidence was found that pyronaridine-artesunate re-treatment increased safety risk based on laboratory values, reported adverse event frequencies, or electrocardiograph findings. For all first treatment or re-treatment episodes, pyronaridine-artesunate (n=673) day 28 crude ACPR was 92&#x000b7;7% (95% CI 91&#x000b7;0&#x02013;94&#x000b7;3) versus 80&#x000b7;4% (77&#x000b7;8&#x02013;83&#x000b7;0) for artemether-lumefantrine (n=671).

However, because only a few patients in the phase 3 studies were re-treated with pyronaridine-artesunate, it was unclear whether treatment of repeated malaria episodes would exacerbate increases in hepatic enzymes or lead to liver injury. Consequently, pyronaridine-artesunate use was restricted to a single treatment course in any patient. To permit wider access to this potentially valuable antimalarial drug, more data are needed on pyronaridine-artesunate safety and efficacy in patients re-treated for two or more malaria episodes.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>The lack of data for the safety and efficacy of re-treatment of malaria with newly available artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) has restricted their use. In phase 2/3 trials of pyronaridine-artesunate, transient increases in transaminases were noted with pyronaridine-artesunate in some patients after a single course of treatment. Whether treatment of repeated malaria episodes would exacerbate increases in hepatic enzymes or lead to liver injury was not clear. Thus, further data are needed on pyronaridine-artesunate safety and efficacy in patients re-treated for more than one malaria episode.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>The results from this substudy suggest that pyronaridine-artesunate re-treatment is well tolerated and that the safety and efficacy of the first malaria treatment episode is maintained with re-treatment of patients who have subsequent episodes of malaria.

The substudy analysis included patients enrolled between Oct 24, 2011, and Oct 31, 2013, at six health facilities in Mali (Sotuba, Kolle, and Bougoula-Hameau), Burkina Faso (Niankoloko and Bobo-Dioulasso), and Guinea (Maferenya).</p><p>Male or female patients (aged &#x02265;6 months and bodyweight &#x02265;5 kg) were eligible if they had acute uncomplicated microscopically confirmed <italic>P falciparum, Plasmodium malariae</italic>, or <italic>Plasmodium ovale</italic> malaria (&#x0003c;200&#x02008;000 parasites per &#x003bc;L blood) and fever or a history of fever. In the pyronaridine-artesunate group, eligibility criteria for age and bodyweight were modified in accordance with the planned reviews by the data safety monitoring board: at the start of the study, criteria for inclusion were age of at least 15 years and bodyweight of at least 24 kg; after 20 re-treatments, these criteria were revised to at least 2 years and at least 15 kg; after 40 re-treatments, these criteria were at least 6 months and at least 5 kg. For patients randomly allocated to receive artemether-lumefantrine, age (&#x02265;6 months) and bodyweight (&#x02265;5 kg) criteria remained unchanged.</p><p>Key exclusion criteria were complicated or severe malaria; severe vomiting or diarrhoea; history of clinically significant disease or disorders, including known viral hepatitis, known HIV infection, or alcohol abuse; hepatic or renal impairment; alanine aminotransferase concentration of more than twice the ULN; serum creatinine concentration of more than 1&#x000b7;5 times the ULN; anaemia (haemoglobin &#x0003c;70 g/L); or known hypersensitivity to the study drug. Women of childbearing potential had to have a negative pregnancy test, not be lactating, and not planning pregnancy for 42 days after treatment.</p><p>The WANECAM trial is being done in accordance with the good clinical practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Each participating centre's ethics committee or institutional review board approved the study protocol. Participants or their parent or guardian provided written informed consent plus assent from children able to understand the study.</p><p>Patients were re-treated with their allocated ACT if they presented with malaria at least 28 days after previous treatment. An alternative appropriate antimalarial drug (usually quinine) was used for any re-treatment if the patient had severe malaria; had parasitaemia recurrence before 28 days; had <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp parasites of more than 200&#x02008;000 per &#x003bc;L; had severe vomiting or diarrhoea; had alanine aminotransferase of more than twice the ULN; had serum creatinine of more than 1&#x000b7;5 times the ULN; had active hepatitis A, B, or C; had an ongoing severe adverse event; had arrhythmia or QTc prolongation (&#x0003e;450 ms) during previous treatment or at representation; was pregnant or breastfeeding; or had other antimalarial treatment (except rescue treatment or for severe malaria).</p><p>Criteria for treatment discontinuation and study withdrawal were a severe drug-related adverse event, hypersensitivity to the study drug, drug-related QTc prolongation (&#x0003e;450 ms); drug-related alanine aminotransferase of more than five times the ULN or Hy's law; active chronic hepatitis B or C, or HIV infection; travel outside the vicinity of the study for longer than 3 months; any other medical disorder compromising the patient's safety; and withdrawal of consent.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>The WANECAM study was open label.

With the exception of an unrelated death from trauma, all adverse events resolved without further sequelae. Five patients had serious adverse events, all on first treatment, that were thought to be drug related: anaemia and malaria in a 3-year-old girl; alanine aminotransferase 852 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase 298 IU/L at day 7 in a 2-year-old girl; alanine aminotransferase 339 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase 417 IU/L at day 35 in a 3-year-old boy; aspartate aminotransferase 196 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 379 IU/L, and bilirubin 38 &#x003bc;mol/L, which the data safety monitoring board discounted as a Hy's law case because of the high baseline bilirubin concentration (46 &#x003bc;mol/L), in a 31-year old woman; and peak alanine aminotransferase 1229 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 890 IU/L, and bilirubin 41 &#x003bc;mol/L on day 7, alkaline phosphatase 571 IU/L on day 7, which peaked at 901 IU/L on day 14, in a 2-year-old girl.

Five (1%) of 671 patients had serious adverse events and one adverse event was thought to be drug related (toxic epidermal necrolysis). One patient had a serious adverse event (liver injury: alanine aminotransferase 298 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 195 IU/L, and bilirubin 48 &#x003bc;mol/L&#x02014;ie, potential Hy's law event), but was not thought to be drug related because it occurred on day 56.</p><p>Two patients died during the study, but neither death was thought to be drug related: road traffic accident (in the pyronaridine-artesunate group), and pneumopathy and immunosuppression caused by HIV infection (in the artemether-lumefantrine group).</p><p>Risk of Fridericia-corrected QTc (QTcF) prolongation was not increased with repeated pyronaridine-artesunate treatment (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).

The safety profiles of pyronaridine-artesunate and artemether-lumefantrine in this study were consistent with those in previous comparative phase 2 and 3 trials.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In previous trials, transient increases in transaminases were noted after one course of pyronaridine-artesunate in some patients.</p><p>In our study, laboratory defined hepatotoxicity events occurred in some patients, but without clinical manifestations and the outcomes were favourable. There was no indication of any increased risk of hepatoxicity on re-treatment of patients with bodyweights of less than 20 kg versus those 20 kg or greater or for those younger than 18 years versus older patients. Although hepatotoxicity events were more common in patients older than 18 years, three of four hepatic-related serious drug-related adverse events were in children up to 3 years of age.</p><p>Pyronaridine-artesunate re-treatment did not increase overall safety risk based on adverse event frequencies, laboratory values, or electrocardiograph findings. The half-life of pyronaridine is about 14 days so the period between exposures could be affected by residual blood concentrations (five half-lives equal to 60 days). However, there was no evidence of increased risk according to time between treatments. Thus, because more than 50% of patients were re-treated with pyronaridine-artesunate within 28&#x02013;60 days of the first treatment, the safety findings lend support for re-treatment of patients at least 28 days after previous exposure.</p><p>Efficacy was assessed in an intention-to-treat analysis and outcomes were consistent with this conservative approach. For crude ACPR, overall efficacy was higher with pyronaridine-artesunate than with artemether-lumefantrine treatment. However, after exclusion of patients with new infections, the results of PCR-adjusted ACPR were consistent with the findings from two previous phase 3 trials, showing similar efficacy for the two agents.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Thus, the difference in crude ACPR resulted from a higher re-infection rate in the artemether-lumefantrine group than in the pyronaridine-artesunate group and might be explained by the longer elimination half-life of pyronaridine (14 days) than of lumefantrine (3&#x02013;4 days).<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Notably, both ACTs met the WHO criteria of greater than 95% PCR-adjusted ACPR at day 28.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>As with most clinical trials, patients were excluded on the basis of criteria that were applicable to real-life settings&#x02014;ie, pre-existing increased liver function tests or hepatitis. Thus, additional studies might be needed to obtain comprehensive safety information in these populations. Also, patients who had hepatotoxicity events on first treatment with pyronaridine-artesunate were to be excluded from subsequent treatment. Four patients who had a hepatotoxicity event after pyronaridine-artesunate were re-treated with the same drug by mistake and none had another hepatotoxicity event or any hepatic related adverse event. These errors occurred because of absence of any clinical symptoms and delay in drawing attention to the abnormal laboratory values. In the 15 patients who had hepatotoxicity events with pyronaridine-artesunate, although a panel of hepatic assessments should have been initiated, hepatitis could only be ruled out as a possible cause of increased liver enzymes in five patients, and two of these had evidence of previous Epstein-Barr virus infection (data not shown).</p><p>Children are at highest risk of severe malaria. Although 236 (23%) of 1015 patients treated with pyronaridine-artesunate were younger than 5 years and more than a third were less than 20 kg in bodyweight, only 13 children were younger than 1 year. Further data are therefore needed about the safety of pyronaridine-artesunate in infants. Many more infants were unlikely to have been recruited into the WANECAM trial after the cutoff date for inclusion in this substudy, and further studies might be warranted.</p><p>This substudy was not designed to assess efficacy and the final results from the WANECAM trial should be awaited before drawing conclusions about the relative performance of the two comparator treatments. Based on local practices, artemether-lumefantrine was administered without specifically providing fatty intake and data on food consumption before dosing was not gathered. However, only a small amount of dietary fat is necessary to ensure optimum efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and the fat content of breast milk or standard meals in sub-Saharan Africa is adequate.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p><p>The similar safety and efficacy of pyronaridine-artesunate on first treatment of malaria versus re-treatment of subsequent malaria episodes lend support to wider access to pyronaridine-artesunate as an alternative ACT for the treatment of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
