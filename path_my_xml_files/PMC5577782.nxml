With the limited efficacy of PEG-IFN-&#x003b1; and prolonged treatment periods associated with NAs, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies, especially for patients with a poor early response to anti-viral therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this study, 178 patients with chronic hepatitis B (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;131) and compensated (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;47) HBV-induced cirrhosis were enrolled, 120 patients with HBeAg (+). All the patients were treated for 12&#x000a0;weeks with PEG-IFN-&#x003b1;. Among them, a total of 138 patients with a poor virological response after 12&#x000a0;weeks were treated for an additional 48&#x000a0;weeks with Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a (control) (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;43), with Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;entecavir (ETV) (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;49), or Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;46), and were followed for 48&#x000a0;weeks after therapy. Early virological response was defined as undetectable HBV DNA after anti-viral therapy for 12&#x000a0;weeks. Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as no change in therapeutic effectiveness after 6&#x000a0;months follow-up, and no recurrence.Therapeutic efficacy was determined by evaluating HBV DNA levels, serum and liver HBsAg levels, liver function tests and liver histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Patients in the Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ETV and Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ADV groups showed a significantly greater decrease in HBV DNA levels over time, and a significantly higher SVR compared to patients receiving Peg-INF&#x003b1;-2a monotherapy (both <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.05).

Individualization of anti-viral therapy would ensure that only patients who do not respond to Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a would receive combination therapy.

The primary therapeutic goals in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are clearance of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) from the serum, which is associated with normalization of ALT and histological improvement of inflammation and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Currently approved treatments for CHB include two categories of drugs: 1) immune modulators such as Peg-INF&#x003b1;-2a, and 2) nucleoside (lamivudine, entecavir and telbivudine) and nucleotide analogs (adefovir dipivoxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), which suppress viral replication by selectively inhibiting the activity of HBV DNA polymerase. Although nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) are cheap and safe, their limited long-term efficacy result in prolonged treatment periods, particularly in patients with HBeAg-negative CHB. Extended use of NAs has been shown to be associated with the generation of drug-resistant mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contrast, the duration of interferon-based therapy is predetermined and finite. However, only 30% of HBeAg-negative CHB patients treated with Peg-INF&#x003b1;-2a achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) off-treatment, and HBsAg seroconversion in seen in 3&#x02013;4% of patients after 1&#x000a0;year of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although it was recently shown that CHB patients treated with PEG-IFN had higher rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg seroclearance compared to those treated with entecavir (ETV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], interferons have been shown to be effective only in patients with low viral loads, when the ALT levels are &#x0003e;2&#x02013;5 ULN, or in patients infected with HBV genotype A/B. Additionally, although the rate of HBV DNA loss with interferon-based therapy can range from 14%&#x02013;58.6%, more than 50% of the patients show low levels of viral replication, especially those with a poor early response to Peg-IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other challenges with using interferon-based therapy include the need for parenteral administration, frequent clinical follow-ups and the side-effects.</p><p id="Par17">There has been a recent focus on developing novel therapeutic strategies for patients with a poor response to Peg-INF-&#x003b1;-2a. Some studies have combined the immunomodulatory properties of Peg-IFN along with the direct anti-viral activity of NAs in an attempt to improve therapeutic efficacy in CHB patients. Patients treated with a combination of Peg-INF&#x003b1; and lamivudine (LAM) had a higher on-treatment virological response rate compared to patients treated with LAM monotherapy, but there was no improvement in post-therapy response rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similarly, although HBeAg-negative CHB patients treated with a combination of Peg-INF-&#x003b1;-2a and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) had a more rapid on-treatment HBV DNA suppression compared to those treated with Peg-INF-&#x003b1;-2a monotherapy, this did not translate to higher rates of virological response after suspension of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A total of 17 CHB patients treated with a combination of Peg-INF-&#x003b1;-2a and ETV for 48&#x000a0;weeks and observed for an additional 24&#x000a0;weeks showed a significant decrease in serum HBV DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The protocol of anti-viral therapy in these combination studies was not adjusted based on early response. Optimizing therapeutic regimens based on early virological response and individual characteristics would ensure that only patients who fail to achieve a good response with Peg-INF-&#x003b1;-2a monotherapy would receive combination therapy, thereby shortening the course of therapy, enhancing virological response, decreasing the economic burden and conserving medical resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of additional nucleoside analogues on the SVR and the improvement of liver histology in CHB patients who had a poor virological response to Peg-INF&#x003b1;-2a at the end of 12&#x000a0;weeks of therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient recruitment</title><p id="Par20">A total of 178 patients diagnosed with CHB were recruited from the Department of Gastroenterology at China&#x02013;Japan Union Hospital between September 2005 and December 2010.

Both regimens of combination therapy resulted in a significantly greater decrease in HBV DNA levels over time, and a significantly higher SVR compared to Peg-INF&#x003b1;-2a monotherapy. Although patients receiving combination therapy had a significantly higher change in serum HBsAg levels compared to the monotherapy group, there was no significant difference in liver HBsAg levels between the three treatment groups.</p><p id="Par46">A number of studies have investigated therapeutic strategies which combined the immunomodulatory effects of Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a along with the direct anti-viral activity of NAs for patients with a poor response to anti-viral therapy.

However, a recent meta-analysis suggested that a combination of PEG-IFN and LAM increased SVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A combination of Peg-IFN with ADV or ETV for 48&#x000a0;weeks had a significantly higher therapeutic efficacy in HBeAg-negative CHB patients compared to Peg-IFN monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

It is important to note that these studies used combination therapy as the first-line therapy, whereby patients having the potential to achieve a virological response with Peg-IFN alone also received combination therapy. In the present study, 138 study patients were treated Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a for 12&#x000a0;weeks, and only 95 patients who had a poor virological response at the end of this period received combination therapy of Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a with either ETV or ADV for 48&#x000a0;weeks. The Peg-IFN-&#x003b1;2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ETV and Peg-IFN-&#x003b1;2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ADV groups showed a reduction in HBV DNA by 3.3 and 3.0 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL, respectively and the proportion of patients with undetectable HBV DNA was 69.4% and 71.7%, respectively, which were significantly higher than that in patients treated with Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a alone.</p><p id="Par47">Anti-viral therapy with Peg-IFN was shown to improve liver histology in 38&#x02013;48% of patients and significantly delay disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 26 prospective studies also revealed that reduction of HBV DNA levels after anti-viral therapy was positively related to improvement of liver histology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the present study, a significantly higher percentage of patients in the Peg-IFN-&#x003b1;2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ADV and Peg-IFN-&#x003b1;2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ETV groups showed an improvement in liver histology compared to the Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a monotherapy group (69.2% and 64.3% vs. 27.3%). These data suggested that in patients with an early poor virological response to Peg-IFN-&#x003b1;2a, addition of NAs could promote inhibition of viral replication, which is associated with SVR and improvement of liver histology. These findings have important implications for attenuation of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and slowing the progression of hepatic cirrhosis in CHB patients.</p><p id="Par48">Baseline and on-treatment HBsAg levels have been shown to be strong predictors of therapeutic efficacy, and patients with HBsAg levels &#x0003e;20,000&#x000a0;IU/ml after 24&#x000a0;weeks of Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a treatment failed to achieve a virologic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Reduction in HBsAg levels has been shown to be closely related to seroconversion of HBeAg and HBsAg, and a larger reduction in HBsAg levels during therapy is associated with a higher possibility of HBsAg loss after long-term anti-viral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

In the present study, we showed that patients in the Peg-IFN-&#x003b1;-2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ADV and Peg-IFN-&#x003b1;-2a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ETV groups had a more significant change in serum HBsAg levels compared to patients in the Peg-IFN-&#x003b1;-2a monotherapy group, as well as a higher rate of HBsAg seroconversion. Our data suggested that using combination therapy to achieve modulation of the immune response by Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a and inhibition of viral inhibition by Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a and NAs, significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy which was reflected by a reduction in serum HBsAg. However, there was no correlation between change in liver HBsAg levels and rate of improvement in liver histology. The current study about the relation of serum HBsAg and liver histologic is not very clear, all the results are also different. This study not only observed the changes of serum HBsAg levels, also for the iver histologic HBsAg levels, designed to examine whether changes in the level of HBsAg can predict the effect. But because the patients with liver histological examination is less, the results found no significant differences.</p><p id="Par49">We aimed to investigate the influence of additional nucleoside analogues on the SVR and the improvement of liver histology in CHB patients who had a poor virological response to Peg-INF&#x003b1;-2a at the end of 12&#x000a0;weeks of therapy.

Individualization of anti-viral therapy would ensure that only patients who do not respond to Peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a would receive combination therapy.
