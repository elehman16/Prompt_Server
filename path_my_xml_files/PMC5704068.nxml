We conducted a directed screen of host biomarkers in participants enrolled in a tuberculosis clinical trial to address this need. Serum samples from 319 protocol-correct, culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis patients treated under direct observation as part of an international, phase 2 trial were screened for 70 markers of infection, inflammation, and metabolism. Biomarker assays were specifically developed for this study and quantified using a novel, multiplexed electrochemiluminescence assay. We evaluated the association of biomarkers with baseline characteristics, as well as with detailed microbiologic data, using Bonferroni-adjusted, linear regression models. Across numerous analyses, seven proteins, SAA1, PCT, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, CRP, PTX-3 and MMP-8, showed recurring strong associations with markers of baseline disease severity, smear grade and cavitation; were strongly modulated by tuberculosis treatment; and had responses that were greater for patients who culture-converted at 8&#x000a0;weeks. With treatment, all proteins decreased, except for osteocalcin, MCP-1 and MCP-4, which significantly increased. Several previously reported putative tuberculosis-associated biomarkers (HOMX1, neopterin, and cathelicidin) were not significantly associated with treatment response. In conclusion, across a geographically diverse and large population of tuberculosis patients enrolled in a clinical trial, several previously reported putative biomarkers were not significantly associated with treatment response, however, seven proteins had recurring strong associations with baseline radiographic and microbiologic measures of disease severity, as well as with early treatment response, deserving additional study.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Seven proteins, SAA1, PCT, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, CRP, PTX-3 and MMP-8, show recurring strong associations with markers of baseline tuberculosis disease severity, smear grade and cavitation</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">These same proteins were strongly modulated by tuberculosis treatment; and had responses that were greater for patients who culture-converted at 8&#x000a0;weeks.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Several previously reported putative tuberculosis-associated biomarkers (HOMX1, neopterin, and cathelicidin) were not significantly associated with treatment response in our clinical trial cohort.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The identification of improved biomarkers of tuberculosis treatment effect has been recognized as a key research area by the WHO International Roadmap for Tuberculosis Research because it would accelerate the development of new drugs and regimens, and potentially improve approaches to patient monitoring.

The current standard for use as a surrogate endpoint in phase 2 studies remains focused on culture conversion and the most studied is the two month culture status, which has low sensitivity and modest specificity for predicting outcomes after treatment completion.(<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Horne et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Nahid et al., 2011</xref>) Additionally, being dependent on sputum, culture-based monitoring can be challenging to use in extrapulmonary TB, and in patients with paucibacillary disease such as is seen in HIV-coinfected patients and in children.(<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Wallis et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Zumla et al., 2013</xref>) Both sputum volume and quality decreases in response to treatment and many patients cannot provide sputum samples for culture after a few weeks of treatment. The development of non-sputum-based biomarkers of treatment response would represent an advance for individual monitoring of TB patients as well as serving as an intermediate marker for use in TB drug development.</p><p id="p0025">As an alternative to sputum-based monitoring, blood-based biomarkers are appealing for several reasons. Blood is relatively easy to collect and, unlike sputum, remains an available source for biomarker measures throughout treatment. Blood-based markers of inflammation and infections are also quantitative, and provide an opportunity to improve predictive power by combining multiple biomarkers into predictive biosignatures. Finally, blood-based markers of treatment response could potentially be translated into point of care assays usable in the field without requiring sophisticated laboratory infrastructure, and biosignatures that at baseline could determine disease severity would also be valuable to clinical trialists and TB care providers for risk stratification purposes, as alternatives to chest radiography, for example. Efforts to identify host biomarkers predictive of treatment outcomes have resulted in the identification of a number of biomarkers that change during TB treatment, albeit most are described in observational cohorts or smaller case-control studies.(<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Andrade et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Azzurri et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Coussens et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Djoba Siawaya et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Djoba Siawaya et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Jayakumar et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Chang, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Mihret et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Ostrowski et al., 2006</xref>) Such studies acknowledge a variety of limitations including being single center studies, focusing on single markers, using convenience samples, having modest sample sizes, or relying on case-control designs.</p><p id="p0030">In the work described herein, serum collected in a standardized manner in a rigorously conducted clinical trial sponsored by the CDC-funded TB Trials Consortium, was used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a rifapentine-based regimen for drug-susceptible TB (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Dorman et al., 2012</xref>) Study participants received treatment under direct observation, thereby enhancing and carefully measuring adherence; an important benchmark when assessing biomarkers of treatment effect. We measured the concentration, and change in concentration, of 70 potential biomarkers associated with inflammatory, antimicrobial, T-cell and acute phase responses to bacterial infections, and with tissue remodeling at infection sites. These biomarkers were selected because they have been published as indicators of TB disease and the clinical trial samples provided an opportunity to reassess these associations across diverse international sites (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Andrade et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Azzurri et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Coussens et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Djoba Siawaya et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Djoba Siawaya et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Jayakumar et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Chang, 2003</xref>).

For this reason, the predictive ability of any individual assay for week-8 culture status is likely to be relatively weak. The area under curve (AUC) values for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis can be used as a non-parametric indicator of effect size.

However, the attendant cross-validated AUC is only 0.63. While a 13 marker model was optimal, achieving a value of 0.66, the variability associated with this estimate make the stability of the corresponding signature questionable.

Seven baseline biomarkers were significantly associated with the presence or absence of cavities at enrollment. The strongest effect was observed for the acute phase protein SAA1 (serum amyloid protein A), which showed a two-fold increase at baseline in patients with cavities, as compared to patients without cavities. The other proteins associated with cavitation included the inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2;, the tissue-remodeling factor MMP-8 (matrix metalloproteinase 8) and the cell migration factor sICAM-1 (soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1). Interestingly, the number of biomarkers associated with baseline TB disease increased with increasing disease severity: seven biomarkers were associated with the presence of any cavities, 11 biomarkers associated with the presence of cavities larger than 4&#x000a0;cm, and 26 biomarkers associated with &#x02265;&#x000a0;50% of lung involvement. The associations between serum biomarkers and severity of lung injury is plausible given production of these markers in the lung has also been reported. For instance, SAA1 is expressed in the lung, and has been associated with lung injury as well as lung cancer (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Campos et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Baba et al., 1992</xref>). Similarly, the collectin Pentraxin 3 can both be produced in lung endothelial cells in response to IL-1 (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Pauwels et al., 2010</xref>) or in lung fibroblasts in response to TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al., 2013</xref>) and is associated with pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Pilling et al., 2015</xref>). VEGF is expressed by epithelial cells as well as by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected macrophages, and has been implicated in granuloma-associated angiogenesis (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Polena et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, elevated levels of alpha-defensin are associated with pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Mukae et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et al., 2015b</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that selected markers measured in serum reflect both the burden of microbial infection and the degree of lung injury.</p><p id="p0145">Biomarker associations with baseline measures of microbiologic burden, namely smear grade and MGIT time-to-detection, were also evaluated. We identified five biomarkers, SAA1, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, PTX-3 and TNF-RI, that had significant associations with smear grade. These biomarkers were also among those that had the strongest associations with more extensive disease on chest radiograph (described above). Two additional biomarkers, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-15, were associated with MGIT time-to-detection, and were distinct from the five markers associated with smear grade. The identification of serum markers with strong associations with baseline bacillary burden raises the possibility for rapid point-of-care tests that could inform decisions at the time of treatment initiation in terms of regimen composition and duration, allowing for potential individualization of care.</p><p id="p0150">On treatment, the majority of biomarkers declined significantly, suggesting aberrant levels at baseline that return to normal as the disease is treated, bacterial burden declines and lung injury resolves. Importantly, we also found that several previously reported putative TB-associated biomarkers (HOMX1, neopterin, and cathelicidin) were not significantly associated with treatment response. The biomarkers with the strongest treatment responses were SAA1, CRP, IL-6, MMP-8, and IL-1&#x003b2;, all of which were also linked to disease severity and measures of baseline bacillary burden, providing additional evidence that these markers are indicators of disease state at time of diagnosis and during the course of treatment. Treatment also decreased alpha-defensin levels, not previously reported in TB, although predicted by gene expression studies (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf et al., 2012</xref>). Plasma heme oxygenase-1 (HOMX1) has previously been reported to have a strong response to TB treatment, (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Andrade et al., 2013</xref>) but we found little change in HOMX1 levels with treatment. Neopterin has also been reported to decrease significantly with treatment; (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Turgut et al., 2006</xref>) in our study we did not see a large change in neopterin, but this result may be related to differences in timing of sample collection, as prior reports found that neopterin levels return to baseline levels only after six months of treatment. Whereas plasma protein 10 (IP-10)/CXCL10 has previously been reported to be useful in monitoring patients in smaller studies, (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Azzurri et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Wergeland et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kabeer et al., 2011</xref>) it was not strongly associated with treatment effect in our analyses, although higher levels were noted with greater TB extent of disease on baseline chest radiograph. Cathelicidin and vitamin D binding protein (VitD-BP) assays were developed for this study given the important role of Vitamin D processing in TB disease, (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Yamshchikov et al., 2010</xref>) but we found little association with treatment response for these markers. The biomarkers that had the strongest associations with week-8 culture status, SAA1, CRP, IL1&#x003b2;, IL6, MMP-8 and IFN-&#x003b3;, overlapped with the biomarkers that had the strongest associations with baseline disease status, as well as the largest changes with treatment. However, of these six biomarkers only three, SAA1, CRP and IL-1&#x003b2;, had associations that met our criteria for significance, yet multivariate regression models, employing multiple biomarkers, did not identify combinations with high predictive utility for week-8 culture conversion. Moreover, analysis of biomarker associations with treatment failure was not feasible as only three trial participants (1%) failed treatment.</p><p id="p0155">Three biomarkers showed increasing levels during treatment: osteocalcin, MCP-1 and MCP-4. The increase in MCP-1 with treatment has been previously noted (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Djoba Siawaya et al., 2009</xref>). The reported role of MCP-1 and MCP-4 (or monocyte chemoattractant proteins 1 and 4) as attractants for monocytes and T cells, cell types involved in granuloma formation, provides a plausible mechanism by which levels of these chemokines increase in response to treatment (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Saunders and Britton, 2007</xref>). The increase in osteocalcin with TB treatment is a new finding, however, and the mechanism for this relationship is not clear. Osteocalcin is an osteoblast-specific bone matrix protein involved in bone formation, and has been found to be involved in insulin regulation, (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Karsenty, 2015</xref>) suggesting that osteocalcin may play a role in metabolic control during TB infection. Alternatively, osteocalcin levels may be related to pathogen clearance (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Garhyan et al., 2015</xref>). This is conceivable given reports that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> survival post-therapy may involve infection of CD271(+) bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells, which may act as a protective intracellular niche for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> persistence, and given that toll-like receptor stimulation of osteoclast precursors inhibit their differentiation into non-inflammatory mature osteoclasts during microbial infection, instead maintaining the phagocytic activity of the precursor cells (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Takami et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p id="p0160">Our study has limitations. First, long-term outcomes of interest (relapse versus durable cure) were not a component of the parent phase 2 trial, and our analyses were focused on biomarker associations with baseline severity and microbiologic indicators of treatment effect only. An evaluation of the most promising biomarkers we discovered should be pursued as part of clinical trials with long-term follow-up. Second, we were limited in our ability to explore the dynamics of biomarker change given two time points for serum collection. An assessment of the best performing markers in our study, across additional time points would improve our understanding of the predictive performance of these biomarkers. Third, the parent trial allowed for TB treatment prior to the randomization visit when serum was collected and study drugs initiated. This may have impacted baseline biomarker levels, however, in sensitivity analyses limited to participants with no pre-treatment, the biomarkers with the strongest associations with baseline severity and treatment effect remained the same.</p><p id="p0165">In conclusion, across 70 host biomarkers evaluated in a large and diverse population of TB patients enrolled in a clinical trial, we found that several previously reported putative TB-associated biomarkers (HOMX1, neopterin, and cathelicidin) were not significantly associated with treatment response. However, across numerous analyses we did identify seven recurring biomarkers that 1) were associated with baseline disease severity, 2) were strongly modulated by TB treatment, and 3) had treatment responses that were greater for patients that were culture-converted at 8&#x000a0;weeks. These recurring biomarkers included acute phase proteins (SAA1, PTX-3, PCT and CRP); inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6); and a factor associated with tissue reorganization (MMP-8). These biomarkers may provide blood-based targets both for determining baseline disease severity and for monitoring disease during treatment; they warrant examination in patient cohorts with follow-up that captures long-term outcomes of failure and relapse.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Author Contributions</title><p id="p0170">Conception and design: PN, GBS, AM, and MRS.
