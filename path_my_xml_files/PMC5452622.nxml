It is estimated that 50% of people with dementia experience some symptoms of depression, and the rate of persistence of symptoms is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Evidence suggests that the onset of depression is linked to a dementia diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Comorbid depression in dementia (i) significantly reduces quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], (ii) speeds cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], (iii) increases functional impairment and the need for nursing home placements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], (iv) is associated with higher mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], (vi) increases carer stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and (vii) is costly for health resources, with an increased use of expensive inpatient beds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme has successfully rolled out services providing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with good outcomes in terms of depressive symptom reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The government has now pledged to increase access to evidence-based therapies to all patient groups, including older people and people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, there is currently little evidence for the benefit of psychological interventions for depression in people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis has concluded that Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an effective depression prevention programme for people without dementia, but with a history of recurrent depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has suggested that MBCT is a priority for implementation. Alongside this, there is emerging evidence demonstrating promising results in relation to the benefits of adapted mindfulness interventions for people with dementia, suggesting that it could be beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms and in slowing deterioration in cognitive functions such as sustained attention, distraction inhibition and task switching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Recently, evidence from an adapted mindfulness intervention feasibility study for people with dementia in care homes (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31) showed that a modified mindfulness intervention was feasible and that it led to significant improvements in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There were no significant changes in mood. However, the study did not actively recruit people with depression and a third of the participants from the intervention group who were in the clinically depressed range at baseline moved out of the range at follow-up. In contrast, none of the participants in the control arm did, suggesting that the intervention should be further tailored and target people with comorbid depression and dementia.</p><p>This current study will be the first to investigate the feasibility and potential efficacy data of MBCT in people with comorbid dementia and depression, using qualitative and quantitative methods as recommended by the Medical Research Council [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study is to provide evidence for the feasibility of conducting a fully powered RCT to evaluate a complex psychological intervention for depression in people with early stages of dementia. Feasibility will be evaluated in it in terms of rates of recruitment, retention and adherence to treatment protocol. The potential efficacy of the intervention will also be estimated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>A single-blind randomised feasibility trial will be carried out to test the delivery of an MBCT intervention for people with mild to moderate depression and comorbid early stages of dementia. In this RCT, 50% of participants will be randomly allocated to the immediate group (IA) and will receive MBCT immediately. The remaining 50% of participants will be allocated to the delayed access control (DAC) group. Both arms will receive treatment as usual. Participants will be assessed by blinded assessors that will not be involved in the delivery of the intervention at any point. Assessors will provide explicit reminders to the participants before the assessment visit so that participants do not disclose group allocation inadvertently. The assessor will also record their impression of which arm of the trial the participants belong to and their confidence in that prediction on completion of the follow-up assessments. This will enable us to assess whether inadvertent loss of blinding leads to bias.</p><p>Alongside the running of the study, a progress evaluation will be carried out by interviewing participants taking part in the groups in order to gather qualitative information that can support and enhance the quantitative findings of the feasibility study. In order to gather in-depth data regarding people with dementia&#x02019;s experience of attending a mindfulness group, participants that attended the group will be invited to a semi-structured interview after the group. Approximately 10&#x02013;12 interviews with group participants and family caregivers will be conducted. Carers of participants will be invited to further examine whether potential benefits of the MBCT intervention were generalised to other areas that relate to activities of daily living such as engagement in home-based practice and improvements observed at home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting and location</title><p>Participants will be recruited and identified from memory services in North East London NHS Foundation Trust and memory services in Oxleas Foundation Trust.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Target group and sample size</title><p>As this is a feasibility pilot trial and there is limited research on the effects of mindfulness-based interventions for depression for people with dementia, it was difficult to estimate the likely effect size. We took a sample of 32 participants, 16 per group, as this was considered feasible for the requirements of this pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>People meeting the inclusion criteria are those treated for or with a diagnosis of mild depression and a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia according to DSM-IV criteria with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] of 18 or above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>People meeting the exclusion criteria are those who (1) have congenital learning disability; (2) present with severe depression or high risk of self-harm (e.g. suicidal intent) requiring urgent intervention; (3) are within 2&#x000a0;months of bereavement; (4) are involved in other psychosocial intervention research; or (5) have a diagnosis of psychosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p>The MBCT treatment protocol will be adapted from MBCT for the prevention of depression relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The main adaptation will be the substitution of longer length of meditation practices with shorter ones, discussion of patient&#x02019;s mood and cognitive symptoms in-session and encouraging participants to use formal mindfulness exercises as well as informal mindfulness when distressing situations arise during the week. We will also shorten the length of the mindfulness meditation for home practice from 45 to 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min and will increase attention to distress from memory problems during in-session and at-home exercises. The adapted MBCT will consist of eight, weekly 1&#x000a0;h and half group sessions, which will include skills training and in-class practice. Specific in-class mindfulness exercises will include (a) &#x02018;mindful eating&#x02019; (the &#x02018;raisin exercise&#x02019;), (b) &#x02018;body scan&#x02019; exercise, (c) &#x02018;mindful stretching&#x02019; and (d) sitting &#x02018;mindfulness&#x02019; meditation exercises with various objects (breath, body, sounds, emotional states, thoughts). The programme will incorporate daily assignments of &#x02018;formal&#x02019; home practice of mindfulness techniques (using 15&#x02013;20-min audio-recordings as well as &#x02018;informal&#x02019; exercises to integrate mindfulness into everyday experiences (e.g. eating, walking and brushing teeth). Participants will be instructed to practise mindfulness exercises aided by audio-recordings at least 5&#x000a0;days a week, as well as practising mindfulness throughout the day (e.g. while walking, eating, showering), for an additional 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min a day, for a total of 25&#x02013;40&#x000a0;min of total practice per day. Patients will be ask to record daily practice times in homework logs which will be collected each week, in which they will check which audio-recording(s) they had listened to that day and how much time they had spent doing other mindfulness practice throughout the day. A weekly telephone call by a member of the team will aim to support home practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Procedure for recruitment and intervention delivery</title><p>The researchers will present information about the study (rationale, inclusion and exclusion criteria, etc.) to the managers of the memory clinics (six in total). They will then discuss the feasibility of running the study in their service (e.g. available transport for participant, expected attrition rate for groups in the service), and if they agree to take part, they will start identifying suitable participants for the study.</p><p>Participants will then be informed of the study by their clinical leads from the different memory services that have agreed to take part in the study, and after expressing an interest in the study, potential participants will be asked to complete eligibility pack which will include a participant information sheet along with a consent form. Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions about the study by phone, email or post before being asked to complete the consent form. Until eligibility has been assessed and informed consent has been given, individuals will not be able to begin participation in the study.</p><p>People with dementia meeting the inclusion criteria and who consent to take part in the study, giving signed informed consent in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 will be included in the study. Clinical psychologist trainees that will be involved in the process will receive informed consent and Mental Capacity Act training. Where the participant&#x02019;s level of impairment increases, so that they were no longer able to provide informed consent, the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 will be followed. The initial giving of informed consent will provide an indication of the person&#x02019;s preference for participation in the research, and the family caregiver&#x02019;s viewpoint will also be sought. If the person with dementia shows discomfort at any point with the assessments or their participation in the groups, they will be discontinued.</p><p>Included participants will complete baseline assessment and be randomised into either the IA and will receive MBCT immediately or the DAC group. Randomisation will take place remotely by an independent member of the Research and Development Department using the online software sealedenvelop.com. Taking up or declining the study will not affect the usual support and treatment they receive.</p><p>The two clinical researchers aim to run two MBCT groups each, two at each site with approximately eight participants in each. The clinicians running the groups will monitor the feasibility of recruiting participants (for both IA and DAC groups) within the given time frame. This will ideally include 16 participants in each of the two locations.</p><p>At least two clinicians have been allocated to each of the groups so that in the event that a group facilitator is unavailable (e.g. leave, sickness), the remaining facilitator will run the group alongside co-facilitators.</p><p>The qualitative interviews with participants and their carers will be conducted within 3&#x000a0;weeks of the groups having been completed. As such, it is expected that all data collection will have been completed by December 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Treatment as usual</title><p>Usual care will be the same for both groups and involve usual GP and memory service support, anti-depressant medication, old age psychiatry review and community psychiatric nurse appointments.

Research has provided us with empirical evidence that the proposed approach is effective in aiding a variety of problems related to depression in those without dementia and that it might be a useful approach for people with early stages of dementia.</p><p>Results from this research will be used to indicate whether the intervention is an acceptable resource for people with early stages of dementia and comorbid depression. By assessing the acceptance and feasibility of the intervention for this population, we will be able to gain a key insight as to how such an intervention can be best delivered to individuals and details in relation to how to implement it within the NHS.</p><p>In collaboration with Oxford Mindfulness Centre, public engagement and knowledge exchange in different populations, and their expert clinicians and researchers, will be able to assist our intervention clinicians in case they may need additional help. They are fully committed to helping with this study, and they have granted the study team to access their intervention materials for this feasibility study. Working with OMC at this early feasibility stage will lay a foundation for the future large RCT which, if it is successful, will provide support for the evaluation and introduction of MBCT in the NHS as an additional psychological intervention to offer to people with early stages of dementia and depression and a viable option for depression postdiagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Dissemination</title><p>Dissemination will include an executive summary, open access journal publications and conference presentations. The main journal publication will present the study findings with the data being used to inform the development of the full RCT protocol. A simple feedback sheet information in relation to the results of the study will be sent to all participants who have taken part. The findings will also be disseminated to the Oxford Mindfulness Centre in the form of a report and an oral presentation. Oxford Mindfulness Centre will then disseminate the results internally. We will also disseminate findings via the newsletters on the widely used <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://oxfordmindfulness.org">www.omc.com</ext-link> website.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DAC</term><def><p>Delayed access control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IA</term><def><p>Immediate access</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBCT</term><def><p>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thank to the Oxford Mindfulness staff for their critical view and comments on the research protocol and intervention design.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Funding has been granted for the research costs of this study through the Oxford Mindfulness Centre (OMC) research awards 2015.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AS, EA and JS drafted the study concept and study design.
