The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate pharmacokinetic (PK) bioequivalence between SB2 and EU-sourced INF (EU-INF), between SB2 and US-sourced INF (US-INF), and between EU-INF and US-INF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized, single-blind, three-arm, parallel group study in 159 healthy subjects. All subjects received a single 5&#x000a0;mg/kg intravenous infusion of study drug and then were observed for 10&#x000a0;weeks to study PK, safety and immunogenicity. The primary PK parameters were area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>), AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>last</sub>) and maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>). Bioequivalence for the primary PK parameters was to be concluded using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) if the 90&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of geometric least squares means (LSMeans) of the treatments compared were completely contained within the pre-defined equivalence margin, 0.8&#x02013;1.25.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All of the 90&#x000a0;% CIs for the geometric LSMean ratios of primary PK parameters for each comparison were within the pre-defined equivalence margin. The proportion of subjects who experienced treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between treatments. The incidences of anti-drug antibodies between the three treatments were comparable.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated biosimilarity of SB2 to its marketed reference products of infliximab in terms of PK equivalence in healthy subjects. SB2 was generally well tolerated and showed comparable safety and immunogenicity profiles to the reference products (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01922336).</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="FPar1"><title>Key Points</title><p><table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">Single-dose pharmacokinetics of SB2 were shown to be bioequivalent to those of reference products (EU-sourced Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and US-sourced Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in healthy subjects, considered a sensitive population for PK comparison.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Safety and immunogenicity of single-dose SB2 in healthy subjects are comparable to those of reference products.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infliximab, which is a genetically engineered chimeric human/mouse glycosylated monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;), acts by neutralizing the proinflammatory action and regulatory role of TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Infliximab was approved as Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Janssen Biotech Inc., Horsham, PA, USA) with the indications including rheumatoid arthritis, adult Crohn&#x02019;s disease, paediatric Crohn&#x02019;s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, paediatric ulcerative colitis and psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Recently, Remsima<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Celltrion Inc., Incheon, Korea), using Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as the reference product, was approved for use as an infliximab biosimilar in the EU by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As per EU biosimilar requirements, the approval application included a detailed and thorough characterization of the mAb and non-clinical studies of the biosimilar with the reference product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This was complemented by a clinical phase I study in ankylosing spondylitis patients and a clinical phase III study in rheumatoid arthritis patients to establish and confirm clinical biosimilarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd is developing SB2, a biosimilar to Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, that is produced by recombinant DNA technology and purified by various types of chromatography. In accordance with the regulatory agency biosimilar guidelines, the development of SB2 had involved biosimilarity studies starting with comparison of the structural characteristics, physicochemical properties and biological activities between SB2 and Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, followed by demonstration of similar in vivo behaviour between SB2 and its reference products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Based on the in vitro and in vivo non-clinical study results, clinical studies could be conducted to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SB2 with those of infliximab reference products (INF). The aim of this study was to compare the PK of SB2 and its reference products after single administration of infliximab in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy female subjects of non-childbearing potential and healthy male subjects aged 18&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years were eligible for participation in this study if bodyweight was between 60.0 and 94.9&#x000a0;kg and body mass index (BMI) was between 20.0 and 29.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. For inclusion, subjects had to be in good health without any infectious disease including active or latent tuberculosis as indicated by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), serology, clinical laboratory tests, QuantiFERON<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-TB Gold test (QIAGEN, Venlo, The Netherlands) and urine drug screening. These screening tests were performed during a 3-week period prior to randomization. The nature and purpose of the study was fully explained to each subject and written informed consent was obtained from each subject before the subject was enroled in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was a single-blind, parallel group, single-dose study with three treatment groups, which were SB2 and two infliximab reference products: EU-sourced Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (EU-INF) and US-sourced Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (US-INF). All subjects received a single dose of 5&#x000a0;mg/kg SB2, EU-INF or US-INF by intravenous (IV) infusion for 120&#x000a0;min on the first day of study and then were followed for 10&#x000a0;weeks during which the PK, safety and immunogenicity measurements were made. To avoid infusion-related reaction, premedication with IV hydrocortisone (100&#x000a0;mg), oral acetaminophen (1000&#x000a0;mg), and oral loratadine (10&#x000a0;mg) were administered 30&#x000a0;min to 1&#x000a0;h prior to the infusion of study drugs, which was adopted from a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In case of infusion-related reactions, the infusion could be temporarily discontinued or the infusion rate decreased based on assessment of the investigators.</p><p>During the treatment period, subjects were hospitalized in the PAREXEL Early Phase Clinical Unit (Berlin, Germany) from 1&#x000a0;day before the study drug administration until 3&#x000a0;days after administration for serial PK sampling and close safety monitoring. After discharge, the subjects visited the site at 6, 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, and 71&#x000a0;days after administration. Safety was assessed by vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, and physical examinations. Adverse events (AEs) recorded during the course of the study were categorized by system organ class and preferred terms using the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 16.0). Blood samples for immunogenicity were collected to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to infliximab at pre-dose, 29 and 71&#x000a0;days after dosing. Blood samples for immunogenicity evaluation were analysed using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay for ADA detection and a functional cell-based assay for NAb detection. The percent coefficient of variation (% CV) for the negative control and high positive control for ADA detection were 33.7 and 26.4&#x000a0;%, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pharmacokinetic Evaluation</title><p>Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at pre-dose, 1&#x000a0;h after the start of infusion, the end of infusion, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120&#x000a0;h after the start of infusion and then at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 from the start of infusion. Samples were kept frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or colder prior to analysis. The serum concentration of infliximab was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for the detection and quantification of infliximab by TNF&#x003b1; (R&#x00026;D Systems, Product No. 210-TA-001MG/CF) coated in wells of an ELISA plate (PPD Bioanalytical Laboratory, Richmond, VA, USA). The concentration limit of quantification was from 100 to 3200&#x000a0;ng/mL. Inter-assay precision measured as the % CV were from 6.1 to 9.2&#x000a0;%, and the inter-assay accuracy expressed as the percent difference of the mean value were from 1.9 to 4.8&#x000a0;% within the quantification limit.</p><p>The PK parameter calculations were based on actual sampling times and non-compartmental analysis methods. The maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) and time to reach <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) were obtained directly from the observed values. The terminal elimination rate constant (<italic>&#x003bb;z</italic>) was estimated at terminal phase by linear regression after log<sub>e</sub>-transformation of the concentrations. The terminal half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) was calculated as ln(2)/<italic>&#x003bb;z</italic>. The linear up/log down trapezoidal rule was used to obtain the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>last</sub>). AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>) was calculated as AUC<sub>last</sub>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>C</italic><sub>last</sub>/<italic>&#x003bb;z</italic> (where <italic>C</italic><sub>last</sub> is the last quantifiable concentration). Clearance (CL) was calculated as dose/AUC<sub>inf</sub> and volume of distribution (<italic>V</italic><sub>d</sub>) was estimated as CL/<italic>&#x003bb;z</italic>. The PK parameter calculations were performed with Phoenix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version 6.2 (Certara<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Princeton, NJ, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>PK parameters were summarized in a descriptive manner by treatment and immunogenicity results as overall, ADA positive and ADA negative. An analysis of variance model (ANOVA) was performed for comparison of primary PK parameters (AUC<sub>inf</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>). The difference in geometric least squares means (LSMeans) of log<sub><italic>e</italic></sub>-transformed primary PK parameters between SB2 and EU-IFN, between SB2 and US-IFN and between EU-IFN and US-IFN and the associated 90&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. Back-transformation provided the ratio of geometric means and the related 90&#x000a0;% CIs for the ratio of geometric LSMeans of pairwise comparison were estimated. The bioequivalence of primary PK parameters were to be concluded when the 90&#x000a0;% CI was within 0.8&#x02013;1.25.

The clinical PK study is considered to be essential to demonstrate clinical biosimilar comparability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the most sensitive population that can reduce inter-individual variation should be chosen. Healthy subjects are considered to be a more homogeneous and hence more sensitive population to study PK characteristics than patients since patients can have various disease-related factors which can influence the PK of study drugs. For example, concomitant administration of methotrexate, which is commonly used for autoimmune disease including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, can reduce the clearance of infliximab compared with infliximab administered alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Equivalence of the PK between the test and reference products was based on the CIs for the primary PK variables AUC<sub>inf</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> in relation to the accepted range of 0.8&#x02013;1.25. To meet the requirements of both the EMA and FDA, comparison data between SB2 and EU-INF and between SB2 and US-INF demonstrate the evidence of equivalence in PK between SB2 and each of the two test products, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The PK equivalence between EU-INF and US-INF would provide scientific justification to use EU-INF, which is not licensed in the USA, as the sole active comparator in a phase III clinical trial.</p><p>Although a cross-over design for comparative clinical studies greatly reduces the variability in PK, a cross-over design with infliximab was not feasible considering the long <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>. The <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> of this study in healthy subjects is approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks for all studied infliximabs, which is similar to previous infliximab PK studies in patients and can be considered long enough not to apply the cross-over design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, ADAs to the study drug from the first administration could influence the PK after a second administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, a parallel design for infliximab PK comparison would be more suitable considering the study purpose.</p><p>PK sub-analyses according to the post-dose ADA status were performed to explore the relationship between immunogenicity of study drugs and PK. Within each treatment, systemic exposure of infliximab in ADA-positive subjects tended to be lower than in ADA-negative subjects. Means of AUCs in ADA-positive subjects were 23&#x02013;31&#x000a0;% lower than those of ADA-negative subjects in each treatment. It is known that anti-infliximab antibody can have an influence on the PK of infliximab by changing the drug clearance rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A recent PK modelling study showed that mean CL was 47.1&#x000a0;% higher in patients positive for antibodies to infliximab compared with those who were negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There is a limitation to comparing the historical data and current study results since the previous study results were obtained from patients, while this study was performed in healthy subjects. However, the differences in mean CL between post-dose ADA-positive and ADA-negative subjects in this study were comparable with previous modelling study results (35, 43 and 37&#x000a0;% for SB2, EU-INF and US-INF, respectively). Though there is an immunogenicity influence on PK of infliximab, the 90&#x000a0;% CIs for the geometric LS Mean ratio of all primary PK parameters for each ADA-negative subject group and ADA-positive subject group between SB2 and EU-INF, SB2 and US-INF, and EU-INF and US-INF were within the 0.8&#x02013;1.25 criteria (data are not shown). This PK comparison per ADA results could confirm the PK equivalence between treatments regardless of immunogenicity. Therefore, it is concluded that there is no difference in immunogenicity and the PK influence of post-dose ADA in SB2, EU-INF and US-INF.</p><p>Overall, PK equivalence between the proposed infliximab biosimilar, SB2, and reference products EU-INF or US-INF was demonstrated, and the immunogenicity impacts on PK were also similar between treatment groups in this phase I study in healthy subjects. A clinical confirmatory phase III study is in progress to compare the efficacy and safety, including immunogenicity, between SB2 and EU-INF in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this clinical study in healthy subjects showed pharmacokinetic equivalence between SB2 and its marketed reference products of infliximab.
