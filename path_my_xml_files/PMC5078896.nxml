For multicentre designs, HbA1c can be measured locally at participating centres or by sending blood samples to a central laboratory. This study analyses the agreement between local and central measurements, using 1-year follow-up data collected in a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of newly diagnosed children with type I diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>HbA1c measurements were routinely analysed both locally and centrally at baseline and then at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months and the data reported in mmol/mol. Agreement was assessed by calculating the bias and 95 % limits of agreement, using the Bland-Altman analysis method. A predetermined benchmark for clinically acceptable margin of error between measurements was subjectively set as &#x000b1;10 % for HbA1c. The percentage of pairs of measurements that were classified as clinically acceptable was calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the agreement within centres. Treatment group was not considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Five hundred and ninety pairs of measurement, representing 255 children and 15 trial centres across four follow-up time points, were compared. There was no significant bias: local measurements were an average of 0.16&#x000a0;mmol/mol (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.5, 95 % CI &#x02212;0.2 to 0.5) higher than central. The 95 % limits of agreement were &#x02212;8.6 to 9.0&#x000a0;mmol/mol (local minus central). Eighty percent of local measurements were within &#x000b1;10 % of corresponding central measurements. Some trial centres were more varied in the differences observed between local and central measurements: IQRs ranging from 3 to 9&#x000a0;mmol/mol; none indicated systematic bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Variation in agreement between HbA1c measurements was greater than had been expected although no overall bias was detected and standard deviations were similar. Discrepancies were present across all participating centres. These findings have implications for the comparison of standards of clinical care between centres, the design of future multicentre RCTs and existing quality assurance processes for HbA1c measurements. We recommend that centralised HbA1c measurement is preferable in the multicentre clinical trial setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Eudract No. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2010-023792-25/GB">2010-023792-25</ext-link>, registered on 4 November 2010.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>HbA1c</kwd><kwd>Agreement</kwd><kwd>Trial design</kwd><kwd>Measurement</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000664</institution-id><institution>Health Technology Assessment Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>08/14/39</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>In 2014, approximately 3.2 million people living in the United Kingdom were diagnosed with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Globally, 12 % of all health care expenditure is spent on diabetes care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the United Kingdom, the greatest percentage of NHS costs, and burden to patients, comes from long-term vascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Circulating blood glucose attaches to haemoglobin and concentrations of the resulting glycated haemoglobin, or &#x02018;HbA1c&#x02019;, reflect levels of blood glucose in the preceding 8&#x02013;12 weeks. In 1993 The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reported conclusive evidence that glycaemic control (GC), reported as mean HbA1c, is a critical determinant of the risk of long-term vascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More recently, variability of HbA1c over time has been identified as an important, additional risk factor for vascular disease. During the course of the DCCT, a patient in the 97.5th centile of HbA1c variability was three times more likely to develop diabetes-related eye disease and more than twice as likely to develop diabetes-related kidney disease that of a patient in the 2.5th centile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>HbA1c is measured routinely in clinical services to guide individual diabetes care. It is also a robust clinical outcome for clinical trials, being largely influenced by circulating blood glucose levels. The only caveat is that subjects with blood disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia, may have more rapid haemoglobin turnover, leading to HbA1c concentrations providing underestimates of true blood glucose control. It is usual practice to exclude these individuals from clinical trials in which HbA1c is an outcome measure, and for other estimates of blood glucose control that are independent of haemoglobin turnover to be used in routine clinical practice.</p><p>Standards of diabetes care and clinical outcomes are reported annually at a national level, and can be compared between centres through the National Diabetes Audit and the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit. There are many factors that influence GC, of which one is the quality of clinical services.</p><p>The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) has worked to standardise measurement of HbA1c at an international level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and HbA1c assays have been calibrated against the IFCC-standardised values since June 2009. This process of standardisation should in theory remove the need for centralised measurement of HbA1c for either clinical or research purposes. The main analytical methods used for the measurement of HbA1c include affinity chromatography, immunoassay, cation exchange chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Due to the variety of methods available, there can be significant differences between results obtained, as observed on the national external quality assurance programmes (due in part to haemoglobin variants and sample interferences such as bilirubin and lipids).</p><p>Due to the importance of GC in determining future risk of diabetes-related complications, it is an important endpoint used within clinical trials. In the multicentre study setting, HbA1c can be measured in three ways: at point of contact (POC), e.g. on the ward or in a clinic using bedside portable instrumentation; by sending blood samples to local hospital laboratories; or by sending blood samples to a central laboratory. Measurements made at POC and local laboratories are logistically easier, less costly and represent the pragmatic reality of HbA1c measurement in routine care. However, a central laboratory provides a single standardised testing facility that may provide more consistent results for primary endpoints leading to higher validity of conclusions and allow comparison of outcomes between participating centres. However, this approach incurs higher costs in trial implementation, and may represent an additional burden for paediatric patients, in whom it may be difficult to obtain sufficient blood for dual analyses.</p><p>SCIPI is a clinical trial randomising newly diagnosed children to two methods of insulin delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]: multiple daily injections or continuous pump infusion. The study, funded by the National Institutes for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme aims to compare the effect of insulin regimen on HbA1c measurements 12&#x000a0;months post diagnosis. The initial application to the NIHR HTA requested costs to support central laboratory analysis of HbA1c. This was to provide uniformity and standardisation of the method of measurement. However, the funding decision stated that &#x02018;HbA1c should be measured according to the national protocol and could be done locally&#x02019;. Despite arguments to support central laboratory analysis the trial was funded to support local costs only.</p><p>The Trial Management Group (TMG) expressed concerns about the limitations of this approach and so funds were eventually identified to include centralised HbA1c testing. The central laboratory began collecting blood samples 19&#x000a0;months after the study opened. This meant that the first participants&#x02019; results were not from the central laboratory. Furthermore, the pragmatic nature of the study meant that local results for follow-up appointments were usually obtained using portable instrumentation. Although POC devices are calibrated to the same standards as laboratory-based methods, this introduces another level of uncertainty. Also, if the sample was taken at a patient home visit then local results may have been unobtainable but a sample was sent for central analysis. The necessity for both local and central analysis was evident within the clinical trial protocol and was stressed during the training of staff collecting samples at participating sites throughout the duration of the trial and included publicity for this issue in the trial newsletter and email reminders of its importance.</p><p>This study examines the agreement between locally and centrally measured HbA1c in a multicentre trial setting. The aim of this analysis is to inform the statistical analysis plan for the final analysis of SCIPI and future trial designs. These data also give us helpful insights into the validity of comparing HbA1c values between clinical centres as a measure of quality of care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>At the time of this agreement analysis 294 children and young people aged 7&#x000a0;months to 15&#x000a0;years, who had been newly diagnosed with type I diabetes mellitus, had been randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin. Fifteen UK trial centres were involved in the study.</p><p>The first patient was randomised on 31 May 2011 and central laboratory analysis became available on 21 January 2013. The trial completed recruitment at the end of March 2015 with 294 patients randomised but some follow-up data collection was occurring at the time of this analysis (due to be completed by the end of March 2016).</p><p>HbA1c was collected prior to the start of the randomised treatment and then at follow-up appointments at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months. Data regarding the randomised allocations was not required for this analysis as this study investigated agreement independent of treatment received.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Measurement of HbA1c</title><p>The capillary blood samples were collected from finger-pricks into small capillary tubes and were analysed in two separate locations: locally &#x02013; the majority were analysed using portable instrumentation at outpatient clinics; and centrally &#x02013; at the clinical pathology laboratory at Alder Hey Children&#x02019;s NHS Foundation Trust, using a Siemens DCA 2000 machine. Transportation of samples to the central laboratory was by two possible modes: either through the post; or via bespoke courier systems to ensure that the samples would be received the next day.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Quality assurance of the measurement of HbA1c</title><p>Portable instrumentation is calibrated regularly with local laboratories. All laboratories involved in the measurement of HbA1c are obliged to participate in external quality assurance schemes, ensuring that laboratories with equivalent equipment are able to produce results that are comparable to each other. For almost all HbA1c measurements (local and central), the biochemical methodology employed was immunoassay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data extraction</title><p>Pairs of HbA1c measurements (one local and one central) were extracted from the SCIPI database in September 2015. Each pair of measurements was required to be from a single blood sample (samples taken on different days were excluded). Unusually large disagreements (&#x0003e;20&#x000a0;mmol/mol) were queried and, if unresolved, were reported on but excluded from the analysis to limit bias of results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Units of measurement of HbA1c</title><p>HbA1c measured locally was usually recorded in two units of measurement: mmol/mol and percent (percentage of total haemoglobin). HbA1c measured at the central laboratory (at Alder Hey) was recorded in mmol/mol only, according to the IFCC-aligned standards for reporting HbA1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. From 1 June 2011 the clinical standard unit of measurement for HbA1c became mmol/mol. This paper reports agreement using mmol/mol.</p><p>The formula used for conversion between the two units of measurement is:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

</p><p>Limits are justified by the potential differences in clinical outcomes that a difference of 10 % can imply &#x02013; in the Diabetes Control and Complication Research Group study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the relationship between HbA1c and the risk of developing microvascular complications, and the rate of progression of microvascular complications, was seen as a continuum across the range of GC. This was most marked at the higher levels of HbA1c: the 10 % difference in HbA1c between 10 % and 9 % was associated with a 25 % reduction in the rate of progression of retinopathy. Within patient observations they suggest that a difference in HbA1c of 10 % is clinically significant: those patients who reduced their HbA1c by 10 % (for example, 9.0 % to 8.1 %) reduced their risk of acquiring retinopathy and nephropathy by 39 % and 25 %, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Prior to undertaking the agreement analysis, a statistical analysis plan was developed by BA and agreed by CG. Simple demographics were summarised (gender, age and social deprivation score) for both the full cohort of children randomised in SCIPI and the subset that had at least one valid pair of HbA1c measurements included in this analysis. The Bland-Altman analysis of agreement method was used to compare local and central measurements. For each pair of measurements, the difference (<italic>D</italic>) (local measurement minus central) and the mean (<italic>M</italic>) was calculated. Heteroscedasticity (variance of <italic>D</italic> increasing/decreasing with increasing <italic>M</italic>) was examined through plotting limits of agreement (LOA) graphs. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to check whether within-subject variance of differences was significantly different to between subject variance &#x02013; i.e. to check whether the repeated measures nature of the data needed to be accounted for in the agreement analysis. The percentage of pairs within clinically acceptable limits was calculated for both units of measurement using the predetermined limits described below. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the agreement within centres. Finally, the time-lag between date of collection of blood sample and date of laboratory analysis was investigated as a possible explanation for poor agreement.

It is also important to note that the SDs of measurements were similar for local and central measurements at every time point, showing that power calculations would not be affected by location of measurement. In this study setting, it was found that 95 % of local and central measurements were within a fairly wide margin of discrepancy: &#x000b1;9&#x000a0;mmol/mol and that one in five (20 %) pairs were classified as clinically unacceptably different. This has implications for the validity and reliability of measurements for clinical decision-making for individual patients.</p><p>In the course of this study, some data entry errors, and errors in the conversion from one unit of measurement to another were found &#x02013; though these were detected through the querying process. Only a handful of queried data anomalies could not be verified and these were excluded from analysis. Centre-specific agreement did vary, though there was no centre-specific systematic bias evident. Some centres may have had more unreliable local measurement methods than others or there may have been more errors with data entry.</p><p>The time-lag between blood sampling and analysis at the central laboratory was not associated with levels of agreement, suggesting that there were no issues affecting measurement related to storage and transport of blood samples.</p><p>Discrepancies between HbA1c measurements can sometimes be explained by issues with instrumentation (lot-to-lot variation with HbA1c cartridges; variation between instrumentation makes and models; differences in sample collection devices; measurement errors by users; rogue cartridges within a batch).</p><p>This study does not provide evidence that central measurements are more accurate or more reliable, but rather that the measurement of HbA1c is variable between methods of analysis. In the routine practice of diabetes care, local measurement at clinics incurs lower costs and is convenient for decision-making; in the clinical trial setting, however, a single systematic centralised methodology would be preferable to eliminate any chance that differences in measurement methodology, or levels of training, affect the estimation of effect sizes. Pragmatically, this study provides no reason why local measurements could not be used in place of missing central measurements, given that there would be no overall bias incurred.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study shows that a central laboratory provides a standardised measurement methodology for recording HbA1c during follow-up, and that the results obtained are an unbiased representation of HbA1c measured locally at trial centres. Overall, the mean and standard deviation of measurements were similar for both sources of measurement, meaning that power calculations would not be affected by choice of source of measurement. However, there was found to be a wide spread of differences between local and central measurements for individual blood samples. This means that in some cases, post-diagnosis decision-making could be quite different if based on local measurements compared with central ones.</p><p>For the purposes of developing the SCIPI analysis plan the primary analysis will use central laboratory measures where available and use local results when this is not the case. This is based on the lack of systematic bias and the consistency in the size of the means and SDs across time points and scales.</p><p>Future investigators, and those using measures of HbA1c as indicators of standards of routine clinical care need to be aware of the variability that persists in the measurement of HbA1c across centres within the United Kingdom, despite a commitment to working according to the IFCC initiative for standardisation of measuring and reporting HbA1c. A single central laboratory provides a uniform methodology that, whilst more expensive, removes some of the complexity of sources of variation inherent in the multicentre local measurement approach.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>GC</term><def><p>Glycaemic control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA1c</term><def><p>Glycated haemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p>Interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOA</term><def><p>Limits of agreement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POC</term><def><p>Point of contact</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>CTRC: Clinical Trials Research Centre, University of Liverpool.</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p>SCIPI: Randomised controlled trial of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion compared to multiple daily injection regimens in children and young people at diagnosis of type I diabetes mellitus.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None to add.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>SCIPI was funded by the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR): Project reference: 08/14/39.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The data for these analyses are available on request from the lead author.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
