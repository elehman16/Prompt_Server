Preliminary diagnosis of <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infection relies mainly on a Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT), which has acknowledged limitations. New approaches are needed, first to identify new diagnostic antigens and, second, to find a more suitable platform for field-based immunodiagnostic tests. We took an unbiased approach to identify candidate diagnostic antigens by asking which parasite proteins bind to the antibodies of infected patients and not to the antibodies of uninfected patients. From this list of twenty-four candidate antigens, we selected four and from these we selected the one that worked the best in conventional immunodiagnostic tests. This antigen, ISG65, was used to make lateral flow devices, where a small sample of patient serum is added to a pad and thirty minutes later infection can be inferred by simple optical read out. This simple prototype device works as well as the CATT test and may be developed and optimized for clinical use in the field.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by an MRC PhD studentship to LS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index.htm">http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index.htm</ext-link>), a Wellcome Trust Programme Grant to MAJF (085622) and a Wellcome Trust project grant to MC (085256) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/</ext-link>).

The parasites are transmitted in sub-Saharan Africa by the bite from an infected tsetse fly. HAT is of great public health significance, with epidemic outbreaks recorded several times over the past century with, at times, estimates of 300,000 or more infected individuals <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Simarro1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Today, the recorded number of new cases has dropped below 10,000 per year, yet HAT still continues to place a large burden on individuals and communities in terms of disability-adjusted life years <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Simarro2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Fvre1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The identification of infected individuals is crucial for therapeutic and public health intervention. New tools could aid eradication of this disease when used in coordination with other efforts <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Simarro2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Nimmo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Welburn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Infection with <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> or <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> progresses through two defined stages. The first stage is when trypanosomes are limited to the blood and lymphatic systems. The second stage occurs when the parasites invade the central nervous system <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Malvy1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The latter leads to neurological damage, sleep cycle disruption, coma and death if the patient does not receive treatment <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Rodgers1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Wolburg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Lundkvist1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The two stages are treated with different drugs, and those used for the second stage have severe toxic side effects <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Fairlamb1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Denise1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Staging of the infection, to select the appropriate therapeutics and follow up, is currently done by sampling the cerebral spinal fluid to search for the presence of parasites and/or increased numbers of lymphocytes <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The view that human trypanosome infections are invariably fatal if not treated has been challenged recently <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Bucheton1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Checchi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> but, nevertheless, early diagnosis is extremely important both for individual patient outcomes and for controlling epidemic spread <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Welburn2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Kabor1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The identification of infected individuals relies on dedicated screening teams that visit at-risk communities or patients seeking medical examination <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Odiit1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. HAT diagnosis in the field faces many difficulties; not least the logistical challenges for the screening teams to attend communities in rural locations. In endemic areas, civil disturbance usually increases the incidence of HAT and decreases the frequency of screening <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Chappuis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-VanNieuwenhove1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Once the screening teams are with the communities, they face further challenges to recruit the entire local population into the HAT screening programme, which can lead to under-reporting and under-estimations of infection rates <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Mpanya1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Mumba1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Odiit2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Robays1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>The current HAT screening regimen uses the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT), a serological test that detects whether antibodies from an individual are able to aggregate a suspension of fixed and stained <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> trypanosomes <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Magnus1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, detecting primarily antibodies to the variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) on the fixed cells. If patients have a positive CATT result, microscopic examination of their blood is carried out to detect trypanosomes. If this is positive, a lumbar puncture is performed to stage the infection. Over the years, the CATT test has been optimised to improve sensitivity, specificity and stability. Such modifications include dilution of the blood samples, the use of multiple trypanosome clones expressing different VSG variants and improvements in thermostability <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Jamonneau1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Chappuis2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Hasker1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Truc1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Despite the usefulness and wide deployment of the CATT test, it has several widely accepted limitations <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Radwanska1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Brun1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Wastling1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Penchenier1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These include varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity, its inability to detect <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> infections, the requirement for trained screening personnel to use it and the specialised manufacture which precludes production on a scale necessary to saturate the market <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Robays1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Truc2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. There have also been other post-CATT test diagnostic enhancements. For example, the concentration of trypanosomes from infected blood to improve microscopic detection <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Biler1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Bscher1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Camara1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Further, the detection of trypanosome DNA in blood by loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP) <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Wastling2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> methods are under investigation and are summarised in a recent review <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Mugasa1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, these diagnostic methods require relatively sophisticated laboratory equipment. In summary, there is well accepted case for developing an extremely simple, low-cost diagnostic device with greater sensitivity and specificity than current field tests <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Simarro1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Lateral flow devices are simple tests that can rapidly detect nanogram amounts of antibodies or antigens in finger-prick blood samples without the need for any ancillary equipment <xref rid="pntd.0002087-PosthumaTrumpie1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infections are characterised by very low parasitemias, often &#x0003c;1000/ml, the equivalent of &#x0003c;5 ng total trypanosome protein/ml blood. Thus, using currently available technology, it is not feasible to directly detect a trypanosome protein and a lateral flow test that detects host antibodies is perhaps more likely to have the required sensitivity and specificity. The manufacture of large numbers of lateral flow devices requires milligram to gram amounts of diagnostic antigen, therefore potential diagnostic antigens for such devices should preferably derive from recombinant or synthetic sources. Recently the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) has invested in developing new diagnostic tests for human African Trypanosomiasis <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Steverding1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. With a similar aim in mind, we also set out to identify novel diagnostic antigens, and to create a prototype lateral flow test device, but using a non-biased (proteomics) approach to select potential biomarker antigens. The results of this antigen selection and the performance of a prototype lateral flow device are reported here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All human serum samples were collected with the informed consent of the patients that they could be used anonymously for diagnostic development.

Each serum pool contained four individual sera of patients clinically defined as having an infection with <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> or as being uninfected. IgG fractions were purified from the pooled sera by affinity chromatography on protein G and then immobilised to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose beads. Equal amounts of infection and control IgG-Sepharose were incubated with equal amounts of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> detergent cell lysate. Proteins that bound to the IgG columns were eluted by low pH, precipitated with cold ethanol, dissolved in SDS-sample buffer, reduced, separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal Coomassie blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002087-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). More protein was seen in the eluate from the infection IgG column, consistent with infection-specific anti-trypanosome immune responses. Equivalent sections were cut out from the infection and control lanes, as indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002087-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The excised gel pieces underwent in-gel S-alkylation and tryptic digestion, and the tryptic peptides were analysed by LC-MS/MS. Mascot software matched the peptide spectra to proteins in the <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> predicted protein database and scored the quality of the identifications. Lists of the proteins retained by infection IgG-Sepharose and control IgG-Sepharose were compared in each gel section. Twenty-four proteins with a MASCOT protein score above 50 were found uniquely in the infection IgG eluate and these are described in (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002087-t001">Table 1</xref>). Several of the infection-specific proteins were defined as &#x02018;hypothetical&#x02019;, but other hits included known cell surface proteins, such as: Invariant Surface Glycoprotein (ISG) 75, ISG65, ISG64, Gene Related to Expression Site Associated Gene (GRESAG) 4, and the transferrin receptor subunits ESAG 6 and 7. As a starting point, the proteins with high MASCOT scores were prioritised. The rationale for this selection was that, by using an excess of trypanosome lysate in the affinity purification step, the amount of an eluted antigen should reflect, to a first approximation, the relative amount of antigen-specific immobilised IgG. The latter should, in turn, correspond to the immune response to that antigen in infected patients. Using this criterion, the protein antigens selected for study were ISG75, ESAG7, GRESAG4, ISG65, ISG64 and ESAG6 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002087-t001">Table 1</xref>). Next, we looked into the likely ease of protein expression of these antigens in <italic>E. coli</italic>. At this stage, we de-selected ESAG6 and ESAG7 because they form a heterodimer (adding the complication of dual expression) and because successful (but low level) protein expression has only been reported in a eukaryotic baculovirus expression system <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Chaudhri1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. On the other hand, <italic>E. coli</italic> recombinant expression of domains of ISG75, ISG65 and ISG64 had either been reported in the literature <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> or were known to the authors (Mark Carrington, unpublished data). Consequently, we selected all three ISGs for protein expression trials. Finally, we performed expression trials on the predicted extracellular domain of GRESAG4, for which there was no literature precedent.</p><fig id="pntd-0002087-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0002087.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Immuno-affinity chromatography and identification of potential diagnostic antigens.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the preparation of IgG-Sepharose from <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infection and non-infection (control) sera, the immune-affinity capture of trypanosome antigens from a whole detergent lysate and their subsequent elution and concentration by ethanol precipitation.

The recombinant antigens that best discriminated between <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infected and control patients by ELISA were rISG65-1 and rISG64-1, which had areas under the ROC curve of 0.99 and 0.98 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002087-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

The box plots, heat maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002087-g005">Figure 5A and B</xref>) and Dunn's post hoc analyses (not shown) all indicate that, whereas the stage 2 sera show statistically significant immunoreactivity to all the antigens compared to controls, the immunoreactivities of the stage 1 sera are not statistically significant. rISG65-2 was the most sensitive at identifying <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> infection sera 92% (95%, CI of 74 to 99%), but at a cost to specificity 85% (95%, CI 62.1 to 97%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002087-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002087-t002">Table 2</xref>). As mentioned above, the pooled sera ELISA experiments had indicted that stage 1 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> infection sera might have high antibody titres towards rISG75. However this proved not to be the case and was due to a single serum sample with a very high anti-rISG75 titre.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Lateral flow prototype development to detect <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infections</title><p>Based on the ROC curve analyses of the performances of the ELISA plates, we selected rISG65-1 (ROC curve area 0.99 for <italic>T. b.gambiense</italic> sera) for development of a lateral flow prototype. Purified rISG65-1 was supplied to BBInternational (Dundee, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bbigold.com">www.bbigold.com</ext-link>) a company that specialises in lateral flow technology. The lateral flow approach that was utilised is illustrated in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002087-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, rISG65-1 was both immobilised in a band on a nitrocellulose membrane and coupled to colloidal gold that was then localised in the conjugate pad. When the sera and chase buffer are applied to the sample pad, the rISG65-colloidal gold conjugate is resuspended. The absorbent pad at the top of the lateral flow device draws the liquid across the nitrocellulose membrane. During this time, any anti-rISG65 antibody in the serum binds to the rISG65-gold conjugate and when the antibodies reach the rISG65 test band, one Fab arm of the IgG binds to the immobilised rISG65 while the other Fab domain bridges to the rISG65-gold-conjugate. Accumulation of this specific antibody sandwich generates a visible test line. The control line is an internal positive control for the lateral flow test and does not relate to the infection status of the patient but indicates successful test flow. The final reading of this test should be as follows; the appearance of only a control line (upper band) indicates non-infected sera, whereas, the appearance of two lines, a control and test line (upper &#x00026; lower bands) indicates infected sera, examples are shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002087-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Absence of a control line (upper band) indicates an invalid test, irrespective of the appearance of the test line and the test should be repeated.</p><fig id="pntd-0002087-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0002087.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Prototype lateral flow device for detecting antibodies to rISG65-1 protein.</title><p>Representative results using serum samples from a matched uninfected patient (left) and a stage 2 <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infected patient (right).

An analysis of the test lines was also carried out using a densitometer, where an arbitrary cut off at 265.6 RU gave 100% sensitivity (95% CI of 91.2 to 100%) and 92.5% specificity (95% of CI 79.6 to 98.4%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002087-t003">Table 3</xref>) indicating there is potential for separation between infection and non-infected individual scores.

To do this, we needed to identify potential diagnostic antigen candidates, investigate whether they could be adequately expressed and purified and assess their diagnostic potential with patient sera. We took an unbiased proteomics approach to identify more than twenty potential diagnostic protein antigens, several of which were known cell-surface glycoproteins. This list was filtered pragmatically; first, the proteins with high proteomic MASCOT scores, generally synonymous with their abundance, were selected because, by using an excess of trypanosome lysate in the affinity purification step, the amount of an eluted antigen should reflect the relative amount of antigen-specific IgG in infection sera. The latter should, in turn, correspond to the immune response to that antigen in infected patients. From this list we eliminated ESAG6, since it is known to form a heterodimer with ESAG7 and is, therefore, relatively complicated to express <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Linding1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Our attempts to express parts of the extracellular domain of GRESG4 in <italic>E. coli</italic> were not very successful, although we were able to isolate the A-domain fused to GST. However, this G4a construct and the ISG75 protein construct did not perform well in the ELISA studies and were removed from this study. Nevertheless, these antigens should not be ignored for diagnostic development as they may simply have been miss-folded in the absence of endoplasmic reticulum folding and quality control components <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Arredondo1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Indeed, recombinant ISG75 has been shown to have diagnostic potential for <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> animal infections <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Chaudhri1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Future expression attempts might include bacterial expression systems that target recombinant proteins into the periplasmic space <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Arredondo1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and/or eukaryotic expression systems such as insect cells and <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>.</p><p>Our data on the diagnostic potential of ISGs 64, 65 and 75 for detecting <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> infections were somewhat hampered by the small number of sera available for testing. Nevertheless, it is clear from the ELISA data that IgG antibody responses to these antigens are lower than in <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infections. Further, the IgG responses are particularly low in stage 1 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> patient sera. This may be due to the differing nature and speed of progression of the infections; <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> infections are usually acute and progress faster whereas <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infections are chronic and progress over months or years <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, which could in turn lead to a greater amount and diversity of antibodies present in these sera. A previous study also struggled to identify diagnostic antigens for <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> infections <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Manful1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. A good approach may be to repeat the procedures described here using immobilised IgG from <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> patient sera.</p><p>Further research is also required to measure the half-life of antibodies in patients after they have been treated for HAT, as persistent antibodies may lead to false positives. It has been described that antibodies can persist up to 3 years post cure, however it is not known which class of antibodies persist or which antigens they recognise <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Paquet1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Ideally, a longitudinal study could be carried out to gain a greater insight into this and how it could affect the diagnostic potential of any future lateral flow test relying on antibodies <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Radwanska1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Lateral flow tests, whilst having limitations, could potentially be more suitable for use in the field because of their stability and the fact that they can be used by non-specialists <xref rid="pntd.0002087-Bandla1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we report here the selection of ISG65-1 as a potential diagnostic antigen for <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infections and its performance in both conventional ELISA and prototype lateral flow device assays looks promising. The performance of the prototype ISG65 lateral flow device encourages us to further develop and optimize it, perhaps adding an additional antigen or antigens to improve sensitivity and specificity, while aiming for a production cost of &#x0003c;US$1 per unit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002087.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
