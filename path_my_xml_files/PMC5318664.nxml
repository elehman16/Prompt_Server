This analysis evaluated the safety and tolerability of eluxadoline 75 and 100&#x02009;mg twice daily (BID) in one Phase 2 (IBS-2001) and two Phase 3 (IBS-3001 and IBS-3002) studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with IBS-D (Rome III criteria) were randomized to placebo or eluxadoline (75 or 100&#x02009;mg) BID for 12 (IBS-2001), 26 (IBS-3002), or 52 (IBS-3001) weeks. Safety data were pooled. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed, with special focus on opioid-related AEs, including suspected sphincter of Oddi spasm (SOS) events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>2,776 patients were included in the enrolled set; the safety set comprised 2,814 patients, based on actual treatments received. The most frequent AEs in the placebo and eluxadoline 75 and 100&#x02009;mg groups were constipation (2.5, 7.4, and 8.1&#x00025;, respectively) and nausea (5.0, 8.1, and 7.1&#x00025;, respectively); discontinuation due to constipation was uncommon (0.3, 1.1, and 1.5&#x00025;, respectively). Ten SOS events (10/1,839; 0.5&#x00025;) occurred in eluxadoline-treated patients, manifesting as acute abdominal pain with elevated aminotransferases or lipase, or pancreatitis; all occurred in patients without a gallbladder. Eight of these events occurred with the higher dose of eluxadoline, within 1 week of initiation of therapy, and all resolved with eluxadoline discontinuation. There were five events independently adjudicated as pancreatitis not associated with SOS, three of which were associated with heavy alcohol use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Eluxadoline was well tolerated in Phase 2 and 3 trials, with constipation and nausea the most common AEs. Consistent with the known adverse effects of opioid agonists, clinically apparent SOS events were observed in eluxadoline-treated patients. All occurred in patients without a gallbladder and the majority were observed in patients on the higher dose of eluxadoline, suggesting a possible association.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel movements in the absence of structural, inflammatory, or biochemical abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). IBS global prevalence ranges from ~5 to 15&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) and approximately one-third of all cases meet criteria for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). IBS-D is associated with impaired quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) as well as a marked socioeconomic impact through increased use of health-related resources and reduced work productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>Dietary and lifestyle changes often comprise first-line management strategies for patients with IBS-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), although the durability of these interventions remains unproven. Approved pharmacologic therapies for IBS-D include alosetron, a serotonin antagonist used for the treatment of severe IBS-D in women who have not responded to conventional therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), and rifaximin, a non-systemic antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Both alosetron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and rifaximin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) have demonstrated improvement in global IBS symptoms and abdominal pain.</p><p>Loperamide, an over-the-counter &#x003bc;-opioid receptor (OR) agonist, is an effective antidiarrheal agent commonly used to manage the disturbed defecation of IBS-D, although evidence to support its use is minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). In addition, loperamide is well known to precipitate constipation to the point that is has been used in animal and human models to reliably produce constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), consistent with the effects of unopposed agonism of the &#x003bc;-OR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>Eluxadoline is a peripherally active, mixed &#x003bc;-OR and &#x003ba;-OR agonist and &#x003b4;-OR antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of IBS-D in adults. Enteric neurons in the GI tract express &#x003bc;-, &#x003b4;-, and &#x003ba;-ORs, which regulate GI motility and visceral sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Although there is potential for the mixed pharmacological profile of eluxadoline (local agonistic targeting of &#x003bc;- and &#x003ba;-ORs) to be associated with the known class effects of &#x003bc;-OR agonists, the likelihood of these effects may be reduced through simultaneous &#x003bc;-/&#x003b4;-OR binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p><p>The efficacy of eluxadoline was initially evaluated in a dose-ranging Phase 2 study (IBS-2001) that demonstrated that eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg twice daily (BID) could simultaneously improve abdominal pain and stool consistency over the full 12-week duration of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Subsequently, two large Phase 3 trials (IBS-3001 and IBS-3002) demonstrated the efficacy of eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p><p>Herein we report the pooled safety and tolerability data from the Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies for the approved doses of eluxadoline, 75 and 100&#x02009;mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Phase 2 (IBS-2001; ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01130272) and Phase 3 (IBS-3001 and IBS-3002; NCT01553591 and NCT01553747, respectively) studies described herein were conducted with the approval of each investigator's institutional review board or independent ethics committee, and the studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent.</p><sec><title>Phase 2 trial</title><p>IBS-2001 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study conducted at 263 primary and tertiary care centers in the US, the design and results of which have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Patients were randomized to receive eluxadoline (5, 25, 100, or 200&#x02009;mg) or placebo BID for 12 weeks. Key eligibility criteria were: males and females aged 18&#x02013;65 years, with a diagnosis of IBS-D (Rome III criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>)), a mean daily worst abdominal pain score of &#x02265;3.0 (on a numerical rating scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable)), and a mean daily stool consistency score of &#x02265;5.5 on the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS; scale of 1 (hard, lumpy stools) to 7 (watery, liquid stools)). Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, intestinal obstruction, or evidence of significant hepatic, vascular, or renal disease, were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 3 trials</title><p>IBS-3001 and IBS-3002 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter studies conducted across 556 centers in the US, Canada, and the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In both trials, patients were randomized to receive eluxadoline (75 or 100&#x02009;mg) or placebo BID for 52 weeks in IBS-3001 and 26 weeks in IBS-3002. Key inclusion criteria were: patients 18&#x02212;80 years of age with IBS-D (Rome III criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>)), with an average worst abdominal pain score of &#x0003e;3.0, an average BSFS score of &#x02265;5.5, &#x02265;5 days with a BSFS score of &#x02265;5, and an average IBS-D global symptom score of &#x02265;2.0 (scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very severe symptoms)). Key exclusion criteria were: a history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or alcoholism; abnormal thyroid function; pancreatitis, sphincter of Oddi (SO) dysfunction, or post-cholecystectomy biliary pain; and cholecystitis within the previous 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>The safety and tolerability of eluxadoline were evaluated in each of these Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, and safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reporting, clinical laboratory results, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, and physical examinations. Concomitant medication use was collected throughout the study.</p><p>Special focus was directed on AEs related to the opioid pharmacologic class, including constipation and SO spasm (SOS). In addition to traditional AE reporting, constipation was also evaluated retrospectively based on patient electronic diary (interactive voice response system) entries. Diary-confirmed constipation as prospectively defined in the protocol was confirmed retrospectively using two of the electronic diary measurements: BSFS score and number of bowel movements. Constipation using the BSFS score was defined as an average score &#x0003c;2 over any study week. Constipation using the number of bowel movements was defined as zero bowel movements for &#x02265;4 consecutive days.</p><p>As the known class effects of &#x003bc;-OR agonists on the SO can be difficult to diagnose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), a safety-focused adjudication committee comprising three independent experts (the Hepatobiliary and Pancreatitis Adjudication Committee) was established outside of the Phase 3 study protocol in order to evaluate suspected pancreatitis and SOS events. For all cases adjudicated, the committee reviewed a treatment-blinded dossier of primary medical records, laboratory reports, radiology reports, and case narratives to determine whether the events met pre-specified case definitions for acute pancreatitis of any etiology or an acute hepatobiliary event, and whether SOS was the precipitating etiology based on a decision algorithm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>The committee used the Atlanta criteria for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), clinically defined as having at least two of the three following features: abdominal pain suggestive of pancreatitis (epigastric pain often radiating to the back), with the start of such pain considered to be the onset of acute pancreatitis; serum amylase or lipase levels three or more times normal; and characteristic findings on computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or transabdominal ultrasonographic studies. An acute hepatobiliary event of acute abdominal pain with elevated aminotransferases was defined as consisting of all three of the following criteria: abdominal pain suggestive of biliary origin (epigastric or right upper quadrant pain), with the start of such pain considered to be the onset of the acute hepatobiliary event; serum alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase levels three or more times normal, or two times an elevated baseline value (if that value was &#x0003e;3 &#x000d7; upper limit of normal (ULN)); and an event leading to study drug withdrawal. In determining whether a pancreatitis or acute hepatobiliary event had SOS as a precipitating etiology, the committee assessed whether the event was consistent with an acute, reversible pancreatic, or biliary tract obstruction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Data pooling and statistical analysis</title><p>Data for patients receiving eluxadoline or placebo were pooled from IBS-2001, IBS-3001, and IBS-3002. The safety set included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug (eluxadoline or placebo), and were the basis for AE rates. A number of patients from the Phase 3 studies underwent treatment misallocation during the studies. For these patients, the period during which they received the misallocated treatment was determined and safety findings from those &#x0201c;affected days&#x0201d; were summarized based on actual treatments received, irrespective of treatment randomization.</p><p>Continuous data were summarized descriptively by number, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum. Categorical data were summarized descriptively by frequency. No inferential statistics were performed for safety data.</p><p>Safety analyses were also performed using pooled data for the following subgroups: gender, age (&#x0003c;65, &#x02265;65 years), race, body mass index (BMI; &#x0003c;30, &#x02265;30), prior cholecystectomy status, and hepatic dysfunction (based on presence of elevated baseline ALT and elevated baseline total bilirubin).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient demographics, baseline characteristics, and exposure</title><p>The enrolled set included a total of 2,776 patients across the placebo (<italic>n</italic>=981), eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>=810), and eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>=985) groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The mean age was similar across all treatment groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Approximately two-thirds of patients in each treatment group were female and the majority of patients were of white ethnicity. Additional baseline characteristics, including cholecystectomy history and renal and hepatic dysfunction, remained balanced across the treatment groups in the pooled set (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In both males and females, the overall duration of exposure to randomized eluxadoline treatment was approximately 26 days longer in the eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg group compared with the eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg group (219.7 vs. 192.4 days, respectively, in males, and 207.9 vs. 182.9 days, respectively, in females; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>AEs</title><p>AEs were summarized for the safety set. After adjustment for treatment misallocation, the number of patients included in the safety set was 2,814 across the placebo (<italic>n</italic>=974), eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>=807), and eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>=1032) groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Over half of the patients in each treatment group reported at least one AE (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The proportions of patients with any AE leading to discontinuation were higher in patients receiving eluxadoline compared with those receiving placebo, but were similar between eluxadoline doses (8.3 and 7.8&#x00025; for the 75 and 100&#x02009;mg groups, respectively, vs. 4.3&#x00025; for placebo; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Constipation and abdominal pain events leading to discontinuation were most commonly reported in eluxadoline-treated patients, but were infrequent (constipation: 1.1 and 1.5&#x00025; for eluxadoline 75 and 100&#x02009;mg, respectively; abdominal pain: 1.1&#x00025; at both dose levels).</p><p>The most common AEs (occurring in &#x02265;2&#x00025; of patients in any treatment group) reported in eluxadoline-treated patients were constipation, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, headache, and vomiting, which tended to occur more frequently compared with patients receiving placebo (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The overall frequency of constipation AEs was low, with a similar incidence identified between the eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg (7.4&#x00025; (60/807)) and 100&#x02009;mg (8.1&#x00025; (84/1,032)) groups, with lower incidence in the placebo group (2.5&#x00025; (24/975); <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Investigator-reported AEs of increased ALT occurred in 2.1 and 2.5&#x00025; of patients for the eluxadoline 75 and 100&#x02009;mg groups, respectively, compared with the placebo reported rate of 1.4&#x00025; (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Post-randomization ALT elevations &#x0003e;3 &#x000d7; ULN were rare and the incidence of these events was similar across all treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Four eluxadoline-treated patients (0.2&#x00025; [4/1,839]) had an ALT value &#x0003e;10&#x02013;20 &#x000d7; ULN; three receiving eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg (0.3&#x00025; [3/1,032]) and one receiving 75&#x02009;mg (0.1&#x00025; [1/807] <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Another patient receiving eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg had an ALT value &#x0003e;20 &#x000d7; ULN (0.1&#x00025; [1/807]). Among the five patients with ALT &#x0003e;10 &#x000d7; ULN, three had findings adjudicated as consistent with SOS, and one was determined to be a specimen error. The remaining patient was a 28-year-old female randomized to eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg (study IBS-3001), who was noted to have asymptomatic elevated ALT at week 18, peaking at &#x0003e;20 &#x000d7; ULN around week 26, and resolving ~4 weeks after study withdrawal. Her prior medical history was notable for obesity (BMI 34.3&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), cholecystectomy (5 years previously), and intermittent right upper quadrant discomfort. Additional laboratory and radiological evaluation was notable for hepatomegaly consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and a relationship to drug could not be excluded. In the pooled Phase 3 studies, the frequency of ALT elevations &#x0003e;3 &#x000d7; ULN was slightly higher in patients without a gallbladder, irrespective of treatment group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). In patients who retained their gallbladder, no differences were seen in ALT elevations (&#x02265;3 &#x000d7; ULN) across the three treatment arms (11/650 [1.7&#x00025;], 12/642 [1.9&#x00025;], and 7/676 [1.0&#x00025;] for placebo and eluxadoline 75 and 100&#x02009;mg, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). There were no cases where ALT elevation coincided with elevations of bilirubin &#x0003e;2 &#x000d7; ULN. No cases were consistent with a Hy's Law case, which has the following three components: (1) hepatocellular injury, shown by a higher incidence of &#x02265;3 &#x000d7; ULN of ALT or AST than a non-hepatotoxic control drug or placebo; (2) among trial subjects showing such elevations, one or more also show elevation of serum total bilirubin to &#x0003e;2 &#x000d7; ULN without initial findings of cholestasis; and (3) no other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased transaminases and total bilirubin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Serious AEs (SAEs)</title><p>The frequency of SAEs was low, and slightly higher in eluxadoline-treated patients (75&#x02009;mg: 4.2&#x00025; 100&#x02009;mg: 4.0&#x00025;) compared with those receiving placebo (2.6&#x00025; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). No deaths were reported during the studies. One patient in study IBS-3001 died 21 days after receiving the last dose of eluxadoline (75&#x02009;mg), following an SAE (lower-extremity cellulitis) that was not considered drug related.</p><p>Pancreatitis was the most commonly reported SAE in eluxadoline-treated patients, although the overall incidence was consistently low (75&#x02009;mg: 0.4&#x00025; [3/807] 100&#x02009;mg: 0.4&#x00025; [4/1,032] overall: 0.4&#x00025; [7/1,839] <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). No SAEs of constipation were reported in any treatment group.</p><p>There were six major adverse cardiac events that were evenly distributed between patients randomized to placebo (0.3&#x00025; 3/975) and eluxadoline (0.2&#x00025; 3/1,839; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). All of these eluxadoline-treated patients were &#x02265;70 years of age and all had medical histories or risk factors for cardiopulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p><p>In the eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg group, there was a single case of suspected colon ischemia in a 72-year-old female with a recent history of polymicrobial sepsis (treated with antibiotics) and chronic medical conditions including type II diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis with cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diverticulosis. Nineteen days after the first dose of study drug, the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting followed by rectal bleeding and hypotension, with a blood pressure reading of 80/40&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg documented at home. Concomitant medications at the time of event onset included acetylsalicylic acid, gabapentin, lovastatin, omeprazole, psyllium mucilloid, sertraline, temazepam, and ursodeoxycholic acid. Upon presentation, blood pressure was 147/90&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg with a heart rate of 93 beats per minute; abdominal examination was unremarkable. Colonoscopy and histologic examinations were consistent with colon ischemia, with biopsy specimens revealing microscopic focus of reparative epithelial changes suggestive of colon ischemia in the ascending colon, and focal epithelial erosion and reparative epithelial changes compatible with colon ischemia in the transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon: the patient recovered uneventfully and there were no known complications at the time of last follow-up.

Acute pancreatitis was the most common SAE reported during the first 2 weeks of treatment, occurring in two patients (0.2&#x00025; [2/1,032]) receiving eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg.

During months 4&#x02013;12, the incidence of constipation AEs declined to a consistent low level (&#x0003c;2&#x00025; in any treatment group) and was comparable between treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The incidence of diary-confirmed constipation based on a daily score of zero bowel movements for &#x02265;4 consecutive days during the first 3 months of treatment was also similar across the eluxadoline 75 and 100&#x02009;mg and placebo groups (2.9, 3.8, and 2.6&#x00025;, respectively). Similar rates of patients with constipation were seen during months 4&#x02013;6 in the eluxadoline 75 and 100&#x02009;mg and placebo groups (2.8, 3.6, and 1.4&#x00025;, respectively).</p><p>Rates of diary-confirmed constipation based on average weekly BSFS scores &#x0003c;2 were similar to the rates for spontaneous reports of constipation AEs across the eluxadoline 75 and 100&#x02009;mg and placebo groups.

Eight presented with abdominal pain and elevated aminotransferases; one in a patient receiving eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg (0.1&#x00025; of treatment group [1/807]) and seven in patients receiving eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg (0.7&#x00025; of treatment group [7/1,032] <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Another SOS event, in a patient receiving eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg, was adjudicated as consistent with pancreatitis. The remaining SOS event occurred in a patient receiving eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg and presented as a mild lipase elevation (1.6 &#x000d7; ULN) with abdominal pain; the Adjudication Committee did not believe this met the Atlanta criteria for pancreatitis. All SOS events occurred in patients without a gallbladder (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>SOS events with elevated aminotransferases were transient and resolved rapidly on treatment discontinuation and 75&#x00025; (6/8) occurred within 1 week of treatment initiation. All patients presented with either epigastric/abdominal or biliary pain, often with nausea; one patient receiving eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg was briefly hospitalized to control nausea and vomiting, and the remaining seven were managed as outpatients.</p><p>In the patient with adjudicated pancreatitis consistent with SOS, the abdominal pain was mild, transient, occurred within minutes of the first dose, and was adjudicated as probably drug related. The patient was briefly hospitalized with no complications. In the case of SOS associated with mild lipase elevation, the patient presented with nausea and abdominal pain after 2 doses of study drug. Lipase normalized within 24&#x02009;h of stopping treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>AEs of special interest: pancreatitis</title><p>Including the single event consistent with SOS, seven events were reported as pancreatitis in eluxadoline-treated patients (0.4&#x00025; 7/1,839); three with eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg (0.4&#x00025; 3/807) and four with eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg (0.4&#x00025; 4/1,032; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); six of the seven events were ultimately adjudicated as meeting the Atlanta criteria for pancreatitis (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Of the five adjudicated pancreatitis events not consistent with SOS, three were associated with heavy alcohol use (one in the 75&#x02009;mg group [1/2; 50.0&#x00025;] two in the 100&#x02009;mg group [2/3; 66.7&#x00025;]), one was associated with biliary sludge (75&#x02009;mg group [1/2; 50.0&#x00025;]), and one occurred in a patient who had discontinued eluxadoline 2 weeks before the event (100&#x02009;mg group [1/3; 33.3&#x00025;] <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>The patient with biliary sludge presented with pancreatitis after 26 weeks of treatment and had no history of alcohol use; this patient may therefore have been predisposed to pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), and the event was adjudicated as unlikely to be drug related. The event in the patient who was off drug was also considered unlikely to be drug related due to the time interval and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin during the intervening two weeks.</p><p>All cases of pancreatitis were mild as defined by the Atlanta criteria and all patients discontinued treatment at event onset. All cases resolved clinically, with lipase normalization within days, except in one patient with chronic, severe alcoholism (eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg group), who improved clinically in 1&#x02013;2 days, but required several weeks to normalize enzymes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this pooled analysis of one Phase 2 and two Phase 3 studies, eluxadoline (75 and 100&#x02009;mg doses) was well tolerated in patients with IBS-D, with similar incidence rates of AEs and SAEs across treatment groups.</p><p>The number of patients reporting at least one AE was balanced across treatment groups. Non-serious GI AEs were the most commonly reported AEs in eluxadoline-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo. Although GI SAEs were the most common SAEs reported in any group, overall incidence was low (&#x0003c;0.5&#x00025; for any treatment group). AEs and SAEs were more frequently reported in females compared with males, possibly reflecting gender differences in IBS-D pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Similar safety findings, irrespective of treatment group, were observed for patients &#x0003e;65 years of age, those with BMI &#x02265;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and for patients of white ethnicity.</p><p>Constipation, while infrequent, was the most common GI AE observed with eluxadoline and most often occurred within 3 months of treatment initiation. Similarly, diary-confirmed constipation events based on scores of zero bowel movements or weekly BSFS scores were uncommon, and comparable across eluxadoline and placebo groups (&#x0003c;4&#x00025; in each group), with similar rates reported during the first 3 months after treatment initiation and months 4&#x02013;6. No SAEs of constipation were reported with eluxadoline and discontinuation due to constipation was infrequent.</p><p>Agonism of &#x003bc;-OR and &#x003ba;-ORs is known to increase GI muscle tone, reduce GI motility through reduced contraction and peristalsis, and inhibit secretion from enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). The role of &#x003b4;-OR antagonism by eluxadoline remains unclear, although it may functionally oppose the effects of &#x003bc;-OR agonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). The class effects of &#x003bc;-OR agonists, including loperamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), are associated with drug-induced acute pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) and SOS, through increased SO phasic wave frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>).</p><p>Events consistent with SOS were rare, occurring in 0.5&#x00025; of eluxadoline-treated patients, with a higher incidence in the eluxadoline 100 vs. 75&#x02009;mg group. SOS events most often presented as abdominal pain with elevated aminotransferases and all cases occurred in patients without a gallbladder. Cholecystectomy has been associated with suppression of cholecystokinin-mediated inhibition of SO phasic activity, despite normal bile duct pressure and SO motility compared to the pre-cholecystectomy state (SO phasic wave frequency: 1.6 per minute pre-cholecystectomy vs. 4 per minute post-cholecystectomy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Therefore, eluxadoline's &#x003bc;-OR agonist activity at the SO may further increase SO tone in these patients, increasing the risk of clinically apparent SOS events. This is supported by the observation that the majority of events adjudicated as consistent with SOS occurred with the 100&#x02009;mg dose of eluxadoline occurred early after treatment initiation, and all events rapidly resolved upon treatment discontinuation. Therefore, consistent with FDA-approved labeling, patients without a gallbladder treated with eluxadoline should receive the 75&#x02009;mg dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>) and be monitored for new or worsening abdominal pain, with or without nausea and vomiting, or acute biliary pain with liver or pancreatic enzyme elevations. Although ALT elevations were substantial in some of the events, the rapidity of symptom onset, associated biliary symptoms, and abrupt rise and recovery suggest that these events were typical of a hepatobiliary spasm/obstructive process rather than drug-induced liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). In the patient with asymptomatic ALT elevation &#x0003e;20 &#x000d7; ULN, the time to onset of 18&#x02013;26 weeks was atypical of drug-induced liver toxicity, although a relationship to drug could not be excluded.</p><p>Adjudicated pancreatitis events in eluxadoline-treated patients were rare, clinically mild and transient, and occurred in similar proportions of patients treated with eluxadoline 75 or 100&#x02009;mg. The majority of pancreatitis events not associated with SOS were associated with excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol has been documented to alter pancreatic ductal and periductal anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>), and to contribute to increases in SO pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). While it is possible that the &#x003bc;-OR activity of eluxadoline may have increased SO contractility, which was further exacerbated by alcohol use in patients who experienced pancreatitis, determining a causal relationship with eluxadoline for these events is difficult. Nevertheless, due to the potential for increased risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with excessive alcohol intake alone, eluxadoline is contraindicated in patients with a history of alcohol abuse or addiction, and in patients with chronic or acute excessive alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>).</p><p>The single case of colon ischemia occurred in a patient with multiple comorbidities known to be associated with colon ischemia (including age (72 years), recent polymicrobial sepsis, type II diabetes mellitus, pulmonary hypertension, and concomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use). A causal association with eluxadoline was felt to be unlikely, given the lack of diary reports of constipation and the lack of evidence supporting a physiologic effect on systemic or GI blood flow with eluxadoline or other poorly absorbed OR-targeting anti-diarrheals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>).</p><p>Eluxadoline is an effective treatment option in patients with IBS-D, based on efficacy data from one Phase 2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and two Phase 3 studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In this pooled safety analysis of those studies, eluxadoline was well tolerated and most treatment-emergent AEs occurred early after initiation of treatment, were not serious, and were not associated with any clinically meaningful sequelae. Constipation AEs were infrequent and discontinuation due to constipation was low. Eluxadoline may increase the risk of SOS in patients without a gallbladder, thus, patients without a gallbladder should be monitored during eluxadoline treatment at the recommended dose of 75&#x02009;mg BID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>), and the benefits and risks of eluxadoline should be evaluated in the context of IBS-D symptom severity. There may also be potential for increased risk of pancreatitis with eluxadoline, especially associated with heavy alcohol use. Eluxadoline is therefore contraindicated in patients with a history of pancreatitis, structural diseases of the pancreas, known or suspected SO dysfunction, alcoholism, alcohol abuse, alcohol addiction, or excessive alcohol use (&#x0003e;3 alcoholic beverages per day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>), and patients should avoid chronic or acute excessive alcohol consumption while taking eluxadoline.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Highlights</title><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ajg2016542i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We met criteria for authorship as recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
