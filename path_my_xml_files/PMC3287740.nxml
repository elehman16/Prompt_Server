Hence, 6 clusters will receive the intervention per each time period in a delayed intervention fashion and all clusters will act as controls during the first time period. Study power was insensitive to distributional assumptions under consideration in this case. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The stepped wedge CRT design is robust, flexible, offers a more practical alternative in evaluating intervention in routine practice than other designs and provides an opportunity to model time trends. Despite this, its implementation in routine practice is being hampered by complex statistical issues including sample size estimation. However, we have demonstrated that sample size calculation through power simulation is a simple and efficient approach when the use of routine formulae is impossible. Moreover, it is straightforward to assess sensitivity to issues such as heterogeneity across clusters, including the impact of design constraints such as centre or learning effects. We propose simulation-based power calculations should be considered routine practice in such circumstances. Finally, using a computer is easier than finding a book with the right formula.</p></sec></body></article>
