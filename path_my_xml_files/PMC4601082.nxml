A prospective randomized controlled trial of DFI patients was carried out. Patients were randomized into 2 groups when signs and symptoms had resolved: continuing antibiotics group (CAG) and discontinuing antibiotics group (DAG). The recurrence and clinical outcomes were recorded. The recurrence rate of mild infection with mild/moderate PAD was similar in the 2 groups. Compared with CAG, the recurrence rate of mild infection with severe PAD was higher in DAG (<italic>P</italic> = .030), also for moderate/severe infection with PAD (mild/moderate [<italic>P</italic> = .032]; severe [<italic>P</italic> = .008]). No difference was found in the 2 groups (either mild or moderate/severe) for those without PAD. The clinical outcomes of mild infection in patients were similar in the 2 groups. For moderate/severe infection, the healing rate was higher (73.3% vs 48.3%), and the rate of minor/major amputation and death was lower (23.8% vs 49.4%; 6.9% vs 20.7%; 2.0% vs 13.8%) in the CAG. When the clinical signs and symptoms of infection have resolved, it might be appropriate to stop antibiotics for DFI patients without PAD, and also for patients with mild infection with mild/moderate PAD. For patients with mild infection with severe PAD and moderate/severe infection with PAD, we should perhaps continue antibiotic treatment. Continuing antibiotic therapy could improve clinical outcomes for patients with moderate/severe infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>diabetic foot</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>antibiotic therapy</kwd><kwd>clinical outcomes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Infections of the foot are common in persons with diabetes mellitus (DM).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534734615596891" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Diabetic foot infection (DFI) is now the most frequent diabetic complication requiring hospitalization and is often the pivotal event leading to lower extremity amputation.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534734615596891" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1534734615596891" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Most of these amputations are probably avoidable by appropriate care, including topical and/or systemic antimicrobials, restitution of skin perfusion, pressure offloading, appropriate debridement, surgical procedures, disinfection, and use of appropriate dressings.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534734615596891" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Antibiotic therapy is necessary for all clinically infected diabetic foot (DF) wounds, because antibiotic therapy is associated with frequent adverse effects, high financial costs, and increasing risk of antibiotic resistance.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1534734615596891" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Therefore, how to reasonable use antibiotics for DFI is a very crucial problem for clinicians. According to the 2012 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of DFI, duration of antibiotic therapy for a DFI should be based on the severity of the infection, the presence or absence of bone infection, and clinical response to therapy, and antibiotic therapy can generally be discontinued when signs and symptoms of infection have resolved.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1534734615596891" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>However, whether the degree of lower limb ischemia could influence the antibiotic therapy duration of DFI is unknown. And no study to our knowledge has investigated if stopping antibiotic therapy may increase wound infection recurrence and influence the clinical outcomes of patients when clinical symptoms and signs of infection have resolved. This study aimed to discuss whether there was a difference in continuing and discontinuing antibiotic therapy of DFI patients with different degrees of lower limb ischemia or without ischemia after clinical symptoms and signs of infection had resolved.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-1534734615596891"><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective randomized controlled trial of patients with diabetic foot ulcer infection was carried out in the Metabolic Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from March 2010 to August 2012.

Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured by a HLC-T OSOH 723 G7 automated glycated hemoglobin analyzer. Plasma concentrations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was determined using commercially available kits (Finland Orion Diagnostica Company, Espoo, Finland).

Patients with PAD were given medical treatment, including prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) and/or Cilostazol (4 weeks). All patients were given low-molecular-weight heparin 5000 U once per day to prevent venous thrombosis of lower limbs for an average of 7 to 10 days. Empirical antibiotic therapy (intravenous and/or oral antibiotics) was initially started based on the DFI duration, previous antibiotic treatment, any available microbiological data, and the severity of the infection. For the patients with mild infection, and/or without antibiotic therapy history, infection duration less than 2 weeks was treated with agents that only covered aerobic Gram-positive cocci (GPC) for 1 to 2 weeks. For the patients with more extensive chronic moderate, severe infections, the agents that were against aerobic GPC, as well as common gram-negative, were given, and agents covering obligate anaerobic organisms were also given for patients with deep abscess and/or stench. Therapy was modified according to the antibiotic susceptibility results and the clinical response. The infected wound care was according to the IDSA guideline (2004). The wound was washed carefully by saline and covered with sterile saline gauze or Vaseline oil gauze once a day. Patients with deep abscess and necrotic soft tissue were treated with debridement in time. The patients with severe infection and good blood supply were treated with debridement in 24 hours after admission. For the patients with severe ischemia, debridement was given after the blood supply improved.

This was not consistent with the IDSA guidelines, which showed that most patients with mild infections can be treated as outpatients. In our hospital, there was no outpatient treatment center. In addition, we found that most of the mild infection patients lacked understanding of glucose control and the severity of DFI, thus leading to severe DFI.</p><p>In terms of the recurrence rate, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the mild infection patients, but in the moderate or severe cases, it was significantly higher in the DAG than CAG (44.8% vs 23.8%, <italic>P</italic> = .002). Combining infection severity and PAD grade, we found that the infection recurrence rate of mild infection with severe PAD in DAG was higher than CAG (35.1% vs 12.5%, <italic>P</italic> = .030), and also in moderate/severe infection with mild/moderate PAD (40.0% vs 18.6%, <italic>P</italic> = .032) and severe PAD (60.6% vs 30.4%, <italic>P</italic> = .008). And the risk of infection recurrence was increased by 2.9 times and 3.5 times, respectively, in moderate/severe infection patients with mild/moderate PAD or severe PAD. It means that either infection severity or PAD grade has an influence on infection recurrence in DFI patients when the clinical signs and symptoms of infection have resolved. The 2 groups had similar clinical outcomes for patients with mild infection. However, for moderate/severe infection cases, healing rate (73.3% vs 48.3%, <italic>P</italic> = .000) in CAG was higher and the minor amputation rate (23.8% vs 49.4%, <italic>P</italic> = .000), major amputation rate (6.9% vs 20.7%, <italic>P</italic> = .006), and death rate (4.0% vs 13.8%, <italic>P</italic> = .016) were lower than DAG.</p><p>A previous study<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1534734615596891" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> reported a controlled trial about antibiotic treatment for purely neuropathic (without ischemia) forefoot ulcers in diabetes, and there was no difference in healing rate or ulcer size of the 2 groups after the 20-day follow-up.

Therefore, blood circulation may determine the duration of antibiotics, especially the degree of ischemia may have different strengths due to the influence of antibiotic treatment. We considered that clinical infection and outcomes were influenced by PAD and infection severity. Lipsky also holds the opinion that in some instances of extensive infection, large areas of gangrene or necrotic tissue, or poor vascular supply, more prolonged therapy may be needed.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1534734615596891" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>We found that for most of the patients both in CAG (73.3%, 22/30) and DAG (85.9%, 49/57), recurrence of infection occurred in the first week of observation. Thus, we speculated that patients with DFI, especially moderate/severe infection with PAD and mild infection with severe PAD after treatment whose signs and symptoms have reduced, may need to prolong the antibiotic treatment by 1 to 2 weeks. Further clinical studies are needed to prove this hypothesis.</p><p>The main limitations of the study are the following: this was a single-center randomized controlled study; the follow-up period was only 4.6 months on average; we could not analyze the mid- and long-term complications including late recurrences. In addition, the patients who required revascularization were excluded in the study, and further study should pay attention to this problem.</p><p>In spite of the aforementioned limitations, our study highlighted that when the clinical signs and symptoms of infection resolved, it might be appropriate to stop antibiotics for DFI patients without PAD, also for mild infection patients with mild or moderate PAD. For mild infection with severe PAD and moderate/severe infection with PAD patients, perhaps we should continue antibiotic treatment. Continuing antibiotic therapy could improve clinical outcomes for moderate/severe infection patients when signs and symptoms have resolved.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Tianjin Natural Science Foundation of China (10JCZDJC19800), Tianjin Medical University Science Foundation (2008KY17), and Tianjin Health Bureau Technology Fund (09KZ87).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1534734615596891"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
