Safety assessment included recording of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs. Pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics were evaluated, and disease activity was assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 161 patients, 121 received sifalimumab (26 received 0.3 mg/kg; 25, 1.0 mg/kg; 27, 3.0 mg/kg; and 43, 10 mg/kg) and 40 received placebo. Patients were predominantly female (95.7%). At baseline, patients had moderate-to-severe disease activity (mean SLE Disease Activity Index score 11.0), and most (75.2%) had a high type I interferon (IFN) gene signature. In the sifalimumab group versus the placebo group, the incidence of &#x02265;1 treatment-emergent AE was 92.6% versus 95.0%, &#x02265;1 serious AE was 22.3% versus 27.5%, and &#x02265;1 infection was 67.8% versus 62.5%; discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 9.1% versus 7.5%, and death occurred in 3.3% (n = 4) versus 2.5% (n = 1). Serum sifalimumab concentrations increased in a linear and dose-proportional manner. Inhibition of the type I IFN gene signature was sustained during treatment in patients with a high baseline signature. No statistically significant differences in clinical activity (SLEDAI and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group score) between sifalimumab and placebo were observed. However, when adjusted for excess burst steroids, SLEDAI change from baseline showed a positive trend over time. A trend toward normal complement C3 or C4 level at week 26 was seen in the sifalimumab groups compared with baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The observed safety/tolerability and clinical activity profile of sifalimumab support its continued clinical development for SLE.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with complex pathogenesis and an unpredictable clinical course including flares of disease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). It is characterized by the production of autoantibodies, inflammation, and tissue damage in multiple organs from the deposition of immune complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The consequences of active SLE include organ damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), long-term morbidity, and an increased risk of mortality, often from infections and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Active SLE is also associated with reduced quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and high economic burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). SLE activity is treated with antimalarials, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). A biologic treatment targeting B lymphocyte stimulator, belimumab, has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), and a number of other biologic drugs are in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Current treatments often have considerable toxicity and elicit partial or variable responses, so there remains a significant unmet need for treatments with improved efficacy and an acceptable safety profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The cytokine family of type I interferons (IFNs), and especially the IFN&#x003b1; subtypes, are implicated as important players in SLE pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Several observations support this. IFN&#x003b1; treatment is sometimes associated with the development of autoantibodies and even SLE-like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In patients with SLE, high type I IFN or IFN-driven chemokine levels are associated with greater disease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Genetic polymorphisms of several components of the IFN signaling pathway have been associated with an increased risk of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Furthermore, mice deficient in the IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor have been shown to exhibit reduced signs and symptoms of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), and the IFN&#x003b1; kinoid vaccine prevents clinical manifestations in a lupus flare model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Therefore, IFN&#x003b1; subtypes have been identified as a potential target for drug development in SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p><p>Sifalimumab (formerly, MEDI-545) is a human anti&#x02013;IFN&#x003b1; monoclonal antibody that binds to and specifically neutralizes most IFN&#x003b1; subtypes, preventing signaling through the type I IFN receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). In a phase Ia study of patients with SLE, single doses of sifalimumab were shown to have linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (PK) and dose-dependent inhibition of the type I IFN&#x02013;inducible gene signature. The safety and immunogenicity profile of sifalimumab supported further clinical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of intravenous (IV) sifalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe SLE. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the PK and immunogenicity of sifalimumab. In addition, the effect of sifalimumab on the expression of type I IFN&#x02013;inducible genes in the blood and disease activity were evaluated.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase Ib, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of multiple IV doses of sifalimumab in adult patients with SLE (MI-CP152; NCT00482989). The study consisted of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a 26-week treatment period, and a 24-week followup period. Patients were divided into 4 dose cohorts. Incremental dose escalation occurred following a blinded safety review of data after the twelfth patient reached 6 weeks of exposure.</p><p>Patients were categorized by type I IFN&#x02013;inducible gene signature (low or undetectable versus high) from a panel of 21 type I IFN&#x02013;inducible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). For each category, treatment was assigned using a central interactive voice response system (block randomization), to avoid a large imbalance of gene signature&#x02013;positive patients in any one treatment group. The randomization list was generated by United BioSource Corporation. Patients and clinical site staff were blinded with regard to treatment allocation throughout the study. Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 mg/kg sifalimumab or placebo as an IV infusion administered over &#x02265;60 minutes every 2 weeks for a total of 14 doses.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Adults age &#x02265;18 years with moderate-to-severe SLE were enrolled in the study.

Patients with elevated findings on liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &#x0003e;2 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) that resulted from liver involvement in SLE in the opinion of the investigator were not excluded from the study.</p><p>Concomitant medications were to remain unchanged for 1 month (2 weeks for oral corticosteroids) prior to study start until day 196, apart from burst-and-taper corticosteroids to control SLE flare. Up to two courses, of &#x02264;14 days each, of burst oral steroids of up to 40 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, or no more than 160 mg/course of intramuscular methylprednisolone or equivalent, were allowed between day 0 and day 126. No burst steroids were allowed on or after day 126, and tapering of burst steroids was to have been completed by day 142. During the followup period after day 196, steroid dosage could be changed as needed.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from patients before study entry or any study-specific activities were carried out. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Guidance for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><sec><title>Primary end point</title><p>The primary end point was the safety and tolerability of sifalimumab. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) and their severity, outcome, and any relationship to the study medication were recorded by the investigator throughout the study. AEs were considered likely to be related to study medication if they were possibly, probably, or definitely related to study medication according to investigator assessment. SLE flare was recorded as an AE only if the organ system involved had been inactive or if disease activity in the organ system involved was considerably worse than it was during the year prior to study entry. Additional safety variables included findings on physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiography, viral cultures and titers, hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary end points</title><p>Blood samples for PK and antisifalimumab antibody assessments were obtained at screening (if the patient had previously received sifalimumab), on day 0, every 2 weeks to week 26 during the treatment period, at the beginning of the followup period (day 185), at weeks 27 and 28, and every 4 weeks during the followup period. Concentrations of sifalimumab in serum samples were measured using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The detection, confirmation, and titer measurement of antisifalimumab antibody were conducted using a validated drug-tolerant, solution-phase, bridging electrochemiluminescence assay at screening (if the patient had previously received sifalimumab), on day 0, at weeks 4, 8, and 16 during the treatment period, and at weeks 28, 34, 42, and 50 during the followup period (see Supplementary text, available on the <italic>Arthritis &#x00026; Rheumatism</italic> web site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.37824/abstract">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.37824/abstract</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Exploratory end points</title><p>Blood samples for measurements of the expression of type I&#x02013;inducible genes were obtained at screening, on day 0, at weeks 4, 8, and 16 during the treatment period, and at weeks 28, 30, 34, 42, and 50 during the followup period. RNA extracted from the blood was evaluated for the expression of the 21 type I&#x02013;inducible genes. The median fold change in expression was used as a pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). In subgroup analyses, 4 of the 21 genes (from baseline specimens) were used to stratify patients into subgroups based on type I IFN gene signature (high or low). As a continuous score, the 4-gene score is 99% correlated with the 21-gene score (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1</xref>, available on the <italic>Arthritis &#x00026; Rheumatism</italic> web site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.37824/abstract">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.37824/abstract</ext-link>).</p><p>Disease activity was measured using 2 instruments: the SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) and the BILAG index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). These were administered at screening, at the beginning and end of the treatment period, and every 4 weeks during the treatment and followup periods by rheumatologists trained in the SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI and BILAG assessments. SLE flare was defined as a worsening of the SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI score of &#x0003e;3 points from baseline or as a new grade A or B BILAG score in at least 1 of the 8 organ-based systems compared with baseline. Disease activity was also estimated by measuring the levels of complement C3 and C4 in blood.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>No formal sample size calculation was performed, since the primary end point was safety and tolerability. A sample size of 148 patients was planned, with 32 patients in dose cohorts for 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg sifalimumab, and 52 patients in the dose cohort for 10.0 mg/kg sifalimumab. Each cohort could be expanded by 4 patients per protocol.</p><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all patients randomized) was used to summarize patient disposition, baseline demographics, and disease characteristics. The modified ITT population, which comprised all patients who were randomized and received study medication, was used for measurements of PD and disease activity. The safety population comprised patients who received any study medication, and the PK population comprised patients in the modified ITT population who had &#x02265;1 valid serum sifalimumab concentration assessment after dosing began.</p><p>No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned for the primary end point. Continuous data were summarized by descriptive statistics, and treatment group comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance. Categorical data were analyzed by the number and percentage of patients in each category. PK parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin version 5.2 (Pharsight). Serum sifalimumab concentrations were summarized by treatment group and sampling time. The first and last dose peak concentrations, area under the concentration curve within a dosing interval, steady-state clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal-phase half-life were estimated. For disease activity measured by SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI and BILAG, the last observation carried forward method was used for missing data. A post hoc analysis of disease activity, measured by SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI, was adjusted for burst steroids in excess of that permitted by the protocol. Patients who received excess burst steroids were considered to be nonresponders from the time the burst began.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Disposition and baseline characteristics of the patients</title><p>The study started on March 1, 2008 and was completed on July 20, 2010.

In the placebo group, 3 patients (7.5%) had &#x02265;1 AE that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study medication (herpes encephalitis and infection, weight increase, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma). Infusion reactions were reported in 1 patient receiving sifalimumab 3.0 mg/kg (grade 1), 2 patients receiving sifalimumab 10.0 mg/kg (grade 2 and grade 3), and 1 patient receiving placebo (grade 1). Three patients developed malignancies, including metastatic chondrosarcoma (1 patient receiving placebo) and B cell lymphoma (1 patient each in the placebo and sifalimumab 10.0 mg/kg groups).</p><p>Five deaths occurred, of herpes encephalitis and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (in the placebo group), liver failure due to accidental multiple drug overdose (in the sifalimumab 1.0 mg/kg group), congestive heart failure and SLE flare (in the sifalimumab 10.0 mg/kg group), pneumococcal sepsis (in the sifalimumab 10.0 mg/kg group), and cardiorespiratory arrest and septic shock (in the sifalimumab 10.0 mg/kg group). Of these, only the patient who died of pneumococcal sepsis had additional nonfatal AEs (cholestasis and hepatic necrosis), which were considered by the investigator as possibly related to study medication. Although sepsis contributed to the deterioration in health of 2 patients prior to death, the deaths occurred at least 3 months after the last administration of sifalimumab. However, due to the long half-life of sifalimumab, a potential role of the drug in contributing to the infection cannot be excluded. There were other factors or conditions that led to the deaths of these patients, including lymphoma and chemotherapy in the first patient and cholestatic syndrome and liver necrosis in the second patient.

Similar frequencies of AEs occurred in the combined sifalimumab and placebo groups. The most frequent AEs in the sifalimumab groups were SLE flare, urinary tract infection, nausea, hypokalemia, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and headache. AEs were reported at similar frequencies across the dose groups, except for SLE flares, which decreased at higher sifalimumab doses, and headache and viral infection, which were more frequent at higher sifalimumab doses. Discontinuation rates for AEs in the sifalimumab groups (9.1%) and placebo group (7.5%) were similar. Three patients developed malignancies, 1 in the sifalimumab 10.0 mg/kg group and 2 in the placebo group.</p><p>Five deaths occurred, 1 in the sifalimumab 1.0 mg/kg group, 3 in the sifalimumab 10.0 mg/kg group, and 1 in the placebo group. There were 2 infections in the sifalimumab 10 mg/kg group, septic shock and pneumococcal sepsis, that resulted in 2 of the deaths more than 3 months after the last dose of sifalimumab. While there were contributing factors that led to the deaths (chemotherapy and lymphoma in 1 patient and hepatic necrosis and cholestatic syndrome in 1 patient), the potential contribution of sifalimumab to the deaths cannot be excluded, due to the long half-life of sifalimumab and the risk assessed with larger numbers of patients and longer periods of observation.</p><p>The multiple-dose PK of sifalimumab in this study was linear and dose-proportional over the dose range 0.3&#x02013;10.0 mg/kg. The low systemic clearance (0.19&#x02013;0.24 liters/day), small volume of distribution (5.0&#x02013;6.3 liters), and terminal half-life of 20&#x02013;29 days were representative of a monoclonal antibody without target-mediated clearance. In the previous phase Ia study of sifalimumab, single-dose PK was also linear and dose-proportional across the dose range tested (1&#x02013;30 mg/kg). Inhibition of the 21-gene type I IFN signature was dose dependent, and there was a trend toward improvement in disease activity in sifalimumab-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>In this study, sifalimumab exhibited a dose-dependent target neutralization as in the phase Ia study described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). In contrast to the early phase Ia study, however, IFN target neutralization was significantly less in this group of SLE patients with moderate-to-severe disease than previously reported in SLE patients with mild disease. The reason for this difference is not clear but may reflect increased contributions of types I&#x003b2; and &#x003b4; IFNs to the target signature in patients with moderate-to-severe SLE. Sifalimumab inhibits most but not all type I IFN&#x003b1; subtypes but does not inhibit &#x003b2; or &#x003b4; IFNs. The higher incidence of antisifalimumab antibodies, 24.0% in patients receiving sifalimumab and 2.5% in patients receiving placebo, in this multiple-dose study is reflective of the use of a sensitive and drug-tolerant assay for detecting antisifalimumab antibodies. There was no impact of antisifalimumab antibodies on sifalimumab PK in patients who tested positive for antisifalimumab antibodies.</p><p>In measurements of disease activity, which were included only as an exploratory end point, the heterogeneous baseline characteristics and the ascending dose design made comparisons between groups difficult, and the small number of patients in each group limited the usefulness of the data. The effect of sifalimumab on disease activity was similar to that of placebo, as assessed by SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI and BILAG scores, except in post hoc analyses, in which positive trends were observed in the combined sifalimumab group and the subgroup of patients with a high type I IFN gene signature at baseline, and when these were adjusted for burst steroids in excess of that permitted in the protocol. There was a trend toward normalization of both C3 and C4 complement levels in patients with low levels at baseline, more frequently in the sifalimumab group than the placebo group over time. Complement components (C3 or C4) are considered biomarkers of disease activity in SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>The heterogeneous nature of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) makes it a prime candidate for individualized treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. This, in turn, raises the need for biomarkers to identify patients who may benefit from anti-IFN&#x003b1; therapies. The 21-gene type I IFN signature has been successfully used as a PD marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). A 4-gene subset of these 21 genes has subsequently been identified as a potential predictive marker to identify patients who may respond to sifalimumab treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). In the post hoc analyses of this study, the 4-gene signature was used to stratify patients into groups of those with high and those with low type I IFN activity, with a prevalence of high type I IFN activity of &#x0223c;75% in patients with moderate-to-severe SLE. Inhibition of the expression of the type I IFN gene signature by sifalimumab is indicative of its inhibition of type I IFN signaling by blockade of IFN&#x003b1;. Incomplete suppression of the type I IFN gene signature both in this study and in the earlier phase I study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) suggests that other type I IFNs in SLE may contribute to the activation of the type I IFN pathway. This hypothesis is being investigated.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution, especially for data on disease activity, since this was an exploratory end point. It should be noted that the cohorts had variable enrollment by country and site, which may have introduced bias. For example, the sifalimumab 0.3 mg/kg cohort was enrolled entirely from the US, while the sifalimumab 3.0 mg/kg cohort was less than half US-based. Since patients in the placebo group were randomized with each dosing cohort, this also meant that the placebo group contained variations by geographic origin. A further geographic difference was noted with regard to type I IFN gene signature. A higher proportion of patients enrolled in South America (91.3%; n = 46) had a high type I IFN gene signature than those enrolled in North America (69.6%; n = 115).</p><p>A 4-week interruption in study drug administration while the death of 1 study patient was investigated occurred late in the study, and this meant that the interruption of dosing affected chiefly the 10.0 mg/kg cohort. The influence of changes in background medication, such as burst-and-taper courses of corticosteroids, on disease activity measures was another limitation of the study design. Finally, the heterogeneous baseline characteristics of this study population make between-group comparisons difficult. This is, however, a common difficulty in conducting clinical studies in SLE, where patients have highly variable disease characteristics in terms of organs affected, severity of organ damage, disease activity, and frequency and severity of SLE flares, and may also have AEs induced by standard therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, at multiple IV doses, sifalimumab appears to have an adequate safety and tolerability profile in adults with moderate-to-severe SLE, supporting the continued clinical development of sifalimumab in this disease. A currently ongoing larger phase IIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study is under the observation of an independent data safety monitoring board to further characterize the safety profile.</p></sec><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
