involved in the pathophysiology of diverse neuropsychiatric diseases. Previous
transcranial magnetic stimulation studies suggested that acute application of selective
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors enhances cortical excitability in the human brain.
However, other, such like clinical effects, usually require prolonged noradrenaline
reuptake inhibitor treatment, which might go along with different physiological
effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic effects of the
selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine on cortical excitability in
healthy humans in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study.
Sixteen subjects were assessed with different transcranial magnetic stimulation
measurements: motor thresholds, input-output curve, short-latency intracortical
inhibition and intracortical facilitation, I-wave facilitation, and short-interval
afferent inhibition before and after placebo or reboxetine (8 mg) single-dose
administration. Afterwards, the same subjects took reboxetine (8 mg/d) consecutively for
21 days. During this period (subjects underwent 2 experimental sessions with identical
transcranial magnetic stimulation measures under placebo or reboxetine), transcranial
magnetic stimulation measurements were assessed before and after drug intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both single-dose and chronic administration of reboxetine increased cortical
excitability; increased the slope of the input-output curve, intracortical facilitation,
and I-wave facilitation; but decreased short-latency intracortical inhibition and
short-interval afferent inhibition. Moreover, chronic reboxetine showed a larger
enhancement of intracortical facilitation and I-wave facilitation compared with
single-dose application.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results show physiological mechanisms of noradrenergic enhancement possibly
underlying the functional effects of reboxetine regarding acute and chronic
application.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>reboxetine</kwd><kwd>noradrenaline</kwd><kwd>cortical excitability</kwd><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance Statement</title></caption><p>Acute and chronic enhancement of noradrenergic brain activity via single dose and chronic
administration of reboxetine (RBX) increases cortical excitability via enhancement of
facilitation and reduction of inhibition. Chronic RBX resulted in larger increase of
intracortical facilitation and I-wave facilitation compared with single dose administration.
Chronic RBX itself, without an additional acute loading dose, enhances corticospinal
excitability and I-wave facilitation compared to placebo medication.</p></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Noradrenaline is a neuromodulator in the central nervous system that regulates various
neuropsychological processes (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Robinson, 2012</xref>;
<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bhagya et al., 2015</xref>). A single dose of the
selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NRI), reboxetine (RBX), can improve working
memory and motor learning in healthy subjects as well as in clinical populations such as
depression and stroke (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2003</xref>;
<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Plewnia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
The physiological foundation for these effects might be the impact of noradrenaline on
neuroplasticity and cortical excitability. Animal studies have shown that noradrenaline
enhances long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as long-term depression (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kirwood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Nakadate et
al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Tully et al., 2007</xref>). The
direction of LTP and long-term depression depends on the activation of &#x003b1;- and
&#x003b2;-adrenoreceptors. Typically, activation of &#x003b2;-adrenoreceptors enhances LTP, whereas the
activation of &#x003b1;-adrenoreceptors reduces it (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Kemp and
Manahan-Vaughan, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Marzo et al.,
2009</xref>). These receptors also affect various intracellular processes such as ion
channel opening via modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) receptors (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Tully et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Recently, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures have been applied to test the
effects of noradrenaline on cortical excitability in humans. Corticospinal excitability can
be assessed by active and resting motor thresholds (MTs) and the input-output curve (I-O
curve) (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abbruzzese and Trompetto, 2002</xref>). MTs reflect neuronal membrane
excitability and depend primarily on ion channel activity, as they are increased by
voltage-gated sodium channel blockers, but not affected by drugs modulating GABAergic or
glutamatergic transmission (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Ziemann et al., 1996</xref>,
<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">1998a</xref>). The I-O curve serves as an index of
excitability of larger neuronal populations compared with MTs (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abbruzzese and
Trompetto, 2002</xref>). The I-O curve depends on neuronal membrane excitability, because
its slope is decreased by sodium and calcium channel blockers. Furthermore, synaptic
mechanisms are involved as it is modulated by drugs influencing the GABAergic and
glutamatergic system (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Broojerdi et al., 1999</xref>;
<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Di Lazzaro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Paulus et al., 2008</xref>). Short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI)
and intracortical facilitation (ICF), and motor cortex indirect waves (I-waves) are studied
by paired-pulse TMS. SICI is mainly influenced by glutamate and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors
and based on the induction of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Ziemann et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">1998a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Liepert et al., 1997</xref>). ICF is
thought to reflect activity of GABAergic and glutamatergic systems. I-waves are thought to
be primarily controlled by GABA-related neuronal circuits (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Ziemann et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">1998b</xref>). In previous studies, a single dose of RBX enhanced the slope of I-O curve
and ICF but showed no effect on MTs and intracortical inhibition (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Plewnia et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Herwig et al. (2002)</xref> reported
increased ICF, but also decreased intracortical inhibition under RBX. With regard to the
contribution of adrenergic receptor subtypes, following a single dose of the
&#x003b1;-2-adrenoreceptor agonist guanfacine, a decrease of the I-O curve and ICF as well as an
increase of intracortical inhibition have been described (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Korchounov et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the RBX-induced excitability
enhancement, which differs relevantly from the effect of &#x003b1;-2-adrenoreceptor activation,
might be primarily driven by excitatory effects of &#x003b2;-adrenoreceptors. These findings confirm
that noradrenaline is involved in human brain excitability, but the mechanism is complex and
probably receptor subtype dependent. The above-mentioned pharmacological TMS studies were
conducted via single-dose protocols. In clinical applications, therapeutic effects are
usually obtained after some weeks (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kasper et al.,
2000</xref>). It might be speculated that the physiological effects of the respective
substances differ between single dose and chronic treatment. Therefore, we aimed to compare
the effects of single dose with chronic treatment of RBX on motor cortex excitability in
healthy volunteers, using a variety of single and paired-pulse TMS measures tackling
different ion channels and receptors. In accordance with previous studies, we hypothesized
that a single dose of RBX enhances cortical excitability in healthy humans. According to the
superior clinical results obtained from chronic treatment, we furthermore hypothesized that
chronic application might also lead to more pronounced enhancement of cortical excitability
compared with a single-dose application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Sixteen healthy subjects (8 females) aged 27.5&#x000b1;4.01 years (mean &#x000b1; SD) were recruited.
Subjects were all right-handed, between 18 and 50 years old, and currently nonpregnant.
None of them had a history of neurological diseases, electric implants in the body, or
took other medications during the study period. Written informed consent was obtained from
all subjects who participated in the study before inclusion. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the University of G&#x000f6;ttingen and conformed to the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Pharmacological Intervention</title><p>Eight mg reboxetine (RBX) or an equivalent placebo (PLC) drug was administered 2 hours
before the start of each experimental session, allowing the verum substance to induce a
stable plasma level and prominent effects in the central nervous system (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Pellizzoni et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Dostert et al., 1997</xref>). Steady-state plasma concentrations are
achieved after 5 days of drug intake, and clinically, the majority of antidepressants have
therapeutic effects after approximately 2 weeks of treatment (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Dostert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kasper et
al., 2000</xref>). Thus, for the chronic RBX condition, we designated a 3-week period of
RBX intervention and started to measure cortical excitability after 2 weeks of
application.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Monitoring of Motor Cortical Excitability</title><p>Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were induced in the right abductor digiti minimi muscle
(ADM) by single-pulse TMS over the left primary motor cortex, conducted by a Magstim 200
magnetic stimulator (Magstim Company) with a figure-of-eight magnetic coil (diameter of
one winding=70 mm; peak magnetic field=2.2 T). For the paired-pulse TMS protocols, the
coil was connected to 2 Magstim 200 stimulators via a bistim module. The coil was held
tangentially to the skull, with the handle pointing backwards and laterally at 45&#x000b0; from
midline. The optimal position was defined as the site where TMS resulted consistently in
the largest MEP. Surface electromyography was recorded from the right ADM by use of
Ag-AgCl electrodes in a belly tendon montage. The signals were amplified, and band-pass
filtered (2 Hz to 2 kHz; sampling rate, 5 kHz). Signals were digitized with a power 1401
data acquisition interface (Cambridge Electronic Design) and stored for offline
analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Motor Threshold Determination</title><p>The resting MT (RMT) was defined as the minimum TMS intensity that elicited a
peak-to-peak MEP of 50 to 100 &#x003bc;V in the relaxed muscle in at least 3 of 6 consecutive
trials. The active MT (AMT) was the minimum intensity eliciting a MEP response of ~200 to
300 &#x003bc;V during moderate spontaneous background muscle activity (~15% of the maximum muscle
strength) in at least 3 of 6 consecutive trials.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>I-O Curve</title><p>The I-O curve was determined using TMS intensities of 100, 110, 130, and 150% RMT (15
stimuli per block [each intensity], with the order of the blocks randomized).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>SICI-ICF</title><p>Short-latency intracortical inhibition and facilitation were measured by a TMS
paired-pulse protocol including ISIs of 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 ms. The first 3 ISIs represent
inhibitory, and the last 2 ISIs reveal facilitatory effects, which reflect excitability of
inhibitory and excitatory interneurons, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Kujirai et al., 1993</xref>). In this protocol, the subthreshold conditioning stimulus
(determined as 70% of AMT) precedes the test stimulus. The test pulse was adjusted to
achieve a baseline MEP of ~1 mV and readjusted during the respective stimulation
protocols, if needed, to compensate for effects of global excitability changes on
test-pulse amplitude. The pairs of stimuli were organized in 15 blocks, where each ISI was
represented once together with one additional single test pulse in a pseudo-randomized
order for each block.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>I-Wave Facilitation</title><p>I-wave facilitation was investigated using a TMS paired-pulse protocol including ISIs of
1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9, 4.1, 4.3, and 4.5 ms (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Ziemann et al., 1998b</xref>). In this protocol, the TMS test stimulus
precedes the conditioning stimulus (determined as 70% of RMT). The test pulse was adjusted
to achieve a baseline MEP of ~1 mV and readjusted during the respective stimulation
protocols, if needed, to compensate for effects of global excitability changes on
test-pulse amplitude. The pairs of stimuli were organized in blocks in which each ISI and
one test pulse was represented once and was pseudo-randomized. These blocks were repeated
15 times.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Short-Interval Afferent Inhibition (SAI)</title><p>SAI combines peripheral and motor cortex stimulation to evaluate activity of the
cholinergic systems in the human brain (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Di Lazzaro et

and an intensity of 200% of the perceptual threshold) over the ulnar nerve precedes the
motor cortex TMS test pulse. The test pulse was adjusted to achieve a baseline MEP of ~1
mV and readjusted during the respective stimulation protocols, if needed, to compensate
for effects of global excitability changes on test-pulse amplitude. Peripheral nerve
stimulation was delivered by a Digitimer D185 stimulator (Digitimer Ltd). Interstimulus
intervals of 20 and 40 milliseconds between the peripheral and cortical stimulus were used
(<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Di Lazzaro et al., 2006</xref>). The
control-conditioning test pairs and a single TMS pulse control condition were recorded 20
times in random order.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><p>The study was conducted in a partial crossover design. In the chronic medication
condition, we had no participant group that received chronic placebo medication for weeks.
The study was divided into 2 parts, each with 2 experimental sessions. Within each part,
sessions were carried out in randomized order and separated by at least 1 week. All
volunteers completed both parts of the study (4 sessions). The first part (2 sessions) of
the experiment explored single dose RBX effects. Subjects were seated in a comfortable
chair with head and arm rests. The right ADM hotspot was determined over the left primary
motor cortex, and 20 MEPs were recorded with the TMS intensity, which elicited on average
MEP of 1 mV amplitude (SI<sub>1mV</sub>). Afterwards, RMT and AMT were determined using
standard procedures. After measuring AMT, a 15-minute break followed to avoid a possible
effect of muscle contraction on the next measurements. After this break, the following
parameters were recorded in randomized order as baseline measures: I-O curve, SICI-ICF,
I-wave facilitation, and SAI. Afterwards, the participants took single-dose placebo (sPLC)
or RBX (sRBX). Two hours after medication, TMS was readjusted to obtain single test pulse
amplitudes of 1 mV, if needed. Then all of the above-mentioned parameters were measured
again. The second part (2 sessions) of the experiment explored chronic RBX effects. The
same participants received RBX (8 mg/d) consecutively for 21 days. During this period, the
other 2 sessions with RBX (chronic RBX condition [cRBX]: with RBX at the day of
experiment) or placebo (chronic placebo condition [cPLC]: with placebo at the day of
experiment) were conducted in randomized order at the end of the second and third week
after the start of chronic drug intake. The procedure in each session was the same as in

randomized order. Two hours after intake of the medication, the same TMS measurements
were repeated to explore the effect RBX on excitability. For the chronic part (2

Accordingly, after application of single-dose and chronic RBX, SAI was significantly

enhancement on cortical excitability in healthy subjects by different TMS protocols
(corticospinal excitability: MTs and I-O curves; intracortical excitability: SICI-ICF,
I-wave facilitation, and SAI). In general, our findings show enhanced corticospinal
excitability, ICF, and I-wave facilitation, but reduced intracortical inhibition and SAI
after single-dose and chronic RBX intake. Furthermore, ICF and I-wave facilitation were more
prominently enhanced in the chronic medication condition compared with a single dose. These
findings might partially explain why the onset of action of antidepressants takes several
weeks in clinical application (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Heinbotham and Dunwiddie,
1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>).
Additionally, chronic RBX itself without an additional acute loading dose enhanced
facilitation of I-O curve and I-wave facilitation compared with placebo medication, which
shows that chronic application of RBX itself results in prolonged excitability
alteration.</p><p>Regarding corticospinal excitability, AMT, RMT, as well as SI<sub>1mV</sub> did not differ
between single-dose RBX, chronic RBX, and placebo medication. However, I-O curve MEP
amplitudes were enhanced under both single-dose and chronic RBX conditions. Animal studies
showing that noradrenaline enhances glutamatergic facilitation in the hippocampus might
explain these results, as higher TMS intensities of the I-O curve are affected by
glutamatergic mechanisms (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2007</xref>).
Moreover, our results are in line with previous human studies that found that single-dose
RBX and the presynaptic &#x003b1;2-antagonist yohimbine increase the slope of I-O curve but do not
alter MTs (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Plewnia et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Since measuring the I-O curve involves larger neuronal populations as
compared with MTs, the sensitivity of the I-O curve in detecting cortical excitability
changes might be superior. This, beyond the impact of glutamatergic mechanisms on the I-O
curve, might be another reason why the I-O curves, but not MTs, are modulated by RBX. As the
enhancement of the I-O curve originates at cortical or/and subcortical sites, our findings
indicate that modulation of central noradrenaline is a possible way to enhance
cortico-spinal excitability. Nevertheless, because of the missing 3-way interaction of drug,
intensity, and time point, the results of the I-O curve should be interpreted with caution.
This missing interaction might be caused by the fact that in the chronic PLC conditions,
MEPs were already enhanced because of the impact of chronic RBX intake on cortical
excitability, which might have critically diminished the 3-way interaction (drug x time x
intensity).</p><p>SICI-ICF and I-wave facilitation were prominently modulated by RBX, especially in the
chronic application mode. Here, we found enhanced ICF and I-wave facilitation as well as a
decreased inhibition after RBX administration. ICF is regulated predominantly by glutamate
receptors with some GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor contribution (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Ziemann et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">1998a</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">1998b</xref>). SICI and I-wave
facilitation are suggested to be primarily controlled by GABAA receptors (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Ziemann et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Ilic et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Paulus et al.,
2008</xref>). Our results thus imply that noradrenaline exerts modulation effects on both
excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission and GABA-related inhibition. These results are in
accordance with those of former in vivo and in vitro studies showing that noradrenaline
suppresses GABAergic inhibition and enhances glutamatergic facilitation (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Tully et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, studies in humans have shown that single-dose
RBX decreases SICI and increases ICF (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Herwig et al.,
2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Plewnia et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). These findings, however, contrast with one
study, in which application of RBX for 16 days did not affect ICI and ICF (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Lange and Liepert, 2007</xref>). A possible explanation
might be the longer duration of drug intake in our study, which might result in more
prominent effects.</p><p>Since SAI is directly controlled by the cholinergic system, modulation of the noradrenergic
system might have decreased SAI by cholinergic activation (Lazzaro et al., 2000). In the
visual cortex, slice studies have shown that noradrenaline acts in combination with the
cholinergic system, which results in facilitation of LTP (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Brocher et al., 1992</xref>). However, a contribution of the GABAergic
system to the RBX effects cannot be ruled out at present, as SAI is also affected by
GABAergic mechanisms (Lazzaro et al., 2007), and other results of our study are in
accordance with a prominent impact of RBX on GABA activity.</p><sec id="s19"><title>Mechanisms</title><p>The specific mechanisms responsible for the effects of RBX on cortical excitability in
the human brain should be further investigated in forthcoming studies. One possible
mechanism is the reduction of potassium conductance by RBX (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hass and Konnerth, 1983</xref>). This would result in a depolarization of
postsynaptic membranes and enhance calcium influx into the intraneuronal compartment
through NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels, which might enhance
cortical facilitation (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Gu, 2002</xref>). The
&#x003b2;-adrenoreceptor might be the candidate involved in this mechanism, as activation of
&#x003b2;-adrenoreceptors decreases potassium conductance and results in depolarization of
postsynaptic neurons (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hass and Konnerth, 1983</xref>).
Moreover, the main mechanism suggested by the results of our experiments, an increase of
glutamatergic and reduction of GABAergic activity by noradrenergic enhancement, is
supported by recent animal studies showing that &#x003b2;-adrenoreceptors suppress GABAergic
inhibition and facilitate activation of NMDA receptors in different brain areas (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Tully et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Functional Relevance</title><p>Recent evidence suggests that cortical excitability and plasticity are disturbed in mood
disorders and animal models of stress. RBX serves as a second-line antidepressant.
Antidepressant treatment produces opposing physiological effects and thus blocks the
effects of stress on performance (Henn and Vollmayer., 2004; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Holderbach et al., 2007</xref>). However, most of these data so far
represent animal studies. Noradrenergic agents have been shown furthermore in pilot
studies to improve cognitive functions such as working memory and motor learning in
healthy and depressed subjects (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al.,
2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, a
previous study of our group has shown that RBX prolongs and enhances LTP-like plasticity
induced by noninvasive brain stimulation (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al.,
2016</xref>). LTP is an important physiological derivate of learning and memory
formation (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Rioult-Pedotti et al., 2000</xref>).
Deficient LTP and left prefrontal hypo-activity are present in depression and are
restituted after antidepressant treatment; thus, respective restitution of brain
physiology and reduction of symptoms seem to be associated (Henriques and Davidson., 1991;
<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Rocher et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Norman et al., 2007</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that
the enhancement of cortical excitability and LTP-like plasticity may contribute to
adaptive changes induced by antidepressant treatment and therefore improve learning and
cognition.</p><p>Clinically, maximal effects of noradrenergic agents are obtained after weeks or even
months of treatment (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kasper et al., 2000</xref>),
suggesting that longer term adaptive changes might contribute to therapeutic efficacy.
Animal studies suggest that both acute and repeated treatments with selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor can enhance synaptic efficacy, but only repeated treatments
significantly facilitated the induction of LTP compared with placebo medication (Ohashi et
al., 2002). Moreover, brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene expression was downregulated
after 4 hours (acute), but upregulated after 14 days (chronic) of application of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor in the rat hippocampus (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Coppell et al., 2003</xref>). Since serotonin and noradrenaline are both central
neuromodulators and are effective for treating depression, they might show similar
mechanisms regarding acute and chronic effects. In accordance, previous studies suggest
that chronic treatment with selective NRI restore learning and memory deficits in an
animal model of depression (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bhagya et al,
2015</xref>). Furthermore, NRI improved cognitive functions in chronically treated rats
(<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Lapiz et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly,
noradrenergic agents improve cognitive function such as working memory and motor learning
in healthy and depressed subjects (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al.,
2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). These
results imply that cortical excitability might be modulated by selective NRI in different
ways according to the duration of treatment. It might be speculated that the underlying
mechanisms are more prominent noradrenergic enhancement or upregulation of respective
receptors. However, based on the current results, it cannot be excluded that the more
prominent effects of chronic noradrenaline enhancement are due to enhanced selective NRI
concentration in the chronic medication condition, compared with single-dose application.
Thus, the specific interaction between dosage, cortical excitability, and noradrenergic
activity in the human brain should be explored in more detail in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Limitations</title><p>Some potential limitations of the present study should be taken into account. First, the
study was conducted in healthy subjects. In neuropsychiatric diseases, transmitter
availability and other features of brain function might be different; future studies are
thus needed to explore transferability of these results to patients. In our study, we
applied a crossover design in which subjects received a sequence of different experimental
sessions. Thus, we did not include a chronic placebo medication condition. There are 2
advantages of this design compared with a parallel group study. First, the influence of
confounding covariates is reduced, since each subject serves as his or her own control. In
a noncrossover study, even if randomized, it is often the case that different groups are
found to be unbalanced on some covariates. Second, a crossover design does require fewer
participants than a parallel study, which is more efficient within a limited given time
frame. One disadvantage of the crossover design is the missing opportunity to monitor the
stability of the obtained excitability parameters over time independent from medication in
the chronic medication condition. However, given that respective premedication parameters
in the different conditions were quite similar between conditions, we presume the absence
of a systematic drift of parameters independent from medication. Another limitation of
this study is that it does not allow us to discern if the enhanced effects of chronic
medication are due to different physiological mechanisms induced by chronic RBX
application, or caused by the higher drug concentration in the chronic medication,
compared with single-dose application. The larger effects of chronic medication can indeed
be caused at least partially by dose-response effects. Such a dose effect seems plausible,
because in the chronic placebo medication condition (&#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; refers here to the
medication at the day of TMS monitoring) we obtained excitability parameters different
from no medication conditions. Other effects of chronic medication cannot, however, be
ruled out in this study. In future studies, drug concentration measures as well as
repetitive TMS monitoring in the chronic medication condition, which was not possible
within the current design, would be advantageous. Finally, given the prominent effect of
noradrenergic receptor activation on cortical excitability, future studies should explore
the relevance of noradrenergic activation on functional outcomes in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>Min-Fang Kuo, Hsiao-I Kuo, Asif Jamil, and Giorgi Batsikadze received no financial support
