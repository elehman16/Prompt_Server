The studies were sponsored by Cyberonics, Inc, to evaluate VNS Therapy in a TRD patient population. Efficacy was evaluated in these studies using various assessment tools, including the MADRS and CGI-I. Specifically, the MADRS and CGI-I were secondary outcome measures in Studies D-01, D-02, D-03, D-21, and D-23; and the CGI-I (but not MADRS) was a secondary outcome measure in Study D-04. Although the MADRS and CGI-I were secondary outcome measures in these studies, they have been utilized as the primary outcomes for the meta-analysis as these were the only clinician-rated assessment tools common to the majority of the studies; that is, five of the six studies used the MADRS and all six studies used the CGI-I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Detailed descriptions and the outcomes of Studies D-01, D-02, D-03, D-04, and D-21 have been previously published as cited in the following descriptions of the studies, but results from the TRD Registry (D-23) are not currently published. Only Studies D-02 and D-21 were randomized trials, and note that only TAU studies that were conducted for comparison to VNS treatment were included in the meta-analysis to ensure similarity of patient populations. All studies were conducted at multiple centers in the US and Canada, except for Study D-03, which was conducted at multiple centers in Europe.

After the acute phase was completed the device was activated for these 116 patients. The acute phase included an initial 2-week-long period following implant when the VNS device was not turned on to aid recovery.

Because only one of the studies randomized patients to VNS + TAU or TAU (ie, the acute phase of the D-02 study), we used propensity scores to control for any potential differences between the treatment groups.</p><p>Propensity scores were calculated by fitting a logistic regression model using SAS PROC GLIMMIX with the dependent variable of treatment group (1 = VNS + TAU and 0 = TAU). The regression model included the following measured baseline variables: age, gender, ethnicity, duration from first diagnosis of illness, duration since diagnosis of current episode, number of prior medications by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classifications,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-mder-6-017">28</xref> ECT history (yes or no), baseline MADRS and CGI&#x02019;s Severity subscale (CGI-S) scores, number of previous psychiatric hospitalizations, and number of lifetime suicide attempts. The propensity score is the fitted probability of the response (VNS + TAU group) from the multivariate regression model for each observation (patient) in the data set. The fitted probabilities are ranked into five categories (quintiles) using SAS PROC RANK (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).</p><p>To compare VNS + TAU versus TAU, we fitted mixed effects repeated measures models to account for the staggered visit schedules. The fixed terms included an intercept (or grand mean), treatment effect, and propensity score; no treatment-by-time interaction was considered due to difficulties with interpretation and identifiability issues posed by the large number of time points. We took a Bayesian approach that modeled both studies and subjects as random effects by placing a hierarchical model on these terms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-mder-6-017">29</xref> Week of follow-up was modeled with a normal dynamic linear model (NDLM).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-mder-6-017">30</xref> The NDLM accounts for the correlation between time points and borrows information across observations such that, for observations closer together in time, more information is borrowed, and for observations further apart in time, less information is borrowed. Noninformative priors were assumed for all parameters. For MADRS and CGI-I scores, we modeled the mean score for subjects as a function of the time point and treatment groups. For response and remission endpoints (either MADRS or CGI-I), we modeled the log-odds and report the odds ratios associated with the treatment groups.</p><p>Treatment group was considered as categorical with two categories, VNS + TAU and TAU alone. Propensity score was included as a categorical variable. Models were fit including all subjects and a factor for each propensity score and within each subgroup defined by propensity score.</p><p>Finally, we compared the proportion of patients who were sustained responders between the two treatment groups. In these analyses, patients were considered sustained responders at 48 weeks if they achieved a response (ie, a 50% reduction in MADRS score) at both 24 and 48 weeks. Similarly, patients were considered sustained responders at 96 weeks if they achieved a response at both 24 and 96 weeks. Because studies had follow-up visits at slightly different times, visits within 2 weeks of each other were combined for the purposes of this analysis. Sustained response was considered for both the MADRS and CGI-I. We present the raw proportion of patients who were sustained responders and the odds ratio for sustained response of VNS + TAU versus TAU along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.</p><p>To aid in assessing clinical benefit, we calculated the numbers needed to treat (NNT) for VNS + TAU based on a comparison of the observed response rates for VNS + TAU and TAU.</p><p>Incidence for each AE preferred term was computed as a proportion of subjects that experienced the event within each year. A subject who experienced the same event more than once within year 1 or year 2 was counted once for each preferred term within each year. An AE that occurred in the first year of VNS treatment, but did not resolve until the second year, was counted as occurring in both the first and second years of treatment.</p><p>Analyses were conducted with a self-written code using Intel Fortran compiler v11.0.083 (The Fortran Company, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and using R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Repeated measures models were fit using standard Markov chain Monte Carlo Metropolis&#x02013;Hastings steps.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Characteristics of the patient populations</title><p>Intent-to-treat classifications were used in the studies with randomization, and all observations within 2 years, from all patients who were enrolled in one of the six clinical studies.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-mder-6-017">Table 1</xref> summarizes the baseline characteristics of the study patients by treatment group.

Hence, not every baseline clinical characteristic was collected in every one of the six studies as indicated in<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-mder-6-017">Table 1</xref> (eg, number of hospitalizations and number of lifetime suicide attempts were not collected in Study D-01, and the MADRS was not assessed in Study D-04). A total of 1035 patients were treated with VNS + TAU and 541 patients with TAU (the TAU group includes 425 from D-04 and D-23 plus 116 from D-02). Note that the totals for both groups include the 116 patients from the D-02 study: these patients were randomized to the sham-control TAU group for the initial 12-week acute phase (while the VNS devices remained inactive), and, thereafter, the patients&#x02019; VNS devices were activated and their subsequent long-term phase data were included in the VNS + TAU group, with the week 12 MADRS and CGI-I data considered as baseline for VNS + TAU.</p><p>Patients in the two treatment groups were similar in age (47.8 &#x000b1; 10.2 years for the VNS + TAU group and 48.7 &#x000b1; 10.9 years for the TAU group) and gender distribution (66.2% female in VNS + TAU group and 69.7% female in TAU group) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-mder-6-017">Table 1</xref> ). More non-Caucasian patients were found in the TAU group (9.4%) than in the VNS + TAU group (3.5%). The VNS + TAU population had evidence of greater chronicity and treatment resistance; specifically, more patients who received VNS + TAU had ECT (56.1% versus 39.5% in the TAU group), more had unsuccessful prior drug treatment trials (6.9 &#x000b1; 2.2 versus 5.9 &#x000b1; 2.2 in the TAU group), and more had lifetime depression-related hospitalizations (3.4 &#x000b1; 6.0 versus 1.9 &#x000b1; 4.3 in the TAU group).</p><p>The withdrawal rates during the acute and long-term phases were comparable (23.6% for VNS + TAU and 22.2% for TAU) (data not shown). The most common reasons for withdrawal were: patient withdrew consent (3.4% for VNS + TAU and 6.3% for TAU), protocol non-compliance by patient (2.1% for VNS + TAU and 4.9% for TAU), and lack of efficacy (2.3% for VNS + TAU and 0% for TAU).</p><p>The number of patients per propensity score quintile and their demographic characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S3</xref>. Basic demographic characteristics were similar. Note the marked gradation of disease state severity from propensity score quintile 1 to quintile 5. Significant increases across quintiles can be seen from number of hospitalizations, suicidality (prior attempts during lifetime and current episode, as well as, the percentage of suicidal patients at baseline), and baseline assessments (CGI-S and MADRS). Note also that the percentage of patients with a bipolar diagnosis increases with the propensity score quintile.</p></sec><sec><title>Repeated measures assessment</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-mder-6-017">Figure 1</xref> shows the model estimated mean MADRS and CGI-I scores, as well as probabilities of response across follow-up for both treatments. The models did not include a treatment-by-time interaction; thus, these plots show parallel trends over time for both treatment groups. The offset illustrates the better outcomes for patients who received VNS + TAU, while outcomes for both groups tended to improve. Specifically, the model-based MADRS response rates for VNS + TAU at 12, 24, 48, and 96 weeks were 12%, 18%, 28%, and 32% versus 4%, 7%, 12%, and 14% for TAU, respectively. Similarly, CGI-I response rates for VNS + TAU at 12, 24, 48, and 96 weeks were 14%, 23%, 40%, and 50% versus 3%, 4%, 10%, and 14% for TAU, respectively. Finally, the MADRS remission rates for VNS + TAU at 12, 24, 48, and 96 weeks were approximately 3%, 5%, 10%, and 14% versus 1%, 1%, 2%, and 4% for TAU, respectively.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref> show MADRS and CGI-I scores by study and treatment group at selected time points.

Outcomes were compared over time (up to 96 weeks of treatment) in a sample of over 1000 patients in the VNS + TAU group and over 400 patients in the TAU group from six prospective clinical studies evaluating VNS + TAU or TAU. This Bayesian meta-analysis found a consistent superiority of VNS + TAU over TAU.</p><p>Compared with outpatients evaluated in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study who had not responded to three to four treatment steps,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-mder-6-017">5</xref> patients in this meta-analysis were more likely to be Caucasian and to have had a longer length of illness, a higher suicide attempt rate, and more previous depression treatments, including ECT. Thus, the chronic treatment resistant nature of the VNS + TAU patients is indisputable. Nevertheless, the odds of treatment response in VNS + TAU patients were three times that for patients who received TAU alone, and the odds of remission in VNS + TAU patients were almost five times as likely as that for TAU patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-mder-6-017">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>As this meta-analysis included all company-sponsored completed and ongoing multicenter VNS Therapy studies, there is no additional published literature examining VNS + TAU versus TAU against which to compare these findings directly. However, the response rates in the VNS + TAU patients are comparable in magnitude to those obtained with ECT, which is known to be superior to pharmacotherapy in treating patients with severe or difficult to treat depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-mder-6-017">35</xref> Meta-analyses of ECT trials in MDD have shown similar superiority of response, which was approximately three times greater than with simulated ECT (odds ratio: 2.83; CI: 1.30, 6.17), and approximately four times greater for ECT in comparison to antidepressants (TCAs, MAOIs, SSRIs, and lithium + TCA), in a clinical setting (odds ratio: 3.72; CI: 2.60, 5.32).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-mder-6-017">32</xref></p><p>To provide additional clinical context for these findings, we compared the NNT over time for VNS versus ECT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-mder-6-017">Table 4</xref>). NNTs from acute phase trials comparing ECT to various anti-depressants were as follows: 5 for ECT versus TCA, and 3 for ECT versus MAOI. For VNS + TAU, the NNT decreases over time from 12 to 96 weeks (NNT of 8, 7, 6, and 4 at 12, 24, 48, and 96 weeks, respectively). Thus, longer-term VNS + TAU treatment appears to have a similar magnitude of effectiveness as short-term ECT.</p><p>We acknowledge that ECT is an effective acute episodic treatment option and that VNS Therapy is not an acute therapy but a potential longer-term approach with sustained treatment delivery.

Further, it represents a culmination of all available multicenter studies with VNS in this patient population, the consistent use of commonly used and validated scales for measuring depression symptomatology, and an analysis performed at the individual patient data level rather than using summary data, as is the case with most meta-analysis studies. The primary limitation of the meta-analysis involves the individual study designs; namely, that the TAU group data is limited to two trials for the CGI-I scale (ie, Studies D-04 and D-23) and one trial for the MADRS scale (Study D-23); in addition, the non-randomized D-23 study and the randomized, sham-controlled acute phase of the D-02 study represent the only concurrent head-to-head comparisons of VNS + TAU and TAU. We also note that patients included in this study were out-patients with an overall moderately severe to severe disease state but not very severe symptoms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-mder-6-017">Table 1</xref>). The medications that the patients were receiving prior to VNS achieved some stability and modest benefit but had not produced a remission, and the patients continued to have a clinically meaningful level of symptom severity and poor function. Thus, the patients were candidates for a different treatment approach. Finally, the issue of blinding the investigators and patients to VNS. Therapy is difficult for a treatment that has benign &#x02013; but well characterized and observable &#x02013; side effects. Discussions between the field of psychiatry and the FDA have been undertaken regarding these multifaceted questions of study design and blinding for devices in the treatment of depression, with limited success.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-mder-6-017">43</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This meta-analysis reveals a substantial and sustained difference in both response and remission rates between VNS + TAU and TAU treatment in patients suffering from a treatment-resistant major depressive episode.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Mr Jayewardene, Dr Bunker, and Dr Olin compiled the raw data, and the demographics and patient disposition data; they also performed the NNT analysis.
