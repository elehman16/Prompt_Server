No trials have investigated the impact of water provision on cognitive performance among schoolchildren in hot and arid low-resource settings. We conducted a randomized-controlled trial in five schools with limited water access in Chipata district in Eastern province, Zambia, to assess the efficacy of water provision on cognition. Pupils in grades 3&#x02013;6 were randomly assigned to either receive a bottle of drinking water that they could refill throughout the day (water group, n = 149) or only have access to drinking water that was normally available at the school (control group, n = 143). Hydration was assessed in the morning before provision of water and in the afternoon through urine specific gravity (U<sub>sg</sub>) measured with a portable refractometer. In the afternoon we administered six cognitive tests to assess short-term memory, concentration, visual attention, and visual motor skills. Morning prevalence of dehydration, defined as U<sub>sg</sub>&#x02265;1.020, was 42%. Afternoon dehydration increased to 67% among the control arm and dropped to 10% among the intervention arm. We did not find that provision of water or hydration impacted cognitive test scores, although there were suggestive relationships between both water provision and hydration and increased scores on tests measuring visual attention. We identified key improvements to the study design that are warranted to further investigate this relationship.</p><p><bold><italic>Trial Registration</italic>:</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01924546">NCT01924546</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was made possible by the generous support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through its WASHplus (global) and SPLASH/Zambia projects.

Improved access to drinking water in schools may improve children&#x02019;s ability to learn by improving attention, concentration, and short-term memory. According to UNICEF, only 51% of schools in low-resource settings have access to water throughout the day [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dehydration is likely high in these water-scarce schools, especially during the dry season, although prevalence estimates are unavailable. Evidence on the association between hydration and cognitive performance would provide important data for policy makers in the education sector by establishing a direct link between investments in water at school and educational attainment.</p><p>Among adults, exercise-induced dehydration has been shown to impact memory, attention, and visuospatial function [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition to the direct physiological effect of dehydration on cognitive performance, dehydration has also been shown to have a negative effect on psychological factors that could affect cognitive performance, including mood, perceived effort, and concentration [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150071.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>A smaller body of research has explored the cognitive effects of dehydration among children; evidence from intervention and cross-sectional studies in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Israel corroborates findings among adults, suggesting that drinking water is associated with improved attention, short-term memory, visual search, and mood [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The majority of these studies among children have been conducted in the global North and estimate the effect of voluntary dehydration, which occurs when children do not drink a sufficient amount of water even when it is available [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Little research has been conducted in the context of water-scarce environments, where there is the potential for increased prevalence and severity of dehydration due to the fact that children often do not have access to any drinking water throughout the school day. In 2013, we conducted a pilot field trial in Mali to develop testing protocols and field measures of hydration and cognition, as well as to examine the effect of drinking supplementary water during the school day on hydration status and on cognitive performance using a school-level crossover study design. The pilot study revealed challenges with the crossover study design and considerable learning effects related to the novelty of the cognitive tests.</p><p>Using the hydration and cognitive testing measures piloted in Mali, the objective of this study was to assess the impact of drinking water provision on cognition among schoolchildren in water-scarce environments. As secondary objectives, we measured the effect of hydration on cognition and the effect of drinking water provision on hydration. Lessons learned from the pilot study have been integrated into the current study.

We determined that pupils in grades 3&#x02013;6 were able to complete the tests and a low percentage of children (1&#x02013;15%) achieved either the maximum or minimum score on any of the cognitive tests, indicating that the selected tests were neither too difficult nor too hard. The tests and instructions were further piloted and adapted in Zambia to ensure that pupils there were equally able to complete the tests. The tests included:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Letter cancellation (visual attention): Pupils were given one minute to cross out target letters randomly dispersed among a grid of non-target letters. A score was calculated from the number of correct letters crossed out minus the number of incorrect letters (maximum score 38).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Direct image difference (visual attention): Pupils were given one minute to circle differences between two similar images. A score was calculated from the number of circles correctly identifying a difference minus the number of incorrect circles (maximum score 11).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Indirect image difference (visual memory): Pupils were given one minute to study an image, then turn to a blank page, then turn to a second, nearly identical image. Pupils were given one minute to circle differences between the second image and their recollection of the first image. A score was calculated from the number of circles correctly identifying a difference minus the number of incorrect circles (maximum score 9).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Forward digit recall (short-term memory): Ten sequences of numbers of two to six digits in length were read aloud. Pupils wrote down each sequence after it was read. Two scores were calculated from the total number of correctly recalled sequences (maximum score 10) and the digit span of the longest correctly recalled sequence (maximum score 6).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reverse digit recall (short-term memory): Eight sequences of numbers of two to five digits in length were read aloud. Pupils wrote down each sequence in reverse order after it was read. Two scores were calculated from the total number of correctly recalled sequences (maximum score 8) and the digit span of the longest correctly recalled sequence (maximum score 5).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Line trace (visuomotor skills): Pupils were given fifteen seconds to draw a line between two curved parallel lines. A score was calculated from the distance of the drawn line in centimeters minus the number of times the drawn line touched the sides (maximum score 29).</p></list-item></list><p>Cognitive tests were conducted immediately following provision of the afternoon urine sample. Total testing time was 60&#x02013;75 minutes. All tests were paper-based and administered by trained study staff in a group setting in a school classroom. Instruction scripts for each test were translated into Chinyanja and all test instructions included a practice example. Parallel versions of the image comparison tests were created to minimize copying. We piloted several comparable images for the direct and indirect image difference tests, each with the same possible maximum score. The distribution of scores were visually assessed for normality and we selected the four images with the best outcomes for inclusion in the final study. Scores for individual tests were omitted from analysis if responses did not meet criteria for completing the test correctly.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were entered into Microsoft Excel and analyzed using STATA v.13 SE. Independent samples t-tests were used to evaluate differences between study arms in pupil age, grade, distance walked to school, and morning and afternoon U<sub>col</sub> and U<sub>sg</sub>. Chi-squared tests were used to evaluate differences between study arms for pupil sex, eating and drinking before school, illness in past two weeks, test version, and morning and afternoon dehydration. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate the association between pupils&#x02019; individual morning and afternoon hydration measures.</p><p>We conducted an intention to treat analysis to evaluate the impact of the intervention (supplementary water provision) on eight cognitive test scores. Secondary analyses included evaluating the association between hydration (U<sub>sg</sub>) and test score, regardless of intervention status; evaluating the association between dehydration (U<sub>sg</sub>&#x02265;1.020) and test score, regardless of intervention status; and evaluating the impact of the intervention on hydration (U<sub>sg</sub>) and dehydration (U<sub>sg</sub>&#x02265;1.020). Multivariable linear regression models were employed to evaluate the impact of the intervention on each of the eight cognitive test scores, and to test the association between hydration (U<sub>sg</sub>) and test scores, dehydration (U<sub>sg</sub>&#x02265;1.020) and test scores, and intervention status and hydration (U<sub>sg</sub>). Logistic regression models were employed to test the impact of the intervention on dehydration (U<sub>sg</sub>&#x0003e;1.020).</p><p>Models were assessed for interaction and confounding with sex, age, grade, reported drinking and eating in the morning before school, distance walked to school, illness in the past two weeks, test version, morning hydration, morning dehydration, and the availability of drinking water at the school. Variables were included in the models if they had a p-value less than 0.006, the level of significance determined by using the Bonferroni correction to account for eight hypotheses on a single outcome. Illness in the past two weeks and the availability of drinking water at the school appeared as significant modifiers in the relationship between U<sub>sg</sub> and some test scores. Test version appeared as a significant confounder for the relationship between study arm and the indirect image difference test, and morning dehydration appeared as a significant confounder for the relationship between both hydration outcomes and the direct image difference test. These confounders were included in the final models as warranted.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (Atlanta, GA), the FHI 360 Office of International Research Ethics (Durham, NC) and the Excellence in Research Ethics and Science Ethical Review Board (Lusaka, Zambia).

We found that a high number of pupils were dehydrated in the morning, dehydration increased throughout the day, and the provision of water significantly decreased dehydration. However, we found little evidence of associations between the provision of water or hydration status on cognitive performance.</p><p>The intervention had a significant impact on pupil hydration. We found that 43% of pupils in the study schools were dehydrated in the morning. Unrestricted access to drinking water under the intervention condition reduced the prevalence of dehydration to 10% by the afternoon, while pupils in the control condition had an increase of dehydration prevalence to 67%. The increase in dehydration was greater among pupils in the control group in schools that did not provide any water to pupils (77% dehydrated) compared to pupils in schools where some water was available (60% dehydrated). These results suggest that the provision of even a limited quantity of drinking water helped mitigate levels of dehydration; however, this was not sufficient to prevent an increase in dehydration throughout the school day. We did not measure the quantity of water that pupils in the intervention arm consumed. Further research could be conducted to establish the quantity of water necessary for a pupil to maintain hydration throughout the school day.</p><p>The proportion of pupils who were dehydrated in the morning (43%) was lower than what had been previously observed in Israel (84%) [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Italy (68%) [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The variability in the prevalence of dehydration may be explained by research suggesting that mean urine osmolality ranges widely between individuals and cultures [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, although the cutoff value we used to evaluate dehydration among children in Zambia (U<sub>sg</sub>&#x02265;1.020) was equivalent to those used in previous studies of dehydration among children in Western settings [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150071.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150071.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150071.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the value corresponding to physiologic dehydration might be different among the Zambian pupil population. Additional research may be needed to evaluate differences in cross-country and cross-cultural urine osmolality, and appropriate cutoff values for hydration classification.</p><p>We found few, if any, associations between the provision of water and improved performance on cognitive tests. There was some evidence that provision of supplementary drinking water was associated with increased visual attention as measured through the direct image difference test. However, the p-value for this test at p = 0.05 did not meet the threshold for significance suggested by using the Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. Our results stand in contrast to previous research finding significant improvements in memory, visual attention, visual memory, and visual search after supplemental water provision [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], as well as research demonstrating significant negative impacts of dehydration on short-term memory [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150071.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We saw some additional evidence suggesting that pupils who were classified as hydrated (U<sub>sg</sub>&#x0003c;1.020) and pupils with lower overall U<sub>sg</sub> performed better on tests of visual attention. However, the confidence intervals for these associations crossed zero. These findings should be interpreted with caution, as this was a secondary analysis that pooled observations from both intervention and control arms, and as such did not have an unbiased counterfactual group.</p><p>There are a number of possible explanations for the lack of significant associations between water provision and cognitive test scores, and between hydration and cognitive test scores.</p><p>Unlike the previous research conducted in the UK, Italy, and Israel, our study did not conduct pre- and post-intervention cognitive testing since we had observed considerable learning curves associated with the cognitive tests that we thought may obscure any changes revealed from improved hydration during our pilot in Mali. Without these baseline measures of cognitive performance, we cannot be sure that the intervention and control arms were comparable in terms of cognitive abilities. Also, our study may not have captured additional potential confounders and effect modifiers. Although we did collect self-reported information about illness in the past two weeks, we did not have any biologic measures of soil-transmitted helminth infection, under-nutrition, or malaria, all of which have been shown to negatively impact cognitive development and performance of children [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We also did not collect information on physical activity during the day, which could have affected both hydration levels and cognitive performance [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, because pupils were randomized to the intervention and control groups, the effects of these potential confounders would have likely been evenly distributed between the groups.</p><p>Additionally, we found evidence of excessive water consumption among some children in the treatment group. In at least two of the study schools, some pupils treated their access to water as a competition to drink as much as possible. Seventy-eight (28%) pupils had an afternoon U<sub>sg</sub> measurement below 1.003, which is the lower limit for normal hydration [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Rogers, Kaint, and Smith [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that drinking water decreased cognitive performance among people who had low self-reported thirst. It is possible that excessive water drinking impaired cognitive performance for some pupils. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on all models excluding pupils with U<sub>sg</sub>&#x0003c;1.003 and did not detect any significant results. However, it is possible that any effect of excessive water consumption extended to pupils with U<sub>sg</sub> above 1.003 as well. We did not include measures of self-reported thirst in this study, as prior research suggests that reported thirst is not correlated with biometric indicators of hydration [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, future studies may benefit from including self-reported thirst to account for potential effect modification.</p><p>Furthermore, our measurement of hydration may not have been sufficiently sensitive. Our use of U<sub>sg</sub> was motivated by the cost effectiveness and practicality of handheld refractometers that require only a small urine sample, as well as past research that has shown U<sub>sg</sub> to be highly correlated with U<sub>osm</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, other research has indicated that U<sub>sg</sub> can lag behind other measures of hydration and may not always be an accurate indicator of current hydration status [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150071.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although the low cost and ease of measurement in the field provide compelling support for the use of U<sub>sg</sub> to measure hydration, additional research may be needed to support the use of this measure in future studies of the effect of hydration on cognition. Additionally, it is possible that providing water over the course of one school day may not be sufficient to reduce the negative impacts of dehydration on the cognition of chronically dehydrated schoolchildren. Longitudinal research examining the sustained provision of supplementary drinking water on cognitive performance is warranted.</p><p>Our study may have been underpowered, as we did not achieve our sample size target of 300 pupils. Additionally, sample size calculations were based on data from England and Mali and may not reflect the context-specific effects of the impact of hydration on test scores. When we did observe differences in test scores between hydrated and dehydrated pupils in the Zambia trial, the differences were not as large compared to results from similar tests conducted in Israel and the United Kingdom [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150071.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150071.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we cannot verify that the cognitive tests we employed accurately tested the cognitive skills they were intended to assess. Due to an error in test allocation, the two version of the image tests were not distributed evenly between study arms, and differences in the difficulty of the two versions may have obscured the relationship between water consumption and the cognitive skills we intended to assess. Additionally, although the cognitive tests selected for this study were taken from published test batteries that had been validated to assess specific cognitive domains, there is some concern that cognitive tests developed in Western settings may not be appropriate in other cultural contexts [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Western tests have been successfully adapted to contexts in Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0150071.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150071.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and we piloted all tests to ensure that pupils in Zambia could accurately complete them. We did not, however, conduct an assessment to ensure that the tests did indeed assess the intended cognitive functions among this population. Further research may be needed to ensure that measures of cognitive function are suitably adapted for use among pupils in Zambia and other rural sub-Saharan African contexts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that providing an unrestricted quantity of water decreased dehydration throughout the school day, and that dehydration significantly increased in the absence of a sufficient quantity of drinking water. We found few associations between water provision or hydration status and cognitive test score, although we did see a suggestive relationship between both water provision and hydration and improved scores on tests of visual attention. While there is considerable evidence that dehydration leads to reduced cognitive test scores, this relationship has not been confirmed through a trial of water provision among schoolchildren in a low-resource field setting. It is possible that no association may truly exist between hydration and cognitive performance; however, our inability to find a clear association between provision of water and cognition may be due to logistical challenges with the study design, power, and measurement of outcomes. Current policies to increase water access may not consider the quantity of water that is available to pupils; the impact of access to a sufficient quantity of drinking water for school children deserves further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150071.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Dataset.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150071.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150071.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Codebook.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150071.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150071.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150071.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150071.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150071.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150071.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Dataset from Mali pilot.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150071.s005.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150071.s006"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>Codebook from Mali pilot.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150071.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the staff of WASHplus in Washington, DC and SPLASH in Zambia for their support, specifically Sarah Fry, Orlando Hernandez, and Justin Lupele, as well as Kaleb Price from Emory and our field team.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0150071.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>UNICEF</collab>. <source>Raising Even More Clean Hands: Advancing Health, Learning and Equity through WASH in Schools</source>. <publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc>: <year>2012</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0150071.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gopinathan</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pichan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>VM</given-names></name>. <article-title>Role of Dehydration in Heat Stress-Induced Variations in Mental Performance</article-title>. <source>Archives of Environmental Health</source>. <year>1988</year>;<volume>43</volume>(<issue>1</issue>).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0150071.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Cian</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Barraud</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Melin</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Raphel</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>. <article-title>Effects of fluid ingestion on cognitive function after heat stress or exercise-induced dehydration</article-title>. <source>International Journal of Psychophysiology</source>. <year>2001</year>;<volume>42</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>243</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>51</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8760(01)00142-8">10.1016/s0167-8760(01)00142-8</ext-link></comment>
