The goal of this study was to assess the effect of a single intralesional implantation of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSCs) on artificial lesions in equine superficial digital flexor tendons (SDFTs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>During this randomized, controlled, blinded experimental study, either autologous cultured AT-MSCs suspended in autologous inactivated serum (AT-MSC-serum) or autologous inactivated serum (serum) were injected intralesionally 2&#x000a0;weeks after surgical creation of centrally located SDFT lesions in both forelimbs of nine horses. Healing was assessed clinically and with ultrasound (standard B-mode and ultrasound tissue characterization) at regular intervals over 24&#x000a0;weeks.

In horses, the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), which is located at the palmar aspect of the limb, acts to store and release elastic energy and is subject to strains close to its functional limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Due to gradual accumulation of degenerative damage during intensive training leading to partial rupture, this tendon is prone to failure, especially in racehorses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Because of the high incidence, prolonged recovery period and high re-injury rate, a plethora of physical, medical and surgical interventions have been applied over the years to improve quality of the repair tissue; however, to date the ideal treatment concept has not been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Potentially regenerative therapies, in particular cell and blood-based substrates, have gained interest over the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The administration of multipotent cells, in particular autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], or totipotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] into tendon defects is suggested to have direct and indirect influences on tendon healing. It is thus hypothesized that the injected cells may either differentiate into cells capable of synthesizing tendon matrix&#x02014;that is, have a direct regenerative effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]&#x02014;or act by a paracrine effect through the release of trophic mediators, growth factors and immunomodulatory, angiogenic as well as anti-apoptotic substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>To date it is not clear which cell source is the ideal choice to enhance tendon regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Comparing different adipose tissue-based cell-rich substrates, adipose-derived nucleated cells (ADNCs) are, by contrast with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSCs), a mixture of different cell types. The advantage is that ADNCs are readily available within hours after tissue harvest without the demand of cost and time for culture. Multipotency has been proven for pericytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which form a subset of the ADNCs. However, AT-MSC culture leads to a higher cell dose and theoretically to a greater effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To the knowledge of the authors, however, it is not clear which cell type contributes most to tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In an experimental equine collagenase model study ADNCs had a limited effect on tendon healing but led to histologically improved tendon organization and an increase in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The clinically most relevant sources of MSCs in equine orthopaedics are bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The advantages of adipose tissue over bone marrow are that it is widely available and easily accessible, and its MSC content is higher with a higher proliferation capacity of AT-MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and a slower senescence than that of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Despite the lack of a definite set of surface markers to characterize equine tenocytes, a recent study demonstrated that, compared with BM-MSCs, umbilical cord blood MSCs and AT-MSCs express collagen 1A2, collagen 3A1 and decorin at the highest levels with the highest collagen type 1A2:3A1 ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. AT-MSCs show high expressions of the tendon markers COMP and scleraxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, AT-MSCs have already been used with promising results to treat equine tendinopathies, as described in several uncontrolled case series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In a controlled in-vivo experimental study, the implantation of AT-MSCs into collagenase-induced SDFT core lesions resulted in improved tendon fibre organization and decreased inflammatory infiltrate, as well as increased collagen type I gene expression compared with the control limbs, whereas no differences were seen in clinical parameters and with B-mode ultrasonography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In another study from the same group using the collagenase-gel model of tendinopathy, intralesional treatment with AT-MSCs suspended in platelet concentrate prevented progression of SDFT lesions and resulted in better organization of collagen fibrils, less inflammation and increased vascularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, the relevance of this model is questioned due to the strong acute inflammatory response after collagenase injection, which is unlike naturally occurring degenerative tendon lesions, and due to difficulties in standardization of lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. A recently introduced surgical model of centrally located SDFT (core) lesions is thought to mimic the characteristics of overuse tendinopathy more realistically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Since the 1980s, B-mode ultrasonography has been considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Because of its limitations, such as the lack of axial information, operator dependence, influence of ultrasound beam angle and limited resolution, however, the value of quantification of B-mode ultrasound images for the adequate assessment of repair is questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Ultrasound tissue characterization (UTC) is a new technique that was developed to analyse echo pattern stability on a computerized basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Transverse ultrasound (US) images are captured at regular distances over the long axis of the tendon, and are reconstituted to a three-dimensional block of US information with the help of custom-designed software. Depending on the echo pattern stability over contiguous images, four different echo types can be discriminated with histo-morphology as a reference test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. UTC has been shown a viable diagnostic tool to monitor experimental tendinopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and natural tendon disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] in horses and is increasingly used for the assessment of (Achilles) tendon integrity in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Histologic examination is still the gold standard to assess tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and commonly yields the most important results at the end of terminal experimental studies when findings can be correlated to those from other examination modalities (e.g. diagnostic imaging) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Another major component of experimental tendon studies should be biomechanical testing of tendon specimens to quantify functional properties of the repair tissue which are potentially representative for the resistance to strain in a clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, the effect of AT-MSCs has not been tested experimentally in horses over a 6-month period using a controlled blinded, randomized study design with non-invasive monitoring and multimodal end-stage evaluation of the repair tissue. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether a single intralesional implantation of AT-MSCs suspended in autologous inactivated serum into surgically created lesions leads to a reduction of inflammatory signs and improved ultrasonographic, biochemical, biomechanical and histologic characteristics compared with the application of autologous inactivated serum alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Horses</title><p>Nine horses (eight warmbloods, one trotter) aged 3&#x02013;6 years (mean 4&#x000a0;years) with a mean bodyweight of 545&#x000a0;kg (range 498&#x02013;607&#x000a0;kg) were included in this study. All horses were housed in boxes and fed hay and cereals. Prior to the study, none of the horses showed clinical and/or ultrasonographic (B-mode, UTC) signs of forelimb SDFT disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Surgical creation of lesions and adipose tissue harvest</title><p>Core lesions were surgically created in the SDFTs of both forelimbs using the model introduced by Little and Schramme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and modified by Bosch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and Schramme et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. All horses received meloxicam (0.6&#x000a0;mg/kg bwt (IV)) preoperatively and 2&#x000a0;days postoperatively. No perioperative antimicrobials were administered. A standard protocol for inhalation anaesthesia was used and the horses were positioned in lateral recumbency. After clipping and aseptic preparation, a 1.5-cm incision was made in the palmar midline, 2&#x000a0;cm proximal to the proximal end of the common digital flexor tendon sheath through the skin and the mesotendon into the tendon core. A 2.5-mm blunt conical obturator (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was inserted and guided proximally inside the tendon core under ultrasonographic guidance over a distance of 7&#x000a0;cm. Subsequently, a 3.5-mm burr (Abrador Burr 28200RN; Karl Storz) was inserted in the tunnel that had been created, activated and gradually pulled backwards over 20&#x000a0;seconds, while pressing the tendon against the tip of the burr. Care was taken not to damage the dorsal epitenon. Epitenon incisions were sutured in a simple interrupted pattern with polyglactin 910 (Vicryl&#x000ae; 2-0 USP; Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany), and skin incisions were closed in a vertical mattress pattern with polyamide (Dafilon&#x000ae; 2-0 USP; Braun Melsungen, Melsungen, Germany). Double-layer bandages were applied and changed every 1&#x02013;2 days until intralesional injection.</p><p>During the same general anaesthesia, the right paraxial gluteal region was clipped and aseptically prepared. A 4-cm skin incision was made in the cranio-caudal direction and 20&#x000a0;g of adipose tissue was excised from the subcutis. The skin was sutured with a vertical mattress pattern with polyamide (Dafilon&#x000ae; 1 USP; Braun Melsungen).</p><p>Adipose tissue was stored in MSC medium containing 1&#x000a0;g/l Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle&#x02019;s Medium (DMEM) with 25&#x000a0;mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and 1%&#x02009;<sc>l</sc>-glutamine (DMEM with 25&#x000a0;mM HEPES, with <sc>l</sc>-glutamine; PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Penicillin-Streptomycin 100; PAA Laboratories) at 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and shipped to the laboratory overnight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>AT-MSC isolation and culture</title><p>Adipose tissue was mechanically separated using a scalpel blade and a tissue chopper.

B-mode ultrasound examination was carried out with a 6&#x02013;15&#x000a0;MHz ultrasound probe (GE ML 6-15; GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) connected to a Logiq E9 (GE Healthcare) using a standoff pad and constant settings (frequency 13&#x000a0;MHz, gain 52, depth 25&#x000a0;mm, single focal zone set at 15&#x000a0;mm depth). The palmar metacarpus was divided into examination zones from proximal to distal in the transverse (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 3C) and longitudinal plane (1, 2, 3) as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

Settings (depth, gain, focal zone) were standardized, and all examinations were performed by the same operator (FG) with the horse bearing weight equally on both forelimbs. With the help of the tracking device, the probe moved automatically from proximal to distal at constant speed over a distance of 12&#x000a0;cm. Sampling of transverse images was conducted every 0.2&#x000a0;mm, including the surgical site as the reference point for the analysis. The compiled 600 transverse US images were reconstructed into a three-dimensional data block of US information and stored digitally until the end of the examination period. The stability of the echo pattern of corresponding pixels in contiguous transverse images was analysed (UTC2011&#x000ae; Analyser V1.0.1; UTC Imaging). The following echo types were discriminated: those generated by intact and fully aligned fascicles (echo type I, green), those generated by discontinuous and less aligned fascicles (echo type II, blue), those generated by a mainly fibrillary matrix with accumulation of collagen fibrils not (yet) organized into fascicles (echo type III, red) and those generated by an amorphous matrix and fluid (echo type IV, black). A 4-cm-long tendon segment from 2 to 6&#x000a0;cm proximal to the scar in the epitenon was selected for analysis by one examiner (FR), being blinded to the treatment modality. Within this segment, every fifth colour-coded transverse image (distance between images 1&#x000a0;mm) was used to place a circular cursor (&#x02205; 5&#x000a0;mm) in or around the central core lesion, depending on its size. These contours were interpolated and ratios of echo types were analysed quantitatively as fractions of the determined volume. Mean values for the proportion of each echo type were calculated for all horses and for all time points. Ten scans obtained at different time points and from different horses were chosen randomly and analysed twice by the same examiner to determine the intra-observer reliability and by three examiners to determine the inter-observer reliability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Euthanasia and tissue harvest</title><p>Twenty-four weeks after creation of the lesion, all horses were sedated and anaesthesia was induced using a standard protocol.

Before testing, the exact CSA was measured at four locations along the length of the specimen using a laser device (Laser Micro Diameter LDM-110; Takikawa Engineering, Japan) and the average CSA was calculated. Strips were fixed in the loading device of a universal materials testing machine (Zwick 1445; Zwick, Germany) in a PBS bath and preconditioned with 3% strain at 1 Hertz for seven cycles. After that, specimens were loaded to failure with 0.5&#x000a0;mm/s. For each specimen, force (F) and displacement were recorded.

However, the fact that the hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) content in the AT-MSC-serum treatment group is closer to the normal situation may potentially indicate improved collagen crosslinking.</p><p>Hydroxylysine (HLys) is produced during a post-translational enzymatic modification process in tendon and is needed for the formation of the mature crosslinks HP and LP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Newly formed collagen within a lesion is less crosslinked than in mature tissue, which was most likely caused by enzymatic cleavage after the surgical trauma and the subsequent formation of more stable crosslinks during the remodelling phase resulting in repair tissue with higher tensile strength and stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p>The HP crosslink concentration per molecule of collagen in our study was the same in normal tissue as in AT-MSC-treated lesion tissue while lesion tissue treated with inactivated serum alone contained significantly less HP than macroscopically normal tissue. Despite the lack of significance between the AT-MSC-serum and serum groups this might be interpreted as a sign of superior crosslinking; that is, a better or more advanced repair after AT-MSC treatment.</p><p>The contents of lesion tissue in HLys and in LP as expressed per molecule of collagen were the same in tendon lesions treated with AT-MSC-serum and serum alone and in macroscopically normal tissue, showing that these post-translational modifications were by contrast not affected by creation of the lesions and the treatment modalities.</p><p>An increased GAG content of healing tendon lesions reflects a high tenocyte metabolism and an increased production of extracellular matrix. There is controversy about increased GAG content in tendon repair: on the one hand, degenerated tendon regions including fibrous scar tissue have been shown to contain higher concentrations of sulphated GAGs than normal tendons in humans and horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. On the other hand, an increased GAG content as expressed per DNA has been interpreted as a sign of improved tendon healing in a recent equine study after intralesional platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Interestingly, GAG contents of saline-treated control tendons in the latter study and in another study testing a plasma product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] were similar to the GAG content in both groups of the current study using the same surgical model of tendinopathy, respectively. This also corresponds well to findings in naturally injured SDFTs that were saline treated and contained significantly more GAG than corresponding BM-MSC-treated as well as untreated control tendons, which were relatively uninjured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the current study, GAG contents in tendon lesions were higher than in normal SDFT tissue from more proximal regions of the injured tendons. These GAG contents in turn were very similar to those from mid-metacarpal SDFT tissue from mature horses in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], suggesting that the proximal metacarpal region is suitable as a control to compare biochemical parameters of mid-metacarpal SDFTs and that SDFTs did not reach normal GAG content after treatment at the end of the observation period in the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], which implies that the end stage of healing had not been reached.</p><p>In the current study, lesions treated with AT-MSCs had the same content in total collagen and Hyp as tendons treated with autologous inactivated serum alone. Although replacement of tenocytes with new ones resulting from tenogenic differentiation after engraftment of MSCs with consecutive production of extracellular matrix (e.g. collagen, GAG) is a potential mechanism of the therapy used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the findings do not support that this mechanism of action played a major role in the current study.</p><p>Collagen and Hyp contents, however, were significantly lower than in macroscopically normal tendon tissue which contained as much collagen as unaltered tissue in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The finding that lesion tissue contains less collagen than normal tendon is in accordance with a previous study using the same model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Collagen types could have been differentiated between the more elastic type I and type III in the current study. However, MSCs as well as autologous serum have the potential to influence the expression of these collagen types during tendon repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The time frame in which expression of the collagen type I to III ratio reaches its optimum during the remodelling phase has not been clearly defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], so it remains unclear whether differentiation of collagen types would have helped to show which treatment modality was more beneficial in the current study.</p><p>Collagen content correlates positively with the modulus of elasticity representing stiffness and with the stress at failure of the tendon strips in the current study, because both parameters were significantly lower in lesion tissue than in macroscopically normal tendon tissue. This is a typical characteristic of scar tissue with low maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and also proves that tendon healing was still ongoing at the terminal stage of the current experiment. It has to be concluded that AT-MSCs did not significantly influence the biomechanical properties in surgically created SDFT lesions 22&#x000a0;weeks after treatment, as did PRP in a similar model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Stress at failure, one of the most important indicators for tensile strength of tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], was significantly lower after AT-MSC-serum treatment and after treatment with serum alone than in macroscopically normal tendon tissue harvested from a proximal segment from the same tendons. Based on the knowledge that intact tendon tissue from the proximal metacarpal region normally has similar biomechanical properties as tissue from the mid-metacarpal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], this finding suggests that scar tissue has not regained its original strength 22&#x000a0;weeks after AT-MSC treatment. Findings from the present study show that it is beneficial to include macroscopically normal tissue as a second control group during biomechanical testing as an intra-individual reference for normal tendon tissue which was not reported in similar studies previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p><p>Biomechanical properties of the repair tissue are closely related to functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], which becomes clinically manifest by the recurrence rate of natural tendon disease in horses and to a lesser extent by persisting lameness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Horses in the present study did not show signs of lameness until the end of the study period, which is in accordance with the observation that, in contrast to human patients with Achilles tendinopathy, chronic tendon pain does not play a major role in horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, the sensitivity of clinical examination alone is limited to monitoring lameness, especially in cases of bilateral tendon injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This could have been improved by using computerized gait analysis, but this was not available during the experiment. The study period and the exercise regimen could have been extended to determine the recurrence rate of tendinopathy, one of the most reliable parameters of long-term functionality. However, this was considered ethically unacceptable in an experimental study.</p><p>Swelling of SDFTs, another clinical parameter of inflammation, was less (weak significance) in AT-MSC-treated tendons than in control tendons only at a single time point (i.e. at 21&#x000a0;weeks after lesion induction). Because the ultrasonographically determined tendon cross-sectional area (TCSA) did not differ between groups at any time, the findings during palpation might be attributed to a decrease in subcutaneous swelling rather than in tendon diameter. Swelling was determined by palpation, a diagnostic modality which is subject to some inaccuracy, so it remains questionable whether AT-MSCs really influenced subcutaneous swelling during the remodelling phase (e.g. by reflux of the cell suspension during treatment).</p><p>In the current study, no significant reduction of clinical signs of inflammation and no reduction of fluid and/or cell accumulation during ultrasonography were recorded after injection of AT-MSC-serum during the acute inflammatory phase when compared with the effect of serum alone, which corroborates earlier in-vivo findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]&#x000a0;- although an increased echogenicity of collagenase-induced SDFT lesions was seen after AT-MSC application in a later study from the same group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Another experimental in-vivo study using the same surgical model as in the current study showed a significant reduction of fluid and cell accumulation by means of UTC early after intralesional treatment with PRP, which was interpreted as a reduction of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The authors of the current study would have expected similar effects after AT-MSC injection, because these cells are known to exert anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]: human AT-MSCs led to a reduced inflammatory response in synovial cells from patients with osteoarthritis by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Recently it has been shown in a canine model of tendon transection that collagen sheets seeded with AT-MSCs promote an anti-inflammatory M2-type macrophage phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Immunomodulatory actions of MSCs are thought to be dose and time dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], so that a higher MSC dose, implantation at an earlier or later time point after lesion creation or repeated injections might have led to different results. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no experimental data exist concerning the ideal dose and timing of MSC implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. On the one hand, it is hypothesized that there is a direct positive dose&#x02013;effect relation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]; on the other, experimental data show cytotoxic effects of high MSC doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. In a rabbit experimental study, BM-MSC&#x02013;collagen composites were used to repair patellar tendon defects and MSC concentrations of 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> and 8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml did not lead to additional biomechanical and histological improvement compared with 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. In the current study, the cell dose of 10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> AT-MSCs was based on recommendations from previous clinical and experimental trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. The time of injection might have been too late to induce early anti-inflammatory effects, which were achieved with PRP injections as early as 7&#x000a0;days after lesion creation in the same model of tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Although the ideal point of time for MSC treatment is not known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], it is hypothesized that tendons should be treated after the initial inflammatory phase and before fibrous tissue has formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Advised times range from 7 to 30&#x000a0;days between lesion creation and treatment with adipose tissue-derived cells has been described in experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Using high numbers of pure MSCs for treatment, cell culture per se implies a delay of cell injection. In a large clinical study, horses treated &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;weeks after injury had a lower re-injury rate than horses treated later, but this difference was not significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>].</p><p>In the current study the authors decided to postpone the MSC injection for another week, because lesions seemed to be less developed at ultrasonography 7&#x000a0;days after induction than in previous studies using the same model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which might be attributed to the use of a different burr during creation of the lesions, to confinement of the horses to box rest instead of exercising them after lesion induction, or to the model itself. The surgical model ideally creates a compartment similar to that typically seen in degenerative strain-induced tendon disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Creating these lesions requires general anaesthesia, which is a disadvantage, but this model is better standardized and considered less painful for horses than induction of core lesions with collagenase, a model which rather reflects the inflammatory component of tendinopathy. The response to these interventions in terms of the expansion of the lesion seems to be less pronounced in the surgical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The inflammatory response in the current study was most prominent relatively late - that is, at 5&#x000a0;weeks after surgery and 3&#x000a0;weeks after cell injection, as shown by UTC (peak in echo type IV) - so that at this time potential anti-inflammatory effects ascribed to AT-MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] might already have been weaker than the endogenous inflammatory response. In other words, the AT-MSCs could possibly not exert their effect adequately in an environment of only mild to moderate inflammation at the time of injection. Interestingly, in another in-vivo study using a collagenase model, AT-MSCs which were implanted 30&#x000a0;days after lesion creation (i.e. approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks later than in the current study) led to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration as determined by histology of biopsies at 30 and 120&#x000a0;days after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This finding suggests that later AT-MSC implantation at the end of a pronounced inflammatory phase might be more efficient, but the significant differences between both experimental models of tendinopathy may also play a role here.</p><p>Depending on the mode of action of MSCs implanted into tendon lesions (i.e. paracrine effects versus de-novo synthesis of tendon tissue), a decline of MSC population over time during the inflammatory and proliferative phase may be an explanation for the lack of substantial differences between the AT-MSC and control groups. Death of the MSCs is a potential reason: in an equine surgical model of tendinopathy, less than 5% of BM-MSCs survived more than 10&#x000a0;days and only 0.02% survived over 90&#x000a0;days after implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Allogeneic embryonic stem like cells (ESCs), by contrast, were detectable at a constant level over 90&#x000a0;days in the same study, which shows that development of stem cells from different sources may vary after implantation. High numbers of AT-MSCs could be detected with different modalities as long as 9&#x000a0;weeks after implantation into surgically created SDFT lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Labelled AT-MSCs injected into experimentally induced equine tendon lesions were partly found to remain viable and integrated in the lesion tissue after 24&#x000a0;weeks, although numbers of cells decreased over time, and MSCs could even be detected in SDFT lesions of the contralateral limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Together with the observation that labelled cells were retrieved in the peritendinous tissue near the injection site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], this implies a potential effect of the MSC treatment on the contralateral defect and a loss of MSCs effectively available in the treated lesion. Both effects may have limited the effect of the treatment.</p><p>It would have been valuable to test in the current trial whether the therapy exerted an anti-apoptotic effect on tenocytes, an effect which has been attributed to AT-MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. However, to address this it would have been necessary to take tendon biopsies to perform immunostaining with markers for apoptotic cells during the inflammatory phase, given the duration of the study. This was discarded because of the potential impact of the procedure on tendon healing. Further, the attraction of precursor cells as another potential mechanism of AT-MSC therapy is more relevant during early phases of tendon healing. Even after harvesting of tendon biopsies, it would have been a challenge to estimate this effect merely via determination of the cellularity, because there is no precursor cell-specific marker.</p><p>For injection, cells must be suspended in a medium, which may consist of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or autologous blood serum, the latter being considered a more adequate suspension medium by some authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. However, it was shown that autologous serum, cultivated in glass tubes at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x000a0;hours, contains significant amounts of IL-1ra and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], which implies that serum alone might influence tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Instead of fresh serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], thermally inactivated autologous serum was used in the present study and also injected into control group lesions. Alternatively, control lesions could have been left without puncture and treatment, but puncture alone has been shown to support drainage of early fluid accumulation and could theoretically guide peritendineal precursor cells into the lesion and thereby have a therapeutic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. For the same reason, repeat biopsies were not used in the current study compared with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Only two more control groups&#x02014;one without any puncture, and one with puncture alone but without injection&#x02014;could have ruled out these effects. However, a much larger study population would have been needed.</p><p>Twelve weeks after surgery, the ratio of type II echoes representing discontinuous fascicles not yet aligned into lines of stress was significantly higher in AT-MSC-treated lesions than in control lesions, which might be indicative for a pro-aligning influence of implanted AT-MSCs on the early organization of tendon matrix into tendon bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], potentially mediated by direct or paracrine coordinating effects of AT-MSCs on fibroblasts. However, differences did not last until the end of the observation period, and no effects on the percentage of type I echoes (i.e. intact tendon tissue) were evident in the AT-MSC group, so it remains unclear whether the finding is biological reality or due to chance. Clinical relevance seems limited.</p><p>Ratios for type I echoes, representative for fully aligned tendon bundles, did not reach those for intact tendon tissue inside the core lesion in terminal UTC scans. This indicates that there was still no complete restoration of perfectly aligned tendon bundles after 24&#x000a0;weeks, as expected after this timeframe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The finding that ratios of all echo types only changed mildly in the current study after week 12 is different from that of Bosch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], who used a similar model of tendinopathy and found further improvement; that is, a more pronounced decrease of the echo type IV ratio and an increase of the echo type I ratio between weeks 12 and 24 after PRP treatment of surgically induced tendon lesions.</p><p>Results of histology, biochemical analyses and biomechanical testing, which were only performed post mortem 22&#x000a0;weeks after treatment, correlate well with the UTC findings observed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. None of these diagnostic modalities showed differences between AT-MSC-serum-treated tendons and serum-treated controls. Compared with macroscopically normal SDFT tissue from the same horses there were significantly higher DNA and GAG contents, and lower Hyp and total collagen and HP contents. At the same time tenocyte nuclei were rounded, showing the more tenoblastic cell type, and cell density showed high local variations. Also, histologic scores for fibre structure and fibre alignment were increased in both groups. All of these findings are indicative for relatively high metabolic activity and ongoing tissue repair and remodelling at the end of the observation period (i.e. in the remodelling or maturation phase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It can be argued that to evaluate the end stage of tendon repair an observation period of 1&#x000a0;year would have been even more appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. However, it had been shown previously that the phases of early remodelling or maturation when newly formed collagen type I fibres are organized into bundles and orientate themselves into lines of stress take place between approximately days 45 and 120 after lesion induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], and it is hardly conceivable that differences would have been noted at 1&#x000a0;year but not after 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>In AT-MSC-treated lesions, no difference in vascularization was found histologically using a subjective five-point scale in this study. However, in a more detailed analysis reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] in which all clearly identifiable vessels on the entire tissue section were counted in the same specimen, there was a significantly higher number of vessels in AT-MSC-treated versus control tendons. This finding, together with the increase in Doppler signal detected at 2&#x000a0;weeks post treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], shows that the methodology used in the current study was obviously not sensitive enough to detect these relatively minor differences. In other equine experimental studies, an increase in Doppler signal could be detected at 6&#x000a0;weeks after implantation of AT-MSCs suspended in platelet concentrate into artificial SDFT lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], whereas intralesional PRP injection led to an almost continuous increase in Doppler signal in another investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Stimulation of angiogenesis by AT-MSCs was also postulated by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] while others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] showed endothelial cell apoptosis and capillary degeneration after application of rat BM-MSCs in vitro. Neovascularization is of utmost importance to assure transportation of cells and growth factors towards and away from the lesion site during the inflammatory and proliferative phases of extrinsic tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, there is controversy about the effects of a prolonged increase in vascularity, which is discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The effect of a single intralesional injection of cultured AT-MSCs suspended in autologous inactivated serum was not superior to the treatment of surgically created SDFT lesions with autologous inactivated serum alone in a surgical model of tendinopathy over an observation period of 22&#x000a0;weeks. AT-MSC treatment might have a positive influence on collagen crosslinking and therefore possibly on tensile stress resistance of remodelling scar tissue. Ultrasound tissue characterization (UTC) was a viable tool to monitor tendon healing non-invasively and the findings correlated well with results from end-stage histology, biochemistry and biomechanical testing, which proved that despite the onset of the remodelling phase, tendon healing was not completed after a period of 24&#x000a0;weeks. Randomized controlled long-term studies including naturally occurring tendinopathies are necessary to put the results of the current study into perspective before intralesional AT-MSC injection can be recommended (or rejected) as a viable option for the treatment of tendon disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec29"><p>
