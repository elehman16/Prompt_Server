HER-2 is overexpressed in 15%&#x02013;20% of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The anti&#x02013;HER-2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has led to a longer time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) time when added to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of metastatic HER-2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer patients, and it produces longer disease-free survival and OS times when administered with or following chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, resistance to trastuzumab is present or eventually develops in patients with metastatic disease, and recurrences following trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy still occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Lapatinib (Tykerb&#x000ae; or Tyverb&#x000ae;; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) is a small-molecule, reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A planned interim analysis of a randomized, open-label, phase III trial (EGF100151) in women with HER-2<sup>+</sup>, locally advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who progressed following treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab in the adjuvant or metastatic setting demonstrated that the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine led to a significantly longer independently assessed TTP. Based on that analysis, the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) recommended early termination of enrollment, notification of the patients of the results, and offering combination treatment to patients randomized to monotherapy. Efficacy and safety data from the interim analysis were reported at the time accrual was closed and a subsequent analysis of data through the termination of accrual was reported in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

The primary endpoint was independent assessment of TTP (defined as time from randomization to disease progression or death resulting from breast cancer). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) (the time from randomization to disease progression or death resulting from any cause), OS, the overall response rate, the clinical benefit rate (confirmed complete response plus confirmed partial response plus stable disease lasting &#x02265;6 months), and safety measured according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version 3.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Enrollment was stopped on April 3, 2006, based on a recommendation by the IDMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

The 11 baseline and disease history factors that were investigated have been correlated with survival and are considered to be prognostic in the management of patients with MBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These factors were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score (0 or &#x02265;1), number of metastatic sites (&#x0003c;3 or &#x02265;3), site of disease (visceral or nonvisceral), liver metastases (yes or no), stage of disease (IIIB/IIIC or IV), hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor negative and progesterone receptor negative, estrogen receptor positive, or progesterone receptor positive), time from last dose of prior trastuzumab to randomization (&#x02264;8 weeks or &#x0003e;8 weeks), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (&#x0003c;3 or &#x02265;3), age, time from diagnosis to randomization, and time from metastatic diagnosis to randomization.</p><p>A stepwise model-building approach was employed to evaluate the effects of these baseline prognostic factors.

Of these, 35 patients (90%) crossed over to combination therapy. An additional patient who had discontinued capecitabine because of disease progression 6 days prior to the time enrollment was halted also received combination therapy. As a result, a total of 36 patients crossed over to the combination arm, thereby confounding the effect of treatment on OS. The baseline prognostic factors for patients who crossed over to lapatinib plus capecitabine were similar to those of the 165 patients on capecitabine alone who did not cross over. Because there is no optimal methodology to adjust for crossover in a survival analysis, several approaches were used to conduct exploratory analyses.</p><p>Exclusion of crossover patients from the analysis resulted in median OS times of 75.0 weeks in the combination group and 56.4 weeks in the monotherapy group, with an HR of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.62&#x02013;0.97; <italic>p</italic> = .023) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).

This analysis reflects the benefit these patients received from capecitabine monotherapy; however, it is a conservative analysis and potentially favors the capecitabine arm as a result of the fact that patients who died after crossover were censored.</p><p>A Cox regression model considering crossover as a time-dependent covariate was used to adjust for the effect of crossover without excluding the effect of capecitabine on OS for the patients who crossed over. The Cox regression with time-dependent crossover accounts for the effect of capecitabine as well as the effect of the combination following crossover. When crossover was used as a time-dependent covariate, the HR for the crossover effect was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.41&#x02013;0.98; <italic>p</italic> = .042), suggesting that patients' risk for death was lower with crossover to lapatinib plus capecitabine. The HR for the treatment effect (<italic>n</italic> = 408) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.64&#x02013;0.99; <italic>p</italic> = .043), suggesting a clinically relevant 20% lower risk for death for patients in the combination arm.</p><p>A final Cox regression model considered crossover as a time-dependent covariate and included the baseline prognostic factors identified as significant in the previous Cox regression analysis (i.e., ECOG performance status score, presence or absence of liver metastases, and number of metastatic sites).

The hepatobiliary SAE reports were confounded by underlying medical conditions: worsening of pre-existing liver metastasis, alternative diagnoses (e.g., bile duct obstruction), and concomitant medications associated with hepatobiliary SAEs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>D<sc>iscussion</sc></title><p>The EGF100151 study was originally designed with a planned enrollment of 528 patients to provide 90% statistical power to detect a 50% longer TTP and 80% statistical power to detect a 30% longer OS time. The OS analysis was to be performed after 457 deaths had occurred. When the interim analysis demonstrated a significantly longer TTP (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43&#x02013;0.77; <italic>p</italic> = .001) with the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine, patient enrollment was halted before the sample size of 528 patients was met. The 340 deaths in the final analyses provided only a 68% power to detect a 30% longer OS time. If crossover patients derived additional benefit with crossover to the combination treatment, the ability to detect a significant difference in OS may have been further hampered. Nevertheless, it is important to evaluate differences in OS recognizing the limitations of the analysis and to explore methods that attempt to address the potential impact of crossover.</p><p>The mature survival analysis performed when 83% of patients had died shows a trend for improvement with the combination. Although these data suggest that the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine led to a longer survival time, further research is needed to identify patients who may benefit the most from the addition of lapatinib to chemotherapy. However, it would be difficult to gather more information from the current study because of premature stoppage of accrual to the trial, crossover effects, and the effects of subsequent treatments on OS.</p><p>Exploratory analyses adjusted for baseline disease history and treatment crossover were conducted using several methodologies to adjust for crossover. Each of the methods demonstrated a greater reduction in the HR for death than that determined by the ITT analysis, suggesting that the benefit from the combination following crossover from monotherapy may have impacted the ability of the ITT analysis to demonstrate a significant difference in the OS times. These updated survival analyses support the demonstrated efficacy of lapatinib in the TTP analysis in this heavily pretreated population.</p><p>Exploratory analyses have also been conducted to determine whether the interval from the last dose of prior trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and the number of prior trastuzumab-based regimens would predict differential clinical benefit from lapatinib. These analyses did not identify any subset of patients who did not benefit from the addition of lapatinib but suggested that lapatinib may be more effective in patients who had received only one prior trastuzumab-containing regimen. However, more research is needed to confirm these results because of the small number of patients in each subset.</p><p>The incidences of SAEs were similar in the capecitabine monotherapy and lapatinib plus capecitabine combination arms. Diarrhea was the most common SAE reported for this study. Lapatinib did not appear to be associated with a greater risk for key SAEs, including pneumonitis/pneumonia, LVEF, and hepatobiliary events.</p></sec><sec><title>C<sc>onclusion</sc></title><p>An interim analysis of EGF100151 showed significant clinical benefits, including a trend toward OS in favor of combination therapy, versus monotherapy in patients with trastuzumab-pretreated HER-2<sup>+</sup> MBC. These results led to the premature termination of accrual to the study, and patients receiving monotherapy were permitted to cross over to combination therapy. Although premature termination and crossover resulted in insufficient power to detect an OS benefit, these updated analyses confirm a trend toward an OS advantage in the combination arm. A Cox regression analysis considering crossover as a time-dependent covariate suggested that there may have been a 20% lower risk for death in the combination therapy arm. In addition, the incidences of SAEs were largely consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Overall, these updated analyses continue to support the clinical benefit and safety of lapatinib in patients with HER-2<sup>+</sup> MBC.</p></sec><sec><title>C<sc>ontributors</sc></title><p>At the time of the study, the following investigators and institutions participated: M.
