Some current behavior management techniques may help to reduce resistant negative behaviors and facilitate the acceptance of the treatment by the child<sup>[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Although such techniques are effective in some patients, those with mental, physical or communicational underdevelopment will not be able to benefit from the management techniques<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. In such cases to avoid a substandard and unsafe dental treatment, a combination of behavior modification and pharmacologic methods are advised<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Conscious sedation as a pharmacologic anxiety control technique in pediatric dentistry is a way to make a cooperative yet conscious condition in an uncooperative dental patient<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. As defined by American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) conscious sedation is a controlled drug-induced state, with a minimally depressed consciousness during which patients are able to maintain ventilatory function and respond to verbal or physical stimulations<sup>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Drugs and dosages in conscious sedation have a margin of safety to preclude unconsciousness and maintain the reflexes intact<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the past decades introduction of benzodiazepines in particular midazolam has decreased the use of other sedative agents with less efficiency or more adverse effects<sup>[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Midazolam, as a water soluble benzodiazepine with no active metabolites and mild side effects, demonstrates anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic and amnesic effects<sup>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. The most common way of administration for this drug is via oral route, although other routes of administration, such as intramuscular, transmucosal and intravenous, have also been defined<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Nevertheless, the oral route has demonstrated less predictable results compared to other routes. Children undergoing sedation by the oral midazolam have to starve for 4-6 hours before the dental treatment and they will have postoperative nausea and vomiting more frequently<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Recently transmucosal sedation has received attention in conscious sedation procedures<sup>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Rapid onset of action, ease of administration, higher bio-availability, absence of nausea, vomiting and respiratory side effects make this way more effective in emergency dental practice of young children unable to fast<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Intranasal (IN) and buccal are two possible routes of midazolam transmucosal sedation. However, the IN sedation, although widely used, may be uncomfortable to the young patients due to the mucosal irritation during its administration<sup>[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. Because of the advantages of the buccal midazolam in management of status epilepticus, interest has focused on this route in medical circumstances, yet its application in dentistry is currently not common<sup>[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>;<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It has been suggested that oral administration of midazolam is a safe and acceptable form of sedation in pediatric dentistry<sup>[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, however, despite of numerous superior advantages of the buccal Midazolam, its application has been limited and to date there is no literature comparing these two methods. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of buccal midazolam in dental pediatric patients and to compare it with oral Midazolam.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>The study was designed as a prospective randomized, crossover, clinical trial and approved by Shahed University Ethics Committee. It was preregistered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with code IRCT2013020312350N1.</p><p>The study took place at pediatric dentistry clinic of Shahed University, Tehran, from November 2011 to June 2012. Out of 34 patients referred for dental treatment, 18 uncooperative healthy American society of Anesthology I (ASA I) patients between 2.5 and 6 years, were recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Eligible participants were those who needed bilateral and identical restorative and pulptreatment requiring 2 or more dental visits and were unable to tolerate the dental procedure with behavior management techniques. Those with known hypersensitivity to the drug, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, renal or hepatic impairment, upper respiratory tract infection and tonsillar hypertrophy were excluded. A full written and verbal explanation of the study was given to the parents and an informed consent obtained. Children were assigned to one of the 2 groups (1 or 2) according to their medication in their first appointment by simple randomization procedures using a random number table. Group 1 received 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam syrup (Amsed, 2.5 mg/ml, Dales Pharmaceutical, England) 30-45 minutes before treatment, while group 2 was given 0.3 mg/kg buccal midazolam (Epistatus, 10mg/ml, Special Product Ltd, England), 15-30 minutes prior to dental procedure. The other regimen was used at the second appointment. All the dental treatments were carried out by an experienced pediatric dentist assisted by a trained dental sedation nurse and both of them were blinded to the applied sedation method.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPD-24-198-g001"/></fig><p>A sedationist administrated the medication, recorded patients&#x02018; weight before the first appointment and monitored pulse rate and oxygen saturation by a pulse oximeter, every 10 minutes during treatment and at recovery in each session. The sedation procedure and dental treatment was performed in an eligible ambulatory setting. All patients were instructed to refrain from liquids and solid foods for 2 and 4 hours.</p><p>The sedationist placed the drug in the mandibular buccal sulcus in both quadrants using a unique syringe in children receiving buccal sedation. Patients were encouraged trying not to swallow the sedative medication for a few moments to permit transmucosal absorption. The oral midazolam was administrated by a needleless syringe and the sedation nurse made sure that the child has swallowed the whole drug.</p><p>Once the child demons&#x000ad;trated adequate level of sedation, dental treatment was initiated. A proper level of sedation was achieved when the child appeared relaxed or exhibited slurring of speech, mild ptosis and took a distant gaze<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Benzocaine 2% as a topical anesthetic was applied on the dried mucosa for 2 minutes followed by lidocaine 2% with 1:80000 epinephrine local analgesics in a standard technique. After achieving a total analgesia, the dental treatment was performed.</p><p>Behavior of each patient during the 2 appointments was recorded by a camera and evaluated by an experienced pediatric dentist who was also blinded to the groups, according to the four categories of the Houpt behavior rating scale<sup>[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Postoperatively the acceptability of each method for children and their parents was assessed by a 5 point visual analogue scale (VAS) and a 3 point questionnaire, respectively<sup>[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. VSA evaluated the anxiety level of the child during the treatment. This self-report measurement instrument comprised of 5 cartoon-type faces, numbered 1-5 and from left to right: 1 represented &#x0201c;calm&#x0201d; and 5 displayed &#x0201c;very high anxiety&#x0201d;. Children were asked to put a mark on the faces according to the intensity of their anxiety. The questionnaire also as a self-report assessment tool, asked the parents how they found the efficacy of each method (ineffective to very effective). At the end of each session patients were transferred to recovery room and supervised by their parents and the sedation nurse. Finally the standard criteria for discharge were used<sup>[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 10.0 for windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). A nonparametric Wilcoxon sign rank test was utilized to compare the ordinal parameters of the two medications. Quantitative data were examined by the Paired t&#x02013;test.

An optimal sedation method for children should be efficient, safe and easy to use and acceptable for patients<sup>[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. Present study compared the safety, efficacy and patients&#x02019; and parents&#x02019; satisfaction of the oral and buccal midazolam sedation.</p><p>In the present investigation 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam and 0.3 mg/kg buccal midazolam was administrated. Although some researches indicate that oral midazolam at the range of 0.25-1 mg/kg is safe and no difference was found in sedative effects of 0.5 mg/kg, 0.75 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg of oral midazolam<sup>[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>, others have reported adverse effects in children receiving 1 mg/kg<sup>[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Some studies suggested 0.5 mg/kg of oral midazolam as safe and efficient in sedating children<sup>[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Johnson et al found no significant difference between the physiologic and behavioral impacts of 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam and 0.3 mg/kg transmucosal midazolam<sup>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Due to the successful results of investigations implementing 0.3 mg/kg transmucosal midazolam, we have chosen this dose of midazolam for buccal sedation<sup>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the present research an onset time of 30-45 minutes for oral midazolam and 10-15 minutes for buccal midazolam was applied before the dental treatment. Selecting the time interval was based on the fact that the peak plasma level of oral midazolam occurs approximately 30 minutes after drug administration and is comparable to the peak plasma concentration of buccal midazolam after 10 minutes<sup>[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Our findings support the hypothesis that both types of sedation methods are safe. The highest pulse rate was 175 bpm observed in one patient,</p><p>exceeding the normal rate of 130 bpm. This resultshould be considered in light of the fact that the normal heart rate in physiologic condition may pass 170 bpm during crying, which is not life threatening and only persistent tachycardia would require close monitoring<sup>[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>. Similar to the heart</p><p>rate, the arterial oxygen saturation levels were clinically comparable in both medication regimens and did not surpass the critical levels<sup>[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. The lowest oxygen saturation level of 94% in this study was comparable to the findings of Wilson et al with the same minimum oxygen saturation, in which a lower dose of buccal midazolam [0.2 mg/kg) was administrated. This may indicate that based on the arterial oxygen saturation, the 0.3mg/kg dose of the buccal midazolam is as safe as 0.2mg/kg<sup>[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. However, despite the similarities between the two studies, caution should be exercised when comparing the findings, as differences such as study design and age group of patients may affect the data. Oxygen de-saturation was also observed by Johnson et al when using 0.5mg/kg oral midazolam or 0.3 mg/kg intranasal midazolam. However, such de-saturation was reported to be false and attributable to the violent movements and hysterical crying of the patient, rather than the direct effect of the drug<sup>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>According to the observer&#x02018;s evaluation based on the Houpt behavior classification for &#x0201c;sleep&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;movement&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;crying&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;general behavior&#x0201d; there was no significant difference between the two sedation methods. In both methods the majority of the subjects remained calm, with no or little movement and crying in the first and last phase of the dental treatment, showing that midazolam in both forms may successfully reduce the unwanted movements and crying reactions of the uncooperative patient.</p><p>During the sedation procedure most of patients were fully awake. Shapira et al reported a greater proportion of patients asleep or drowsy compared to our study when a combination of midazolam and hydroxyzine was administered. They concluded that combination of sedative drugs should be approached with a great caution due to their additive adverse effects <sup>[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, 94.4% and 88.9% of the subjects were rated with a score of 3 and less for oral and buccal route respectively. Lima et al reported a relatively lower success rate for midazolam. Nevertheless, they declared that the value of reported success rate was limited as the behavior assessments were carried out every 15 minutes and a more comprehensive evaluation of the whole session was not possible by this method<sup>[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>. To overcome this bias we have filmed the entire treatment sessions and divided this into 2 phases (the first and the last 20 minutes). This was especially helpful as the serum concentration of the drug may vary by the time, thus probably resulting in various behavioral reactions<sup>[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Parents did not prefer one regimen over the other, and were overall satisfied with both of the methods. Most of the patients experienced no or mild anxiety during the treatment. One of the factors influencing the acceptability of the sedative agent through oral route is its taste. The vials of intravenous midazolam, which are widely used in oral midazolam sedation, have a bitter taste, which may be not tolerable for young patients <sup>[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. To solve this problem usually extemporaneous formulations with unidentified bioavailability are used<sup>[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>. As we have used syrup of oral midazolam with a palatable taste; this was not the case in our study. Neither buccal midazolam nor oral midazolam resulted in any paradoxical or disinhibition reactions in our subjects and this was in agreement with the findings of Wilson et al<sup>[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This study was designed in a cross-over manner, reducing the impact of individual variants throughout the study, as each patient serves as his or her own control <sup>[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup>. To minimize the bias of the evaluations, a blinded observer confirmed the ratings and an operator completed the dental procedures.</p><p>There were some limitations to the present study. First, the parents&#x02019; opinion regarding their child&#x02019;s treatment is a subjective and very individual measure. Although self-report assessments are widely used to attain qualitative information on the acceptability of the sedation procedures, however, a more detailed questionnaire may help to overcome this shortcoming<sup>[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Second, the fluidity and bitter taste of buccal midazolam resulted in increased salivation and difficulty in retaining the medication in buccal sulcus, thus a minute amount of the buccal midazolam may be swallowed and not buccally absorbed. Therefore we recommend production of midazolam in a gel form, avoiding oral ingestion and allowing maximum transmucosal absorption.</p><p>This study was primarily intended to investigate the safety, efficacy and acceptability of buccal midazolam as a sedative agent for dental treatment, however, we suggest a similar survey focusing on the recovery characteristics of this medication after the completion of sedation procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both 0.3 mg/kg buccal midazolam and 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam resulted in similar efficient sedation outcomes. We did not observe any arterial oxygen de-saturation or abnormal heart rate in subjects receiving either of the 2 methods. Both medication regimens received high acceptability among sedated children and their parents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The research described in this article was financially supported by Shahed University, Tehran, Iran.
