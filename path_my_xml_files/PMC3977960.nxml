Women with neck pain &#x0003e;30 mm VAS (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;131) were included in the present analysis. The training group (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;77) performed specific resistance training for the neck/shoulder muscles three times a week, and the control group (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;54) received advice to stay active.

Between-group differences in neck pain reached significance after 4 weeks (11 mm, 95% CI 2 to 20). The time-wise change in pain showed three phases; a rapid decrease in the training group compared with the control group during the initial 7 weeks, a slower decrease in pain during the following weeks (week 8&#x02013;15), and a plateau during the last weeks (week 16&#x02013;20). Adherence to training followed a two-phase pattern, i.e. weekly participation rate was between 70&#x02013;86% during the initial 7 weeks, dropping towards 55&#x02013;63% during the latter half of the training period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Four weeks of specific resistance training reduced neck pain significantly, but 15 weeks is required to achieve maximal pain reduction. The time-wise change in pain followed a three-phase pattern with a rapid effect during the initial 7 weeks followed by a slower but still positive effect, and finally a plateau from week 15 and onwards.

Relevant changes were observed after only 4 weeks of strength training indicating that this amount of time is necessary to achieve a minimal clinical relevant pain reduction <xref rid="pone.0093867-Dworkin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093867-Kovacs1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Further decrease in pain intensity was seen until week 16 with the steepest slope on the neck pain/time curve &#x02013; i.e. fastest decrease in pain intensity - during the initial 7 weeks of training Adherence to training was highest during the initial 7 weeks of training after which adherence to training was decreasing &#x02013; especially after week 10 which coincided with a national vacation week. This implied that following holidays, adherence to training was challenged and special efforts may be necessary to keep adherence high. Although adherence to exercise decreased during the latter phase, training motivation remained high all through the intervention period.</p><p>The strength training protocol used in the present study has previously been shown to rapidly and effectively reduce neck pain and improve muscle function in office workers with trapezius myalgia <xref rid="pone.0093867-Andersen4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093867-Andersen5" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus, Andersen et al. showed that 10 weeks of high intensity strength training induced a linearly time-wise decrease in pain intensity by 79% from baseline in women with chronic neck pain <xref rid="pone.0093867-Andersen4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Consequently, the observed significant and clinically relevant neck pain reduction in the present study was expected. In our study, the initial 10 weeks of training decreased pain intensity by 36% from baseline, and by 49% at the end of intervention. The less significant pain reduction seen after 10 weeks of training in the present study may partly be explained by a somewhat more heterogeneous pain group than in the study by Andersen et al. (2009) where only women with diagnosed trapezius myalgia were included and all training sessions was closely supervised.</p><p>Contrary to the intensive short term intervention by Andersen et al. <xref rid="pone.0093867-Andersen4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, a plateau in neck pain reduction was reached during the present 20 week intervention period. Thus, our study showed a time period &#x02013; i.e. 15 week - after which no further reductions in pain were seen. However, weekly adherence to training was achieved by only 60% of the participants during the last 5 weeks which may explain the decrease in efficacy during the last phase of the intervention. Although the observed plateau may be explained by low adherence, the finding suggest that phase I (week 1&#x02013;7) and II (week 8&#x02013;15) result in minimal (17 mm) to moderate (27 mm) clinical significant relevant neck pain reductions, respectively, with improvements maintained throughout the last phase of the training period (week 16&#x02013;20). Consequently, it could be stated that the present &#x0201c;exercise dose&#x0201d; taken in a 15 week period will be sufficient to reach an optimal neck pain reduction - presupposing that weekly adherence to training is achieved.</p><p>In the control group a decrease in neck pain intensity was observed in the initial 10 weeks. This observation may be explained by the fact that chronic neck pain symptoms are known to display seasonal variation, worsening in the autumn and decreasing in the spring <xref rid="pone.0093867-Takala1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Since the present study took place from January to June, a general decrease in neck pain symptoms was expected.</p><p>In the present study we did not investigate the underlying mechanisms of pain reduction. However, we have previously tested the effect of similar types of exercise in a small group of women with chronic neck muscle pain (trapezius myalgia). In that study, the women with chronic neck muscle pain had a marked pain-inhibition of muscle function as measured by isokinetic dynamometry and electromyography <xref rid="pone.0093867-Andersen8" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093867-Andersen9" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. After the 10 week strength training intervention pain was reduced <xref rid="pone.0093867-Andersen10" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and muscle strength increased as expected in response to strength training <xref rid="pone.0093867-Andersen11" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, but more importantly the ability to rapidly develop muscle force almost doubled <xref rid="pone.0093867-Andersen12" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The mechanisms responsible may not only be physiological, but could partly be explained by distinct psychological factors. That is fear avoidance of movement as often observed in pain patients, leading to slow and stiff movements, was abolished after the strength training period. Thus, strength training reduces pain, and also restores muscle function and the ability to use the body in a more natural way. From a physiological point of view the high intensity strength training exercises can increase blood flow to the painful muscles and enhance protein turnover of muscle tissue, which may aid recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, specific resistance training effectively reduced neck pain among female industrial technicians with frequent neck/shoulder pain symptoms. During a 20 week intervention period, the time-wise change in pain followed a three-phase pattern with a rapid effect during the initial weeks followed by a slower effect during the latter phase, and finally a plateau during the last 5 weeks. Decreased participation rate may explain the decrease in efficacy during the latter phase of the intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The contribution in terms of manpower allowing employees to train during work time for 1 hour per week for 20 weeks was given by the workplaces involved.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0093867-Bot1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
