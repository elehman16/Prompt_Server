Over 41,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year in the UK and about 34,000 in England alone. Just under 16,000 colorectal cancer patients die each year in the UK, equating to one death every 32 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. About 20% of patients have liver metastases at presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and another 30% subsequently develop liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) has provided a good long-term survival for many patients who would have previously been treated with palliative therapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, only about 7&#x02013;20% of people with CLM undergo potentially curative liver resection because of the age and co-morbidities of the patient or because of the extent of cancer spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Increasing the number of patients who can undergo potentially curative therapy for liver metastases alone is a main NHS goal for improving the outcome for bowel cancer patients in the UK. Therefore, specialist liver resection centres are carrying out more extensive and complex resections including elderly patients with major co-morbidity. This more extensive surgery in patients with co-morbidity is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality (high-risk patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Thermal ablation</title><p id="Par16">Thermal ablation is an alternative modality for treatment of CLM and involves destruction of cancer by heat. Thermal ablation includes established modalities such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA).</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Radiofrequency ablation</title><p id="Par17">RFA involves localised destruction of the tumour using heat generated by high-frequency alternating current to produce coagulative necrosis of the tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For the treatment of CLM, it is generally carried out as a short-stay procedure under general anaesthesia, although it can also be performed under local anaesthesia in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Multiple sessions may be required to treat all the tumours in some patients. It can be performed percutaneously under image guidance (usually CT scan) but can also be performed by open or laparoscopic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Contraindications for RFA include lesions close to the hepatic hilum or adjacent to the hepatic duct as injury may lead to delayed stenosis of the duct and lesions abutting the bowel because of the risk of perforation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Lesions near large blood vessels are often difficult to treat because of dissipation of heat by circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. According to the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) criteria, RFA is recommended for CLM only when there are &#x02264;&#x02009;5 lesions and tumour size does not exceed 3 cm at its longest axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The dose delivered for RFA varies from one patient to another and is guided by the ablation zone diameter. The target is to heat the tissue to 60 &#x000b0;C at which coagulative necrosis occurs but keep the electrode tip temperature &#x0003c;&#x02009;100 &#x000b0;C to avoid charring and vaporisation of tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Microwave ablation</title><p id="Par18">MWA involves localised destruction of the tumour using heat generated by microwave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For the treatment of liver lesions, it is usually carried out as a short-stay procedure under general anaesthesia as with RFA, although it can also be performed under local anaesthesia in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As with RFA, multiple sessions may be required in some patients to treat all the lesions (index disease). It is usually performed percutaneously under image guidance (usually ultrasound scan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is more effective than RFA in lesions near large blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Major technical limitations of MWA include low power, shaft heating, large diameter probes, long and relatively thin (1&#x02013;2 cm) ablation zones, and unpredictability regarding the size and shape of the zone of ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Effectiveness of ablation methods</title><p id="Par19">These methods are currently used for patients with CLM not suitable for surgical resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and not for patients with a possibility of curative liver resection surgery because of high local recurrence rates with thermal ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Multiple studies have highlighted the superiority of surgery to ablation for preventing recurrence within the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recent series from Nishiwada et al. showed a 13% recurrence after surgery as opposed to 46% after thermal ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Other newer modalities of thermal ablation include laser ablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thermal ablation may be associated with a lower chance of cure than surgery because of the problem with local recurrence. To determine the evidence for thermal ablation, a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA)-funded systematic review of literature was commissioned and subsequently published in February 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The systematic review identified one non-randomised comparative study in which the survival in patients with RFA was similar to liver resection surgery despite the RFA group having more co-morbidities or more extensive liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. An exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis performed by the group based on this non-randomised study showed that RFA has the potential to be cheaper and might result in better health-related quality of life. Another non-randomised study published since this systematic review has also shown that patients undergoing RFA have survival comparable to surgery despite having more extensive liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, an underpowered randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed no evidence of difference in survival between MWA and liver surgery in resectable CLM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, in another non-randomised study published after the systematic review by Loveman et al., people who were eligible for surgery but preferred RFA had poorer survival than those undergoing surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Comparison of methods of thermal ablation</title><p id="Par20">Non-randomised studies comparing MWA with RFA suggested that MWA is better than RFA in terms of technical feasibility and lower disease recurrence in patients with unresectable CLM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Of the newer forms of ablative methods, such as HIFU, CyberKnife&#x000ae;, and cryotherapy, there are no publications comparing these newer ablation methods with either RFA or MWA. In reality, different surgeons and radiologists have their own preferences of method of ablation because of this uncertainty.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Potential advantages of thermal ablation over surgery</title><p id="Par21">Current evidence suggests that thermal ablation has lower complication rates and better health-related quality of life than surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thermal ablation is also less expensive than liver resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which will result in cost savings to NHS. Ablation therapy has the potential to decrease the pain after treatment and time taken for recovery from cancer therapy which will decrease the number of work days lost by the patient and relatives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Potential concerns about thermal ablation compared with surgery</title><p id="Par22">The major concern about thermal ablation is the high incidence of local recurrence and extrahepatic recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As a result, it would be anticipated that it will not offer similar cancer-related outcomes as liver resection surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, in patients who are at high surgical risk but would currently be considered for liver resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the short- and long-term outcomes after surgery are poorer than the normal surgical cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and hence thermal ablation may be a valid alternative to surgery for this group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Uncertainty in treatment of patients with potentially resectable colorectal liver metastases</title><p id="Par23">The HTA review suggested that there is equipoise regarding treatment using ablation or surgery of elderly patients and those with significant co-morbidities which pose significant risk from a surgical procedure and that good quality evidence of both the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of ablation is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In summary, liver resection is a modality with higher short-term mortality and complication rates and poorer quality of life during the first 3&#x02013;6 months but with low local recurrence rates and a high potential for cure: &#x0003e;&#x02009;25% of patients are alive five years after liver resection of CLM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; ablation is a less expensive modality with practically no short-term mortality, lower complication rates, earlier recovery, and higher short-term quality of life but with high local recurrence rates and the crucial uncertainty of whether it could offer similar long-term cancer-related outcomes as liver resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. From a practical aspect, the choice in the treatment of patients with potentially resectable CLM lies between these two modalities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>When can one consider ablation to be equivalent to liver resection in terms of long-term results?</title><p id="Par24">Liver resection for CLM is a major surgical procedure and carries a postoperative mortality of approximately 3&#x02013;4% and a complication rate of ~&#x02009;40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Because of the effects of major surgery and the associated pain, the patients take about 2&#x02013;3 months to recover from surgery and the quality of life is only 0.65 on a scale of 0 to 1 (1 indicating perfect health) even six months after liver resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. As the patient group identified for this trial are those considered high-risk in terms of age, co-morbidity and the extent of liver resection required, the mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay are likely to be considerably higher than the average and the health-related quality of life and recovery period significantly greater.</p><p id="Par25">In contrast, the ablative methods have fewer complications (6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and the quality of life is 0.74 (on a scale of 0 to 1) by three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An informal discussion with patient representatives from Bowel Cancer UK suggested they were willing to trade-off 3&#x02013;6 months (average 4 months) of their long-term survival in return for a less-invasive procedure with significantly lower complication rates compared to surgery. So, on average, the long-term results of ablation and surgery can be considered equivalent if the difference in long-term survival between the modalities is &#x0003c;&#x02009;4 months. Clearly, if ablation results in similar or better survival, ablation is the better option since it is less invasive and results in better quality of life in the short-term.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Choice of patient group to be investigated</title><p id="Par26">There has been no adequately powered RCT comparing ablation vs surgery in patients with CLM. Retrospective cohort studies highlight the high local recurrence rate associated with thermal ablation in comparison to liver resection surgery but a much lower procedure-related morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The options include performing a RCT for low-risk patients (young patients without co-morbidities with limited extent of cancer spread) with CLM, high-risk patients with CLM, or all patients with CLM who are suitable for undergoing liver resection. There is good long-term data on the efficacy of surgical resection. Surgical resection provides low rates of local recurrence and disease-free survival (DFS) proportions of ~&#x02009;28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, there is a high rate of local recurrence following thermal ablation and a lack of long-term data on the efficacy of ablation in patients with CLM. Because of the known rates of local recurrence and the lack of long-term data on cancer outcomes, the majority of clinicians feel that it is unethical to randomise low-risk patients to ablation or surgery despite the short-term benefits of lower complication rates, less pain and lower costs in patients undergoing ablation.</p><p id="Par27">While some non-randomised studies did not justify these concerns and demonstrated equivalent survival between RFA and liver resection despite patients undergoing RFA having more co-morbidities or more extensive cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], another non-randomised study supported these ethical concerns and demonstrated that RFA had poorer five-year survival compared to surgery, the only difference between the patient groups in the second study being their preference for RFA or surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">However, with high-risk patients, there is significant uncertainty as to the benefits of surgery and the majority of clinicians feel that there is equipoise between these modalities for this patient group.

This will also allow us to perform sensitivity analyses using imputation methods to assess the impact of changing the proportion of each type of treatment performed within arm on the primary treatment effect estimate.

We will estimate cost-effectiveness during the &#x02018;within-trial&#x02019; period (two years/within-trial analysis) and also over the expected lifetime of the patient (lifetime/long-run analysis). The within-trial analysis will be based on resource use, health-related quality of life and survival data collected in the trial; the long-run analysis will be based on a decision-analytical model constructed using trial data supplemented with data from published sources. In the within-trial analysis, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) will be calculated for each patient based on the survival data and health-related quality of life data collected during the trial.

Cost components included in the analysis will consist of the detailed cost of the ablation procedures (including annuitised capital costs plus consumables), laparoscopic and open surgical resection procedures, the costs of treating the complications of these procedures, CT scans and other imaging tests, MDT meetings, costs of chemotherapy, contacts for receipt of chemotherapy, contacts and medications for treating the side effects of chemotherapy, plus other resource use associated with the cancer and its sequelae (e.g. outpatient attendances, hospital readmissions, palliative care, primary care contacts, prescribed medications, use of social services including hospice care). The volume of resource use for each cost component will be measured directly in the trial from patient records and using patient diaries; unit costs will be taken from standard published sources.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Method</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Design: semi-structured interviews</title><p id="Par125">A purposive sample of up to 20 patients will be recruited over nine months from across the pilot study sites, to include the three outcomes of consent: (1) participant consented and accepted treatment allocation; (2) participant consented to randomisation but refused the allocated treatment; (3) participant refused participation in the trial. In-depth, semi-structured interviews will explore patient perspectives of treatment, their understanding of the two treatments, reasons for taking part or refusing the trial and the acceptability of randomisation between the procedures.</p><p id="Par126">A purposive sample of approximately 15 healthcare professionals (local principal investigators, recruiters) from across the pilot study sites will be interviewed. Participants will be selected on the basis of their ability to shed light on the recruitment process (initial discussion, recruiter interview). Interviews will explore their views about the trial, clinical equipoise and their understanding of the recruitment challenges.</p><p id="Par127">Patient and staff interviews will be informed by a topic guide developed in conjunction with PPI representatives and informed by the literature. All interviews will be audio-recorded with permission.</p><p id="Par128">Participant information sessions (recruiter encounters) will be audio-recorded (with permission) to examine how information is presented by recruiters and received and understood by patients, to identify issues potentially affecting trial recruitment. Information gleaned from the interviews and listening to the participant information sessions will inform the development of training materials for the main trial.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par129">All interviews will be professionally transcribed verbatim and managed usingNVivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The data will be analysed using thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and coded independently by two researchers for emerging themes who will then compare codes and themes and resolve any disagreements by consensus. The analysis will be further refined by using constant comparison and contrastive approach, and looking for negative cases. A subset of up to 60 patient recruitment encounters (audio recordings of recruitment encounters) will be analysed using content analysis to identify potentially directive uses of language and good practice.</p><p id="Par130">Information gained will be utilised to optimise patient information provided relating to the study (recruitment interview and PIS) and to advise clinical staff about how to describe the study, which will enable recruitment to be maximised in the main trial. Our own STAR trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] has confirmed the value of such approaches in improving recruitment. Emerging issues related to trial design and conduct that may be responsible for poor recruitment will be discussed with the trial team and a plan to improve recruitment during the pilot trial will be introduced if necessary. This may include reconsideration of eligibility criteria, redesign of study information, advice about presenting the study, discussions about equipoise or evidence, which may be addressed by changes to study information, protocol or training for recruiters.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par131">With the development of new technologies, new methods for cancer treatment are being introduced into the healthcare market and need to be evaluated in terms of both efficacy and cost-effectiveness in comparison to competing therapies. Unless this is performed, newer, more cost-effective therapies will not be introduced into the NHS or costly treatments which are ineffective may be adopted. This problem applies at the present time with the recent introduction of thermal ablation techniques as an alternative to surgery for the treatment of patients with CLM. If effective, they should be more widely implemented in the NHS and the technology refined. If they are ineffective, support for more extensive surgery is required and the technology should be abandoned. It is important that any evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness between competing therapies should be based on RCTs, which ensure that similar types of people receive the two therapies. In addition, the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria should be such that it should be possible to perform both therapies in an adequate way in order to maintain equipoise and to avoid a therapy being considered superior to another because of the selection of participants to be included in the trial. In the LAVA trial, we will include only participants who are eligible for ablation and surgery. Although we have left it for the local specialist MDT to make the decision as to whether the potential participant is eligible for both ablation and surgery, we anticipate that the participants included meet the CIRSE criteria for RFA for CLM, i.e. &#x02264;&#x02009;5 lesions and tumour size does not exceed 3 cm at its longest axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par132">Controversies in cost-effectiveness are frequently addressed through an NIHR-funded HTA. A recent report on clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ablative therapies in the management of liver metastases suggested that a trial investigating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ablation vs surgery in patients with resectable CLM is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The long-term results of ablation and surgery can be considered equivalent only if the difference in long-term survival between the modalities is &#x0003c;&#x02009;4 months due to the recovery period required following major liver surgery. However, the true difference in cancer survival between ablation and surgery in patients with CLM is not known.</p><p id="Par133">&#x02018;NHS England Strategic and Operational Planning 2014 to 2019&#x02019; states the following &#x02018;The healthcare system is facing the challenge of significant and enduring financial pressures. People&#x02019;s need for services will continue to grow faster than funding, meaning that we have to innovate and transform the way we deliver high quality services, within the resources available, to ensure that patients, and their needs, are always put first.&#x02019; Clearly, it is important to maximise the health of people using the resources available.</p><p id="Par134">This research will achieve this purpose of maximising the health of people using the resources available. The results of this research can be adopted immediately in the UK because of widespread availability of expertise in both thermal ablation techniques and liver resection surgery, resulting in maximisation of the health benefits using the resources available in a short period of time for high-risk patients with potentially resectable CLM. This research may also have indirect benefit for low surgical risk patients with CLM in the long term. The results of the current research will either justify the concerns of clinicians who consider that thermal ablation is inferior to surgery for the treatment of patients with CLM (in which case, no RCT comparing ablation and surgery will be conducted in low surgical risk patients as it is extremely unlikely that ablation is equivalent or better than surgery in low surgical risk patients if it offers worse results than surgery in high surgical risk patients) or it may reassure clinicians that ablation is an effective therapy in which case, a subsequent RCT may be conducted in low surgical risk patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec48"><p>
