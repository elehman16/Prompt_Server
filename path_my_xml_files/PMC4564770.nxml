This study examined whether myofascial structural integration therapy, a complementary treatment that manipulates muscle and fascia, would improve gross motor function and gait in children &#x0003c;4&#x02009;years with cerebral palsy. Participants (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;29) were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (NCT01815814, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://goo.gl/TGxvwd">https://goo.gl/TGxvwd</uri>) or Open Label Extension. The main outcome was the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 assessed at 3-month intervals. Gait (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) was assessed using the GAITRite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> electronic walkway. Parents completed a survey at study conclusion. Comparing Treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) and Waitlist-Control groups (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9), we found a significant main effect of time but no effect of group or time&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;group interaction. The pooled sample (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) showed a main effect of time, but no significantly greater change after treatment than between other assessments. Foot length on the affected side increased significantly after treatment, likely indicating improvement in the children&#x02019;s ability to approach a heel strike. Parent surveys indicated satisfaction and improvements in the children&#x02019;s quality of movement. MSI did not increase the rate of motor skill development, but was associated with improvement in gait quality.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>spasticity</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>myofascial structural integration</kwd><kwd>Rolfing<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd><kwd>motor function</kwd><kwd>gait</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Gerber Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100001130</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">11PH-010-1210-2986</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">Maternal and Child Health Bureau<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100007305</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">77MCO9796-01-00</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="8099"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the term used to describe a set of non-progressive disorders of movement and posture that lead to limitations in functional activity and can be attributed to disturbances that occurred in the fetal or infant brain. These disorders of movement are frequently accompanied by other medical or functional issues: disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and/or behavior; epilepsy; and/or secondary musculoskeletal problems (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The prevalence of CP has been reported to be 2.11 (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) to 3.6 cases/1000 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), making it the most common movement disorder of childhood. The most prevalent variant is spastic CP. Muscles affected by spasticity have increased velocity-dependent sensitivity to stretch, causing stiffness, tightness, and interference with movement, which can lead to joint contracture and deformity. Children with mild forms of spastic CP usually walk independently. Visual gait analysis has identified slower velocity, shorter stride length, and longer double support time in ambulatory children with CP relative to typically developing peers (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>None of the common treatments for spastic CP, including physical and occupational therapy; bracing; medications; and surgical procedures is completely satisfactory. Non-invasive treatments often have limited or temporary treatment effects that fail to substantially change the natural course of the condition or improve an affected limb&#x02019;s functional capacity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Localized treatment with injections of botulinum toxin A is associated with only temporary improvements in selected gait parameters and in reducing spasticity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Systematic reviews suggest that a combination of approaches may be more effective than a single approach to treatment (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In the past, spasticity was attributed solely to the etiologic non-progressive central nervous system injury. Recent evidence suggests that skeletal muscle and its extracellular matrix are altered in CP (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Increased passive stiffness within the muscle bundle is accompanied by increased collagen content within the extracellular matrix and by increased sarcomere length, rather than by abnormalities of the mechanical properties of individual muscle fibers. These findings implicate structural changes in the muscle and extracellular matrix of muscle as important contributors to the increased muscle tone and stiffness in CP&#x02009;(<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Targeting the local structural changes, especially before the development of contractures and deformities, might, therefore, be a helpful component of a comprehensive strategy to improve motor function in young children with CP. The goal of the present study was to determine if a treatment that manipulated muscle and surrounding fascia, used as an adjunct to physical therapy, occupational therapy, and routine medical care, could improve motor function and gait in young children with spastic CP.</p><p>The treatment we assessed was myofascial structural integration (MSI). MSI is a specific manipulative and movement-based complementary medicine practice, developed by Dr. Ida P. Rolf in the 1930s. In MSI, a trained practitioner manually manipulates muscle and fascia in order to free up stiff body parts and joints, increase stability, improve balance and mobility, and put the body into proper alignment to facilitate improved motor patterns. This treatment was selected because its goals are appropriate for children with CP, it follows a standard and reproducible 10-week protocol and it addresses the whole body, not just legs or arms. Previous research on MSI for individuals with CP found that patients with mild CP experienced improvements in such gait parameters as cadence, velocity, and stride length after a standard course of treatment with MSI (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A recent preliminary randomized crossover design trial of MSI in young children with CP showed greater improvements after a course of MSI than after a comparable number of control play sessions, though some children improved throughout the entire study (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A case report found improvements in cadence and double support time in two children with spastic CP after MSI (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). MSI is distinct from massage, another movement-based complementary practice, which has been shown to have variable effects on adolescents with CP (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to determine whether MSI therapy, used as an adjunct to physical and occupational therapy, could improve gross motor function in young children with spastic CP. We hypothesized that a course of MSI treatment added to the existing regimen of physical and occupational therapy would lead to greater gains in gross motor function than the therapies alone. A secondary aim of the study was to evaluate changes to select gait parameters after the treatment in those children who were ambulatory at the time of Enrollment. The final aim was to obtain parental impressions of the MSI treatment and its impact on the children after treatment. Though MSI is a non-invasive approach, we surveyed families after the treatment to determine if there were any adverse effects and to learn if parents saw benefits that were not captured in our assessments.</p><p>If MSI were to prove effective, it could be incorporated into the treatment plan of young children with spastic CP as an adjunct to conventional therapies. Ideally, it would delay or eliminate the need for risky, invasive, or time-limited treatment options. Because it is safe, it could also be used repeatedly across the child&#x02019;s development. It is important to prove efficacy because though safe, the standard course of 10 sessions may not be reimbursed by health insurance and is, therefore, expensive for families.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Young children with spastic CP were recruited from a university medical clinic, state-funded medical therapy programs that serve children with CP, and through self-referral from local publicity. We studied young children, less than age 48&#x02009;months at the time that consent was obtained because they are in a dynamic period of development, generally before the onset of deformities and contractures, and therefore possibly more likely to change than older children or adults. Eligibility criteria were as follows: diagnosis of spastic CP (or mixed CP with spasticity); no recent history of seizures, surgery, or botulinum toxin A injections; receiving physical therapy; and level II, III, or IV on the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or a level of II, III, IV on the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) for children who were GMFCS I, as determined by a physical therapist or pediatrician on the study team. Throughout the study, the children continued to participate in their typical treatment regimen, which included physical therapy at minimum and depending on the child, may have also included occupational therapy, medications, other complementary treatments (e.g., Feldenkrais Method), and regular recreational activities (e.g., swimming). The Institutional Review Board at Stanford University approved the protocol and parents provided informed consent prior to their child&#x02019;s participation.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We enrolled 26 children in the Randomized Cohort on a rolling basis and assigned them to one of the two groups through the use of a random number sorter: Treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) or Waitlist-Control Group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Two children, one from each group, did not complete the treatment protocol and were dropped from further analyses. Three children originally assigned to the Waitlist-Control Group were reassigned to the Treatment Group to accommodate the children&#x02019;s circumstances: one to complete the treatment protocol before the anticipated birth of a sibling, one to avoid delay in physician-prescribed botulinum toxin A injections, and one to avoid further waiting for a child whose participation was delayed while she enrolled in a physical therapy program. The revised sample size in the Randomized Cohort was Treatment Group <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15 children and Waitlist-Control Group <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study group assignment: original randomization group assignments in the Randomized Cohort, subsequent shifts, and addition of the Non-Randomized Cohort</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fped-03-00074-g001"/></fig><p>Phase 2 was an Open Label Extension. Children randomized to the Waitlist-Control Group received the treatment after the wait period. In addition, funding permitted the enrollment of five additional children (&#x0201c;Non-Randomized Cohort&#x0201d;), all of whom were assigned to the Treatment Group in order to complete the protocol before the end of the funding period. We then compared the Treatment Group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) to the Waitlist-Control Group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9). We also evaluated the pooled sample (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) for change over time.</p><p>All of the participants were scheduled for an evaluation at Enrollment and every 3&#x02009;months for a total participation period of 9&#x02009;months. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the stages of the study. All of the children waited 3&#x02009;months and had a second assessment prior to MSI treatment in order for us to assess the rate of developmental change prior to the experimental treatment. The second assessment was called the Pre-Treatment Assessment for the Treatment Group and the Wait Assessment for the Waitlist-Control Group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The Treatment Group underwent MSI therapy between the second and third assessments. The Waitlist-Control Group began MSI therapy after the third assessment. Both groups had a Post-Treatment Assessment and the Treatment Group was also assessed at a 3-month Maintenance assessment. All participants completed at least three assessments, including the post-treatment assessment, and 27 of the 29 children completed four assessments (one moved away from the geographic area before study completion and one began therapy with botulinum toxin A injections), to show whether skills remained stable during maintenance for the Treatment Group.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Study design: assessment points and treatment periods for the Treatment and Waitlist-Control groups</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fped-03-00074-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Treatment</title><p>Each child was scheduled for 10 weekly 60- to 90-min sessions of the MSI intervention. All of the children completed 9 or 10 of the scheduled sessions. A single Certified Advanced Rolfer (KSP) with over 35&#x02009;years of experience working with young children provided the therapy in her private studio. MSI treatments followed the specific, structured sequence that addressed the entire body. The researchers prepared the parents and the children by explaining the therapy as a type of bodywork similar to deep tissue massage. Children remained partially clothed and lay on a table, sat on the floor, or sat on a parent&#x02019;s lap during the treatment. During each session, the clinician manually manipulated the muscles and fascia of the section of the body that was the focus for that day.</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Primary outcome measure: The gross motor function measure-66</title><p>An assessor (physical therapist or pediatrician) blind to each child&#x02019;s group assignment completed the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66). The GMFM-66 is an observational measure that was developed to capture the gross motor capacity of children with CP. It is has been shown to be valid, reliable, and responsive to change (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The 66-item tool utilizes a 0&#x02013;3 rating scale to measure skills in five different dimensions (A: Lying and Rolling, B: Sitting, C: Crawling and Kneeling, D: Standing, and E: Walking, Running, and Jumping). The total score, between 0 and 100 (higher scores indicating greater function), is obtained using specialized program scoring software that is based on a logit scale. Each assessment was videotaped and scored. After the conclusion of the study, videos for participants who demonstrated irregular score patterns were reviewed and their corresponding GMFMs rescored if required.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5"><title>Secondary outcome measure: GAITRite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> electronic walkway</title><p>Gait assessments of all ambulatory children were recorded and analyzed using the GAITRite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> electronic walkway. Its ease of operation makes this 14-foot walkway suitable for use with children. Several studies have documented the reliability of the measures in children with CP (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). As a child traverses the GAITRite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> walkway, pressure exerted by foot contact on the surface activates sensor pads embedded in the electronic mat. The walkway records the geometry of the activating foot contact and the relative arrangement of contact points in two-dimensional space. Spatial and temporal characteristics of the gait are calculated based on foot contact geometry.</p><p>Children walked barefoot over the walkway at a self-selected pace. Multiple passes over the walkway were obtained at each assessment. For analysis, a Walk was defined as the averaged data of the first two and up to four passes over the walkway that included a minimum of eight fluent steps in one direction across the mat with one foot always on the mat (indicating a walking pace). Passes in which the participants ran, stopped, or navigated off the mat were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="S2-6"><title>Secondary outcome measure: Parent satisfaction survey</title><p>At the conclusion of the study, parents were given a &#x0201c;Parent Satisfaction Survey&#x0201d; that the research team developed to record parents&#x02019; impressions of changes they saw in their children over the course of the study. The survey also allowed parents to provide feedback to the researchers about the study in general. The survey included the domains of emotional affect, functional body control, balance/flexibility, strength, height, weight, and functional achievements. The 11-question survey included open-response questions, such as, &#x0201c;Did you notice any changes in your child&#x02019;s balance/flexibility (walking, standing, climbing stairs, tripping)?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Did you notice any changes in your child&#x02019;s strength (self support, pulling up, climbing)?&#x0201d; The survey also included two ratings of satisfaction: &#x0201c;Parent Rating of Satisfaction&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Parent Rating of Child Satisfaction.&#x0201d; Each rating was recorded on a Likert Scale, with 1 as the lowest score and 10 as the highest score.</p></sec><sec id="S2-7"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="S2-7-1"><title>Primary Analysis</title><p>Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22. As preliminary analyses, we first compared the Treatment and Waitlist-Control groups from the Randomized Cohort using independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-tests and Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test to establish if the groups were comparable on the basis of mean age, gender, race (comparing White to Non-White), CP type (comparing hemiparesis diagnosis to non-hemiparesis diagnosis), CP severity (comparing GMFCS levels I and II to III and IV), and mean GMFM-66 score at Enrollment. To assess treatment efficacy within the Randomized Cohort, we used a Repeated Measures ANOVA; GMFM scores at assessments II and III (Pre-Treatment to Post-Treatment for the Treatment Group and Wait Assessment to Pre-Treatment for the Waitlist-Control Group) were the within subject variables and randomization group was the between subject variable.</p><p>In the Open Label Extension, we compared the five children in the Non-Randomized Cohort to the group of 24 children in the Randomized Cohort using independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-tests and Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test to ensure that the groups remained comparable in composition on the same metrics as mentioned above.

The results of both the RCT and Open Label Extension showed that the children improved in gross motor function over time, but the rate of improvement on this measure was no greater immediately after treatment than with developmental change alone. Analyses of spatial and temporal gait parameters using an electronic walkway revealed changes in foot length, possibly representing improved heel strike, on the more affected side but no changes in the other gait parameters. A parent survey at the conclusion of the study found that parents were generally very satisfied with the treatment and saw improvements in their children&#x02019;s function that were not detected by the selected outcomes measures. In summary, in this sample of children with CP, MSI did not increase the rate of motor skill development, but was associated with an improvement in gait quality and with positive parent reports of changes.</p></sec><sec id="S4-2"><title>Lack of change in GMFM-66 scores as a function of treatment</title><p>We did not detect changes in the rate of improvement on the GMFM as the result of MSI treatment. These negative findings suggest that MSI treatment is not effective in improving the rate of gross motor development in children with CP. However, the secondary analyses suggested modest qualitative improvements. It is, thus, possible that the treatment led to changes that were not detected by the GMFM-66 measure.</p><p>The GMFM is a very demanding outcome measure. Studies of other therapies have also failed to reach significant change on the broader 88-item GMFM measure (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Studies assessing botulinum toxin A injections have found improvements in spasticity reduction and gait improvements without corresponding statistical difference in GMFM scores between treatment and control groups (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), did not include a control group, or did not compare the GMFM improvement to that expected with time alone (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Of over 100 studies, we found only three RCT studies that showed improvements in GMFM scores after treatment with botulinum toxin A compared to controls (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). For future studies, other outcomes measures of gross motor skill that may be more sensitive to change than the GMFM-66 should be considered.</p><p>Why might the GMFM fail to register change as a result of therapy in our study population? The assessment requires cooperation from the children during testing. Young children with CP may be inconsistent in their behavior and motivation and, therefore, inconsistent in their performance on the measure. In this study, most children showed consistent improvement in their GMFM-66 score. However, occasionally, children experienced a reduction in their scores from session to session. Many factors, such as mood, sleep disturbance, and level of cooperation, may contribute to the variability in scores (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). For children who are either at the floor or the ceiling of the skills that the GMFM is able to measure, a very slight change in consistency in the child&#x02019;s performance may bring about a dip in performance.</p><p>Another challenge in using the GMFM-66 as the outcome measure is that the degree of expected change varies as a function of age and severity of motor disability. In previous trials, children who were young (&#x0003c;3&#x02009;years of age) and had mild CP showed greater change in GMFM scores than children who were older and had more severe CP (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Because the children in our study were young, the rate of developmental change, even without treatment, was relatively rapid, making it difficult to discern changes specifically related to the intervention. An acknowledged limitation of the GMFM measure is that children functioning in the middle of the GMFM-66 range have greater potential to change than children whose initial assessment is either very low or very high. In this study, 6 children were at GMFCS Level I and 12 children were GMFCS Level IV, with 18 out of 29 total participants in either of one of these categories. In both of these groups, it would be difficult to detect change based on the treatment. Because of the heterogeneity of the etiology and clinical presentation amongst children with a diagnosis of CP, Damiano recently cautioned that in order to advance evidence-based practice in the field of CP treatment, investigators and clinicians must consider each child individually when determining a treatment&#x02019;s potential to improve function, and when developing and interpreting RCTs, answering not only the question of &#x0201c;what works&#x0201d; but also the question of &#x0201c;what works for whom&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>A final challenge in using the GMFM-66 as the outcome measure was that it was designed to measure change in skill level rather than change in quality of movements. As stated by Russell in a validation study for an early version of the GMFM, &#x0201c;It is likely that the changes detected by the GMFM reflect only part of the &#x02018;real&#x02019; change in motor behavior over time, since many aspects of improvement are qualitative rather than quantitative. For example, we have the impression that when children use aids to perform motor functions they often have more qualitative than quantitative improvement in function. The GMFM does not appear to detect these changes or improvement well&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Indeed, in order to achieve a higher score on the GMFM-66, children must make relatively major changes in gross motor function. For example, a child with hemiplegia may have a markedly improved heel strike after treatment, contributing to stability and balance. To observe changes on the GMFM-66, however, she might have to make the significant gain of being able to stand on her affected leg and kick a ball with her other foot. Such an accomplishment might exceed the type of change that the improved heel strike might be expected to induce.</p></sec><sec id="S4-3"><title>Changes in the gait analyses after treatment</title><p>The quasi-experimental gait analysis demonstrated a significant increase in foot length on the more affected side after treatment. We interpreted increased foot length as an increase in the amount of foot contact with the mat. We did not think that the change represented growth in the foot because the less affected foot did not change significantly in length and both feet did not change in width, as would be predicted with growth. Rather, the selective increase in foot length most likely represents a lowering of the heel toward the floor and decreased toe walking, resulting in greater overall foot contact with the mat. We do not think that this finding was a spurious result. We did not find a change in foot length prior to treatment, in the maintenance phase, or in the foot on the less affected side. Improvements in heel strike could be seen visually on the videotapes obtained during the use of the GAITRite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> electronic walkway. Finally, some parents mentioned on the final survey that they had observed an improvement in gait and balance. It is also interesting to note that three children began to walk during or shortly after MSI. One child started walking within a few months of completing the treatment. These data suggest that MSI, when used as a complementary treatment, may improve aspects of gait in ambulatory children with mild spastic CP.</p><p>Ambulatory children with spastic CP demonstrate specific gait abnormalities. Ankle plantar flexor muscles are often overactive with ineffective dorsiflexor muscles, leading to the dynamic equinus foot deformity and poor heel strike, or incomplete foot contact, characteristic of toe walking. Decrease in dynamic equinus can be a treatment goal because it contributes to balance, stability, and reduces energy expenditures during walking, leading to functional improvements. The change in foot length occurred despite the fact that MSI treatment encompassed the whole body and did not specifically address only the foot. Targeting a specific part of the body may not be necessary for change to occur. It is interesting to note that this improvement in a motor skill would <italic>not</italic> be quantified in the GMFM-66, supporting the notion that MSI may improve quality of movement rather than promote quantitative functional change.</p><p>Two previous studies of MSI and gait found improvements in gait that we did not detect. A 10-child case series using bilateral insole sensors to assess gait parameters found that children with mild CP demonstrated improvements in cadence, velocity, and stride length; children with moderate CP demonstrated only improvements in velocity; and ambulatory children with severe CP did not demonstrate any gait improvements (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Because of our small sample size, we did not analyze our ambulatory children separately based on CP severity, and, therefore, we may not have picked up on any differences within individual severity subgroups as the earlier study did. A recent case series using similar methodology as the current study in two older children with spastic CP found improvements in cadence and double support time after a course of MSI (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Unlike the previous study, we analyzed only passes over the mat in which one foot was on the mat at all times in order to eliminate runs. Velocity independently influences cadence and time spent in single support and double support for children with CP (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We chose to limit gait measurement variability by eliminating runs. However, we may have limited our ability to detect increases in maximum velocity, and its correlate, cadence. Likewise, because a running child is likely to spend less time in double support than a walking child, we may have been less likely to find changes for this gait parameter in our walking sample.</p></sec><sec id="S4-4"><title>Results of the parent survey</title><p>The qualitative reports from parents of the participants suggested that the children benefited from the therapy in ways not quantified by the Gross Motor Function Measure-66. Parent comments included &#x0201c;better walking, balance still shaky but better,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;better head control,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;improved functional use of hands,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;decreased limp.&#x0201d; Such comments highlighted improvements in the quality of the children&#x02019;s movements rather than in motor skills that would be measured by the GMFM-66. Such qualitative changes may contribute to the children&#x02019;s ability to engage in day-to-day tasks. We recognize that parents were aware of which treatment phase the child was in over the course of participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="S4-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>Limitations of the study were the relatively small sample size of 29 children and the uneven distribution of GMFCS levels. In addition, the Treatment and Control groups were weighted toward more severe levels of CP, which may have limited the amount of improvement we were able to observe with the GMFM-66. Furthermore, because of scheduling conflicts and the late addition of five participants into the Treatment Group without randomization, our Treatment Group and Waitlist-Control Group were unequal in size, although similar in other variables. In the secondary gait analysis, because of the small study sample size, there were not enough ambulatory participants to utilize the RCT design of the larger study for the analyses, so a quasi-experimental design was used. We did not have any measures of motor function other than the GMFM-66, which is not a sensitive measure for detecting improvements in quality of movement. Similarly, the GAITRite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> electronic walkway may not be the optimal modality for determining improved heel strike or other gait improvements; metrics reflecting ankle kinetics, kinematics and use of in-shoe foot sensor technology might yield greater precision and accuracy. We did not have any measures that assessed spasticity reduction in our children. Another limitation is that the young participants were inconsistent in their performance on the GMFM assessments and in their gait assessments. We reported inconsistent performances on the GMFM assessments for some children and eliminated many passes across the GAITRite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> mat because of erratic ambulation. This variability and these exclusions may have limited our ability to observe changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion and Future Directions</title><p>In summary, MSI treatment used as a complementary treatment in young children with spastic CP did not increase the children&#x02019;s rates of change on the GMFM-66 beyond the background rate of change from development and other therapeutic interventions. In ambulatory children, the treatment was associated with increased foot length on the affected side, possibly representing improvements in heel strike and gait quality. Parents generally found MSI therapy to be beneficial to their children in ways that were not captured by the main outcome measure. We think that further assessment of manipulative therapies to address the muscle and extracellular matrix changes in spastic CP is warranted. Future studies might consider inclusion of other outcomes measures in the research design, including ones that measure quality of movement, spasticity, quality of life, and functional changes in domains, such as mobility, self-care, communication, and social function.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Stanford Institutional Review Board (Protocol 16807), and the recommendations were adhered to.
