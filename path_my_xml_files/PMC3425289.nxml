There is no specific guideline on the ventilation modes for this group of patients. Although several studies have been performed to determine the optimal ventilatory settings in these patients, the answer is yet to be found. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) in comparison with volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) for maintaining oxygenation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in obese patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred and two adult patients of ASA physical status I and II, Body Mass Index of 30&#x02013;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in this prospective randomized open-label parallel group study. To start with, all patients received VCV. Fifteen minutes after creation of pneumoperitoneum, they were randomized to receive either VCV (Group V) or PCV (Group P). The ventilatory parameters were adjusted accordingly to maintain the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 40 mmHg. Respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation and peak airway pressure were noted. Arterial blood gas analyses were done 15 min after creation of pneumoperitoneum and at 20-min intervals thereafter till the end of the surgery.

This mechanical effect of PCV allows a homogeneous distribution of ventilation leading to better ventilation&#x02013;perfusion matching.

The inclusion criteria were patients of either sex, aged between 18 and 39 years, of ASA physical status I and II, with Body Mass Index between 30 and40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, no major obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease (defined as &#x0003c;70% of predicted value for pulmonary function test variables of volume and flow), PaCO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 45 mmHg and scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Exclusion criteria were patient refusal, anticipated difficult intubation, inability to maintain stable ventilator settings for 30 min, patients with a history of obstructive or restrictive type of lung diseases, known hypersensitivity to any drugs used in this study, ASA physical status III and IV and conversion to laparotomy.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>A pilot study involving 20 patients (10 patients in each group) was performed to determine the difference of mean PaO<sub>2</sub> between groups and the within-group standard deviation. The difference of means was found to be 30 and within-group standard deviation as 60. From this data and assuming a probability of Type I error as 5%, it was calculated that a minimum of 73 patients would be required for the study to be able to reject the null hypothesis with a power of 85%. A total of 1252 patients were needed initially to get 102 patients (51 patients in each group) incorporated into the study.</p><p>Following complete pre-anaesthetic evaluation, a peripheral venous access and an arterial access were secured and a baseline arterial blood sample was drawn for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. Routine continuous monitoring including pulse rate, blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), respiratory rate, capnometry and electrocardiogram were done throughout the procedure. The pre-operative readings as well as the readings in intra-operative period were recorded at an interval of 15 min and considered for statistical analysis. All members of the team provided care to all the patients. A standard protocol for general endotracheal anaesthesia with controlled ventilation was conducted in all patients.</p><p>All patients received oral alprazolam 0.5 mg the night before the surgery; intravenous inj ranitidine 50 mg and inj metoclopramide 10 mg 2 h pre-operatively, inj glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intravenously 30 min pre-operatively and inj fentanyl 2 mcg/kg 5 min before induction. After proper pre-oxygenation, patients were induced with inj propofol 2 mg/kg. The trachea was intubated with a PVC-cuffed endotracheal tube of appropriate size after achieving adequate relaxation with inj suxamethonium 1 mg/kg. The lungs were ventilated with 50% nitrous oxide, 50% oxygen and isoflurane 0.9&#x02013;1%. Muscle relaxation was maintained with inj vecuronium bromide 0.08 mg/kg followed by additional top-up doses of 0.02 mg/kg, maintaining muscle relaxation at &#x0003c;2 twitches (using a train-of-four sequence) of adductor pollicis muscle measured every 15 min. Bispectral index was used to monitor the level of anaesthesia (BIS maintained between 40 and 60). Inj tramadol 2 mg/kg was administered for additional perioperative analgesia.</p><p>To start with, all patient's lungs were ventilated (Penlon Prima SP, AV 800 ventilator. Penlon Limited. Abingdon Science Park.Barton Lane. Abingdon OX14 3PH. United Kingdom.) using VCV with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg and inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. Respiratory rate was adjusted to obtain an end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) of 35&#x02013;40 mmHg. After pneumoperitoneum (intra-abdominal pressure 10&#x02013;12 mmHg), patients were placed in a 25&#x000b0; head-up position. Fifteen minutes after pneumoperitoneum, patients were randomized with the help of a computer-generated random number list to receive either VCV (Group V; <italic>n</italic>=51) or PCV (Group P; <italic>n</italic>=51).</p><p>In Group V, ventilation was continued with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg. The initial tidal volume was increased by 1 mL/kg every 5 min until 12 mL/kg, and the respiratory rate was increased by 2/min every 5 min till 20/min to maintain EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 40 mmHg. Patients in Group V were shifted to laparotomy when EtCO<sub>2</sub> could not be maintained with tidal volume of 12 mL/kg and respiratory rate of 20/min. Following fall in EtCO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;35 mmHg, the respiratory rate was decreased by 2/min every 5 min till 8/min, with a decrease in tidal volume of 1 mL/kg until 6 mL/kg.</p><p>In Group P, the airway pressure not exceeding 35 cmH<sub>2</sub>O was set to provide a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg. Respiratory rate was adjusted to keep an EtCO<sub>2</sub> of 35&#x02013;40 mmHg. Following an increase in EtCO<sub>2</sub>, the respiratory rate was increased by 2/min every 5 min till 20/min, achieving the target EtCO<sub>2</sub>. Following a fall in EtCO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;35 mmHg, the respiratory rate was decreased by 2/min every 5 min till 8/min, with a decrease in airway pressure by 2 mmHg every 5 min until 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Patients in PCV requiring airway pressure &#x0003e;35 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and respiratory rate &#x0003e;20/min to maintain normocarbia were shifted to VCV and were dropped from the study.</p><p>Arterial blood samples were drawn 15 min after establishment of pneumoperitoneum and at 20-min intervals thereafter till the end of the surgery. Patients requiring conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy were excluded from the study. Laparotomy was advised when the patient was unable to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;95% and EtCO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;45 mmHg.</p><p>Neuromuscular blockade was reversed if the train-of-four ratio was &#x02265;2 twitches with inj neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and inj glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. The patient was extubated after fulfilling the criteria of adequate reversal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were entered into an excel spread sheet and analysed using standard statistical software like SPSS and Statistica.

Reduced FRC can result in lung volumes below closing capacity in the course of normal tidal ventilation, leading to small airway closure, ventilation&#x02013;perfusion mismatch, right-to-left shunting and, ultimately, arterial hypoxaemia. Anaesthesia worsens this situation such that up to 50% reduction in FRC occurs in obese anaesthetized patients compared with 20% in the non-obese.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Moreover, pneumoperitoneum causes 30% lower static compliance and 68% higher inspiratory resistance in supine anaesthetized obese patients compared with those of normal weight patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] During laparoscopy, diminished FRC, ventilation&#x02013;perfusion mismatch and pulmonary shunting contribute to a decrease in arterial oxygenation, which is further exaggerated in the obese patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Ventilation&#x02013;perfusion inequalities in obese patients during laparoscopy may require about 15&#x02013;25% increase in minute ventilation to maintain normocarbia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] But, the increase in tidal volume or respiratory rate does not improve arterial oxygenation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Although several studies have been performed to determine the optimal ventilatory settings in these patients, the answer is yet to be found.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The primary goal of mechanical ventilation is the maintenance of adequate gas exchange, which must be achieved with minimum lung injury and the lowest possible degree of haemodynamic impairment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The large tidal volumes used in VCV to maintain normocarbia during laparoscopic surgery in obese patients may lead to certain deleterious effects. High inflation volumes that intend to aggressively recruit atelectatic lung units overdistend the normal alveoli, leading to alveolar rupture and volutrauma. It can also exert an inflammatory lung injury similar to adult respiratory distress syndrome. The inflammatory mediators in the lung can also be released into systemic circulation, resulting in inflammatory injury to the distant organs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Monitoring EtCO<sub>2</sub> is an adequate guide for determining the minute ventilation required to maintain normocarbia,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and it provides a reasonable approximation of PaCO<sub>2</sub> in healthy patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Therefore, in our study, we maintained EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 40 mmHg in both the groups for comparison of oxygenation between the two groups. After pneumoperitoneum, it takes about 15 min for PaCO<sub>2</sub> to reach a plateau.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Thus, in this study, arterial blood samples were taken for analysis 15 min after the establishment of pneumoperitoneum.</p><p>In our study, 35 min after the creation of pneumoperitoneum, significantly lower respiratory rate was required to maintain normocarbia in Group P compared with Group V. Although the difference in respiratory rate was statistically significant, it was not clinically relevant (12.20&#x000b1;0.57 in Group V vs. 11.53&#x000b1;0.61 in Group P).</p><p>Statistically significant higher tidal volume and minute ventilation were required for maintenance of normocarbia during VCV compared with PCV. It can be explained by the fact that large tidal volume in VCV mainly ventilates the non-dependent portion of the lung, leading to excessive stretching of those regions without improving the overall ventilation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] On the contrary, in PCV, recruitment of collapsed alveoli due to high flow rate in the early inspiratory phase leads to improved lung ventilation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Although the delivery of tidal volume and minute ventilation were lower in PCV, adequate CO<sub>2</sub> elimination was achieved due to overall improvement in lung ventilation. Thus, the adverse consequences of large tidal volume delivery like rise in peak pressure, plateau pressure, volutrauma and inflammatory lung injury could be avoided in PCV.</p><p>Balick-Weber <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] noted no significant difference in arterial oxygenation in patients receiving PCV compared with the patients receiving VCV. But, in our study, 35 min after establishment of pneumoperitoneum, a significantly higher PaO<sub>2</sub> value was found in Group P than that in Group V. Cadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] observed a similar finding in their study. The improved oxygenation in PCV may be explained by the delivery of &#x0201c;square wave&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] of pressure to the patient's airway. Pressure develops rapidly due to the very high flow at the initiation of inspiration followed by rapid flow deceleration. By delivering a larger proportion of tidal volume early in the inspiratory phase, the lung is maintained at a higher volume recruiting more alveoli to participate in gas exchange.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] PCV is also associated with increased mean airway pressure, a ventilatory parameter found to correlate with oxygenation status.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the patients receiving PCV (Group P) showed a significantly lower value of alveolar&#x02013;arterial oxygen gradient (PAO<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;PaO<sub>2</sub>) compared with the patients receiving VCV (Group V). This observation is consistent with the result of the study conducted by Cadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] This can be explained by the decelerating inspiratory flow profile in PCV that enhances the distribution of ventilation among alveolar lung units improving gas exchange.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Moreover, in VCV, higher intra-thoracic pressure decreases the venous inflow into the thorax, leading to a fall in preload and the compression of pulmonary blood vessels raises pulmonary vascular resistance, which can impede right ventricular stroke output.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Fall in right ventricular stroke output causes ventilation&#x02013;perfusion mismatch in the lung, resulting in hypoxaemia. It can be supported by the previous study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] that found lower pulmonary vascular resistance and higher cardiac index in patients receiving PCV in comparison with the patients receiving VCV.</p><p>Balick-Weber <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] found lower peak airway pressures during PCV than during VCV in patients undergoing laparoscopic urological procedures. In this study also the peak airway pressures were significantly lower in Group P than that in Group V. It can be explained by the decelerating flow pattern and the earlier dissipation of flow resistance in PCV.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Thus, in PCV, the peak pressure is limited, reducing the chance of barotraumas. Conversely, the higher tidal volumes and increased peak airway pressures in VCV cause alveolar over distension, leading to lung injury.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to increase FRC and to improve oxygenation in obese patients is questionable. Although the use of PEEP is of proven value for improving oxygenation in situations involving respiratory failure, its role in anaesthetized patients is controversial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] It has been suggested that PEEP may fail to improve oxygenation because increased alveolar pressure increases the shunt fraction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, it can be stated that PCV is a better choice than VCV in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of its dual advantages. On one hand, it improves arterial oxygenation and on the other hand, it can limit the chance of lung injury.</p><p>The limitations of this study were lack of direct measure of FRC, lung compliance and plateau pressure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Neugebauer</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Troidl</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Kum</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name><name><surname>Eypasch</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Miserez</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The E.A.E.S.
