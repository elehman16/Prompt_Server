A computer-generated random number table (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</ext-link>) was used for randomization. Numbered envelopes were used to conceal the sequence until the intervention was assigned.

The yoga classes were conducted in the basement of the hospital where one hall is exclusively dedicated for yoga therapy. The study group was taught integrated yoga and the control group was taught the non-yogic physiotherapy exercises by certified therapists. After this, they were asked to practice daily at home for the next 3 months. Compliance was supervised by telephone calls once in 3 days and a weekly review was conducted once a week for 3 months. The daily review cards were checked for the regularity and doubts if any were clarified. The evaluation was conducted by the senior research fellow. All patients were asked to tick the practices daily after the home practice in the diary provided for the purpose; at every visit their clinical progress and therapy received on the day were documented.

Tekur <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] studied the efficacy of the integrated approach of yoga therapy in patients with chronic low back pain and documented 48.8% reduction in Numerical Rating Scale scores in the yoga group. Garfinkel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] studied the effects of Iyengar yoga in patients with OA hands and found a better reduction in the pain during activity. Yogitha <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] showed a reduction in pain and tenderness in patients with common neck pain after integrated yoga. In a study by Aglami&#x0015f; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] there was a significant group differences in all domains of SF-36 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.004), while there were no group difference in WOMAC domains (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.004). Baker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] found increases in the SF-36 physical function, physical role, social and mental health scores and physical performance scores and decreases in the WOMAC pain after a 4-month strength exercise program. Foley <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] stated that after a 6-week exercise program physical performance increased, the WOMAC score did not change, and the physical component of the SF-12 increased after hydrotherapy. Diracoglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] observed increases in the SF-36 physical function, physical role, and vitality scores and the WOMAC physical function scores and physical performance in a kinesthetic group is greater than in a strength group after an 8 week exercise program. In a study by Kirkley <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] in patients assigned to arthroscopic surgery there was no improvement with respect to physical function, pain, or health-related than those were assigned to the control group. In a study conducted at our center by Rangaji <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] on the role of IAYT in the treatment of osteoporosis, he showed that in the comparison between the groups, the exercise group showed a significant difference in physical functioning component of SF-36 than the yoga group.</p><p>This study has revealed a statistically significant improvement in respect of all the domains of the SF 36 score with significantly better improvements in the yoga and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Mechanisms</title><p>Several factors would have contributed to the beneficial effects observed in both groups in this study. As noted in several earlier studies physiotherapy intervention may increase the blood glow. Better results in the yoga group could be due to its stress reducing effect since yoga is meant to bring about better emotional stability. Yoga is defined as &#x02018;samtvam yoga&#x02019; in Bhagavadgita[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] which refers to &#x02018;the balanced state of mind under any demanding life situation, be physical or psychological (sheetaushnasukhaduhkheshusamah)&#x02019;. This emotional stability is achieved by the multifactorial approach of yoga that includes safe physical practices (asanas), breathing techniques (<italic>pranayama</italic>), meditation (<italic>dharana and dhyana</italic>), and introspective corrections in one's cognitive errors by inputs at intellectual (<italic>jnana yoga</italic>) and emotional level (<italic>bhakti yoga</italic>).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] This may have contributed to better health behavior and improved QOL.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-18"><title>Strengths of the study</title><p>Good sample size, randomized control design, active supervised intervention for the control group for the same duration as the experimental group and follow up for 3 months with good compliance (6% dropouts) are the strengths of this study. The result of this study that has shown marked differences between groups on all variables offers strong evidence for incorporating this module of IAYT for knees by the clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-19"><title>Suggestions for future work</title><p>A longer follow-up of &#x02265;12 months is necessary to check for long-term efficacy and long-term acceptability. Studies using MRI and biochemical variables may throw light on the mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Adjunctive program of the integrated approach of yoga therapy for OA knees improves all components of QOL on SF36. IAYT offers a good value addition as a nonpharmacological intervention in improving QOL in patients with OA knees.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chopra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Patil</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bilampelly</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Relwani</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Tandle</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of rheumatic disease in rural population in Western India: A WHO-ILAR-COPCORD study</article-title><source>J Assoc Physicians India</source><year>2001</year><volume>49</volume><fpage>240</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11225138</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Felson</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An update on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of osteoarthritis</article-title><source>Radiol Clin North Am</source><year>2004</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15049520</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Felson</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Dieppe</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hirsch</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Helmick</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Osteoarthritis: New insights.Part 1: The disease and its risk factors</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><year>2000</year><volume>133</volume><fpage>635</fpage><lpage>46</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11033593</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Bremmer</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bier</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Osteoarthrosis.Prevalence in the population and relationship between symptoms and x-ray changes</article-title><source>Ann Rheum Dis</source><year>1966</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5905334</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Recommendations for the medical management of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee: 2000 update.
