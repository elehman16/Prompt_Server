Predisposing factors are pre-existing systemic diseases, female, oral contraceptives, bacterial infections, smoking. Its etiology is still not very clear so it is also known as alveolar osteitis, localized osteitis alveolgia, alveolar sicca dolorosa, localized osteomyelitis, septic socket, necrotizing socket and fibrinolytic alveolitis. Birns hypothesis[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] is the most accepted explanation of dry socket till date. He stated that trauma and inflammation causes release of stable tissue activator from the adjacent bony socket and soft-tissues. Tissue activator converts plasminogen (present in the blood clot) to the plasmin. Plasmin causes lysis of blood clot and pain (kininogen-kinins). Dry socket is unlikely to be present within first 2 days of extraction due to presence of antiplasmin, which gets consumed later. Most of the studies suggest the treatment with intra-alveolar dressing with different medicaments and in some cases antibiotics and analgesics if required. Despite all the research and development it is still posing a challenge in terms of delayed healing and frequent visits along with mental agony of the patients.</p><p>Plasma rich in growth factor (PRGF) obtained from autologous blood is used to deliver growth factors in high concentrations to the site of bone defect. So, we have used PRGF[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] along with gelatin sponge to promote healing and compared it with the traditional treatment of zinc oxide eugenol dressing.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Guided bone regeneration has emerged as accepted surgical procedure used to increase the quantity and quality of host bone in localized alveolar defects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] An autologous bone graft requires a second surgical site, postoperative discomfort and time and cost expenditure. In 1990, Gibble and Ness introduced the fibrin gel to act as to improve availability of hemostatic agents. Our research is aimed to promote the socket healing and reduce the visits of the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study comprised of 45 patients of dry socket in the span of 1 year. Exclusion criteria were smokers, steroid therapy, diabetes, pregnant, and lactating women. Stratified random sampling was chosen. The patients reporting with complain suggestive of dry socket were diagnosed for the presence of disease. After confirmation they were subjected to exclusion criteria as mentioned. After the inclusion of patient into study they were attributed into any one group out of three, one by one, i.e., 1<sup>st</sup> patient goes into group A then 2<sup>nd</sup> patient goes into group B and 3<sup>rd</sup> patient goes to group C and repeating the same until each group contains 15 patients each. Selection was exclusive of consideration of sex and age.</p><p>A well-informed consent was taken in patient's language. A clearance was taken from the institutional ethical committee. Single surgeon treated all cases in order to standardize the patient care and asepsis.</p><p>Group A patients were operated under local anesthesia and PRGF along with gelatin sponge was placed.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Plasma rich in growth factor (PRGF) preparation</title><p>Ten milliliter of blood was obtained from cephalic or basilic veins (due to their accessibility and sufficient diameter) using 19-gauge needle to avoid platelet rupture or activation in the lumen. Sampled blood was immediately transferred to a syringe containing anticoagulant (1 ml of 3.8% sodium citrate for 10 ml blood) and centrifuged in PRGF system set for 460 G in 8 min, to sediment platelets. Three layers were isolated after centrifugation: Red blood cells (RBCs) at the bottom, white blood cells in the middle, and plasma on the surface. The surface plasma itself contained three distinct layers:</p><p>Platelet poor in growth factors (PPGF) on the top (500 &#x003bc;l).</p><p>Plasma growth factors (PGF) in the middle and PRGF at the bottom that contains the highest concentrations of platelets and growth factors accumulated right above the RBCs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Test tube containing plasma rich in growth factors</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-4-37-g001"/></fig><p>PPGF and PGF were separately retrieved using two 500 &#x003bc;l pipettes. CaCl<sub>2</sub> was then added to PRGF (0.05 ml/ml) and coagulation was obtained within 5-8 min.

In this study, the disease had female predilection, the cause may be the use of oral contraceptives.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The mean age was reported to be 31.05 years in group A, 32.57 years in group B, and 31.98 years in group C, which are close to the age group reported in the literature.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The rationale for using PRGF along with gelatin sponge was based on previous studies, which showed the potential of PRGF in the process of bone healing.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] PRGF contains platelets, growth factors and fibrinogen.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Alpha granules of platelets include a high concentration of growth factors such as plateled derived growth factor (PDGF), tissue growth factor (TGF), platelet derived endothelial growth factor (PDEGF), platelet derived angiogenesis factor (PDAF), interstitial growth factor IGF-1, and platelet factor 4 (PF-4). These factors increase tissue vascularity through increased angiogenesis, chemotaxis of macrophages and fibroblasts, increased granulation tissue production and epithelialization, enhanced osteogenesis. These might also act antimicrobial effect and provide with an immediate surgical chemostatic agent that is biocompatible, effective and safe. Recent reports have suggested that more rapid epithelialization, denser and mature bone with better-organized trabeculae and greater bone regeneration occurs with platelet rich plasma. Gelatin sponge may act as a scaffold and as a good carrier of osteoblasts due to its flexibility, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Different studies[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] had reported the use of Platelet-rich Plasma PRP in extraction socket. We had reported the contributing effect of PRGF along with gelatin sponge in the socket healing. In our study, healing is faster in group A as compared to group B. These findings of better healing in group A may be supported by the previous studies of PRGF.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Resolution of pain is earlier in group B as compared to group A, which may be due to the obtundant nature of eugenol.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The use of PRGF along with gelatin sponge significantly enhances the healing of dry socket as compared to zinc oxide eugenol or irrigation only; but in terms of pain relief, zinc oxide eugenol dressing was more effective than others. In this study, disease was observed to have female predilection and the mean age was found to be 31.5 years.</p><p>Our study data indicated that with the use of PRGF along with gelatin sponge frequent visits and time may be saved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combination of gelatin sponge along with PRGF seems to accelerate socket healing due to the growth factors incorporated in the PRGF and scaffold forming capability of gelatin sponge.</p><p>However, a long-term randomized study with bigger sample size and control is required to determine the effectiveness of PRGF along with gelatin sponge. This is a first endeavor of this kind and is expected to stimulate further exploration into the deeper aspects of advantages of PRGF along with gelatin sponge in the healing of dry socket.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
