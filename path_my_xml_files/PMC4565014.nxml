Chemotherapy designed to prolong survival and improve the quality of life (QOL) of patients is the mainstay of treatment. On the basis of the results of previous clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], bevacizumab plus standard regimens such as FOLFOX, CapeOX, and FOLFIRI is currently recommended as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.</p><p>In Japan, S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine-based anticancer preparation, is approved for the indication of colorectal cancer. S-1 combines tegafur, a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, with 2 modulators of 5-fluorouracil metabolism: gimeracil and oteracil potassium. Gimeracil reversibly inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), a catabolic enzyme of 5-fluorouracil, and thereby increases concentrations of 5-fluorouracil in serum and tumor tissue. Oteracil potassium suppresses the activity of 5-fluorouracil in gastrointestinal tissue, reducing gastrointestinal toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many clinical trials have evaluated S-1 in combination with irinotecan. Komatsu et al. conducted phase I/II studies in gastric cancer and phase II studies in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Subsequently, Muro et al. performed a Phase II/III study (FIRIS trial) comparing FOLFIRI with S-1/irinotecan (IRIS) as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. IRIS was demonstrated to be non-inferior to FOLFIRI in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). IRIS was thus established to be a viable option for the second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, similar to FOLFIRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The results of phase II studies evaluating S-1 plus irinotecan combined with bevacizumab as first-line treatment have been reported. In a study by Komatsu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], bevacizumab (5&#x000a0;mg/kg) and irinotecan (100&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) were given as a continuous intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15, and S-1 was given orally for 2&#x000a0;weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. This 4-week regimen was regarded as 1 course. The RR was 57.7 % (95 % CI, 43.2 to 71.3 %), and the PFS was 16.7&#x000a0;months (95 % CI, 13.1 to 18.7&#x000a0;months). In a study performed by Yamada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], bevacizumab (7.5&#x000a0;mg/kg) and irinotecan (150&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) were given as a continuous intravenous infusion on day 1, and S-1 was given orally for 2&#x000a0;weeks, followed by a 1-week rest period. This 3-week regimen was regarded as 1 course. The RR was 67.0 % (95 % CI, 52.1 to 79.1 %), and the PFS was 12.4&#x000a0;months (95 % CI, 10.0 to 14.7&#x000a0;months). Kato et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] evaluated S-1 plus irinotecan combined with bevacizumab as first- and second-line treatment. Bevacizumab (7.5&#x000a0;mg/kg) and irinotecan (150&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) were given as a continuous intravenous infusion on day 1, and S-1 was given orally for 2&#x000a0;weeks, starting on day 3, every 3&#x000a0;weeks, defined as 1 course. The RR was 72.0 % (95 % CI, 50.6 to 86.2 %), and the PFS was 11.5&#x000a0;months (95 % CI, 10.4 to 19.8&#x000a0;months).</p><p>The results of these studies demonstrated that a PFS of 10&#x000a0;months can be expected with either a 4-week course (IRIS/bevacizumab) or a 3-week course (SIRB) of S-1 plus irinotecan combined with bevacizumab. Although the dose of irinotecan in these regimens was 150&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3&#x000a0;weeks, which is lower than the dose in FOLFIRI (270&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3&#x000a0;weeks), we considered this dose of irinotecan to be appropriate for combination therapy with S-1, irinotecan, and bevacizumab.</p><p>All studies of combination therapy with S-1, irinotecan, and bevacizumab have confirmed that this regimen is well tolerated: the incidence of grade 3 or higher neutropenia was 14 to 27 %, and the incidence of grade 3 or higher diarrhea was 7 to 17 %. Although some patients had elevations of blood pressure or thrombosis (i.e., adverse effects most likely attributed to bevacizumab), concurrent treatment with bevacizumab did not increase S-1- or irinotecan-related toxicity. The results of these 3 phase II studies suggested that a combination of S-1, irinotecan, and bevacizumab (S-1/irinotecan/bevacizumab) is comparable to FOLFOX/bevacizumab and CapeOX/bevacizumab, currently used as standard regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer, in terms of PFS. S-1/irinotecan/bevacizumab can be given as a 3-week regimen (SIRB) or a 4-week regimen (IRIS/bevacizumab).</p><p>Standard regimens of FOLFOX/bevacizumab and CapeOX/bevacizumab can cause neurotoxicity, potentially disrupting treatment. In the NO16966 study, the PFS was 9.4&#x000a0;months in the FOLFOX/bevacizumab and CapeOX/bevacizumab groups combined, as compared with a time to treatment failure (TTF) of only 6.9&#x000a0;months. The reason for treatment withdrawal was disease progression in 29 % of the FOLFOX/bevacizumab and CapeOX/bevacizumab groups combined and adverse events in 32 %. The main reasons for treatment withdrawal were not adverse events caused by bevacizumab, but neuropathy and other adverse events caused by chemotherapy. The use of FOLFOX/CapeOX as first-line treatment is associated with a higher total dose of oxaliplatin than second-line treatment, resulting in a higher incidence and severity of neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, the use of these regimens as second-line treatment would prolong exposure to neurotoxicity during the overall survival period. Therefore, irinotecan-based chemotherapy should be used as first-line treatment from the viewpoint of toxicity and patients&#x02019; QOL. At present, oxaliplatin-based regimens are mainly used for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. In patients who have recurrence during or immediately after oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, the cumulative neurotoxic effects of oxaliplatin may persist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, the establishment and evaluation of S-1-containing irinotecan-based regimens for first-line treatment are expected to become more important.</p><p>On the basis of these findings, the primary endpoint of this study is to validate the non-inferiority of combination therapy with S-1/irinotecan/bevacizumab (SIRB or IRIS/bevacizumab) to oxaliplatin-based standard treatment (mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab or CapeOX/bevacizumab) in terms of PFS and to assess superiority if non-inferiority is demonstrated. Whether it is possible to quantitatively predict differences in response to irinotecan-based regimens and oxaliplatin-based regimens will also be investigated, with the ultimate goal of improving patients&#x02019; QOL, healthcare cost-performance, and individualized therapy of colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and study design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled phase III study of patients who receive first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.

PFS is defined as the period from the date of enrollment to the date of disease progression or of death from any cause, whichever comes first. Data are censored on the date of surgery for patients who undergo surgical resection of tumors that respond to the protocol treatment and become resectable. In patients with confirmed disease progression (recurrence in patients who undergo R0 resection) after surgery, the confirmation date is considered to indicate an event.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Definition of analysis sets</title><p>The full analysis set (FAS) is defined as all enrolled patients. However, patients with serious study protocol violations (i.e., informed consent not obtained or serious violations of the study procedures) will be excluded.

Given that the permissible limit for the hazard ratio is 1.25, with a statistical power of 85 %, an alpha level of 0.025 (one-sided), an enrollment period of 36&#x000a0;months, and a follow-up period of 18&#x000a0;months for the primary endpoint of PFS, 434 patients are estimated to be required (required number of events, 374). To compensate for ineligible patients, the target number of patients is set at 450. If the non-inferiority is demonstrated in the study, superiority will be tested. (The enrollment of 434 patients is estimated to provide 78 % statistical power to detect a difference between the groups with a hazard ratio of 0.75).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Analysis plan</title><p>All evaluations of treatment effectiveness will be performed in the FAS. As a reference, effectiveness will also be analyzed in the PPS. Survival times (PFS, OS, and TTF) are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Two-sided 95 % confidence intervals of the hazard ratios in the assigned study groups are calculated by using a Cox proportional-hazards model adjusted for stratification factors other than institution and including only the study group as a covariate. The upper limit of the confidence interval will be confirmed to be below 1.25. Superiority in terms of PFS will be tested using a stratified log-rank test adjusted for stratification factors other than institution.</p><p>Response rates with confidence intervals will be calculated according to the assigned group for patients who have measurable lesions. Differences in response rates between assigned treatment groups will also be calculated along with the respective confidence intervals.

For the period from initiation of the study treatment until death, medical care costs according to procedure and total medical care costs will be calculated for each subject on a lifetime basis and during the study treatment, and total medical care costs will be compared between the control group and the study group. In addition, after the study treatment begins, the attending physician will fill in a patient questionnaire concerning the use of nursing and long-term care services, informal care provided by family members, and disease-related changes in the employment status of the patients and their family members. These data will be used to compare non-medical care costs between the control group and the study group.</p><p>The aforementioned data on medical care costs and non-medical care costs and the QALY data will be used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in the control group and the study group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Translational research (TR)</title><p>Colorectal cancer can be broadly classified into 4 subtypes according to two elements.

Both mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab and CapeOX/bevacizumab, used in the control group, are standard treatments widely used in Japan. The results of phase II studies of IRIS/bevacizumab and SIRB, used in the study group, suggest that the efficacy and side effect profiles of these regimens are generally similar. Evidence from Phase III studies has been obtained for IRIS/bevacizumab, but only the results of phase II studies are available for SIRB. However, the SIRB regimen has the advantage that patients are required to come to the hospital only once every 3&#x000a0;weeks. Because each regimen has advantages, 2 regimens are included in the study arm of the present study.</p><p>At present, both oxaliplatin-based regimens and irinotecan-based regimens are recommended as first-line standard treatment for advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. In general clinical practice in Japan, oxaliplatin-based regimens are usually used initially. However, given the peripheral neuropathy associated with oxaliplatin, first-line treatment with irinotecan-based regimens might be better with respect to toxicity. In our study, combining the oral preparation S-1 with irinotecan instead of using FOLFIRI, a regimen combining intravenous 5-fluorouracil/<italic>l</italic>-leucovorin with irinotecan, is expected to reduce drug-related costs and improve the patients&#x02019; QOL because the use of a portable infusion pump for 2&#x000a0;days is not required.</p><p>In our study, the results of QOL surveys, translational research, and cost effectiveness analysis are secondary endpoints. We believe that our study is very meaningful from the perspective of comparative effectiveness research.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional file</title><p>
