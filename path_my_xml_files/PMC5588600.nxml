However, there are several other, progressive fibrotic lung diseases, in which conventional anti-inflammatory therapy is not sufficiently effective and antifibrotic therapies may offer a novel treatment option.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">We designed a study protocol for inclusion of patients with progressive fibrotic lung disease despite conventional anti-inflammatory therapy (EudraCT 2014&#x02013;000861-32). The study population comprises patients with collagen-vascular disease-associated lung fibrosis (CVD-LF), fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (fNSIP), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP), and asbestos-related lung fibrosis (ALF). Disease progression needs to be proven by slope calculation of at least three Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) values obtained within 6&#x02013;24&#x000a0;months prior to inclusion, documenting an annualized decline in percent predicted FVC of 5% (absolute) or more despite appropriate conventional therapy. Absolute change in percent predicted FVC from baseline - analyzed using a rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model - will serve as efficacy-related primary study endpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">There is an urgent unmet clinical need for effective therapies for patients with a progressive fibrotic lung disease other than IPF. The current study protocol is unique with respect to selecting patients with different disease entities of lung fibrosis which have, however, essential pathophysiological characteristics in common. Moreover, by selecting patients with evidence of disease progression despite conventional therapy, the protocol ensures that a cohort of interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients with a high unmet medical need is targeted and it may allow a sufficiently high event rate for evaluation of treatment responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">

IPF is the most frequent and aggressive diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) in the western world. In well-designed clinical phase III trials, both drugs have been demonstrated to reduce the annual loss of FVC by approximately 50% and to yield a significant reduction of all-cause mortality after one year for pirfenidone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Of note, there are several DPLDs which share pathomechanistic principles, e.g. disturbed epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk, radiographic/histological characteristics like reticulation, traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing in variable combinations, as well as the progressive worsening and the fatal outcome with IPF and, therefore, represent important differential diagnoses and areas of great unmet medical need. Among these are lung fibrosis in association to collagen/vascular diseases (CVD-LF), fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (fNSIP), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP), and asbestos-induced lung fibrosis (ALF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In these entities, immunosuppressive therapy represents the standard clinical treatment option, albeit frequently ineffective and potentially harmful. In case of ALF, no pharmacological treatment is available at all. Therefore, a novel treatment option is highly needed for these most severely impaired patients.</p><p id="Par6">We hypothesized that, based on the pathophysiological and clinical similarities between IPF and the mentioned four types of non-IPF lung fibrosis, pirfenidone should be a viable treatment option especially in patients in whom conventional anti-inflammatory therapy failed. In particular, we aim to assess whether treatment with pirfenidone results in attenuation of the decline in lung function and exercise capacity in these patients, similarly to what has been observed in IPF. We will therefore conduct an exploratory efficacy and safety study of oral pirfenidone for progressive, non-IPF lung fibrosis (RELIEF in LUNG FIBROSIS) in CVD-LF, fNSIP, cHP, and ALF.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Funding and ethics</title><p id="Par7">This protocol is funded by the German Center for Lung Research (Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung, BMBF) and co-funded by Roche Pharmaceuticals. It has been approved by the ethics committee of the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Germany. Written informed consent is obtained from every patient enrolled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>CVD-lf</title><p id="Par8">Lung fibrosis is a common feature in CVD: it can be found in up to 80% of patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) and in 20&#x02013;50% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and it is not rarely observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis/polymyositis and Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Musculoskeletal pain, weakness, fatigue, fever, joint pain or swelling, photosensitivity, Raynaud&#x02019;s phenomenon, pleuritis, dry eyes, or dry mouth in the setting of lung fibrosis are important hints for the existence of CVD-LF, but these symptoms may appear later, after lung fibrosis has already been diagnosed. Detection of auto-antibodies such as antinuclear antibodies, antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens or of rheumatoid factor/ anti citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) may be helpful to early disclose the link between lung fibrosis and a systemic autoimmune disease. The most common form of pulmonary involvement is the nonspecific interstitial pneumonia histopathologic (NSIP) pattern, but a UIP pattern is also regularly encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Administration of immunosuppressant drugs may be of help in some forms of CVD-LF (e.g. lung fibrosis associated with Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome), but usually fails to exert beneficial effects and disease control in the long term (e.g. in PSS). Importantly, pulmonary involvement usually is the key prognostic factor in these CVD and progression of lung fibrosis is associated with worse outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Idiopathic fibrotic NSIP</title><p id="Par9">Originally designed as provisional entity, idiopathic NSIP is meanwhile regarded as a separate and clearly distinguishable subgroup within the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. NSIP seems to come along in two peculiarities, one being the cellular form, with extensive, general lymphoplasmacellular infiltrations of the septae, resulting in septal thickening, but not that much fibrosis, the other one being fibrotic NSIP, being characterized by deposition of collagen in the septae and a more variable extent of inflammatory reaction. Typically, however, the alveolar structure is maintained and complex fibrosis, such as honeycombing as observed in UIP, is absent. Although the clinical picture is related to IPF (patients are only slightly younger and more frequently female), with coughing and exertional dyspnea representing the key complaints, the HRCT is clearly different, showing extensive ground glass opacities in cellular NSIP and reticular changes in fibrotic NSIP, usually not following a strict centripetal gradient and being also present frequently in upper lobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients with cellular NSIP are usually well responding to a corticosteroid or combined immunosuppressive therapy, their life-expectancy is probably not reduced. In contrast, patients with fibrotic NSIP do show a much more progressive phenotype of the disease, with a varying degree of responsiveness to immunosuppressive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In case such therapy fails, progressive fibrosis occurs and will be prognostically relevant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>cHP</title><p id="Par10">cHP is a type III/IV based allergic reaction, with development of specific (so called precipitating) IgG antibodies against inhaled organic antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The spectrum of the causative antigens is broad, covering a multitude of antigens associated with occupational (e.g. actinomyces thermophilus in case of the farmer lung) or leisure (e.g. pigeon droppings and feathers in case of pigeon breeders lung) activities. In the more acute stage, respiratory (dyspnea, coughing) and more general (fever, headaches) symptoms start some hours after antigen exposure. During this acute episode, a primarily lymphocytic inflammatory reaction takes place in the lung parenchyma, results in the formation of granuloma and is usually associated with a CD8 dominant lymphocytic reaction in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF; CD4/CD8&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. During this phase, the clinical picture and the histopathological (NSIP-like pattern, lymphoplasmacellular infiltrations, granuloma formation), radiographic (nodular pattern and ground glass primarily in upper lobes), and functional (hypoxemia, restrictive and/or obstructive ventilation pattern) abnormalities are fully reversible upon antigen cessation. In case of a permanent and / or prolonged antigen exposure (either due to unawareness or unavoidable contact to a known antigen), the above mentioned temporal and/or spatial relationship between antigen exposure and symptoms is lost, and there is a variably rapid and progressive decline in lung function and exercise capacity. In this phase, considerable percentages of neutrophils are found in BALF, granuloma may be missing in the histopathology and a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern may be observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), fibrotic changes may mimic the classical UIP pattern of IPF, but with peribronchiolar and upper lobe predominance, and may result in a more complex picture, making the correct diagnosis quite difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Also, in contrast to the primarily inflammatory triggered early phase, an increasing number of reports suggest that epithelial injury and apoptosis, a key feature of IPF, play a significant role in cHP, too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids is known do ameliorate acute episodes of HP, but has questionable effects on chronic HP which may progress with and without persistent antigen exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Alf</title><p id="Par11">Despite the prohibition of the use of asbestos in the early &#x02018;90s, asbestos-related lung diseases are on the peak nowadays, illustrating the long latency observed in these diseases. Whereas pleural asbestosis is easily diagnosed on the basis of a corresponding patient&#x02019;s history and the typical radiographic appearance in HRCT, diagnosing pulmonary involvement is more complex. If pleural changes typical of asbestos-induced lung diseases are present, any kind of interstitial lung disease should be regarded asbestos-induced, unless a known other cause is identified. In absence of prototypical pleural changes, however, the association between radiographic and histopathological findings of pulmonary fibrosis, sometimes even resembling a typical UIP pattern, and asbestos can only be made on the basis of a thorough, extensive patient history, with a focus on the professional activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Typically, the disease is progressive in nature, with a varying rate of progression. There is no established treatment for these patients and steroids or immunosuppressants are typically not regarded as effective. Apart from the progressive nature of lung fibrosis, patients with ALF or pleural asbestosis are facing the challenge of lung cancer or mesothelioma development, which then largely determines the prognosis. Interestingly, more recent reports also indicate ongoing epithelial injury in asbestos-induced lung fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in clinical IPF trials</title><p id="Par12">Clinical safety and efficacy data on oral pirfenidone for the treatment of patients with IPF and PF include the following: Three published journal articles on clinical studies evaluating oral pirfenidone for the treatment of patients with IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; one controlled Phase II trial was published in abstract form but not published as a journal article in the medical literature: the study, PIPF-001, was initiated by Marnac, the original Sponsor, and completed by InterMune [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; one study published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) using pirfenidone in patients with PF associated with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; one controlled, prospective, randomized clinical trial evaluating oral pirfenidone in Japanese IPF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; two controlled, prospective, randomized clinical Phase III trials evaluating oral pirfenidone in IPF patients with change in FVC as primary endpoint (CAPACITY program, PIPF 004 and PIPF 006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; one pivotal phase III clinical trial (ASCEND) confirming the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on decline of FVC, decline of 6MWD, and a significant effect on overall mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is a pooled analysis of the three randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as well as a meta-analysis summarizing some of the clinical observations made with pirfenidone in patients with IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">On the basis of these studies, pirfenidone was authorized as treatment for mild to moderate IPF in the EU in the year 2011 and in the US after completion of the confirmatory ASCEND trial in 2014. In total, more than 1650 volunteers and patients received at least one dose of pirfenidone in clinical trials. Pirfenidone was administered orally TID at total doses ranging from 1197&#x000a0;mg/d to 3600&#x000a0;mg/d. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) in clinical studies was high (approximately 80&#x02013;90%) but they were comparable in the pirfenidone and placebo arms and in general classified as mild to moderate. In all clinical trials, the side effect profile of pirfenidone was similar, with gastrointestinal malaise, anorexia, weight loss being most frequent, followed by skin rash and photosensitivity requiring permanent use of sun blockers. Overall, the side effects were tolerable for the vast majority of IPF patients and only led in approximately 5% to treatment discontinuation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Rationale for the RELIEF study</title><p id="Par14">As outlined above, IPF is not the only fibrotic lung disease being characterized by a UIP pattern and by primarily fibrotic (reticular) changes in HRCT. Similar changes may be encountered in CVD-LF, cHP, and ALF. Although distinct in terms of histopathology and HRCT, fNSIP may act in a clinically similar manner as compared to IPF. Therefore, if immunosuppressive therapy, usually administered in CVD-LF, fNSIP, and cHP fails to stop the progression of the disease, the life-expectancy of patients with these forms of diffuse parenchymal lung disease is likewise limited by the progressive nature of the lung fibrosis. Against this background it appears more than reasonable to speculate that pirfenidone, a drug with a yet not completely known molecular action profile, but profound anti-fibrotic and even anti-inflammatory activities, may not only be effective in IPF, but also in other, progressive forms of lung fibrosis, where anti-inflammatory treatment modalities fail to exert arrest of progression and/or improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Aims of the study</title><p id="Par15">The purpose of the RELIEF study is to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with pirfenidone (2403&#x000a0;mg/d) compared to placebo in patients with CVD-LF, fNSIP, cHP, and ALF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par16">RELIEF is a prospective, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolling patients with progressive fibrotic lung disease due to CVD-LF, fNSIP, cHP or ALF, despite conventional anti-inflammatory therapy.

Assuming furthermore a similar treatment effect in all clinical diagnosis groups (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for diagnostic categories), the two-sample Mann-Whitney U Test for independent samples is used to test for a difference in median. For a group sequential design according to O&#x02019;Brien/Fleming with one interim analysis, a two-sided significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, 187 patients per arm are needed to detect an effect size of 0.3 between the two treatment groups across all indications. The magnitude of the effect size was based on the observed rank effects (i.e. effect in a non-parametric analysis) of pirfenidone versus placebo in the CAPACITY study at 1&#x000a0;year (48&#x000a0;weeks) corresponding to an effect size of 30% after scaling back.

The null hypothesis is tested against the alternative hypothesis at a two-sided significance level of 5%. The treatment effect will be tested using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel mean score statistic, median treatment differences will be estimated according to Hodges-Lehmann. The applied methods are based on a location-shift model assuming that the metric distributions of the absolute change in percent predicted FVC are the same, except for location. Furthermore, the primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed by factorial ANCOVA with a classification effect for treatment and diagnostic category (with and without an interaction term for treatment and diagnostic category) and baseline FVC as a covariate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Handling of missing values in rank ANCOVA</title><p id="Par110">Patients with missing values due to death will be assigned the worst ranks according to the time from randomization until death where the shortest time until death corresponds to the worst rank.</p><p id="Par111">A missing value at Visit X in Patient A who is alive at that time will be imputed as follows.

First, it allows to enroll patients with different forms of interstitial lung disease. Second, a common progressive fibrotic phenotype of ILD is defined by radiomorphology on high-resolution thin section computed tomography and, more importantly, by at least three spirometric measurements within 6 to 24&#x000a0;months, which show an annual decline in percent predicted FVC of at least 5% (absolute). Third, study medication (i.e. pirfenidone or placebo) is used on top of existing anti-inflammatory medication, which has to be stable for at least three months. If progressive fibrosis is the common pathophysiological pathway in these diseases, there is good chance that antifibrotic effects of pirfenidone ameliorate disease progression in this group of diseases.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par115">Initiation of the participating sixteen centers throughout Germany started in April 2016.
