Previous research shows a high prevalence of distress and disruption to the lifestyle of family caregivers of persons with late AMD. This supports existing evidence that caregivers are &#x02018;hidden patients&#x02019; at risk of poor health outcomes. There is ample scope for improving the support available to caregivers, and further research should be undertaken into developing services that are tailored to the requirements of family caregivers of persons with AMD. This study aims to implement and evaluate an innovative, multi-modal support service programme that aims to empower family caregivers by improving their coping strategies, enhancing hopeful feelings such as self-efficacy and helping them make the most of available sources of social and financial support.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A randomised controlled trial consisting of 360 caregiver&#x02013;patient pairs (180 in each of the intervention and wait-list control groups). The intervention group will receive the following: (1) mail-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy designed to improve psychological adjustment and adaptive coping skills; (2) telephone-delivered group counselling sessions allowing caregivers to explore the impacts of caring and share their experiences; and (3) education on available community services/resources, financial benefits and respite services. The cognitive behavioural therapy embedded in this programme is the best evaluated and widely used psychosocial intervention. The primary outcome is a reduction in caregiver burden. Secondary outcomes include improvements in caregiver mental well-being, quality of life, fatigue and self-efficacy. Economic analysis will inform whether this intervention is cost-effective and if it is feasible to roll out this service on a larger scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the University of Sydney human research ethics committee. Study findings will be disseminated via presentations at national/international conferences and peer-reviewed journal articles.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>The trial registration number is ACTRN12616001461482; pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>carer</kwd><kwd>intervention</kwd><kwd>health outcomes</kwd><kwd>cognitive behavioural therapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009399</institution-id><institution>Macular Disease Foundation Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is an innovative study as it is the first to implement and evaluate a comprehensive support service tailored to family caregivers of persons with age-related macular degeneration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Randomised controlled trial design with a wait-list control group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Translation of evidence-based interventions to practice&#x02014;there is evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy can be effective in reducing caregiver burden and distress, and it is the most widely used psychosocial intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is a multi-component intervention, and prior research has shown that&#x000a0;these are more effective than single interventions because they use several techniques and addresses a variety of caregiver needs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruitment of participants is confined to only one state in Australia.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Blinding of the intervention to participants and project staff (ie, study coordinator) is not possible.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive, chronic disease of the central retina and is a leading cause of blindness and low vision among older adults.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Advanced AMD, including neovascular AMD&#x000a0;(wet) and geographic atrophy (late dry), is associated with substantial, progressive visual impairment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Visual impairment from AMD often means that patients have a reduced ability to engage in everyday activities and family members are often called on to provide physical and emotional support.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref> Caring for loved ones with vision loss is burdensome and often leaves the caregiver exhausted and at risk of health problems.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 7 8</xref> A UK study<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> showed an elevated level of caregiver burden associated with caring for family with wet AMD, which was equivalent to the burden experienced by caregivers of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> and higher than for patients with colorectal cancer.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>We had previously conducted a cross-sectional survey of 500 caregivers of persons with wet AMD and showed a higher than expected prevalence of elevated emotional distress (&#x0003e;50%; n=280), including feeling sad, frustrated and/or isolated in this cohort.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This finding underscored the difficulty of coping with the challenges related to assisting persons with advanced AMD. If undetected and untreated, negative outcomes related to caregiver distress could persist or worsen over time.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, healthcare providers are often forced to neglect caregivers and place priority on service delivery for their patients due to budgetary and strategic planning priorities.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This could lead to clinically elevated anxiety/ stress, resulting in a greater overall burden on informal caregivers.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Over half of the surveyed caregivers of people with wet AMD in our previous study (n=295) also neglected their own needs and personal or family interests and had to make unwelcome changes to one or more areas of their lives (eg, retirement plans).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This self-perceived disruption to the social support that caregivers receive from their informal network of family and friends, as well as the formal network (eg, paid employment), as a result of caring for someone with AMD could perpetuate negative outcomes in caregivers.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The qualitative analyses component of our study<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> showed that significant sacrifices were made by the caregiver in order to meet the needs of the care recipient with late AMD. This could also add to the burden and distress experienced by the caregiver. Finally, our study showed that very few family caregivers sought or received respite, and this added burden can have a negative impact on the relationship between the caregiver and care recipient.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Despite the importance of providing information and support to help family caregivers, interventions to increase support for family caregivers have lagged far behind those provided for patients with AMD.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> There is ample scope for improving the support available to caregivers, and further research should be undertaken into developing services that are tailored to the requirements of family caregivers.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Early intervention, awareness programs and coordination of community resources could alleviate caregiver distress.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> There is strong consensus that, once information needs are met, family caregivers are likely to benefit from additional interventions such as improving their problem solving skills and extending their social support network.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Specifically, psychosocial interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can decrease caregiver distress, by fostering a more efficient, systematic approach to caregiving that enhances personal resources such as motivation and self-efficacy when providing care for a family member.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 17&#x02013;22</xref> CBT is a recognised efficacious strategy, and it is designed to help the client develop skills they can use outside of the therapy session and continue using when therapy ends.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> Moreover, mail-delivered CBT (M-CBT) involving written materials being posted to older caregivers is optimal, as it allows them to review the materials as often as needed and at their own pace.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In randomised controlled trials (RCTs), M-CBT has established efficacy against control in a wide range of disorders.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref></p><p>The proposed intervention study is novel as it will be the first to implement and evaluate a comprehensive support service tailored to the family caregivers of individuals with AMD. The intervention includes M-CBT and a telephone-delivered group therapeutic programme (facilitated by a professional counsellor), which will effectively consolidate the psychoeducation, as well as educational materials on community support, respite services and caregiver financial entitlements and benefits. The study will be a two-arm RCT with an economic evaluation. This study was codeveloped with key stakeholders or partner organisations: Macular Disease Foundation Australia (MDFA) and Carers NSW. MDFA is the national peak body representing people with macular disease, their families and caregivers, and Carers NSW is a statewide organisation representing informal caregivers. The current study aims to improve the design and delivery of these organisations&#x02019; existing support services and programs in a way that makes it easier for family caregivers to have timely access to a coordinated, multi-component intervention targeting drivers of caregiver stress and burden. A unique aspect of this study is that lay MDFA staff will be trained in the principles of CBT. MDFA currently runs support services from their Sydney (Australia) office for clients with AMD and their family members and/or caregivers. There is evidence to support lay providers without any healthcare experience delivering CBT, under the supervision of experts.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The primary hypotheses assert that the multi-modal intervention will lead to significant reductions in caregiver burden (primary study outcome) and improvements in health-related quality of life&#x000a0;(QOL), fatigue, self-efficacy, life satisfaction&#x000a0;and mental and emotional well-being, (secondary outcomes). A high rate of adherence and participant satisfaction with the multi-modal intervention is also hypothesised, with delivery both acceptable and feasible to stakeholder organisations. Finally, the intervention is hypothesised to be cost-effective when compared with usual care, when considering health outcomes for family caregivers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This ongoing study is designed as a multi-site, two-arm RCT, with an intervention group and a wait-list control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).

Recruitment involves an opt-in two-step process for a participant pair. Consent for participation is required from both the caregiver and care recipient. Step 1 involves screening for interest in participating in the research via either: (1) the study coordinator discussing the study with potential participants attending the eye clinic or (2) advertising the study through MDFA and Carers NSW newsletters and clients self-referring as a result of the provision of information. The advertisement will cover &#x02018;possible emotional strain and stress&#x02019; associated with caring and the treatment&#x02019;s aims of &#x02018;improving emotional well-being and coping.&#x02019;</p><p>Step 2&#x000a0;involves providing further information about the study via the study information sheet and obtaining written consent for the participant by either: (1) providing the information sheets, consent forms and baseline questionnaires to potential participant pairs attending the eye clinic (this will be completed at the clinic or mail&#x000a0;returned with a reply-paid envelope) or (2) telephoning the potential participant to further discuss the research, followed by posting information sheets, consent forms and baseline questionnaires to people who have indicated willingness to participate.

The educational materials sent out to participants will aim to increase their knowledge about support and respite services and financial entitlements and benefits including how best to access them, which has been previously shown to increase caregivers&#x02019; sense of competence and reduce depression.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Participants in the intervention group will be asked to complete a form prior to participating in the Carers NSW Talk-Link group sessions to identify the issues they might want to discuss (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>) and to also reinforce CBT skills taught in the prior week. These will then be developed into weekly topics to guide group discussions. Information/ newsletters will be provided by the facilitators.

Permission will be sought to link data from 12 months prior to the intervention and up until 1&#x02009;year after the intervention. Hence, health-related resource use data (eg, medical consultations and prescription use) will be compared between the two&#x000a0;RCT arms and will contribute to the economic evaluation. To protect the participants&#x02019; privacy, all outcome data will be kept in a password-protected file that is separate from the document containing the participants&#x02019; names and identification codes. All documents related to the study will be stored in restricted-access facilities or locked cupboards and on restricted-access servers and password-protected personal&#x000a0;computers and files as per University of Sydney human research ethics committee&#x000a0;(HREC) requirements.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention</title><p>Treatment acceptability in the intervention arm will be assessed immediately after completion of the 10-week multi-modal treatment by asking participants to rate their satisfaction with the&#x000a0;following: (1) overall support service programme they received, (2) CBT modules they completed and (3) adherence to the programme. Participants will respond to these three questions using a 5-point Likert Scale, ranging from &#x02018;very satisfied&#x02019; to &#x02018;very dissatisfied.&#x02019; Participants will also be asked to respond with yes/no to the following questions: (1) &#x0201c;Would you feel confident in recommending this treatment to a friend?&#x0201d;; (2) &#x0201c;Was it worth your time participating in this programme?&#x0201d; Finally, participants will be asked to specify which components of the programme they found most useful or valuable, and suggestions will be elicited on how the programme could be improved further. Moreover, the percentage of people who enter the study compared with the total number to whom participation is offered and the follow-up rate achieved will also be determined. Treatment feasibility will be broadly assessed based on preliminary outcomes achieved: cost-effectiveness of the intervention, combined with the ease with which support staff could support participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>The analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective and will include costs incurred by individuals and healthcare providers. This perspective will be taken because the cost consequences of this intervention may extend beyond the domain of healthcare. This will be a &#x02018;within-trial&#x02019; economic evaluation carried out within the timeframe and context of the trial and will determine the cost&#x02013;utility of this support service compared with usual care. We will determine the cost per person to deliver the support service using a bottom-up approach. This will include the cost of training MDFA staff, telephone consults, educational materials and other consumables. These will be valued at market rates and presented in 2017 $A. This will enable us to determine the cost of wider roll out of the programme. Direct healthcare costs will be determined through patient-level linkage to MBS and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme&#x000a0;(PBS). Healthcare resource use during the trial will include (1) primary and secondary healthcare consultations and admissions&#x000a0;and (2) use of medications, including antidepressants and anxiolytic medications. Healthcare costs will include both government contributions to healthcare plus any patient out-of-pocket expenses. We will also measure and value time contributions of caregivers to attend the course and take part in discussion groups, using median wage rates.</p><p>Participants&#x02019; health states will be captured using the five&#x000a0;domains of the EQ-5D-5L, namely, mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The responses on each domain of the EQ-5D-5L will be converted into utility values using a valuation algorithm for the Australian population.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be determined over the duration of the trial from the summation of mean utility x time interval between EQ-5D administration times. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in $A/QALY will be determined in the intervention compared with control. Bootstrapping will be used to estimate a distribution of&#x000a0;the joint uncertainty in mean costs and outcomes and to calculate the CIs around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. One-way sensitivity analysis will be conducted around key variables. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be derived that&#x000a0;summarises the probability of the intervention being cost-effective based on willingness to pay per QALY gained.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Sample size considerations</title><p>We plan to recruit 360 caregiver&#x02013;patient pairs (180 in each RCT arm) over 4&#x02013;6 months.

An 81% full compliance level represents 90% of recruits in the intervention arm actively taking up the educational and support programme, among whom 90% actively practice the strategies learnt. We have chosen to recruit the higher number of 288 available caregivers, so that we will additionally be able to estimate rates of uptake, acceptance, satisfaction and improvement with intervention with high precision (standard errors&#x000a0;&#x0003c;6%) and have well-powered secondary analyses including an effect size of 0.5 of intervention on mean overall QOL and a difference of 20% vs 40% between intervention and control groups in the proportion reporting specific negative impacts of caregiving.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Data collection and analysis plan</title><p>All data will be collected using questionnaire booklets and data collection sheets and will be subsequently entered into a secure online platform, called Research Electronic Data Capture.

Secondary analyses will directly test change in scores at each follow-up within the intervention and control groups and test for difference between intervention and control groups in the average of the three postintervention CBS scores. The percentage of individuals within intervention and control arms who demonstrate a large change in caregiver burden, defined as a change of half an SD or more, will be estimated with 95% CI. Secondary endpoints are: percentage of participants reporting overall satisfaction with the intervention and each major subcomponent, percentage of participants completing the overall programme and each major subcomponent, change from baseline in QOL, fatigue and self-efficacy scores and postintervention frequency of depressive symptoms.</p><p>Differences between the intervention and control groups in individual EQ-5D-5L domain and depression outcomes will be tested using &#x003c7;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> tests, and mean postintervention level of caregiver burden, fatigue, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms and general health will be tested using two-sample t-tests.
