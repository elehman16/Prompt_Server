general traction therapy influence the pain, disability, and straight leg raise (SLR)
ability of patients with intervertebral disc herniation. [Subjects] The subjects were 30
patients with chronic lumbar pain who were divided into a spinal decompression therapy
group (SDTG, n=15), and a general traction therapy group (GTTG, n=15). [Methods] The SDTG
used a spinal decompression device, and the GTTG used a lumbar traction device. Both
groups received conservative physical therapy three times a week for four weeks. A visual
analog scale (VAS) was used to measure the degree of pain the patients with chronic lumbar
pain. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to measure the degree of functional
disability. A goniometer was used to measure the patients&#x02019; SLR ability. [Results] Both
SDTG and GTTG showed statistically significant decreases in VAS and ODI scores and a
statistically significant increase in SLR angle. A comparison of the two groups found no
statistically significant differences. [Conclusion] Spinal decompression therapy and
general traction therapy are effective at improving the pain, disability, and SLR of
patients with intervertebral disc herniation. Thus, selective treatment may be
required.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Spinal decompression therapy</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Straight leg raise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eighty percent of adults experience lumbar pain at least once in their lifetime, and 80% of
structures causing lumbar pain are related to intervertebral discs<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Disc herniation is multifactorial, often related to
degenerative processes and mechanical effects, and mostly occurs due to light external
injuries of the spine, such as spinal bending and stretching, spinal rotation exercises, and
abrupt posture changes<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both surgical and
conservative treatment methods are considered for intervertebral disc herniation.
Conservative treatments include medication, exercise therapy, and physical and
rehabilitation methods. Among them, one of the most widely used methods is traction therapy.
Traction therapy reduces the pressure caused by gravity and soft tissues, and sufficient
tension extends spinal separation and the intervertebral disc. Negative pressure within the
intervertebral disc increases its hydration and reduces pressure on the nerve root by
removing the force applied to the vertebral pulp<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Spinal decompression therapy is another method that has recently been used as a
conservative treatment for intervertebral disc herniation. Spinal decompression therapy
reduces the pressure on the intervertebral disc by suppling nutrients and oxygen to the
intervertebral disc. This creates a state of non-gravitation or negative pressure by
adjusting the direction and angle of traction to suit the location of the intervertebral
disc, which is the target of the treatment. This in turn reduces the pressure inside the
intervertebral disc by gradually and softly increasing a specific part of the intervertebral
disc through the decompression of a precise part of the lesion<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although studies of various treatment methods for intervertebral disc herniation have been
conducted, comparisons of spinal decompression therapy and general traction therapy remain
inadequate. This study aimed to identify how spinal decompression therapy and general
traction therapy, which are non-surgical treatment methods, influence the pain, disability,
and straight leg raise (SLR) ability of patients with intervertebral disc herniation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 30 patients (male: 9, female: 21) who complained of
radiating pain caused by chronic lumbar pain. The subjects had suffered from continuous
lumbar pain, as diagnosed by an orthopedic specialist, for over three months, and were
selected from among patients who visited S Hospital, located in Daegu Metropolitan City,
Korea. On average, the spinal decompression therapy group (SDTG, n=15) was 41.3&#x000b1;7.3&#x02005;years of
age, 162.3&#x000b1;8.9&#x02005;cm in height, and 58.3&#x000b1;12.2&#x02005;kg in weight, and the general traction therapy
group (GTTG, n=15) was 44.0&#x000b1;4.1&#x02005;years of age, 162.7&#x000b1;8.4&#x02005;cm in height, and 59.1&#x000b1;11.3&#x02005;kg in
weight. No statistically significant differences were found in their general
characteristics. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Youngdong University
Institutional Review Board. All subjects read and signed consent forms in accordance with
the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Those who had undergone an operation
on a lumbar vertebra, had spinal tumors or infections in the intervertebral disc,
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatism, fractures, or other contraindications for manual
therapy, were excluded from the study.</p><p>All subjects were treated three times each week for four weeks. The SDTG were treated with
a spinal decompression therapy device (MID 4&#x02005;M Series, WIZ Medical, Korea) for 20 minutes
each time. The GTTG were treated with a lumbar traction therapy device (OL 110, Dong Bang
Medical, Japan) for 20 minutes each time. Hot packs (20 minutes), interferential current
therapy (15 minutes), and ultrasound (5 minutes) were used to treat both groups during the
conservative physical therapy.</p><p>Each subject of the SDTG, which received the spinal decompression therapy, lay on his/her
back on the device&#x02019;s bed and had the pelvic and thoracic regions fixed with an air belt. The
slipping of the fixed parts was prevented by fixing the patient&#x02019;s head with a strap. The
region of the cervical vertebrae was stretched by applying the robotic jog system, and a
sacrum treatment device that supports the sacrum was used to maintain lumbar lordosis.
Traction started with a strength level of 5 to 6; the power level was increased by a certain
ratio during each phase. When pain occurred due to an increase in traction, the existing
power level of traction was lowered or maintained. The ratio of the hold time to the rest
time was set at 2:1, and standard and divided compression methods were used simultaneously.
Each subject of the GTTG, which received lumbar traction therapy, lay on his/her back on a
traction table and had a knee support placed under each knee. Traction was first applied at
one third of the subject&#x02019;s weight. Then, the traction was increased after each treatment, up
to 50% of the subject&#x02019;s weight. When an increase in traction caused pain, the existing
traction was lowered or maintained.</p><p>A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the degree of pain. The Oswestry
Disability Index (ODI) was employed to evaluate the degree of disability. Nine questions
were scored from 0 to 5 according to functional performance with higher scores indicating
higher degrees of disability. Percentage (%) values were obtained by adding the score
measured from each item and dividing the sum of all items by the maximum score of 45 points.
A SLR test was performed to determine whether the nerves under pressure due to
intervertebral disc herniation had tension<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the SLR test, each patient lay on his/her back and relaxed by
stretching both legs. While slowly raising the subject&#x02019;s straight leg on the affected side,
the tester used a goniometer to measure the angle when lumbar pain or radiating pain in the
legs occurred.</p><p>The paired t-test was conducted to compare values before and after the treatment within
each group to identify the pain, disability, and SLR of patients with chronic lumbar pain.
The independent t-test was performed to compare differences between the two groups. This
study performed statistical analyses using SPSS 12.0 for Windows, and the level of
statistical significance was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The SDTG and GTTG showed statistically significant declines in the VAS and the ODI socres

that spinal decompression therapy decreased pain and increased mobility and showed

219 patients reported pain reduction. Ramos and Martin<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that spinal decompression therapy yielded statistically

statistically significant declines in VAS and ODI scores. Kang<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted spinal decompression therapy and manual therapy
for patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation, and reported that after the
treatment, the SLR angle showed a statistically significant increase. Lee et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a group that received spinal
decompression therapy and manual therapy showed a larger degree of pain reduction and a
higher increase in the range of motion (ROM) of the hip joint than a group that received
spinal decompression therapy and general physical therapy.</p><p>In the present study, SDTG and GTTG showed statistically significant declines in VAS and
ODI scores, and a statistically significant increase in the angle of SLR. A possible
explanation for these results is that spinal decompression therapy and traction therapy
reduce the pressure generated by gravity and soft tissues, and increase spinal separation
and the diameters of the intervertebral disc and intervertebral foramen. In addition, the
generation of negative pressure within the space of the intervertebral disc may have led the
part of the disc, which had been pushed out to the rear of the intervertebral disc, to
return inside, thereby reducing neural sensitivity. No statistically significant differences
were found between the two groups. This is likely due to the fact that spinal decompression
therapy and traction therapy have similar basic principles: both therapies relax the overall
lumbar region by loosening pressed nerves and tense muscles reducing the pressure on the
intervertebral disc. Therefore, the two treatment methods may not have notable differences
in terms of therapeutic effects. In addition, since general traction therapy is covered by
health insurance but decompression therapy is not in Korea, physical therapists are required
to select treatments considering patients&#x02019; expenses. However, increasing the number of
treatments or lengthening the treatment period might produce different findings.</p><p>This study examined the clinical effects of conducting spinal decompression therapy and
general traction therapy, which are non-surgical treatment methods, for patients with
intervertebral disc herniation. In conclusion, physical therapists may be required to select
an appropriate treatment method considering the condition of a patient, cost, and time.
Follow-up studies should be conducted on the long-term effects of these therapies,
increasing the treatment period and the number of treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Spangfort</surname><given-names>EV</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The lumbar disc herniation.
