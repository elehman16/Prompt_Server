Mobilization into a standing position by means of a tilt table has been shown to improve their arousal and awareness. However, due to the frequent occurrence of syncopes on a tilt table, it is easier to accomplish verticalization using a tilt table with an integrated stepping device. The objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a tilt table therapy with or without an integrated stepping device on the level of consciousness. A total of 50 participants in vegetative or minimally conscious states 4 weeks to 6 month after injury were treated with verticalization during this randomized controlled trial. Interventions involved ten 1-hour sessions of the specific treatment over a 3-week period. Blinded assessors made measurements before and after the intervention period, as well as after a 3-week follow-up period. The coma recovery scale-revised (CRS-R) showed an improvement by a median of 2 points for the group receiving tilt table with integrated stepping (Erigo). The rate of recovery of the group receiving the conventional tilt table therapy significantly increased by 5 points during treatment and by an additional 2 points during the 3-week follow-up period. Changes in spasticity did not significantly differ between the two intervention groups. Compared to the conventional tilt table, the tilt table with integrated stepping device failed to have any additional benefit for DOC patients. Verticalization itself seems to be beneficial though and should be administered to patients in DOC in early rehabilitation.</p><p>

The consequences for patients and their families are disastrous. Severe DOC range from coma via vegetative state (VS) [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]&#x02014;also referred to as unresponsive wakefulness syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], a condition in which the patient is awake but shows no behavioral evidence of conscious awareness&#x02014;to minimally conscious state (MCS), characterized by one or more minimal but definite behavioral signs of consciousness [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In these cases the primary aims of neurological rehabilitation are: prevention of secondary medical complications and restoration of cognitive-behavioural functions [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Only limited evidence is available for treatments that have been suggested to enhance arousal and the ability to communicate, and therewith to accelerate recovery after prolonged DOC [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Drugs are commonly used to enhance arousal and promote behavioral responsiveness, but only in 2012 was the first drug amantadine HCl proven effective in a placebo-controlled trial [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Besides a pharmacological treatment, non-invasive brain stimulation, like transcranial direct current stimulation, might be a promising therapy option to improve signs of consciousness in patients with DOC [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Sensory stimulation programs (sensory stimulation via auditory, tactile, olfactory and visual inputs) were also administered to these patients. A meta-analysis published in 2002 found no reliable evidence proving the efficacy of these programs [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A recently published study of Urbenjaphol et al. showed that patients receiving a sensory stimulation program consisting of the stimulation of the five sensory modalities (tactile, gustatory, olfactory, auditory, visual senses) in a sequential order during 30-min session had a significantly better outcome than those in a control group (based on values of the Glasgow Coma Scale) [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In general, there are two basic therapeutic stimulation programs for DOC patients: the sensory stimulation approach and the sensory regulation approach [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The sensory stimulation approach is based on the assumption that intensive stimulation of all the senses will enhance synaptic re-innervation and stimulates the reticular activating system [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, the sensory regulation approach assumes that the capacity for information processing in these patients is limited. It therefore emphasizes the enhancement of selective attention by regulating the environment rather than providing high degrees of stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Mobilization into a standing position, e.g., with a tilt table, has been shown to improve arousal and awareness in small groups of VS and MCS patients [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although desirable, it is not always easy to perform head-up tilt in the early phases of DOC. A common problem is the occurrence of syncopes due to a central sympathetic dysfunction and the absence of the venous pump due to paralyzed leg muscles [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To re-enforce cardiovascular response and to stabilize blood circulation, passive leg exercise to support the venous pump has been combined with head-up tilt by using a tilt table with an integrated robotic stepping device. Patients with DOC, analogous to patients with spinal cord injury, were shown to have reduced syncopes or presyncopes when using a tilt table with integrated stepping during mobilization [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This device made it possible to mobilize the patients into a standing position earlier and for a longer time during the course of rehabilitation. Assuming that the vertical position influences the state of arousal and alertness [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], an extension of verticality duration potentially enhances arousal and therewith the alertness and responsiveness of the patient.</p><p>This prompted us to design a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial to determine the influence of earlier and increased mobilization by using a tilt table with integrated stepping. We hypothesized that 3 weeks of treatment using a tilt table with integrated stepping (compared to a conventional tilt table) could enhance recovery of consciousness in patients with DOC 4 weeks to 6 months post injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Design</title><p>This study was a prospective, single-blind, stratified, randomized controlled trial with two intervention groups. According to the German Medical Devices Act (Medizinproduktegesetz), this study was registered at the German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information; DIMDI) prior to patient recruitment on June 27 2006 (reference number: AP4/3332/28/06). In addition and in order to satisfy international standards we also registered the study in Current Controlled Trials Ltd (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link>) by August 31 2006, identifier number ISRCTN72853718. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Bavarian State Chamber of Physicians on May 30 2006, protocol number 06018. One modification to the initial protocol was made on December 22 2006 to change the age limit from 70 to 75 years.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18&#x02013;75 years, VS or MCS following traumatic brain injury, intracerebral bleeding or ischemic infarction, or MCS after hypoxic brain damage. Patients after hypoxic brain damage in VS were not included into the study. Patients were not enrolled in the study if any of the following criteria were met: (1) time since injury was less than 4 weeks or more than 6 months, (2) mobilization into standing lasted more than 30 minutes, (3) heart attack occurred within 4 weeks prior to admission, (4) patient wore a cardiac pacemaker, (5) severe condition of osteoporosis, (6) severe contracture or spasticity of the lower extremities were present; physical therapists rated the patient&#x02019;s feasibility to participate in both study interventions based on their experience with tilt table and Erigo therapies, (7) unstable fractures or decubiti on lower extremities, (8) legal proxy refused to give written informed consent. All patients&#x02019; legal proxy signed a written informed consent form (study physicians enrolled patients).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Sample Size</title><p>The number of patients was calculated a priori based on an analysis of a 6-week CRS-R time course of patients with early VS/MCS in our hospital. A mean improvement of 6.5 &#x000b1; 3.5 points had been reported (unpublished data). As the time course and possible improvement of CRS-R values in a large group of VS/MCS patients had not yet been reported, an additional improvement by 3 points was considered clinically relevant. On the basis of 0.8 power for detecting a significant difference (p = 0.05, two-sided), 22 patients were required for each study group. In anticipation of possible dropouts, a total of 50 patients were enrolled.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome was the rate of improvement in the CRS-R score after the intervention. The CRS-R is a standardized neurobehavioral assessment tool comprising six hierarchically organized subscales measuring: auditory, visual, motor, oromotor&#x02013;verbal function, communication, and arousal. The scores ranged from 0 to 23; higher scores indicated a higher level of neurobehavioral function [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Exhaustion from an intervention, bath, nutrition or another rehabilitation action might influence the alertness of a patient and consequently the results of the testing. In addition, the majority of patients with a severe DOC do not have a circadian sleep rhythm. Both aspects make it difficult to choose an optimal time for testing. To reduce this bias, the CRS-R was assessed twice at each measurement point; once on two separate days. The highest score was used for analysis.</p><p>Secondary outcome was determined by the modified Ashworth scale (MAS). The MAS grades the level of resistance encountered during manual passive stretching [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. MAS values were collected for extensors and flexors of shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles on both sides, i.e., 24 values were obtained per patient. The MAS has moderate to good test-retest reliability but limited inter-rater reliability [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Both scores were assessed at baseline, after 3 weeks of treatment (week 3), and after 3 weeks of follow-up (week 6). Assessments of CRS-R and MAS were made by experienced therapists, one occupational therapist doing all CRS-R ratings, two physiotherapists all spasticity ratings. The assessors&#x02019; training consisted of repeated supervised practice of the assessments prior to the trial. The assessors were blinded with respect to the allocated intervention, but noted the presumed therapy on the assessment form.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Treatment was assigned in random blocks by stratifying for type of brain injury (traumatic, non-traumatic) and state of consciousness by means of the CRS-R at the day of randomization (VS, MCS). These factors are shown to be predictive in terms of outcomes. Stratification was used to increase the comparability of both intervention groups [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The allocation of treatment groups was by a computer-generated random sequence provided by the University of Munich. Allocation sequence was thus concealed until interventions were assigned (the authors ML and CK assigned patients to the interventions). Participants were allocated to one of two groups: treatment on a conventional tilt table or on the Erigo.</p><p>The Erigo is a tilt table with an integrated robotic stepping device. The upper body of the patient is secured by a harness that fixes the chest and shoulder to the table. Leg movements are controlled by computer and are the result of passive thigh movement attained by securing the distal thigh to the device; the feet are strapped to two footplates. The inclination of the tilt table can be continuously adjusted from the horizontal to the vertical position. The speed of leg movement can be modified from 0 to 80 steps per minute [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>After randomization the patients were scheduled for a total of ten sessions over 3 weeks, allowing 3 to 4 treatment sessions per week. The intervention was administered for 3 weeks, since it had been reported that at least 2 weeks of sensory stimulation were necessary for there to be any significant effect on consciousness [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therapy sessions, both on the Erigo and the tilt table, were executed by two physical therapists or by one physical therapist with assistance provided for transfers from bed to device and back. Each session was scheduled for 1 hour gross therapy time. Net therapy time&#x02014;starting after the patient was transferred to the device until the patient was returned to the supine position within the device&#x02013;and the duration of the 70 degrees tilted head-up position were documented. Blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored and an interruption of the verticalization procedure due to a syncope or presyncopal symptoms such as tachypnoea, tachycardia, pallor or increase in sweating was documented. The criteria for an interruption can be found elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Patients were allowed to be further verticalized after an interruption occurred.</p><p>In addition to verticalization treatment, i.e., tilt table or Erigo, patients were treated by a dysphagia therapist, neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, and a physiotherapist. The therapists selected the content of the additional physiotherapy to meet the patient&#x02019;s needs; however, prolonged mobilization out of bed into a standing position was not allowed, as this was the main focus of the study interventions. All patients received the same total amount of therapy (300 minutes therapy, incl. activating nursing, a day), as required by the German health care system.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>For pre-test comparisons of demographic and outcome variables between the groups Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, and <italic>Chi</italic>

These approaches involved use of either a conventional tilt table or a tilt table with an integrated robotic stepping device (Erigo). Both groups significantly improved during the 3-week intervention period. The Erigo group improved by a median of 2 points on the CRS-R. However, the rate of recovery of patients was better in the conventional tilt table group; these patients improved by a median of 5 points on the CRS-R and an additional 2 points during the 3-week follow-up period. On the basis of our sample size estimate this result might mean that patients receiving Erigo therapy were hindered in their rehabilitation process. On the other hand, our estimate might have been too optimistic, and the underlying patient sample might have been potentially biased by the routinely applied tilt table therapy. The results of the &#x02018;German registry for coma outcome in patients undergoing acute rehabilitation&#x02018; (KOPF-R) [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] revealed a mean improvement by 4 points on the CRS-R during a 3-month interval, indicating a 2-point improvement over 6 weeks. Thus, we assume that the Erigo therapy group showed typical improvement, whereas the conventional tilt table group had an additional benefit.</p><p>Nevertheless, our study apparently disproved the initial hypothesis that the recovery of consciousness in DOC patients could be enhanced by administering 3 weeks of treatment on a tilt table with integrated stepping compared to a conventional tilt table 4 weeks to 6 months post injury. The demographic data or the medications taken during the study period are not likely responsible for the difference in CRS-R outcome as there were no significant differences. Although a total of ten cases in the tilt table group could have a worse prognosis (6 patients with hypoxic etiology, 4 with brain stem lesions), the distribution for the factors shown to be predictive in terms of outcomes (traumatic/ non-traumatic and VS/ MCS) were sufficiently stratified [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the present study the integrated stepping device improved the time that patients can be verticalized, as it has been shown in an earlier study [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although the 2-minute difference in the net therapy time was statistically significant, the clinical significance is at least questionable bearing in mind the therapy durations of 25 and 23 minutes, respectively. The 4-minute difference for the duration of the 70 degrees tilt however represents an improvement of about 50% and thus seems not only statistically but also clinically significant. Thus&#x02013;in contrast to our hypothesis&#x02014;an extended verticalization achieved by a tilt table with an integrated stepping device did not lead to a better recovery in our patients.</p><p>In search for the reason of the better study outcome in the tilt table group we thoroughly examined further differences between our two treatment options. One striking difference is the abundance of sensory stimulation, which patients on the Erigo experience during treatment. Not only do cuffs move the patients&#x02019; legs, thus increasing proprioceptive sensory information, but also the auditory system was stimulated by the sound of the electrical drives of the Erigo system. Lehembre et al. and Sitt &#x00026; King et al. confirmed previous findings of studies on resting-state EEG recordings in patients with DOC, which showed that EEG delta-band power increased with the severity of the disorder [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Recent functional imaging studies of the human brain also observed that the functional connectivity is reduced in regions of the default mode network (DMN) [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or the weighted global connectivity is reduced [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although the functions of the DMN remain a subject of debate, Mantini &#x00026; Vanduffel concluded in their review of functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies that in addition to spontaneous cognition, a crucial function is the monitoring of the environment [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although the DMN activity in MCS patients and especially in VS patients is reduced, it is the disintegration of cognitive processing rather than the absence of local brain activation that characterizes the loss of consciousness [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These two aspects, i.e., the increase in EEG delta-band power and the reduced activity of the DMN, indicate that sensory processing is slowed, and any further processing of incoming sensory information is limited to lower order brain structures. This might explain why severely affected DOC patients seem to benefit more from a therapy with reduced sensory activation, like the tilt table therapy. Further studies should verify this hypothesis by including neurophysiological measurements and functional imaging to better describe the investigated study population.</p><p>Patients with severe DOC are known to have high risk of increasing spasticity and there is evidence that frequent physical therapy may have a positive effect on the patient&#x02019;s spasticity [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In our study both tilt table therapies did lead to an improvement or had no change in spasticity in most instances, whereas only 19.7% of the tested muscles worsened. Whether these changes in spasticity were influenced by the study interventions or the values display just the typical development over time in our study population, cannot be determined with our study design. However, the changes in spasticity showed no statistically significant differences between both intervention groups.</p><p>Our study has certain limitations. First, it was conducted at an inpatient rehabilitation center where the study interventions augmented the total rehabilitation program, e.g., routine nursing care and involvement of several therapeutic professions such as occupational, pharmacological, dysphagia, and physical therapies. However, the overall time of activation care as well as of occupational, physical, and dysphagia therapies was controlled and did not differ between the groups, although it was not possible to determine every single content and duration of the regular therapy program of each patient. Nevertheless we cannot rule out a bias by a difference in the associated therapies. Since the standard rehabilitation interventions continued during the study, we cannot determine the degree to which the benefits of the study interventions are independent of or synergistic with such standard treatments. In addition, with respect to our argumentation on sensory overflow the ratio of a study intervention session duration to the entire rehabilitation day should be considered. Second, the primary outcome parameter CRS-R is not validated for the use in non-TBI patients nor for the use over time with repeated measures. Third, as the study sample comprised patients in a non-chronic stage (&#x0003c; 6 months) of DOC, spontaneous recovery within the study period cannot be ruled out. Fourth, our findings can be generalized only to a limited extent, since patients in a VS of non-traumatic origin with poor prognosis were not included [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the prognostic criteria for such patients are currently undergoing a comprehensive revision. For example, recent studies on therapeutic hypothermia in patients following cardiopulmonary resuscitation reported improved neurological outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The thorough reevaluation of the previously established decision rules on the basis of studies of post-cardiac arrest patients not treated with hypothermia promises to have consequences for studies like ours [<xref rid="pone.0143180.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Informed Consent form&#x02013;English version.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Informed Consent form&#x02013;German version.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s004"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol&#x02013;English version.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s005"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol&#x02013;German version.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s006"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Individual patient characteristics.</title><p>Abbr.: TT, tilt table; f, female; m, male; TBI, traumatic brain injury; CRS-R, coma recovery scale-revised; VS, vegetative state; MCS, minimally conscious state; GCS, Glasgow coma scale.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s007"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Individual CRS-R scores.</title><p>Abbr.: TT, tilt table. *, missing data refilled with the last observation carried forward method.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s008"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Individual Ashworth scores&#x02013;upper extremities.</title><p>Abbr.: MD, missing data.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s009"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Individual Ashworth scores&#x02013;lower extremities.</title><p>Abbr.: MD, missing data.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143180.s010"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Therapy documentation.</title><p>Abbr.: n.a., no therapy applied or not documented; interruption 0, no therapy interruption; interruption 1, therapy interruption necessary.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143180.s010.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the families of the patients for giving their consent to our study.
