Commonly used treatment measures include medication with oral analgesics, corticosteroid injections, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, ultrasound guided needling and lavage, and surgical treatment. Earlier cohort studies suggest that patients may benefit from these treatments, but there are few randomized studies and conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of the various treatments. In the present study we aim to compare the effectiveness of ultrasound guided needling and lavage (barbotage) together with a steroid injection to sham barbotage with and without an additional steroid injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study will be performed in six secondary-care institutions in Norway and Sweden. It is designed as a pragmatic, randomized, three-arm, parallel group, double-blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial with a 2-year follow-up. It will be performed on 210 patients, aged 30&#x000a0;years or older, presenting with painful arc, positive impingement sign and a calcium deposit&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;mm. Randomization to one of the three treatment options will be performed by using an online central randomization system. The three treatment groups are barbotage together with a subacromial steroid injection (the barbotage group), sham barbotage together with a subacromial steroid injection (the steroid group) or sham barbotage without a subacromial steroid injection (the placebo group). In the placebo group the steroid injection will be replaced by a short-acting local anaesthetic. Standardized home-based post-treatment physiotherapy will be performed by all patients for 8&#x000a0;weeks. Follow-ups are at 2 and 6&#x000a0;weeks, 4, 8, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months after treatment was given and will be performed with the patients and the outcome assessors blinded for group assignment. Primary outcome will be the Oxford shoulder score at 4&#x000a0;month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures are the QuickDASH upper extremity score, the EQ-5D-5L general health score and visual analogue scales for pain at rest, during activity, and at night.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The scientific evidence from this placebo-controlled trial will be of importance for future treatment recommendations in patients with calcific tendinitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02419040">NCT02419040</ext-link>, registered 10 April 2015</p><p>EudraCT: 2015-002343-34, registered 23 September 2015 (retrospectively registered)</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12891-017-1501-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Calcific tendinitis</kwd><kwd>Barbotage</kwd><kwd>Ultrasound guided lavage</kwd><kwd>Corticosteroids</kwd><kwd>Sham treatment</kwd><kwd>Placebo</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bergesenstiftelsen</institution></funding-source><award-id>None</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moosmayer</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Aase Bye and Trygve J.B.

The condition is characterized by the formation of deposits of calcium crystals in one or several of the rotator cuff tendons. The prevalence of the condition has been reported to be 3 to 10% in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and 7 to 17% in individuals with shoulder pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Tendon inflammation located around the deposit is considered to contribute to pain. The course of the disease is often self-limiting with spontaneous calcium resorption and resolution of symptoms over several months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In cases in which resorption is delayed, absent or incomplete, symptoms may persist and anti-inflammatory treatment and/or removal of the calcification may provide symptomatic relief. Different treatment methods including anti-inflammatory and analgesic medication, extracorporal shockwave therapy (ESWT), ultrasound guided needling and lavage (barbotage), and surgical treatment are in use, but a consensus on the preferred treatment is lacking.</p><p>Farin introduced barbotage as an ultrasound guided technique in 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It consists of needle aspiration and lavage of the calcium deposit. Both single and double needle procedures have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Good short- and medium-term results have been reported from several cohort studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] . A systematic review of the efficacy of barbotage in the treatment of calcific tendinitis found the technique to be safe and effective with an estimated average of pain improvement of 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Only few comparison studies between barbotage and other techniques have been performed. In one randomized study, barbotage was found to be superior to subacromial corticosteroid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Contrary, a systematic review and meta-analysis of minimally invasive therapies in the management of chronic calcific tendinopathy, concluded that barbotage was not more effective than subacromial corticosteroid injections. The review concluded that further research is needed to evaluate its effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Considering the cyclic often self-limiting course of the disease, and the treatment&#x02019;s anticipated placebo effect, the effectiveness of barbotage should preferably be answered by a sham-controlled randomized study.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the present study is:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p> to compare the short-term effectiveness (at 4&#x000a0;months) of barbotage and steroid injection, sham barbotage and steroid injection, and sham barbotage without steroid injection in the treatment of calcific tendinitis, and</p></list-item><list-item><p> to compare the long-term effectiveness (2&#x000a0;years) between the study groups.</p></list-item></list>

Patients who will have to be excluded according to the criteria given in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> will be reported. Inclusion, treatment and follow-up of study patients will be performed by hospital based physicians, specialised in physical medicine or orthopaedic surgery, all with long experience and special interest in the treatment of shoulder patients. At one site the study intervention will be given by a radiologist. The study hospitals represent different types of hospitals ranging from university hospitals to municipal hospitals and from hospitals with an urban to those with a rural location. Study medication and equipment is available at all study sites as all study interventions are part of already existing treatment routines. The study will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and under consideration of national laws and regulations, and will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Patient flow through the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2017_1501_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Standard shoulder radiographs (anterior-posterior, lateral and acromioclavicular views) will be obtained not more than 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to the intervention.

Patients fill in the scores directly on a computer/tablet through an internet website which is encrypted and has a secure protocol. Baseline and follow-up data will be stored on the research server at Martina Hansens Hospital, Sandvika, Norway. Access to the server is password protected and only the principal investigator (SM) has access to the database.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients who fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who have signed the consent form after oral and written study information was given, will be randomized to one of the three treatment options. Randomization will take place on the day of the intervention by an online central randomization system (web-CRF) developed and administered by the Unit of Applied Cancer Research, Institute of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. To assure verifiability of the randomization, patient initials, year of birth and name of the treating hospital will have to be registered at the central randomisation database. After registration, the intervention group for the specific patient will be displayed on-screen. Allocation will be 1:1:1. Block randomization with varying block lengths and stratification according to hospital will be performed. The randomisation list will remain at the University of Trondheim for the whole duration of the study and, consequently, will be inaccessible for the investigators, care providers and outcome assessors at the study centres.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p>An orthopaedic surgeon (2 hospitals), a radiologist (1 hospital), or a specialist in physical medicine (3 hospitals), all with at least 5&#x000a0;years of experience in diagnostic and interventional ultrasound of the shoulder will conduct the allocated interventions. To ensure consistency a video of the procedure was produced and send to all trial sites (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Video barbotage procedure).</p><p>Interventions will be performed with the patient in supine position. The arm will be internally rotated to a degree that the treating physician considers to be the most favourable for the puncturing of the calcific deposit (usually arm on the back). An opaque sheet will be used to block the patient&#x02019;s view of the screen of the ultrasound machine. After sterile skin preparation, with a 7 to 14&#x000a0;MHz transducer wrapped in a sterile drape, and by using sterile jelly, the calcific deposit will be sonographically identified, usually on the lateral transversal view. A 21-gauge needle will be introduced into the shoulder under sonographic guidance, and the pathway and the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa will be anesthetized with an injection of 10&#x000a0;ml of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride with adrenaline 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml.</p><p>In patients randomized to barbotage a new 18-gauge needle connected to a 5&#x000a0;ml syringe with 4&#x000a0;ml of saline solution will be used to puncture the calcification using freehand technique under continuous sonographic monitoring. With the tip of the needle placed in the centre of the deposit, the calcification will be flushed. If backflow of calcific material can be identified in the syringe, lavage of the deposit will be performed by successive propulsion and aspiration with the syringe plunger. Extracted calcium can be visualized in the syringe as a cloudlike substance that settles at the bottom of the barrel. To avoid reinjection of the calcium into the deposit, the needle and the syringe will be hold in the horizontal plane during the procedure. The syringe will be substituted when the fluid has become cloudy and the procedure will be repeated until the backflow becomes clear. At the end of the procedure the content of the syringes will be poured into a measuring cup and, when settled at the bottom of the cup, the volume of the extracted calcium will be estimated. In cases where no material can be extracted, repeated perforation of the deposit will be performed to possibly initiate or accelerate spontaneous resorption.</p><p>In patients randomized to the steroid group or to the placebo group, the tip of the 18-gauge needle will be placed in the soft parts outside of the rotator cuff and movements mimicking the lavage procedure will be performed.

We will blind the patient during the procedure by blocking their view of the ultrasound screen and the doctors working space and by mimicking a barbotage procedure in all patients. To control whether blinding of the patients was successful, patients will be asked after the treatment, and again after 2 and 6&#x000a0;weeks, which treatment they believe was performed. A blinding index as given in the literature will be calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The specialists performing the study interventions will be excluded from all other tasks during the follow-up and the statistician conducting the statistical analysis will be blinded to the treatment given.</p><p>The specific treatment procedure will not be reported in the patient journal, only that the patient received the study treatment, according to randomisation. The specialist who performs the study treatment, will record the patient&#x02019;s randomisation number, treatment selection, and name and date of birth in a decryption list which is kept in a safe place, accessible to the treating doctor only. This list can be consulted only if code break should be necessary during the trial. Code break is only permitted if knowledge of the study treatment seems mandatory for further treatment of a patient or if the patient insists in knowing the treatment group.

The blinded assessor will register all treatment related adverse events by asking and by consulting each patient&#x02019;s adverse event diary. The adverse event diary will be handed out to the patients on treatment day and will have to be kept over the entire 24-month follow-up period. Patients will be asked to enter in the diary any changes of their health condition that theiy perceive as an adverse event. The type of the event, its date of occurrence, its duration and its severity (on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from mild to severe) will have to be given. In case of a serious event, the hospital will have to be contacted immediately. If an adverse event requires treatment this will be recorded by the physician who is responsible for patient follow-up. The use and the dosage of prescription analgesics during the post treatment period will be recorded. An X-ray of the shoulder will be performed and, if still visible, the calcific deposit will be measured and classified according to Mol&#x000e9; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], blinded for baseline results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>The study&#x02019;s primary outcome measure is the OSS with the outcome at 4&#x000a0;months as the result of primary interest.

If necessary, they will be offered treatment as usual, which means barbotage (repeated barbotage if barbotage was the primary treatment), steroid injection (repeated injection if injection was the primary treatment), ESWT, surgery, or therapist guided physiotherapy treatment, depending on findings and patient preferences. Earlier re-examination and change of treatment can be considered, in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, for patients who are symptomatic to an extent that they cannot wait until the four month control. Patients who change the treatment during follow-up will remain in the study and will be followed-up according to an intention-to-treat principle.

If primary non-invasive treatment fails, different mini-invasive or non-invasive treatment options such as injection therapy, barbotage or ESWT exist. Which of them should be preferred is unclear.</p><p>Sham studies aiming to assess the effectiveness of invasive interventions for shoulder disorders are rarely performed but are necessary to provide a better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms. In the present study we want to compare two mini-invasive approaches representing different therapeutic principles; in the steroid injection group symptomatic relieve will be tried to achieve by anti-inflammatory treatment alone and in the barbotage group by a supplementary removal of the calcific deposit. A literature search identified only one randomised study comparing these methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The study was performed on 48 patients and showed a significantly better result on the Constant score for the barbotage group at one year follow-up (86.0 versus 73.9 points). The present study will be based on a larger patient group and a longer follow-up, and will also include a placebo group. Inclusion of a placebo group is important as we aim to assess the contribution of the placebo response to treatment results. Comparison to placebo has traditionally been performed in drug studies. However, the existence of a surgical placebo effect can be assumed and may be underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This would apply in particular for the treatment of conditions where pain is the dominant symptom, as pain is the outcome most powerfully affected by placebo interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Inclusion of a placebo group as a comparator in studies assessing the effectiveness of invasive or mini-invasive procedures has increased in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and has revealed that the results of some surgical procedures are not different from placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Without a placebo group we cannot exclude that patients treated by cortisone injection or barbotage are exposed to an ineffective mini-invasive procedure with a profound placebo effect.</p><p>To ensure recruitment of a sufficient number of eligible patients, the study will be performed at six hospitals as a multicenter study. Based on the number of barbotage procedures performed at these hospitals in the time before study start, inclusion of ten patients per year and per site can be expected. To minimise the number of drop-outs, data capturing at four of the six follow-ups will be via email where the patients can fill in the study scores on a computer at home. Non-appearance of follow-up data will be noticed immediately on the central server and can be handled by sending out a reminder.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to contribute to better knowledge about the mechanisms for pain reduction and improvement of function in the treatment of patients with symptomatic calcific tendinitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
