It leads to dissatisfaction and discomfort after surgery and can delay a patient&#x02019;s return to normal routine activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. POST has been rated by patients as the eighth most adverse effect in the postoperative period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The incidence of POST after ET intubation varies from 14.4&#x02013;90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The method of airway management is an important factor in causation of POST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. ET intubation is commonly performed under direct laryngoscopy using Macintosh laryngoscope (MCL). To visualize glottis with this laryngoscope, a forward and upward force is applied on the handle of the laryngoscope to align visual, oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. The force is also transferred to the arytenoid cartilages of the larynx and may damage the mucosa of delicate airway that may cause trauma to the glottis resulting in POST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Glidescope (GL) is a video laryngoscope (VL) and requires minimal head manipulation and positioning and allows rapid visualization of the larynx, compared to conventional direct laryngoscopy with MCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and provides improved view of the glottis that facilitates ET intubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It has been found to be less traumatic than MCL due to avoidance of the forces applied on the laryngoscope blade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">As ET intubation using GL requires less force during visualization of glottis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and has been found to be faster with superior view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], we hypothesized that ET intubation with GL would cause less trauma to the throat and consequently, lower incidence of POST.

Group MCL was intubated with Macintosh laryngoscope, Group GL was intubated with Glidescope. All the ET intubations were done by anesthesiologists who were having the experience of at least 100 intubations with each instrument.</p><p id="Par35">In the operating room, a peripheral intravenous (i.v.) line was established and standard monitors like continuous ECG, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SPO<sub>2</sub>) and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) were applied. Patient&#x02019;s head was placed on a 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;inches. high pillow to make a &#x0201c;sniffing morning air position&#x0201d;. Before induction of anesthesia, the patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3&#x000a0;min and received i.v. dexamethasone in the dose of 8&#x000a0;mg. GA was induced with i.v. propofol in the dose 2&#x000a0;mg/kg and fentanyl 2 microgram (mcg)/kg. For ET intubation, neuromuscular block was attained with cisatracurium in the dose of 0.15&#x000a0;mg/kg. Till the establishment of adequate neuromuscular block, the patients&#x02019; ventilation was assisted manually using a face mask. During this period the patients&#x02019; lungs were ventilated with 100% oxygen containing 2% sevoflurane on a circle breathing system. After establishment of adequate neuromuscular block confirmed by absence of response to train of four stimulation (TOF) of ulnar nerve, the trachea was intubated using either MCL or GL (according to the patients&#x02019; group). Cuffed poly vinyl chloride ET tube was used in all patients and the size was 7.0&#x000a0;mm internal diameter (I.D) in female patients and size 8.0&#x000a0;mm I.D in male patients. The ET tube was lubricated with water soluble KY&#x000ae; Jelly only. After placement, the cuff of the ET tube was inflated gradually with air until an intra-cuff pressure of 20&#x02013;25&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O (measured with aneroid manometer VBM, Sulz, Germany) and there was no audible leakage with peak airway pressure of 20&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Heat and moisture exchangers were used in the gas delivery circuit in all cases. For intubation with GL, we used size 4 scope and for patients in MCL group, size 4 blade was used. The allowed time for successful ET intubation was up to two minutes. If the time to intubation (TTI) exceeded 2&#x000a0;min or SPO<sub>2</sub> dropped below 92%, the patient&#x02019;s lungs were ventilated with 100% oxygen containing 2% sevoflurane for 30&#x000a0;seconds (s) and a second intubation trial was attempted. Manual intermittent positive pressure ventilation was done between the attempts with the same anesthetic mixture. A maximum of two intubation attempts were allowed. If two attempts were unsuccessful in proper ET placement, failed intubation algorithm was followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">After successful ET placement, GA was maintained with 2&#x02013;3% end tidal concentration of sevoflurane in 50% oxygen air mixture. Nitrous oxide was not used in the study. Intraoperative analgesia was maintained with intermittent boluses of fentanyl in the dose of 1 mcg/kg when heart rate or NIBP increased by 20% or more from the baseline reading. Cisatracurium was repeated in the dose of 2&#x000a0;mg bolus on appearance of 2 twitches on TOF stimulation of ulnar nerve. All of the patients received i.v. paracetamol in the dose of 1&#x000a0;g intraoperatively. The remaining course of GA was on the anesthesiologist&#x02019;s discretion. On completion of the surgery, the residual neuromuscular block was reversed with the mixture of 2.5&#x000a0;mg neostigmine and glycopyrolate 0.4&#x000a0;mg administered i.v.

In our study we did not find any contribution from these factors as both the groups were similar in this respect.</p><p id="Par48">Our main results show that (a) overall incidence of POST was high with MCL compared to GL, (b) incidence of POST was more at 0&#x000a0;h and at 6&#x000a0;h with MCL compared to GL, however, there was no difference between the groups in the incidence at 12 and 24&#x000a0;h after surgery, (c) severity of POST was more with MCL at 0, 6 and 12&#x000a0;h with MCL, (d) C&#x00026;L grade of view of the glottis was higher and IDS was more with MCL compared to GL, (e) need of external pressure on the neck for successful intubation was more with MCL, (f) POGO score was higher with GL, (g) TTI required for successful intubation was more with MCL and (h) patient&#x02019;s satisfaction score was comparatively more with GL.</p><p id="Par49">Similar to our results, Najafi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] compared incidence of POST after laryngoscopy with GL and MCL in 300 patients and found it to be higher in MCL group. Despite similarities in results, there are certain divergences in the design of both the researches; e.g. the authors studied incidence of POST for 48&#x000a0;h and included the patients undergoing comparatively prolonged surgeries (average surgery duration was 130&#x000a0;min), while we studied POST for only 24 and the average duration of surgery was 85&#x000a0;min. In contrast to our results, Najafi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] found lower incidence of POST at 0, 6, 12, 24&#x000a0;h with both the devices. They did not specify the experience of the intubating person or the BMI of the patients, neither did they compare the number of attempts needed for successful intubation. The probable reason of lower incidence of POST in their study may be due to relatively more experienced anesthesiologists performing ET intubation or the patients having lower BMI or that fewer number of attempts were required for successful intubation. Moreover, our research adds to Najafi&#x02019;s results by studying important additional factors like smoking habits, POGO score, C&#x00026;L score, presence of blood stain on the intubating instrument, intubation difficulty score (all of which may affect the incidence and severity of POST) and the ultimate goal, &#x0201c;patient&#x02019;s satisfaction score&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par50">One of the major causes of POST is trauma to the airway mucosa during airway management. The degree of mucosal damage is related to amount of forces applied during laryngoscopy and the number of attempts required for successful intubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Using GL for laryngoscopy and ET intubation, alignment of laryngeal and oral axis is not required due to unique design of its blade which has a camera at its distal end. Russell et al. compared the forces applied during the laryngoscopy while using GL and MCL. Their results showed lower peak force with GL in comparison to MCL (9&#x000a0;N v.s 20&#x000a0;N; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As less amount of force is required during laryngoscopy using GL, it produced less trauma to the mucosa of the airway, resulting in lower incidence and severity of POST in our study. In a Cochrane database systemic review, Lewis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] compared VL and direct laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation and concluded that VL reduces laryngeal and airway trauma. Although, in our study, the number of patients with blood stain on the intubating device was not statistically high in MCL group, nevertheless, they were higher in number compared to GL group patients. The reason for intubating trauma not showing on the intubating instrument may be because blood on the device would only appear if it caused trauma directly, however, the trauma caused by the ET tube would not show on the intubating instrument. Secondary to inappropriate glottic visualization (higher C&#x00026;L grades and lower POGO score) in the MCL group, the ET tube probably scrubbed against the glottic or laryngeal mucosa and traumatized it resulting in higher incidence of POST.</p><p id="Par51">Another factor contributing to POST is the duration of laryngoscopy and TTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our results show that TTI was higher with MCL compared to GL which contributed to higher incidence of POST in this group. The reason of greater TTI with MCL was comparatively poor view of the glottis based on C&#x00026;L classification and POGO scores which required external manipulation of the neck during ET intubation. Similar to our results Hsu et al. found higher incidence of POST with MCL in comparison to GL following double lumen tube insertion. They related the higher incidence of POST to longer TTI required using MCL compared to GL (62.5&#x000a0;s&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;29&#x000a0;s v.s 45.6&#x000a0;s&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10.7&#x000a0;s (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similarly Johns P et al. also found higher incidence of POST with MCL compared to GL during routine nasotracheal intubation. Their TTI for successful ET intubation was also more with MCL compared to GL (43.5&#x000a0;s v.s. 23.2&#x000a0;s, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0023) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Contrary to our results, Cirilla D and colleagues did not find any difference in the incidence of POST during routine use of GL and MCL in patients with normal airway (32.4% v.s. 36.3%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.619) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In their study, ET intubation was performed by residents, nurses and anesthesiologists. Furthermore, the authors did not record and compare the TTI in their study, in our opinion, it is difficult to compare our results with their study since we found significantly more TTI with MCL compared to GL during visualization of the glottis and placement of ET tube into the trachea which resulted in more trauma to mucosa of the airway and the incidence and severity of POST.</p><p id="Par52">Contradictory to our results, Anderson et al. found no difference between the incidence of POST using GL and MCL in morbidly obese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], possibly due to the longer TTI needed by them with GL versus MCL (48&#x000a0;s v.s 32&#x000a0;s, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001). However, the intubations were performed by different categories of health care providers including nurses, residents and anesthesiologists with the experience of merely 20 or more intubations with GL. In our research, we overcome those limitations by having fairly more experienced anesthesiologists compared to them (having &#x0003e;100 intubations with each device) who performed the ET intubations. Using GL, our anesthesiologists successfully accomplished the ET intubations in only 36&#x000a0;s compared to 48&#x000a0;s required by Anderson et al., and therefore, might have caused less trauma to the airway. The results of Anderson et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to some extent, are comparable to our results as a longer TTI contributes to a higher incidence of POST due to greater degree of airway mucosal trauma irrespective of the type of device used during ET placement.</p><p id="Par53">Our results show that while using GL, laryngoscopic grades based on C&#x00026;L classification are lower and view of the glottis based on POGO score is superior in comparison to MCL which results in reduction in TTI, need of external neck manipulations, number of attempts during ET placement leading to reduction in the incidence and severity of POST. Similar to our results, other researchers also found superior view of the glottis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], lower grades of C&#x00026;L&#x02019;s laryngoscopic view and ET intubation to be easier with GL compared to MCL in patients with normal airway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and in morbidly obese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite getting superior view of glottis using VL, Lewis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] in a Cochrane database systematic review, found no difference in the incidence of POST and the reason of contradiction to our results is probably heterogeneity of the TTI among their studies. Our research would add to the results of the Cochrane database that longer TTI may be a major contributory factor in the causation of POST.</p><p id="Par54">Our data shows that the overall incidence of POST was comparatively less than that of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We speculate that the reason of the overall reduction in the incidence of POST in our research is the contribution of injection dexamethasone, lornoxicam, paracetamol and PCA which were used (as a part of study protocol) for the patients in both the groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">As the use of GL is increasing in patients with normal airway due to improved visualization of glottis and ease of intubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], a reduction in the incidence and severity of POST may also be a contributing factor leading to its popularity in routine case. Future large scale studies, using our results as a baseline, may be required to establish contribution of GL in reduction of incidence and severity of POST during its routine use in patients with normal airway.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="Par56">In this study we used GL and our results may not be applicable to other types of VLs as there are gross differences in the shapes and clinical performance of different kinds of VLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Secondly, though all the intubations were performed by anesthesia trainee residents with experience of 100 intubations with each device, their skill cannot be compared to skilled anesthesiologists as ET placement using MCL has a significant learning curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Additionally, for a valid comparison, relatively more experienced anesthesiologists should have been included, especially with MCL. Thirdly, it was not possible to blind the observer due to design of our study and there is a possibility of bias towards a new device. Fourthly, we used C&#x00026;L classification to grade the view of the glottis using both the devices while it was originally conceived to grade laryngoscopic view based on direct laryngoscopy only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; nevertheless many researchers have used this classification for VLs also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Lastly, in our opinion, we should have checked for the presence of blood on the ET tube as the trauma caused by it may not appear on the intubating instrument.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par57">GL for ET tube placement results in reduction in the incidence and severity of POST compared to MCL during its routine use in patients with normal airway due to probably superior glottic visualization and reduced TTI.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>C&#x00026;L</term><def><p id="Par6">Cormack and Lehane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ET</term><def><p id="Par7">Endotracheal intubation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GA</term><def><p id="Par8">General anesthesia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GL</term><def><p id="Par9">Glidescope</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>I.D</term><def><p id="Par10">Internal diameter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>i.v.</term><def><p id="Par11">Intravenous</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDS</term><def><p id="Par12">Intubation difficulty score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mcg</term><def><p id="Par13">Microgram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCL</term><def><p id="Par14">Macintosh</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIBP</term><def><p id="Par15">Non-invasive measurement of blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PACU</term><def><p id="Par16">Post anesthesia care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCA</term><def><p id="Par17">Patient controlled analgesia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POGO</term><def><p id="Par18">Percentage of glottic opening</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POST</term><def><p id="Par19">Postoperative sore throat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>s</term><def><p id="Par20">Second</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p id="Par21">Saturation by pulse oximetry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TOF</term><def><p id="Par22">Train of four</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTI</term><def><p id="Par23">Time to intubate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VL</term><def><p id="Par24">Video laryngoscope</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the College of Medicine Research Centre, Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par58">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par59">The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MA was involved in designing the study, data collection, data interpretation, writing and reviewing the manuscript.
