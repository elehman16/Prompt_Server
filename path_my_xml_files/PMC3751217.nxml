Previous studies evaluated single sets of incobotulinumtoxinA injections for the treatment of blepharospasm. Individualized injection intervals and other potential determinants of efficacy and safety need to be evaluated in a prospective, longitudinal study. Subjects with blepharospasm who completed a &#x02264;20&#x000a0;weeks double-blind, placebo-controlled main period entered a &#x02264;69&#x000a0;weeks open-label extension period (OLEX) and received &#x02264;5 additional incobotulinumtoxinA treatments at flexible doses (&#x02264;50&#x000a0;U per eye) and flexible injection intervals (minimum of 6&#x000a0;weeks). Outcome measures included Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) (sumscore, severity subscore and frequency subscore), Blepharospasm Disability Index, and adverse events. All 102 subjects who completed the main period entered the OLEX; 82 subjects completed the study, 56 received the maximum five injections. From each injection visit to a control visit 6&#x000a0;weeks later, investigator-rated JRS sumscores and subscores, and patient-rated Blepharospasm Disability Index were significantly improved (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.001 for all). All scores were still significantly improved at trial termination compared with the first injection visit (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 for all). The most frequently reported adverse events were eyelid ptosis (31.4&#x000a0;%) and dry eye symptoms (17.6&#x000a0;%). The injection interval had no impact on the incidence of adverse events (post hoc analysis). No subject developed neutralizing antibodies during the study. Repeated incobotulinumtoxinA injections, administered at flexible doses and injection intervals from 6 to 20&#x000a0;weeks according to subjects&#x02019; needs, provide sustained efficacy in the treatment of blepharospasm with no new or unexpected safety risks.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Blepharospasm</kwd><kwd>Botulinum toxin</kwd><kwd>IncobotulinumtoxinA</kwd><kwd>Dystonia</kwd><kwd>Xeomin</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Wien 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blepharospasm is a focal dystonia characterized by excessive involuntary contractions of the muscles surrounding the eyes (Hallett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>). Patients experience a reduced quality of life and, in severe cases, can even suffer from functional blindness (Daly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1997</xref>).</p><p>Botulinum toxin type A has been successfully used for the treatment of blepharospasm for more than 20&#x000a0;years (for review see Truong and Jost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>), having demonstrated efficacy in several controlled clinical trials (Jankovic and Orman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1987</xref>; Jankovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>; Roggenk&#x000e4;mper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>; Truong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>). IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; also known by its internal drug code NT 201; Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) is a highly purified, lyophilized botulinum neurotoxin type A formulation. When isolated from <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> cultures, botulinum toxin is a protein complex consisting of the 150&#x000a0;kDa core neurotoxin and accessory (complexing) proteins (Inoue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1996</xref>). As a result of a unique purification process, incobotulinumtoxinA contains only the 150&#x000a0;kDa neurotoxin, and unlike other botulinum toxin formulations is free from accessory (complexing) proteins (Frevert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Frevert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>; Frevert and Dressler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). IncobotulinumtoxinA has demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to onabotulinumtoxinA (Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) in the treatment of blepharospasm (Roggenk&#x000e4;mper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>) and cervical dystonia (Benecke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>) when the same unit doses were used.</p><p>In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, treatment with incobotulinumtoxinA demonstrated superiority versus placebo for patients with blepharospasm (Jankovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>). As blepharospasm is a chronic condition, the investigation of long-term treatment options is essential. Here, we present data from the open-label extension period (OLEX) of the placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated injections of incobotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of blepharospasm. The study design incorporated flexible dosing and flexible injection intervals to allow tailoring of treatment to the needs of the individual patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The results of the preceding double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled main period (MP; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00406367) of the trial have been reported previously with the corresponding inclusion and exclusion criteria (Jankovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>). The OLEX had an unblinded, non-controlled design and was conducted at 34 centers in the US and Canada. The responsible Institutional Review Boards approved the study protocol and informed consent form; patients provided written informed consent. The ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice were followed. The study was monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects enrolled in this study had completed the MP, and had expressed the need for a new injection, confirmed by the investigator [defined as a Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) severity subscore &#x02265;2]. Prior to the MP, all subjects had received at least two treatments with onabotulinumtoxinA. The doses used in these onabotulinumtoxinA injections were the basis for the dose of incobotulinumtoxinA administered during the MP (Jankovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>), using a clinical conversion ratio 1:1 between onabotulinumtoxinA and incobotulinumtoxinA (Roggenk&#x000e4;mper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). Re-injection during the OLEX was possible from as early as 6&#x000a0;weeks up to the time whenever the patient expressed the need for a new injection. There were no specific exclusion criteria for the OLEX.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatment</title><p>During the OLEX, subjects could receive a maximum of five incobotulinumtoxinA injections over &#x02264;49&#x000a0;weeks, followed by a safety observation period of &#x02264;20&#x000a0;weeks (total duration &#x02264;69&#x000a0;weeks). In standard clinical practice, the treatment interval is typically restricted to around 12&#x000a0;weeks based on the presumption that this delay will lessen the chance of antibody formation against botulinum toxin. However, this study employed flexibility in dosing and intervals, enabling investigators to re-inject based on subjects&#x02019; needs. Subjects had to contact the investigator to request a re-injection; re-injection criteria included a &#x02265;6-week injection interval and a JRS severity subscore &#x02265;2. Dose, dilution, number of injections, and injection sites were flexible and tailored to each individual subject by the investigator, based on the severity and frequency of spasms, individual response, and history of adverse events (AEs) of each subject. The total maximum dose per injection session was 100&#x000a0;U (50&#x000a0;U per eye).</p><p>Each injection visit was followed by an office visit 6&#x000a0;weeks later when symptoms were assessed. The trial termination visit (TTV) took place 20&#x000a0;weeks (&#x000b1;3&#x000a0;days) after the last injection or when the subject asked for a new injection after the end of the 49&#x000a0;weeks treatment period, whichever came first.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Efficacy assessments</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Jankovic Rating Scale</title><p>Severity and frequency of blepharospasm symptoms were measured using the JRS, which is scored on a scale 0&#x02013;8 points (sumscore) and includes two subscores: severity and frequency, both ranging from 0 to 4 (Jankovic and Orman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1987</xref>; Jankovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>).

Physical and neurological examinations were conducted at the beginning of the OLEX, the third injection visit, and the TTV. Blood samples for laboratory tests and determination of antibodies against botulinum toxin were collected at all injection visits and the TTV. Samples were initially screened for botulinum neurotoxin antibodies using a fluorescence immunoassay (FIA); as the FIA cannot discriminate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, positive FIA samples were subsequently tested using a mouse hemidiaphragm assay (HDA) (G&#x000f6;schel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1997</xref>; Sesardic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>).</p><p>Investigators rated the tolerability of incobotulinumtoxinA at all injection visits (except the first), and at the TTV, using a four-point scale ranging from 1 (very good) to 4 (poor), based on patient reports.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All efficacy variables were analyzed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all subjects who were randomized in the MP and included in the OLEX).

This is the first randomized trial in which flexible injection intervals were used in registration trials in the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of botulinum neurotoxin type A.</p><p>Six weeks after each injection visit, there were significant improvements in the investigator-rated severity and frequency of blepharospasm symptoms (JRS scores) and significant reductions in functional impairments assessed using the patient-rated BSDI, results similar to those of the MP (Jankovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>; Roggenk&#x000e4;mper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>).</p><p>Over the course of the study, the mean JRS baseline scores at the injection visits gradually decreased and significant improvements were seen from the first and the fifth injection visit to the TTV. This suggests cumulative and sustained improvements in subjects treated with incobotulinumtoxinA in this long-term study. Moreover, the flexible dosing intervals might have allowed patients to receive a new injection before the treatment effect of the previous incobotulinumtoxinA injections had completely waned. The mean treatment effect, as assessed via JRS scores 6&#x000a0;weeks after each injection visit, remained constant throughout the OLEX.</p><p>The trial design permitted flexible treatment intervals with a minimum of 6&#x000a0;weeks. Current US Prescribing Information for onabotulinumtoxinA and incobotulinumtoxinA (both approved for the treatment of blepharospasm by the US Food and Drug Administration) recommend a minimum treatment interval of 12&#x000a0;weeks (Allergan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>; Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>), due to concerns that shorter intervals could promote the formation of neutralizing antibodies. However, previous studies with incobotulinumtoxinA in other indications suggest that incobotulinumtoxinA with its low foreign protein content and high specific biological activity is associated with low immunogenicity (Comella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>; Ka&#x000f1;ovsk&#x000fd; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>). These data suggested that flexible injection intervals could be applied to allow for treatment individualization based on the individual patient&#x02019;s clinical needs. In the current study, post hoc analysis did not show that the incidence of AEs differed significantly between subjects with different median injection intervals, suggesting that shorter injection intervals are not more likely to be associated with safety concerns. However, it should be noted that patient groups in the post hoc analysis were relatively small. A recent multi-national survey among 136&#x000a0;patients with CD who received treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA or abobotulinumtoxinA indicated that 78&#x000a0;% of patients preferred injection intervals &#x02264;12&#x000a0;weeks, with 46&#x000a0;% of patients stating they would prefer injection intervals &#x02264;10&#x000a0;weeks (Sethi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>).</p><p>Subjects were specifically questioned about AEs that would indicate toxin spread, including eyelid ptosis and dry eye symptoms, which might have prompted a greater level of reporting. This could have contributed to the seemingly higher incidence of ptosis and dry eye symptoms in this study compared to other reports of botulinum toxin treatment effects in blepharospasm, though these studies also only covered one treatment cycle typically without active questioning (Jankovic and Orman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1987</xref>; Roggenk&#x000e4;mper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>; Truong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>; Wabbels et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Allergan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>). Specific questioning allowed us to monitor for changes in the incidence of ptosis and dry eye symptoms during the succeeding treatment cycles. No trend was noted towards an increase in the incidence of AEs with repeated incobotulinumtoxinA treatments, indicating that repeated injections at flexible intervals between 6 and 20&#x000a0;weeks are a viable long-term treatment option for subjects with blepharospasm. The most frequently observed ADRs, eyelid ptosis and dry eye symptoms, well-known side effects of all botulinum toxin preparations in this indication, were transient, similar to published experience (Allergan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>; Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>; Kenney and Jankovic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). After each injection cycle, &#x0003e;96&#x000a0;% of investigators reported that incobotulinumtoxinA was &#x0201c;well&#x0201d; tolerated or &#x0201c;very well&#x0201d; tolerated.</p><p>Of note in this study, no subjects developed neutralizing antibodies, determined by the in vitro HDA (G&#x000f6;schel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1997</xref>), during the MP (Jankovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>) or the OLEX. This is consistent with other studies of incobotulinumtoxinA (Ka&#x000f1;ovsk&#x000fd; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>) and supports accumulating evidence that incobotulinumtoxinA is associated with low immunogenicity.</p><p>In conclusion, this OLEX of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated that repeated injections of incobotulinumtoxinA at flexible intervals provided sustained efficacy in the long-term treatment of blepharospasm. There were no new or unexpected AEs during this trial and no subjects discontinued due to an ADR. A post hoc analysis by injection interval (6&#x02013;20&#x000a0;weeks) did not show that the incidence of AEs varied significantly for patients who received repeated injections with different median intervals. Further long-term observation of a large number of subjects over many years will be required to fully evaluate the immunogenicity of botulinum toxin preparations for patients with blepharospasm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Study investigators</title><p>Richard Barbano (Rochester, NY, USA); Allison Brashear (Winston-Salem, NC, USA); Matthew Brodsky (Portland, OR, USA); Mahan Chehrenama (Alexandria, VI, USA); Cynthia Comella (Chicago, IL, USA); Paul Cullis (Detroit, MI, USA); Fabio Danisi (Kingston, NY, USA); Richard Dubinsky (Kansas City, KA, USA); Aaron Ellenbogen (Bingham Farms, MI, USA); Marian Evatt (Atlanta, GA, USA); Virgilio Gerald Evidente (Scottsdale, AZ, USA); Hubert Fernandez (Gainesville, FL, USA); Stephen Gollomp (Wynnewood, PA, USA); David Greeley (Spokane, WA, USA); Stephen Grill (Elkridge, MD, USA); Philip Hanna (Edison, NJ, USA); Robert Hauser (Tampa, FL, USA); Neal Hermanowicz (Irvine, CA, USA); Zhigao Huang (Jacksonville, FL, USA); Bahman Jabbari (New Haven, CT, USA); Joseph Jankovic (Houston, TX, USA); Un Jung Kang (Chicago, IL, USA); Mark LeDoux (Memphis, TN, USA); Kenneth Levin (Ridgewood, NJ, USA); Peter LeWitt (Southfield, MI, USA); Anthony Nicholas (Birmingham, AL, USA); Robert Rodnitzky (Iowa City, IA, USA); Alok Sahay (Cincinnati, OH, USA); Harvey Schwartz (Hollywood, FL, USA); Burton Scott (Durham, NC, USA); Kapil Sethi (Augusta, GA, USA); Dee Silver (La Jolla, CA, USA); Carlos Singer (Miami, FL, USA); Lynn Struck (Des Moines, IA, USA); William Sunter (Melbourne, FL, USA); Daniel Truong (Fountain Valley, CA, USA); Alberto Vasquez (St. Petersburg, FL, USA); Maureen Wooten Watts (Dallas, TX, USA).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
