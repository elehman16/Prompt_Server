Chronic constipation (CC), usually defined as more than 6&#x000a0;months of symptoms, is less common but results in 0.5 million UK GP consultations per annum. The effect of symptoms on measured quality of life (QOL) is significant, and CC consumes significant health care resources. In the UK, it is estimated that 10% of district nursing time is spent on constipation. Trans-anal irrigation therapy has become a widely used treatment despite a lack of robust efficacy data to support its use. The long-term outcome of treatment is also unclear. A randomised comparison of two different methods of irrigation (high- and low-volume) will provide valuable evidence of superiority of one system over the other, as well as providing efficacy data for the treatment as a whole.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants will be recruited based on predetermined eligibility criteria. Following informed consent, they will be randomised to either high-volume (HV) or low-volume (LV) irrigation and undergo standardised radiological and physiological investigations. Following training, they will commence home irrigation with the allocated device. Data will be collected at 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months according to a standardised outcomes framework. The primary outcome is PAC-QOL, measured at 3&#x000a0;months. The study is powered to detect a 10% difference in outcome between systems at 3&#x000a0;months; this means that 300 patients will need to be recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will be the first randomised comparison of two different methods of trans-anal irrigation. It will also be the largest prospective study of CC patients treated with irrigation. It will provide evidence for the effectiveness of irrigation in the treatment of CC, as well as the comparative effectiveness of the two methods. This will enable more cost-effective and evidence-based use of irrigation. Also, the results will be combined with the other studies in the CapaCiTY programme to generate an evidence-based treatment algorithm for CC in adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN, identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11093872?q=anal%20irrigation&#x00026;filters=&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=1&#x00026;totalResults=3&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=10&#x00026;searchType=basic-search">ISRCTN11093872</ext-link>.

Chronic constipation (CC), usually defined as more than 6&#x000a0;months of symptoms, is less common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but results in 0.5 million UK GP consultations per annum. A proportion of the population suffer symptoms which are both chronic and more disabling (about 1&#x02013;2% of the population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such patients, who are predominantly female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], are usually referred to secondary care with many progressing to tertiary specialist investigation. Patient dissatisfaction is high in this group; nearly 80% feel that laxative therapy is unsatisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the effect of symptoms on measured quality of life (QOL) is significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. CC consumes significant health care resources. In the US in 2012, a primary complaint of constipation was responsible for 3.2 million physician visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] resulting in (direct and indirect) costs of US$1.7 billion. In the UK, it is estimated that 10% of district nursing time is spent on constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the annual spend on laxatives exceeds &#x000a3;80 million, with 17.4 million prescriptions being issued in 2012 (Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pathophysiological basis of chronic constipation</title><p>The act of defaecation is dependent on the coordinated functions of the colon, rectum and anus. Considering the complexity of neuromuscular (sensory and motor) functions required to achieve planned, conscious and effective defaecation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] it is no surprise that disturbances to perceived &#x02018;normal&#x02019; function occur commonly at all stages of life. Clinically, such problems commonly lead to symptoms of obstructed defaecation, e.g. straining; incomplete, unsuccessful or painful evacuation; bowel infrequency; abdominal pain and bloating. After exclusion of a multitude of secondary causes (obstructing colonic lesions, neurological, metabolic and endocrine disorders), the pathophysiology of CC can broadly be divided into problems of colonic contractile activity and thus stool transit and problems of the pelvic floor. Thus, with specialist physiological testing (using a standard panel of radio-physiological tests of colonic and anorectal function, hereafter referred to as INVEST in this protocol), patients may be divided into those who have slow colonic transit, evacuation disorder, both or neither (no abnormality found with current tests). Evacuation disorders can be then subdivided into those in which a structurally significant pelvic floor abnormality is evident, e.g. rectocoele or internal prolapse (intussusception) and those in which there is a dynamic failure of evacuation without structural abnormality: most commonly termed &#x02018;functional defaecation disorder (FDD)&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chronic constipation management overview</title><p>Management of CC is a major problem due to its high prevalence and lack of widespread specialist expertise. In general, a step-wise approach is undertaken, with first-line conservative treatment, such as lifestyle advice and laxatives (primary care), followed by nurse-led bowel retraining programmes, sometimes including focussed biofeedback and psychosocial support (secondary/tertiary care). Although these treatments may improve symptoms in more than half of patients, they are very poorly standardised in the UK and are not universally successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, patients with intractable symptoms and impaired QOL may be offered a range of costly, irreversible surgical interventions with unpredictable results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], sometimes resulting in major adverse events (AEs) or a permanent stoma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Overall rationale for the CapaCiTY programme</title><p>The current trial forms part of an NIHR-funded programme (PGfAR: RP-PG-0612-20001). This programme aims to develop the evidence base for the management of CC in adults which is currently lacking. This is in contrast to the management of CC in children for which NICE guidance has been recently published (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/constipation-in-children-and-young-people">http://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/constipation/clinical-management-of-idiopathic-constipation-in-children-and-young-people</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; and for adults with faecal incontinence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/faecal-incontinence">http://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/faecal-incontinence</ext-link>). Thus, the current situation is one where there are considerable variations in practice, particularly in specialist services. With a number of new drugs gaining or seeking NHS approval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and technologies at a horizon-scanning stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] it is timely that the currently limited evidence base for adult CC is developed for resource-constrained NHS providers to have confidence that new and sometimes expensive investigations and therapies are appropriate and cost-effective. A cost-conscious pathway of care may help to reduce health care expenditure by appropriately sequencing the care provided, while targeting more expensive therapies at those most likely to benefit. Such data will inform the development and commissioning of integrated care pathways. An overview of the CapaCiTY programme is provided as a scheme (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and includes a series of interlinked work package signature pages (WPs) that answer the important questions for patient care. A rolling programme of national recruitment will provide a large cohort of well-defined patients for subsequent studies within sequential WPs over 5&#x000a0;years. The focus will be on generating real-life evidence from pragmatic studies which will provide valid clinical outcome measures, patient acceptability and cost. Armed with such data it will be possible to develop an NHS management algorithm for CC which will meet patient, clinician and policy aims.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Specific clinical background to the prospective cohort study of trans-anal irrigation (TAI)</title><p>Anal irrigation, using a variety of commercially available devices, has been rapidly disseminated internationally over the past 3&#x02013;5 years, first in patients with neurological injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and subsequently in other CC groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Despite a lack of published data other than from small selected case series, it is now available on the drug tariff and generally considered to be the next step in patients failing other nurse-led interventions such as biofeedback. Anal irrigation has permeated the UK market without robust efficacy data and with on-going concerns regarding longevity of treatment and complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Retrospective clinical audit data and review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] suggest a continued response rate after 1&#x000a0;year of approximately 50% with such patients, thus avoiding or delaying surgical intervention. An accurate assessment of response rate and acceptability of this intervention requires confirmation in a large prospective cohort, together with clinico-physiological predictors of success. In addition, two alternative systems for delivery of TAI exist; low-volume systems delivering approximately 70&#x000a0;ml per irrigation, and high-volume systems delivering up to 2&#x000a0;L of irrigation (although typically only 0.5&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;L is required per irrigation). The low-volume system is cheaper, costing approximately &#x000a3;750 p.a. based on alternate-day use, compared with approximately &#x000a3;1400&#x02013;1900 for high-volume irrigation, and may be more acceptable to patients, and so a randomised study comparing the two systems is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trial design: rationale</title><p>Robust data for the use of TAI therapy in chronic (idiopathic) constipation are lacking. In addition, there are no data demonstrating superiority of high-volume irrigation over low-volume systems. Given the differences in cost between the two systems, a randomised study of well-characterised patients comparing the two methods would provide useful information on whether one system holds a clear advantage over the other. Also, the short- and long-term efficacy and acceptability of therapy in CC could be evaluated. This is timely and informative given the rapidly increasing popularity of this treatment and the fact that TAI is an invasive therapy for which patient selection should also be optimised to maximise benefit.</p><p>In practice, patients will use one system only (plus defined &#x02018;rescue therapies&#x02019; &#x02013; see below) for a minimum of 3&#x000a0;months. After this time point they may switch to the other system if their initial therapy was ineffective/unsatisfactory. Thus, consenting patients will be randomised to initiate therapy with one of these systems but will have the option of switching to the other after an initial 3-month period. This allows us to identify response rates to each system in the short term (3&#x000a0;months), and thereafter this study is a comparison between treatment strategies (low-volume initiated therapy versus high-volume initiated therapy) rather than a pure comparison of the two techniques. This is a patient-centred study design aiming to limit the time that patients spend using ineffective therapy without being allowed to try an alternative. This also allows estimation of comparative cost-effectiveness of the two treatment pathways, and whether one system works better depending on the radio-physiological profile of the patient. Recent data estimates that approximately 85% of patients are still using irrigation at 1&#x000a0;month; this represents a significant short-term treatment failure rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Once patients have switched therapy, they may not switch back to the first system; once they have tried both systems and discontinued them then they will be considered to have completed the intervention and they will return to routine clinical care.</p><p>Irrigation is a maintenance therapy rather than a cure. In addition to outcome measures of the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life questionnaire (PAC-QOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] score at 3&#x000a0;months, patients will provide survival data (time until cessation of irrigation therapy due to lack of benefit). Switching systems does not affect this; the survival data is based on the use of irrigation irrespective of system. A survival analysis is appropriate since anal irrigation is time-consuming and inconvenient as a therapy and patients may find the process distasteful. Patients are unlikely to continue with treatment if they are not gaining worthwhile benefit from it; treatment continuation is a useful patient-centric assessment.</p><p>Consideration of the findings from both groups (individually and together) will be used to model the net value to patients of anal irrigation, considering persistence of benefit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Risks/benefits</title><p>The interventions proposed are those already offered to patients in specialist centres throughout the UK and internationally. All interventions pose acceptable and minimal risks. For instance, the only invasive tests (INVEST) have been performed daily in most specialist centres for up to 30&#x000a0;years without any recorded complication (Barts Health experience of over 10,000 patients). A small ionising radiation dose is required for one of the tests (covered below). A number of questionnaires contain personal questions about bowel problems and the effect of these on QOL and psycho-behavioural functioning; however, all have been used in studies of similar patients previously.</p><p>Trans-anal irrigation has been shown to be a low-risk intervention and is widely used in a variety of defaecatory disorders such as neurogenic bowel dysfunction, idiopathic constipation and faecal incontinence. Serious adverse events (SAEs) are rare, with one study reporting two nonfatal bowel perforations out of approximately 110,000 irrigation treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Other potential side effects include pain, bleeding, painful haemorrhoids and anal fissure. A recent study reported an overall adverse event (AE) rate of 22% when all minor and reversible events were considered. Thirteen percent reported technical problems with equipment and 13% reported minor side effects/AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]<sub>.</sub> The risk of nonparticipation is considered very low.</p><p>The benefits of participation are that patients will receive a very high standard of monitored care as a consequence of the detailed protocol.

</p><p>Note: &#x02018;red flag&#x02019; symptoms are not an exclusion if they have been investigated before enrollment and organic disease excluded. Previous TAI therapy does not include private (non-NHS) &#x02018;colonic irrigation&#x02019; therapy; prior use of such treatments is not an exclusion criterion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study interventions: trans-anal irrigation therapy</title><p>Trans-anal irrigation training will be provided by trained nurse or physiotherapist with experience in delivering care for CC. They must have initiated irrigation therapy in at least three patients independently, and be a nurse/therapist of good standing within a clinical team regularly seeing patients with CC. A standardised approach and intervention will be provided via the use of an intervention manual. For the first 3&#x000a0;months of participation in the study, patients may not use other therapies besides anal irrigation and those rescue therapies specified below. They may discontinue therapy at any point (elective withdrawal from intervention) and may switch from one system to the other after 3&#x000a0;months. Switching anal irrigation systems before completing the 3-month waiting period will be discouraged. If it does occur, it will be documented as a protocol deviation with the timing and reason documented. If symptoms are severe despite the use of irrigation and rescue therapies then other medications may be used on compassionate grounds, but this must be recorded in the Case Report Form(CRF)/concomitant medications log.</p><p>The course of therapy will include a nurse-led training session (or more if required to ensure that the device is being used effectively) followed by patient-led home irrigation therapy. The low-volume system commonly used in practice is Qufora&#x000ae; Mini (MBH-International). Various high-volume systems are used, all of which have very similar mechanisms of action; these include Peristeen&#x02122; (Coloplast) and Qufora Toilet/Qufora Balloon&#x02122; (MBH-international). These are commercially available TAI systems available on prescription in NHS practice.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Low-volume irrigation</title><p>This system consists of a small reservoir attached to a cone. The reservoir holds approximately 70&#x000a0;ml of water and is squeezed to inject water into the rectum. The regime used will be as follows: initial irrigation once daily for 14&#x000a0;days using one to three insufflations (each of 70&#x000a0;ml approximately). This may then be reduced to alternate days depending on response. Patients may then adjust frequency and volume depending on response. They may irrigate as much and as often as they feel is necessary to give them benefit and this information will be captured on the CRF with the aid of an Irrigation Journal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>High-volume irrigation</title><p>High-volume systems consist of an irrigation bag connected to a tube. The water flows into the rectum, either by gravity or using a pump. Some systems employ a balloon to hold the device in place during irrigation; others require the patient to hold it in place. The mechanism of action is the same for all systems. Initial frequency of irrigation is the same as for low-volume irrigation; i.e. daily for 14&#x000a0;days, then alternate days. Patients will commence with irrigations of 300&#x000a0;ml and increase this by 100&#x000a0;ml every 2&#x000a0;days until satisfactory defaecation is achieved or the procedure becomes uncomfortable, up to a maximum of 1500&#x000a0;ml. Patients may adjust therapy depending on response, as for low-volume irrigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Switching between anal irrigation systems</title><p>After 3&#x000a0;months of using one system, patients may switch to the other or discontinue therapy and return to routine clinical care. This will be entirely patient-led, and reasons for changing systems will be explored during follow-up visits and captured on the CRF. There is, therefore, no defined protocol for switching treatments as patients may do this for any reason; analysis of time to switching/discontinuing therapy, as well as the patient-reported reasons for doing so, will provide insight into why each irrigation system is or is not successful. In addition, qualitative interviews with patients who have switched or discontinued therapy will be used to explore these issues more deeply.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Endpoints</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>Clinical endpoints</title><p>All clinical endpoints will be in common with a single standardised outcome framework (consistently used within all CapaCiTY programme studies).

PAC-QOL, the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) and the EuroQol Health Outcome measure (EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L) and the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) will additionally be collected at 1&#x000a0;month; this is to capture reasons for early nonresponse to therapy, as well as to better characterise the patient group and provide more data for economic analysis.

Potentially eligible patients will be identified either in clinic, from referral letters from GPs/other consultants to the constipation clinic, and from patients participating in CapaCiTY 01 who did not respond, or have ceased to respond, to habit training (HT)/biofeedback (HTBF). Participants will be provided with adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and risks of anal irrigation therapy and will take away or be posted an invitation letter and a Participant Information Sheet (PIS). Patients will be given at least 24&#x000a0;h to consider participation and invited to attend clinic for visit 1 (see below).</p><p>The study screening number will be allocated as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Study code 02</p></list-item><list-item><p>Site code &#x02013; three-letter code for each site</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participant Code &#x02013; four-digit code given consecutively and attributed at each site</p></list-item></list>

In the instance of new psychological issues being determined during consultation, referral for psychological support will be deferred until after completion of irrigation training. The exception to this rule would be where there is clinical concern regarding the patient&#x02019;s acute mental state requiring more urgent intervention (see &#x02018;Criteria for withdrawal from treatment&#x02019;). Concerns would be raised by the irrigation nurse team to the research team, and these would be evaluated by the principal investigator (PI) (or a medically trained deputy) and appropriate action taken. Further follow-up visits (V4&#x02013;V8) will be conducted by the research team. If the patient requires further input from the irrigation nurse this may be arranged as per local practices.

The same posters may be used to advertise the study via newspapers, trial websites, social media, and patient groups such as Bowel and Cancer Research charity.</p><p>Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) consultation with CC patients in secondary care has explored the acceptability of this study design, and we have found that this is likely to be acceptable to patients. The proposed rescue therapy and patient diaries/journals used in the study have been reviewed as part of this process. Care has been taken to ensure that the study design is patient-centred, with flexibility of laxative use incorporated into the protocol, as well as the option to switch treatment after 3&#x000a0;months. This aims to ensure that patient experience of the trial is similar to a nontrial patient in terms of treatment received, within the constraints of a randomised trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Study procedures</title><sec id="Sec45"><title>Screening, enrollment</title><p>A brief screening questionnaire will be used to determine whether patients meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see &#x02018;Eligibility&#x02019; above).

The need to collect data on frequency and volume of irrigation, as well as reasons for discontinuing or switching between systems, means that assessor blinding is not possible with respect to these outcomes. Those involved in the development of the statistical analysis plan (SAP) will not have access to any data that will lead them to become unblended and, therefore, they will remain blind. Any researcher collecting CRFs, handling journals or performing statistical analysis on the above outcomes will be unblinded. However, in order to control for observer bias, the primary outcome (PAC-QOL at 3&#x000a0;months) will be concealed; the patients will complete this questionnaire without a researcher present.

The purpose of INVEST in this study is to identify whether certain radio-physiological results correlate with treatment response, i.e. can we predict likelihood of benefitting from irrigation based on pretreatment investigations. Balloon sensory testing in combination with patient-reported urge to defaecate will be analysed as covariates to determine whether such a relationship is present.</p></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Concomitant medications</title><p>It is inevitable that patients will seek recourse to laxatives and other dietary supplements during the course of the programme. Experience shows that complete prohibition can lead to unreported laxative use, which might confound findings. Although we will strongly discourage ad libitum medication usage and specify a defined breakthrough regimen, we will record cotreatment with sufficient fidelity and integrity to enable use as covariates in analyses using a specific patient journal for this purpose (see &#x02018;Standardised outcome framework&#x02019;). A concomitant medications list, including a shortlist of contributory or confounding medications, will be used to filtre on data entry. Patients using one system in the medium/long term may wish to revert to the other system or pause treatment for a short period (for example, while going on holiday) for practical reasons. This is permitted but must be recorded in the concomitant medications log. This will not be considered as switching or ending treatments as it is only a short-term measure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Criteria for discontinuation</title><p>The interventions proposed are well-established in current clinical practice. There are no defined criteria for discontinuation; however, clinicians may withdraw treatment where they have therapeutic or safety concerns, consistent with routine care. Patients may choose to discontinue treatment at any point and return to routine clinical care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Procedure for collecting data including Case Report Forms (CRFs) and storage</title><p>The data collected for the trial will be a mixture of routinely collected data, verifiable against the medical record and patient-reported outcome (PRO) or questionnaire data, collected directly to CRF.</p><p>Each recruiting site will be required to keep accurate and verifiable source notes in the medical record relevant to each study participant&#x02019;s inclusion and continued participation in the study. Data will be collected, transferred and stored in accordance with GCP guidelines and data protection requirements. The PCTU standard operating procedures (SOPs) and study data management plan will define the exact process of data collection, transfer and storage and control of study data.</p><p>A secure online OpenClinica trial database will be provided by the PCTU to enable remote data entry at sites where this is feasible. This database will provide built-in data-validation checks with quality control (QC) checks performed by checking a predefined percentage of CRF data against data entered into the database. In addition, on-site monitoring will enable source document verification (SDV) of records.</p><p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including questionnaires and diaries, may be collected directly to the eCRF using a secure and controlled REDCap database. An automated email reminder will be sent to participants to remind them to complete the questionnaires and diaries every 12&#x000a0;weeks. Alternatively, participants can complete paper questionnaires and diaries to be entered by the central study team.</p><p>All patient-identifiable data, such as Consent Forms, screening and identification logs will be stored in the investigator site files in secure locked cabinets and/or offices, accessible only to delegated members of the study team.

Participants do not have to participate in both sets of interviews; a separate set of patients can be interviewed at 6&#x000a0;months. Recruitment can be extended if data saturation is not accomplished by the 35th patient. Data saturation is defined as the point at which no new or relevant themes emerge.

The codes will not indicate which treatment arm is which so that as far as possible the statistician will remain blind to allocation throughout the analysis. All analyses will be by the intention-to-treat principle. The primary outcome will be PAC-QOL as a continuous variable, analysed at 3&#x000a0;months while the quarantine period is in effect. The proportion of patients continuing with the initial therapy system will be recorded, and the PAC-QOL scores will be analysed using a linear mixed model with a random effect for centre and fixed effects for intervention, trial stratification variables (participants are stratified by sex and women by centre) and baseline PAC-QOL. Secondary outcomes will be analysed using the principles outlined above for the primary outcome.</p><p>Exploratory modelling will be conducted for baseline characteristics: measures of chronic pain, autonomic, joint hypermobility, cognitive, behavioural and mood variables share a common hypothesis that they are detrimental to the success of all treatments, i.e. they perpetuate illness in spite of therapy. We will investigate a maximum of three interactions between treatment and baseline characteristics. These will be described in the SAP a priori. Appropriate regression models, including interaction terms, will be developed to determine the influence of these pretreatment characteristics on the success of treatments in all WPs.</p><p>Life table data for any irrigation will be presented by initial therapy and for specific therapy from date of commencement.

However, the programme of WPs, and inclusion of time to failure data capture, provides a unique opportunity to construct probabilistic models exploring optimal pathways from effectiveness and cost-effectiveness perspectives.</p><p>Since patients will (within the CapaCiTY programme) be followed along a pathway that includes a series of steps of care, it will be possible to construct costs and outcomes for a range of patient pathways providing comparative longer-term cost-effectiveness estimates. Patient-level data from recruitment through the various WPs will be used to construct pragmatic, probabilistic models to explore optimal pathways from effectiveness and cost-effectiveness perspectives.</p><p>Analyses from NHS and societal perspectives will be supported by recording relevant resource use during each WP, and a common panel of outcomes.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec91"><title>Discussion</title><p>The CapaCiTY 02 study is a large and potentially very rich study in terms of hypothesis-testing and generating robust evidence. As previously noted, its primary aim of establishing superiority of one system of irrigation over another will provide valuable information that can be used to guide the choice of therapy in patients with CC. Additionally, the study aims to explore health economic outcomes, and will also evaluate the association between pretreatment baseline characteristics (e.g. psychological profile, joint hypermobility, colonic transit, anorectal physiology) and treatment success. Alongside these elements, a qualitative component of the study will explore the lived experiences of patients and health care professionals who are using irrigation, or training patients in its use.</p><p>The multisite nature of the study, along with the broad range of outcome measures being employed, could potentially lead to several practical challenges in implementing the study protocol. Attempts have been made to anticipate and address these before commencing study recruitment. Prestudy site feasibility questionnaires were circulated to all sites wishing to participate, and these were used to identify the key components of irrigation training and treatment at each site. The training process described in this protocol aims to be as applicable as possible to as broad a range of sites as feasible, without causing the study sites to make significant alterations to their standard practice.</p><p>The protocol also aims to be flexible as regards pretreatment investigations. These have been limited to anorectal physiology and a transit study (see section above: &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec36" ref-type="sec">INVEST</xref>&#x02019;). It was felt that these provided important information necessary for characterising patients before starting treatment, thereby allowing analysis of the relationship between pretreatment characteristics and treatment success. It was decided, as few sites had access to HRAM, that standard manometry was sufficient for the purposes of this study. This increased participation by allowing sites not in possession of the necessary high-resolution equipment to still recruit to the study.</p><p>It is recognised that the study design has several limitations. From a methodological perspective, the fact that neither participant nor assessor blinding was feasible (due to the nature of the treatment and the nature of the outcome data being collected), leads to the possibility of performance bias and reporting bias, as both participants and assessors will (consciously or unconsciously) have particular preconceived ideas about the likely efficacy of each system. Attempts have been made, from a methodological and operational perspective, to limit the impact of this. The fact that every patient receives treatment is important, as it is a reasonable assumption that the placebo effect for each system is similar, thereby meaning that any observed difference between systems is a genuine one. Additionally, the option of switching systems after 3&#x000a0;months is designed to allow participants who have not had success with their original system to try the other one. This means that patients do not spend too long on ineffective treatment, and also allows longer-term data (more than 3&#x000a0;months) to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment as a whole in the long term.</p><p>As can be seen from the &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec92" ref-type="sec">Trial status</xref>&#x02019; section below, recruitment nationally has fallen below the planned rate of recruitment. Several reasons for low recruitment have been identified through discussions with participating sites; these are mainly the result of variation in local practice (making the protocol difficult to implement), as well as service pressures and the pressure on research teams from doing more than one study in the CapaCiTY programme. This highlights the difficulties in implementing multisite studies, and even though attempts were made before study commencement to ensure sufficient flexibility in the proposed study design, problems have nonetheless been encountered.</p><p>Since recruitment has opened, recruitment rates at each study site are monitored and monthly meetings are held to discuss progress and to identify problems at an early stage. Teleconferences have been held with recruiting sites in order to discuss and resolve barriers to recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec92"><title>Trial status</title><p>As of 31 August 2016, the study has seven sites open to recruitment. The first patient was enrolled on 15 October 2015. Currently, 39 patients have been screened and 22 randomised. Of these, two have withdrawn (elective withdrawal &#x02013; no reason given).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec93"><p>

<bold>General</bold>
</p><p>This study (study 2 of the CapaCiTY programme) will be carried out in accordance with the ethical principles in the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care, Second Edition, 2005 and its subsequent amendments as applicable and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p><p>Ethics approval for the whole CapaCiTY programme (studies 1 to 3) has been sought from one of the London NRECs (London City and East). Within the programme, the three studies will be distinct studies and protocols, and thus consented separately. This is necessary to limit patient information which would otherwise be over-burdensome. The REC reference and IRAS number for CapaCiTY 02 are given below.</p><p>REC Reference 15/LO/0732.</p><p>IRAS 172401.</p><p>
<bold>Informed consent procedures</bold>
</p><p>Written informed consent will be obtained at visit 1 from research participants by an appropriately trained and delegated researcher in a face-to-face setting in clinic. For study Consent Forms, see Additional files <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> (quantitative study) and <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> (qualitative study).</p><p>
<bold>Ethical considerations</bold>
</p><p>The protocol has been reviewed by Professor Richard Ashcroft, Professor of Medical Ethics and Law at QMUL. Important considerations that have informed pragmatic design include (a) <italic>limitation of intimate examinations</italic>: to one time point (not repeated if performed before recruitment), (b) <italic>timings of outcomes</italic>: within this study outcomes will be undertaken at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months from the commencement of the first treatment for all patients, with additional recording of key outcome measures (PAC-QOL, PAC-SYM, EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L and EQ-VAS, Irrigation Journal and Patient Journal). For this period of 6&#x000a0;months, patients will not progress to further WPs thus preventing outcome &#x02018;contamination&#x02019;. Additionally there will be a 3-month &#x02018;quarantine&#x02019; from switching irrigation therapy. These delays are akin to that in usual NHS care, during which general supportive care will be provided. This proposed limitations at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months confers no disadvantage and may even represent an acceleration of treatment progression. Ethically, this is viewed as a reasonable trade-off for the commitment to the research programme, (c) <italic>recruitment and consent</italic>: study 2 represents one of the three studies incorporated in the NIHR-funded CapaCiTY programme. Although patients may move sequentially through treatments (and, therefore, studies) during the programme course, study 2 will be consented as a distinct single entity and (d) <italic>qualitative interviews</italic>: these will be in-depth interviews conducted one-on-one (plus a chaperone if requested by the patient) and, therefore, there are potential risks to the safety of the interviewer. Also, the thorough nature of the interviews could lead to psychological distress for the participant. It is, therefore, necessary to identify patients who would be at especially high risk in either of these ways and to exclude them from the study. Baseline assessment would identify and enable exclusion of individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders or a history of high-risk behaviours (self-harm, drug and alcohol addiction). Counselling and support from health care professionals involved in patient care will be available for any subject experiencing untoward distress.</p><p>
<bold>Protocol amendments</bold>
</p><p>In the event of a protocol amendment being required, details of the proposed amendment will be submitted to the sponsor initially for review and authorisation of submission as either a minor or substantial amendment. For substantial amendments, an IRAS amendment form, cover letter and all amended documents (along with a summary of changes) will be submitted to the REC for approval. Once approved, details of the amendments and any action required will be circulated to each participating site PI and local R&#x00026;D/CRN. The CI will submit all nonsubstantial/minor amendments to HRA for classification according to HRA guidelines, the results of which will be provided to participating site PI, R&#x00026;D and CRN as required.</p><p>
<bold>Confidentiality</bold>
</p><p>Information related to participants should be kept confidential and managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, NHS Caldecott Principles, The Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care, and the conditions of REC approval.</p><p>Identifiable information to be collected from the participants includes, full name, date of birth and hospital number and contact details at screening. This information will be used to contact participants but will not leave the study site without prior consent and approvals. All CRFs will be pseudonymised. The participant&#x02019;s GP will be informed of their participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</title><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to
