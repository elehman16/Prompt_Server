Danhong injection, a complementary alternative medicine for chronic stable angina, has been demonstrated to be effective in numerous studies and is widely prescribed to patients. However, the methodological quality of most prior studies was found to be, in general, low. Therefore, we designed this randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using Danhong injection to treat chronic stable angina.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a randomized multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive clinical trial. A total of 870 patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned into either the Danhong injection or the placebo group in a 2:1 ratio. Participants will then undergo a 2-week treatment regimen and a 76-day follow-up period. Because this is an adaptive trial, two interim analyses are prospectively planned. These will be performed after one-third and two-thirds of the patients, respectively, have completed the trial. Based on the results of these interim analyses, a data monitoring committee will determine how to modify aspects of the study without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients who show a clinically significant change, which is defined as at least a 20-point improvement in angina frequency score on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, which will be administered on day 30. Other secondary efficacy and safety outcomes will also be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will provide high-quality evidence regarding the use of Danhong injection to treat chronic stable angina.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01681316?id=NCT01681316&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01681316</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chinese medicine</kwd><kwd>Chronic stable angina</kwd><kwd>Danhong injection</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Stable ischaemic heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and is associated with a substantial and annually increasing burden on individuals and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the USA, the overall rate of death attributable to cardiovascular disease in 2010 was 235.5 per 100,000, and the total number of inpatient cardiovascular operations and procedures increased by 28&#x000a0;%, from 5,939,000 in 2000 to 7,588,000 in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As one of the most common types of stable ischaemic heart disease, chronic stable angina is characterized by recurrent chest pain or pressure, known as angina, which is exacerbated by activity or stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the continued exploration of myocardial revascularization procedures, preventive therapies, including lifestyle interventions, risk factor modification, antiplatelet therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blocker therapy, and newer anti-anginal drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], some patients still experience cardiovascular events, and the proportion of patients whose quality of life is impaired by the frequent symptoms of this condition remains high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is thought to be associated with the undesirable side-effects of anti-anginal therapies, which include secondary nitrate lipid lapse, aspirin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and coronary microvascular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to investigate the role of complementary and alternative medicines in the treatment of angina pectoris. Indeed, 64&#x000a0;% of patients with cardiovascular disease who were surveyed in the USA tended to use complementary and alternative medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], including Chinese medicines. Chinese medicines have been used in therapeutic approaches in East Asia for over two millennia. In China, Chinese patent medicines are prevalent and are commonly used as an alternative to Western medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Evidence has accumulated regarding the efficacy of Chinese medicines in treating angina pectoris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As a Chinese patent medicine, Danhong injection, which is extracted from Danshen (<italic>Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae</italic>) and Honghua (<italic>Flos carthami</italic>), is widely prescribed to patients with coronary heart disease. Danhong injection, the profile of which has been analyzed using HPLC, is certified as a Chinese medicinal product by the China Food and Drug Administration. A number of previous studies, from the bench to the bedside, have suggested that the pharmacological mechanisms of Danhong injection might involve anti-inflammatory activity, anti-atherosclerotic activity, and the activation of blood circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Several clinical studies have also demonstrated that Danhong injection might be an effective and safe treatment option for the management of coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>However, the methodological quality of most previous studies was assessed to be, in general, low. No critically appraised evidence, such as a well-designed randomized controlled trial, is available to provide a high level of evidence to justify the clinical use and recommendation of Danhong injection. In this study, we will conduct a randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of Danhong injection in patients with chronic stable angina.

Patients with chronic stable angina will be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, to identify eligible participants. The patients will be thoroughly informed regarding the details of the study and its potential benefits and risks. Participants will be included only if they meet the inclusion criteria and willingly agree to provide written informed consent. This study is being conducted at dozens of hospitals across China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>According to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the proportion of patients who experienced a clinically significant change that was defined as at least a 20-point improvement in a score on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire angina frequency was 30&#x000a0;% after one month of standard conventional therapy. In this trial, we adopted an adaptive design, which involved using the statistical sample size calculation software EAST5.2. It is hypothesized that an increase of at least 10&#x000a0;% is clinically significant for the Danhong injection group; therefore, the number of subjects required is initially estimated to be 726 (one-sided test, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15). To allow for a 20&#x000a0;% dropout rate, a total of 870 patients will therefore be recruited. Because patients will be randomized into the Danhong injection group or the control group in a ratio of 2:1, the number of participants in the Danhong injection group will be 582 and the number in the control group will be 288. According to the adaptive design, the sample size can be adjusted based on the results of two interim analyses, which will be performed after one-third (288) and two-thirds (582) of the patients have completed the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomization</title><p>All eligible patients who consent to participation will be randomized into either the Danhong injection or the placebo group in a 2:1 ratio. Randomization will be conducted using a clinical information management system (Brightech, Somerset, USA). This system automatically randomizes patients and generates a randomization number with a message noting their assigned treatment. In addition, randomization will be stratified based on whether a patient received standard conventional therapy for more than 1&#x000a0;week prior to study initiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Blinding</title><p>Participants and research personnel will be blinded to Danhong injection therapy or placebo treatment group assignments until the study has concluded. Because the colour of Danhong injection and 0.9&#x000a0;% saline are different, the dropping bottles will be wrapped in sealed shaded bags, and brown infusion devices will be used for infusion. These procedures will be implemented by two professional nurses who will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement before study initiation and not to contact each other. One of the professional nurses will be in charge of preparing the drugs in a special transfusion room and sealing the infusion bottles with shaded brown bags. The other nurse will take the prepared drugs from the transfusion room to the infusion nurse and supervise the infusion process to ensure that the allocation of the drugs is blinded to the patients (the shaded brown bags will not be unwrapped during infusion and will be checked for integrity after infusion).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Interventions</title><p>Standard conventional therapy will be provided to all of the included participants throughout the trial, in strict accordance with the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Stable Angina (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

If the angina persists after three doses, the patient should be transported to hospital immediately for further medical treatment. Patients will be asked to record the details of administration times, the number of doses and the dosages of nitroglycerin in a patient diary, which will be collected by the investigators at a subsequent study visit.</p><p>Concomitant medications that are deemed necessary to manage any serious underlying disease will be allowed during the study and should be recorded in a patient&#x02019;s medical records and case report forms.

However, it has been suggested, controversially, that the principle of a randomized controlled trial goes against the doctrine of traditional Chinese medicine as personalized medicine. There are several drawbacks in the methodological quality of most Chinese medicine trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These include inadequate randomization, a lack of double blinding, non-placebo controls and incomplete outcome data. All of these lead to various biases that can weaken the credibility of the evidence.</p><p>There are several strengths in the methodological design and interventions described in this study. First, this is the first rigorously designed randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Danhong injection for chronic stable angina. Although a number of trials on Danhong injection have been published, there is a lack of well-designed trials that examine the efficacy of Danhong injection for the management of chronic stable angina. In this study, a central online randomization system is used for random sequence generation and allocation concealment, which might avoid potential selection bias. The blinding of both the participants and the study personnel and the blinding of outcome assessments are used to reduce the potential for performance bias and detection bias, respectively. Most previously published randomized controlled trials lack a placebo control. We understand that some critical characteristics of commonly used herbal medicines and Chinese patent medicines, such as colour, appearance, odour, and other properties, restrict the wide application of placebo controls in Chinese medicine studies. However, placebo control is strictly implemented in our study. The dosage form of an injection has a remarkable placebo effect. We employ wrapped dropping bottles and brown transfusion devices to facilitate a placebo control. Thus, the treatment appears to be identical between the Danhong injection and placebo groups. We assume that a potential placebo effect can be excluded in our study. An add-on study design is also applied in this trial, which can be summarized as an &#x02018;A&#x02009;+&#x02009;B versus B&#x02019; model. In this model, participants are randomized to receive either intervention A combined with intervention B or intervention B alone. This method is widely used in Chinese medicine studies, where Chinese medicine is added to a conventional treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, the effect of Chinese medicine therapy will be exaggerated if no rigorous control is used to exclude a placebo effect. In view of this, we designed and implemented the study in a scientific, strict and cautious manner to provide reliable evidence regarding the use of Danhong injection as a complementary therapy for treating chronic stable angina. Finally, in this trial, we also adopted an adaptive design, which is defined as a study that includes a prospectively planned opportunity for the modification of one or more specified aspects of the study design and hypotheses based on the analysis of accumulating data (usually interim data) from subjects in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This method will make the study more efficient (e.g., have a shorter duration or include fewer patients) and is more likely to demonstrate an effect of the drug if one exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Second, the outcome measures in our study are patient-centred. Currently, the assessment of treatment efficacy is being transformed from a traditional doctor-reported outcome model to a patient-reported outcome model, indicating that more attention is being paid to the quality of life of the patients and the relief of symptoms. Guidelines for the management of chronic stable angina also recommend that the treatment goal should include the relief of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Traditional Chinese medicine has been suggested as a promising option for alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life. Therefore, we use changes in Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores and traditional Chinese medicine syndrome scores as our outcome measures because they both focus on patient symptoms. This will help us to provide reliable and convincing evidence for the efficacy of Danhong injection.</p><p>Finally, another key point of this study is that the study drug has substantial therapeutic value in real-world clinical practice. It has been proposed that blood stasis syndrome (<italic>Xueyu Zheng</italic>) is the most common type of chronic stable angina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A recently published review also demonstrated that Chinese patent medicines that promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis, when used as adjunctive treatments for routine anti-anginal therapy, play an active role in reducing the incidence of primary endpoint events, decreasing anginal attack rates, and improving electrocardiogram results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Danhong injection is a certified Chinese medicinal product that is extracted from Danshen (<italic>Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae</italic>) and Honghua (<italic>Flos carthami</italic>). According to the basic theory of Chinese medicine, Danhong injection can produce a remarkable curative effect by promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Moreover, numerous studies, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, have validated the vascular protective effects of Danhong injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Based on the theoretical and clinical evidence mentioned previously, Danhong injection is regarded as a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of chronic stable angina.</p><p>However, there are also several limitations in this study. One of the major drawbacks lies in the lack of assessment of Danhong injection&#x02019;s long-term effects on primary outcome measures. In our study, the follow-up period is only 76&#x000a0;days, which is relatively short. Owing to the short length of the follow-up period and limitations on our budget, the potential role of Danhong injection in reducing major vascular events and overall mortality over the long term will remain unknown. In addition, although an add-on study design and a placebo control will be applied in our study to interpret the complementary effect of Danhong injection, we will still be unable to draw a definite conclusion over whether Danhong injection can serve as an alternative therapy for chronic stable angina because we do not use a &#x02018;head-to-head&#x02019; design. Therefore, well-designed randomized controlled trials that compare Danhong injection with conventional anti-anginal therapies and that have longer follow-up periods are needed in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study began recruiting patients in 2012.
