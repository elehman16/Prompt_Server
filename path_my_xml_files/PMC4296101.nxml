In Portugal, breast cancer-related mortality incidence reaches 1500 women every year [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer is essential to decrease its associated mortality rate, and mass screening is recommended by the medical community [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Mammography</title><p>Mammography is currently considered the best imaging technique for breast cancer screening [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the most effective tool for the early detection of this disease, helping reduce mortality and increasing treatment options [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to its importance, not only for screening but also for diagnosis, intervention, and follow-up [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], mammography has undergone constant improvements to enhance its diagnostic quality, namely in image acquisition, equipment design and components, and technical parameters [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Also, other diagnostic technologies are being developed such as breast tomosynthesis, which aims to reduce or eliminate the tissue overlapping effect thus detecting lesions with higher sensitivity [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Radiographer Role</title><p>Radiographers play an important role in the performance of mammographic examinations; their knowledge requirements go beyond radiation exposure, positioning techniques, and other characteristics of the equipment used [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Radiographers are part of a multidisciplinary team, both during screening or diagnosis and intervention, allowing them to be aware of the clinical information as well as previous breast exams of the patient [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, it is important that the radiographer establishes direct contact with the radiologist in order to contribute to a proper diagnosis. Together with the radiologist, the radiographer is responsible for image quality assurance; the availability, accessibility, and interpretation of mammographic images; and for the performance of additional imaging, preoperative localization, and biopsy techniques [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Beyond these technical issues, radiographers are usually the first professionals to have face-to-face contact with women in primary health care, during breast cancer screening. Therefore, they should be able to provide the patient with sound answers regarding the examination and the implications of the results [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. According to the European Society of Breast Cancer Statistics (EUSOMA) recommendations [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the correct understanding of senology concepts such as breast cancer statistics and family history, and knowledge of breast disease symptoms and treatment options are critical. Further, radiographers require a fair degree of sensitivity since mammography causes considerable anxiety in most women [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>This extended role could contribute to decreasing the mortality rate of breast cancer and thus reducing health care needs [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In this context, the knowledge of senology concepts is essential to the health professional, highly considered in some countries (such as in England, Denmark, Australia, and United States) [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Unlike the aforementioned countries, breast cancer screening in Portugal is not fully organized by the government but by a private institution [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This may be one of the reasons why there are no existing specific training programs and the role of the radiographer is not as differentiated and valued as elsewhere. Hence, the need for continuing education for Portuguese radiographers in this area is critical.</p></sec><sec><title>E-Learning in Health Care</title><p>Continuing education is known to improve the performance of professionals, providing better health care services [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, the National Health Service University identified e-learning as a central strategic delivery mechanism for all its professionals [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several studies [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have shown that radiographers are receptive to new technologies and training and are able to upgrade their skills and extend their role.</p><p>The asynchronous ability, cost-savings, personalized learning, increased accessibility, ease of distribution, and updated content are some examples of e-learning advantages [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, time constraints and the difficulty of &#x0201c;ease of use&#x0201d; are commonly pointed out as drawbacks [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>With the development of new information technology, there is a surplus of software that can be used to implement e-learning systems, ranging from websites and email to blogs, wikis, and discussion forums [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Dedicated Learning Management Systems (LMS) support the planning, organization, and access control of specific learning processes. In radiology, there are some LMS technologies that improve collaboration, interactivity, simulation, and self-testing [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. E-learning is therefore a useful tool helping not only students but also professionals move towards a vision of lifelong and continuous education [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>E-Learning Evaluation</title><p>The potential of e-learning may not always translate into significant improvements in educational outcomes [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For this reason, e-learning needs to be justified by its effectiveness and relevance [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. One important method for evaluating a learning system is the framework developed by Kirkpatrick [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which consists of four categories: learner perception, knowledge, behavior, and impact on organization.</p><p>Most of the studies on the evaluation of e-learning processes rely on users&#x02019; satisfaction and knowledge [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although some authors believe that there is no evidence that learners learn more from e-learning than traditional learning, it is acknowledged that they can learn more effectively [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. E-learning combined with traditional learning&#x02014;that is, blended learning, or b-learning&#x02014;is considered the best way to obtain higher knowledge gain [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Using pre- and post-knowledge tests within an experimental study, if the experimental group performs better than the control group, the e-learning system can be identified as the cause of the improvement [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. According to certain authors [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], there is a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in research on e-learning, despite RCTs being considered the best way to assess e-learning efficacy and effectiveness. Therefore, RCTs are recommended for evaluating e-learning systems [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>One of the most cited questionnaires for user satisfaction with e-learning [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] considers four dimensions of the e-learner satisfaction measurement: content, learner interface, personalization, and learning community. From these dimensions, the tool specifies 26 items using a 7-point Likert scale (ranging from &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;), although the last two questions actually reflect global measures related to overall satisfaction and overall success of the e-learning system. Globally, the questionnaire has presented reliability (Cronbach alpha) of .95 [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The work presented in the following sections aims to provide a new easy-to-use e-learning course, thus contributing to senology teaching, while emphasizing continuing education and professional development.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>In this context, our research question is whether an e-learning system improves the senology knowledge of radiographers and radiology students. The objectives of this work include knowledge promotion and understanding of all aspects of breast illness and patient care required by radiographers. To achieve this, we proposed to (1) develop an easy-to-use course in e-learning environment, (2) assess its efficacy and effectiveness, and (3) assess the satisfaction of users.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>An asynchronous e-learning course on breast imaging for radiographers was developed and evaluated for its efficacy, effectiveness, and satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Target Population and Sample Strategy</title><p>The target population in this study was all radiographers working at public health institutions in Porto&#x02019;s metropolitan area, in Portugal, with ability to perform mammographic exams, and all radiography students attending the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> years of the radiology course at the School of Allied Health Science, Porto Polytechnic Institute who already had mammography training.
</p><p>Hence the sample was stratified by professional status into two groups: students and radiographers, who were invited by email to participate in the study, after an individual request.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>All radiographers and students included in the study were asked to perform the pre-knowledge test. Randomization was performed with the population elements in each stratum who accepted and effectively took the pretest. Therefore, 50% of the elements of each stratum were randomly allocated to the intervention group and contacted to participate in the course, after being properly informed of the randomization process. The remaining sample was allocated to the control group and afterward contacted to participate in a second test.</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation</title><p>The communication with all participants was performed mainly by email (maximum three attempts) as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The intervention group was contacted in order to perform the e-learning course, and a similar process to the pretest enrollment occurred. Private asynchronous access was given during a 20-day period to those who agreed to do the course. Then, a final assessment test was delivered, to be answered within 5 days. Those who discontinued the intervention were requested nonetheless to perform the posttest, to allow an intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p>The control group was contacted 41 days after randomization to perform another test. During this period, neither radiographers nor students allocated to the control group had any formal educational activity concerning senology lectures given by our research team and were asked to answer tests in an honest manner, without consulting external sources, which could in the future evolve into a clear accreditation process [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The course was created and revised between October 2011 and January 2012.

Overall improvement was observed and attributed to the course.</p><p>Although the effect was not clear in students, we found differences in post-knowledge test results between the intervention and control groups, whereas such differences were absent in the pre-knowledge test. This result could be explained by the smaller sample size or higher proportion of individuals lost to follow-up, which could have resulted from being enrolled in other learning activities at the same time during the academic year. In addition, students were probably more prone to self-learning from other sources, or there was interest from students in the control group in learning more after performing the pre-knowledge test.</p><p>Regarding radiographers, those who were allocated to the intervention group significantly improved more than the controls did, which supports the importance of continuing education throughout their working lives.</p><p>The per-protocol analysis enhanced the influence of the course, exposing a significant effect on the students&#x02019; stratum. Considering that the real course effect is probably in between the two statistical analyses, we can conclude that this randomized controlled trial showed that the e-learning course improved the knowledge of those who attended (even if only part of) the intervention.</p><p>Overall, the developed course is efficacious, especially for radiographers, which highlights the need for continuing education, foreseeing also e-learning as an increasingly viable complement to the traditional method, especially since the technologies involved do not need heavy hosting requirements. This study also proved that the course is effective, since only 10% of the learners dropped out. Moreover, the course showed to have a high level of satisfaction, for both radiographers and students.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Since it was not possible to find in the literature any satisfaction questionnaire for e-learning systems in Portuguese, the validity of this satisfaction evaluation should be carefully considered, given the translation. A validation of the questionnaire used in this work could be a future project.</p><p>Another limitation of this work is the single learning institute with moderate sample size, affecting the generalizability of the results.</p><p>Another restraint is related to the learning and evaluation strategy, since we faced the risk of individuals resorting to external sources in order to provide correct answers to the tests. This situation creates a slight bias that is difficult to control considering the study design.</p><p>Nevertheless, randomization was performed after completing the pre-knowledge test, which yielded that the same willingness of participants to enter the study was demonstrated, regardless of the group where they were allocated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Globally, this study underlines the importance of the radiographer as the health care professional who interacts first with women during the breast cancer screening process. We consider the high rate of participation an important aspect in our study (57% of radiographers and 56% of students), which reflects the great interest shown by these professionals to participate in scientific research, thereby promoting their professional category. They took advantage of learning opportunities, which shows that they are health care professionals committed to responding to the constant challenges of the profession.</p><p>This study contributes to the Portuguese radiographers&#x02019; continuing education, since we did not find any similar course related to breast imaging. It would be interesting to conduct additional assessments to demonstrate effective consolidation of knowledge gain. Future developments may include collaborative activities; for this first assessment, we believe such activities would confound the efficacy results.</p><p>Our main finding illustrates the knowledge improvement in senology that our e-learning course gave radiographers. We believe that this study highlights the importance of e-learning as a training platform, especially in light of budget constraints associated with the current economic climate. E-learning should be considered for continuing education, and directors should invest in it to improve the skills of their professionals and consequently enhance health care services [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was done while the first author was a student in the Master&#x02019;s program in Medical Informatics at the Faculties of Medicine and Sciences of the University of Porto which kindly supported this publication.</p><p>The authors would also like to thank S Jo&#x000e3;o Hospital Center, Radiology Department and Breast Unit, for the approval of images for the course, and to the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto for hosting the course website.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p>Authors' Contributions: All the authors have made a significant contribution to this manuscript and have approved the final paper, thus meeting the criteria for authorship.
