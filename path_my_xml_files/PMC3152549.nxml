An over mortality of about 10 percent could result from additional lung injury and inflammation due to the life-support mechanical ventilation, which stretches the lung. It has been recently demonstrated, in vitro, that pharmacological activation of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptors (&#x003b1;7-nAChR) could down regulate intracellular mediators involved in lung cell inflammatory response to stretch. Our aim was to test in vivo the protective effect of the pharmacological activation of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR against ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Anesthetized rats were ventilated for two hours with a high stretch ventilation mode delivering a stroke volume large enough to generate 25-cmH<sub>2</sub>O airway pressure, and randomly assigned to four groups: pretreated with parenteral injection of saline or specific agonist of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR (PNU-282987), or submitted to bilateral vagus nerve electrostimulation while pre-treated or not with the &#x003b1;7-nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA). Controls ventilated with a conventional stroke volume of 10 mL/kg gave reference data. Physiological indices (compliance of the respiratory system, lung weight, blood oxygenation, arterial blood pressure) and lung contents of inflammatory mediators (IL-6 measured by ELISA, substance P assessed using HPLC) were severely impaired after two hours of high stretch ventilation (sham group). Vagal stimulation was able to maintain the respiratory parameters close to those obtained in Controls and reduced lung inflammation except when associated to nicotinic receptor blockade (MLA), suggesting the involvement of &#x003b1;7-nAChR in vagally-mediated protection against VILI. Pharmacological pre-treatment with PNU-282987 strongly decreased lung injury and lung IL-6 and substance P contents, and nearly abolished the increase in plasmatic IL-6 levels. Pathological examination of the lungs confirmed the physiological differences observed between the groups. In conclusion, these data suggest that the stimulation of &#x003b1;7-nAChR is able to attenuate VILI in rats.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanical ventilation is the main life-sustaining tool in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), but even low tidal volume strategies may cause the undesirable side-effects of cyclic hyper-inflation of some lung areas <xref rid="pone.0022386-Terragni1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Hyper-inflation of these areas exposes the lung to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) which is characterized by increased endothelial and epithelial permeability and inflammatory processes <xref rid="pone.0022386-Dreyfuss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Therefore, protection against VILI appears essential.</p><p>Inflammatory processes involving lung cytokines could play a major role in VILI. One of the systems regulating cytokine release is the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (&#x003b1;7-nAChR). These receptors are expressed on macrophages and epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0022386-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and can be activated by acetylcholine released from efferent vagal endings. The anti-inflammatory effect of the vagally-mediated cholinergic pathway has been tested either in septic and non septic models <xref rid="pone.0022386-Pavlov1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0022386-Sykes1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

In endotoxinic rats, Bernik et al. have reported that vagal electrical stimulation was unable to reduce pulmonary tumor necrosis factor synthesis whereas a significant reduction was observed in serum and myocardium <xref rid="pone.0022386-Bernik1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. By contrast, data from Su et al. in mice exposed to acid-induced acute lung injury or to Escherichia coli-induced lung injury strongly suggest an anti-inflammatory effect of the vagally-mediated cholinergic pathway at the lung level <xref rid="pone.0022386-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022386-Su2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. As for VILI, we found only one in vivo report which supposes the existence of an interaction between stretch-induced lung cytokine release (20 mL/kg tidal volume) and the vagal anti-inflammatory pathway <xref rid="pone.0022386-DosSantos1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In this above mentioned report, additional in vitro experiments have also shown that specific agonist or antagonist of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR acts on the intracellular mediators involved in cell inflammatory response to stretch such as pJNK (pro-inflammatory) and Fas, Daxx, pJNK and Bad (pro-apoptotic) <xref rid="pone.0022386-DosSantos1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the protective effect of &#x003b1;7-nAChR activation against VILI still remains to be assessed in vivo.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess, in a rat model of single-hit VILI, whether a pre-treatment with an agonist of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR could attenuate the ventilator-induced impairment in lung function. Furthermore, we examined whether improvement, if any, was associated to a lower inflammatory response. We exposed a group of rats to high stretch mechanical ventilation (HV) at a stroke volume large enough to generate 25-cmH<sub>2</sub>O airway pressure. In other groups, the same ventilation setting was applied either during vagal electrostimulation or after pre-treatment with the specific agonist of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR, PNU-282987. The airway pressure and arterial blood gases were measured during the experiments. The respiratory system compliance was measured at the end, completed by further lung pathological examination and lung IL-6 and substance P assays. Our data show that the stimulation of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR was able to prevent lung impairment in this animal model of VILI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>The experiments and protocols we used were in accordance with the European law and its French version laid out in statutory requirements for alive animal experiments (<italic>articles R214-87</italic> to <italic>R215-10</italic> of <italic>Code Rural</italic>, law #<italic>76-629</italic> from July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1976<italic>/</italic>law <italic>#2001-464</italic> from May 29<sup>th</sup>, 2001 (published in <italic>JORF</italic> on May 31<sup>st</sup>, 2001).

Vagal stimulation started 10 min before the beginning of mechanical ventilation and went on for the first ten minutes of non injurious ventilation. Thereafter, vagal stimulation was performed repeatedly for 10 min-periods with stimulation alternating with 10-min periods without stimulation, to avoid nerve damage by prolonged electrical stimulation. The effectiveness of the vagal stimulation was attested by the characteristic transient bradycardia and hypotension, named &#x02018;vagal escape&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0022386-Campos1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022386.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

When the 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O Paw level had been reached, no further increase in Paw could be detected during vagal stimulation, probably because of the strong distension of airways and of an overlap of pressure levels (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022386.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Continuous monitoring</title><p>As indexes of lung function impairment, a decrease in blood oxygenation was expected on repeated arterial blood gas analyses (Radiometer ABL 330, Copenhagen) and a Paw increase was checked on the continuous monitoring (Gould TA 4000, Ballinviliers, France).

In this model, vagal electro-stimulation or pre-treatment with a selective agonist of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR, limited largely these consequences. Conversely, after blockade of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR, vagal stimulation failed to protect and lung damage was even more intense. These results confirm the existence of a vagally mediated reduction in VILI through the cholinergic nicotinic pathway. Besides, by using a uniformly designed experiment in rats, we originally demonstrate in vivo the preventive effect of a pre-treatment with a &#x003b1;7-nAChR agonist.</p><p>The involvement of the &#x003b1;7-nAchR has been recently demonstrated in vitro in a study showing reduction in cell stretch-induced inflammation and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0022386-DosSantos1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We reinforced its findings by demonstrating that activation of the &#x003b1;7-nAchR by a specific agonist can prevent impairment in lung function and inflammation provoked by lung stretch in vivo. Surprisingly, the protection reported here with the &#x003b1;7-nAchR agonist was nearly complete, whereas it was only mitigated with a global pharmacological activation of the vagus nerve in mice <xref rid="pone.0022386-DosSantos1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Such a more intense effect could be due in part to our different animal model (rats), to the avoidance of hypocapnia, which is known to favor VILI <xref rid="pone.0022386-Laffey1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and to our shorter length of exposition to high stretch ventilation (two versus three hours). Although we didn&#x02019;t demonstrate or study it here, the specific &#x003b1;7-nAchR activation with PNU-282987 was perhaps more powerful than with a global vagomimetic drug such as CNI-1493 <xref rid="pone.0022386-Oke1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. One may however wonder about PNU-282987 efficiency over the study period since its half life has not yet been reported in rats following intraperitoneal injection. We think it unlikely that PNU-282987 had become fully inactive after two hours, because it has a high affinity for the &#x003b1;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and its half life value in vitro is &#x0003e;120 minutes <xref rid="pone.0022386-Wishka1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Since IL-6 concentrations were a hundred-fold higher in lung than in plasma, it is highly likely that IL-6 was mainly lung borne. The similar plasma concentrations of IL-6 observed in the HV<sub>25</sub>-sham and HV<sub>25</sub>-stim groups may result from a peripheral production in response to the cardio-vascular deterioration due to high thoracic pressures, with subsequent tissue hypoperfusion. The &#x003b1;7-nAChR agonist injected into the systemic circulation seemed able to decrease the IL-6 production in the whole organism, perhaps because of a better hemodynamics, or because of a down-regulation applied to the whole organism in opposition to the vagal stimulation which should have released acetylcholine into the thoraco-abdominal organs only.</p><p>Because there is a large spread of vagal innervation into the lung <xref rid="pone.0022386-elBermanial1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, acetylcholine can be released from efferent vagus nerves all along the respiratory system, from the trachea to the respiratory bronchioles. Some reports demonstrate that &#x003b1;7-nAChR are expressed by various non-neuronal cells <xref rid="pone.0022386-Grando1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022386-Kawashima1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, especially lung macrophages and alveolar type II cells <xref rid="pone.0022386-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, these cells being thus the possible targets for acetylcholine binding. Some inhibitory signaling pathways have been experimentally highlighted suggesting how activation of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR may downregulate inflammation. For instance, in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, activation of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR by nicotine suppressed NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation and I-&#x003ba;B phosphorylation, and, in mouse macrophages previously activated by intestinal manipulation, the acetylcholine released during vagus nerve stimulation activated the inflammation-inhibitory JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Both experimental situations resulted in downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 <xref rid="pone.0022386-deJonge1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022386-Yoshikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022386-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In the present work, global vagal stimulation or specific pharmacological activation of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR minimized the adverse effects of high stretch ventilation and strongly decreased lung IL-6 and SP contents. IL-6 has been known to be downregulated by the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway since the princeps article of Borovikova et al. <xref rid="pone.0022386-Borovikova1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. On the other hand, SP is a well known inflammatory mediator. Whether &#x003b1;7-nAChR directly interacts with SP would need specific studies and has not been assessed in the present work. A link has been shown between SP and cytokines in human blood monocytes, SP activating the production of cytokines, especially IL-6 <xref rid="pone.0022386-Lotz1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Reciprocally, cytokines injected into the lung (especially IL-1 beta but possibly IL-6), can activate SP containing C-fibers <xref rid="pone.0022386-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022386-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Therefore, the &#x003b1;7-nAChR activation could decrease indirectly the SP amounts through a lower cytokine release by the cells expressing this receptor.</p><p>The reduction in stretch-induced lung damage measurable both on the physiological and pathological levels could result partly from the inhibition of cytokine/SP release, but not only. As discussed above, the less pronounced fall in blood pressure of the animals receiving PNU may have favored less cytokine release (especially in plasma). In this group, a preservation of cardiovascular function, as suggested from blood pressure, heart rate, and pH data, may also have contributed to lower lung weight. On the other hand, the knowledge of biological and functional effects of &#x003b1;7-nAChR activation is only starting. Some reports suggest its involvement in systemic vascular tone <xref rid="pone.0022386-Si1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> or pulmonary vascular permeability <xref rid="pone.0022386-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The possibility of a beneficial effect of &#x003b1;7-nAChR activation, for example on pulmonary perfusion, vascular permeability or cardio-vascular tone, cannot be discarded. In the HV<sub>25</sub>-stim group, some degree of lung injury remained: there was a larger range of lung weight values and a persistency of lung pathological abnormalities. Despite the fact that crude lung weight is not a very sensible index, it was corroborated by data on compliance and pathological findings. In the HV<sub>25</sub>-stim group, repeated periods of bradycardia and hypotension may have induced heart failure, which could have generated some degree of lung edema and only partial protection against inflammation. In this group, the cardiovascular consequences of vagal stimulation were probably underestimated because we recorded the heart rate and arterial pressure values once vagal stimulation had been stopped. This could explain the significantly lower pH value at 60 minutes in this group (metabolic acidosis). In addition, a specific inflammatory effect of vagal stimulation on airways could have contributed to the lung inflammation in this group <xref rid="pone.0022386-Lotvall1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> explaining the incomplete protection with regard to inflammation.</p><p>The idea of a strong protective role of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR was reinforced by the observation of a worsening in lung damage when vagal stimulation was preceded by &#x003b1;7-nAChR blockade with MLA. The reasons for such a worsening can only be speculative. We previously reported that the vagus nerve participates in lung SP release and injury during high stretch ventilation <xref rid="pone.0022386-Bregeon2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The stimulation of the whole vagus nerve releases SP retrogradely from afferent C-fibers <xref rid="pone.0022386-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022386-Lundberg1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and, orthodromically, acetylcholine from efferent fibers <xref rid="pone.0022386-elBermanial1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It is possible that, in the HV<sub>25</sub>-stim group, the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway had downregulated the stretch-induced inflammatory response since the &#x003b1;7-nAChR were reachable. With &#x003b1;7-nAChR blockade coupled to vagal stimulation, a possible vagally-mediated SP increase may have increased inflammation <xref rid="pone.0022386-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Because lung SP amounts may result both from neurogenic (vagal) and non-neurogenic (immune cells) sources, it is not surprising that lung SP was reduced in the HV<sub>25</sub>-stim group given the anti-inflammatory effect of the cholinergic pathway. MLA can also inhibit a population of non- &#x003b1;7-nAChR such as &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;2-nAChR <xref rid="pone.0022386-Klink1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, which has also been involved in anti-inflammatory processes <xref rid="pone.0022386-Hosur1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The fact that the enhanced injury observed in the HV<sub>25</sub>-stim /MLA group could result partly from the blockade of these other receptors should therefore not be discarded. Another possible explanation for worsening in the HV<sub>25</sub>-stim/MLA group is based on basic physiological knowledge: heart activity depends on the balance between the inhibitory effects of the parasympathetic innervation and the stimulatory effects of the sympathetic innervation. The &#x003b1;7-nAChR also mediates autonomic ganglionic transmission <xref rid="pone.0022386-DeKoninck1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and its blockade can prevent increase in sympathetic cardio-vascular activity <xref rid="pone.0022386-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, in our experiment, the reported premature deaths with cardio-circulatory failure in the HV<sub>25</sub>-stim/MLA group could result from the inability of the sympathetic system to counterbalance the vagally-induced inotropic and bathmotropic negative effects, as suggested by the bradycardia reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022386-g005">figure 5</xref>. The half life of MLA being about 20 minutes in rats after intravenous injection <xref rid="pone.0022386-Turek1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, we think it likely that efficient concentrations of this drug were still present in the plasma of the HV<sub>25</sub>-stim/MLA group at the time of death, occurring at twice the half life.</p><p>The present study confirms the previously suggested modulation of lung inflammation by the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in the lungs exposed to VILI. Selective pharmacological stimulation of the &#x003b1;7-nAChR appears efficient in preventing VILI and might be a new pharmacological target, especially in ARDS patients at risk for ventilator associated injury. However, further experiments with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and applied to larger animal models would be required to confirm the benefits observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022386.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
