The present study investigated the effect of different maternity home practices in St. Petersburg, Russia, as well as of physiological breast engorgement and maternal mood, on milk production in primi- and multiparous women on day four. The amount of milk was studied in relation to the duration of "nearly exclusive" breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>176 mother-infant pairs were randomised into four groups according to an experimental <italic>two-factor design </italic>taking into account infant <italic>location </italic>and <italic>apparel</italic>. Data were recorded in the delivery ward at 25&#x02013;120 minutes postpartum and later in the maternity ward. Group I infants (n = 37) were placed skin-to-skin in the delivery ward while Group II infants (n = 40) were dressed and placed in their mother's arms. Both groups later roomed-in in the maternity ward. These infants had the possibility of early suckling during two hours postpartum. Group III infants (n = 38) were kept in a cot in the delivery and maternity ward nurseries with no rooming-in. Group IV infants (n = 38) were kept in a cot in a delivery ward nursery and later roomed-in in the maternity ward. Equal numbers per group were either swaddled or clothed. Episodes of early suckling were noted. Number of breastfeeds, amount of milk ingested (recorded on day 4 postpartum) and duration of "nearly exclusive" breastfeeding were recorded. Intensity of breast engorgement was recorded and a Visual Analogue Scale measured daily maternal feelings of being "low/blue".</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>On day four, multiparas had lower milk production than primiparas when they were separated from their infants and breastfeeding according to the prescriptive schedule (7 times a day; Group III). In contrast, there was no difference in milk production between multi- and primiparous mothers in the groups rooming-in and feeding on demand (Groups I, II and IV), although multiparas had higher numbers of feedings than primiparas. In addition during the first three days postpartum, multiparous mothers had higher perception of physiological breast engorgement and lower intensity of feeling "low/blue" than primiparous mothers. Early suckling was shown to positively affect milk production irrespective of parity. Thus Group I and II infants who suckled within the first two hours after birth ingested significantly more milk on day 4 than those who had not (284 and 184 ml respectively, SE = 14 and 27 ml, p = 0.0006).</p><p>Regression analyses evaluated factors most important for milk production and found in Groups I and II for primiparous women that early suckling, intensity of breast engorgement and number of breastfeeds on day 3 were most important. Intensity of feeling "low/blue" was negatively related to amount of milk ingested. The significant factor for multiparous women was early suckling. Similar results were obtained in Groups III and IV; however, in primiparous mothers, engorgement was the most important factor and in multiparous women it was rooming-in. Amount of milk produced on day 4 was strongly correlated to a duration of "nearly exclusive" breastfeeding (p &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present data show that ward routines influence milk production. As our data suggest that milk production in primi- and multiparous women may be differently influenced or regulated by complex factors, further research is needed.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Maternity practices focusing on care routines of mother and infant after birth have changed greatly over the last decades due, in part, to recommendations deriving from research. One such example of this change is the practice of putting the newborn baby directly in skin-to-skin contact with the mother immediately after birth. The reasons for skin-to-skin contact are many: it may enhance early breastfeeding, as the baby has been shown to have an inborn pre-feeding behavioural instinct and starts suckling the breast by him/herself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; the mother keeps the baby warm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and the baby will be relaxed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and in a non-crying state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Studies have also shown that rooming-in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and breastfeeding on demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] are favourable for the establishment of lactation. This knowledge has encouraged WHO and UNICEF to include these findings in their joint statement to maternity units worldwide to protect, promote and support breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The present study, conducted from 1995 to 1998, is part of a collaborative Russian &#x02013; Swedish longitudinal research project which evaluated the effect of maternal-infant care routines in Russian maternity homes. More than 99% of women give birth in freestanding maternity homes in Russia. At the time of this study, typical care routines included infants' being swaddled immediately after birth according to cultural traditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], separation of mothers and babies, infants cared for in a nursery, breastfeeding at seven regularly scheduled times per day. Furthermore, partners were not allowed in the hospital during labour and birth, nor during the postpartum period.</p><p>At the onset of this project no official statistics about the duration of exclusive breastfeeding were available in Russia; however, in St. Petersburg, it was estimated that approximately 95% of mothers initiated breastfeeding while residing in the maternity homes. The duration of any breastfeeding was estimated to be 64% at 3 months, 31% at 6 months and 10% at 9 months (personal communication, Igor Vorontsov, Chief paediatrician of St. Petersburg). Exclusive breastfeeding was unusual.</p><p>The research team became interested in evaluating the effects of some of these care practices on mothers and infants. Primarily we studied effects of delivery ward practices on the baby's body temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Secondly, we focused on the effects of Russian ward practices on breastfeeding parameters and infant weight loss during the first days of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the present study we focus on differences in early lactation between primiparous and multiparous women. We have observed earlier (unpublished observations) a slight difference in breastfeeding competence in multiparas compared to primiparas and we thus decided to focus this investigation on whether or not there were any differences in breastfeeding characteristics between mothers as related to parity, maternal physiological breast engorgement and maternal postpartum mood.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the amount of breast milk increases significantly with the degree of physiological breast engorgement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and the pattern and extent of physiological engorgement has been reported to be a possible predictor for sufficient milk supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Changes in mood ("maternity blues") are well-known phenomena coinciding in time with the initiation of lactation. One of the main current hypotheses explains the blues as a result of activation of brain structures connected with parenting, where oxytocin is believed to play a central role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. As far as oxytocin is involved both in breastfeeding outcome and in changes in mood after birth it was hypothesized that milk production could be indirectly affected by ward practices through its probable influence on mother's mood.</p><p>In a randomised trial using an experimental factorial design, we studied the effects of skin-to-skin contact versus contact in clothes and separation at the delivery ward, rooming-in versus nursery care and swaddling versus baby clothes at the maternity ward as well as the mother's mood and her perception of physiological breast engorgement on the amount of breast milk produced/ingested at day four after birth. These factors were studied in relation to the duration of "nearly exclusive" breastfeeding in primi- and multiparous women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study took place from 1995&#x02013;1998 in St Petersburg, Russia at Maternity Home 13, which is a freestanding maternity home. It has approximately 2100&#x02013;2300 births per year; the standard length of stay for new mothers is five postpartum days. Ethnographic data were collected about care routines for mothers and infants. Description of material and methods is also given elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Recruitment of participants took place on regular weekdays during daytime hours. When a healthy woman, free of chronic disease and with an uncomplicated pregnancy was admitted to the delivery ward, she was informed about the study. If she intended to breastfeed and had no preference about rooming-in, swaddling, and skin-to-skin contact, she was asked if she was willing to participate. Women who gave informed consent and had a normal non-instrumental delivery without oxytocin infusion and/or analgesia such as epidural, paracervical, or pudendal block, and a healthy baby (not small for gestational age, without congenital malformations and with Apgar score not less than 8 at five minutes after birth) were included in the study.</p><p>During the four years of data collection, a total of 386 women were assessed for eligibility to participate in the study.

For the purpose of balancing the probable influence of time and parity, the future mother-infant pairs were grouped in sets of eight consecutive dyads, separately for primiparas and multiparas. The randomisation to the eight treatment combinations was performed in blocks of eight mothers independently of the other blocks. In total there were 11 blocks of 8 primiparas and 11 blocks of 8 multiparas. Opaque envelopes containing the information on group assignment were sealed and numbered in the order they should be used: primi- 1, 2, 3 . . . 88, and multi- 1, 2, 3 . . . 88. Both the researchers and the recruited women were blind to the task.</p><p>A total of 176 mother-infant pairs were randomly assigned according to allocation sequence. Immediately after the infant was born and the condition of the mother and baby was assessed as normal, the envelope (with the lowest number) coinciding with parity with information on group assignment was opened. During the approximate first 25 minutes after birth, all infants were subjected to identical compulsory Russian labour ward routines (see description below).

Xeroform powder or 1% iodine solution was applied to the umbilical cord stump and on the infants' skin folds to prevent infection.</p><p>After these obligatory Russian routines, the infants were, according to the randomisation, given to their mothers or placed in a cot in the nursery (dressed or swaddled). Babies given to their mothers were placed either naked skin-to-skin on the mother's chest between her breasts, or placed directly in the mothers' arms (dressed or swaddled).</p><p>If there was no bleeding in the women, the suturing of spontaneous vaginal ruptures and episiotomies was postponed until two hours after delivery. At two hours postpartum, a paediatrician examined infants and then, according to the randomisation schema, the babies were taken to the maternity ward for rooming-in with the mothers or were taken to the nursery and placed in a cot.</p></sec><sec><title>Swaddling</title><p>Swaddling is a traditional Russian practice of infant care, and is used on babies shortly after birth until the infant and mother are discharged from the maternity home. Swaddling then is continued for some months. In the maternity home the following procedure was used: two cotton cloths were placed between the baby's legs, as a diaper, and another cloth was wrapped around both of the infant's legs. The next cloth was used to wrap the baby's arms close to the body, serving as an extra layer of covering of the body and legs. After this, one more cloth was wrapped from behind the head to cover the forehead, which ended cross-wise on the thorax. The final cloth, placed inside the outer blanket, was then wrapped tightly around the entire body of the infant (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>A photo of Russian swaddled baby.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1746-4358-2-9-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Baby's clothes</title><p>Babies who were randomised to wear clothes were dressed in identical sets of infant wear, specially brought from Sweden for the purpose of the study.

In the groups where the babies stayed with their mothers for two hours at the delivery ward, mothers could initiate breastfeeding. These early breastfeeding episodes were observed and it was noted if the baby attached to the breast and suckled with distinct sucking movements.</p><p>At the maternity ward the mothers filled in a diary for each day (if the baby was born after noon, this day was defined as "day 0"). The mothers assessed a variety of factors: <underline>breast engorgement</underline>, the mother's perception of tension/hardness in the breasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] as "none", "slight" or "marked"; <underline>feeling "low/blue"</underline>, by a mark on a 100 mm long horizontal Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with the end points " not at all" and "as much as I can imagine" (the English expression "feeling low/blue" was translated into Russian and retranslated by an other person into English without language confusion); and <underline>number of breastfeeds per 24 hours. </underline></p><p><underline>Milk intake</underline>. On day 4 (i.e. in the interval between 72 and 96 hours after delivery), the amount of breast milk ingested by the baby was measured as the difference in weight before and after each feeding (Electronic scale, Tanita 1581, Tanita Corporation, Japan). If the breastfeeding session began before 72 hours postpartum and was finished after 72 hours, the breastfeed was not taken into consideration. In case a suckling episode started before 96 hours postpartum, but finished after this time, it was included in the calculation. The mothers performed the weighing of infants if they were rooming-in, while nurses weighed the babies kept in the nursery. The scales in the nursery and in the mother's room were of the same model, specially purchased for the study. Each mother was educated by the staff about how to weigh the baby and checking for accuracy during weighing episodes. Milk ingested, originally considered as a difference in weight pre- and post-breastfeeding, was also considered and reported as milk production, as well as milk volume, in some analyses. <underline>The volume of supplemental formula and/or glucose</underline> was measured and noted.  </p><p><underline>"Nearly exclusive" breastfeeding</underline> was assessed over a year-long period at specific follow-up times at the maternity home (at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months after birth). Prior to the measurement days, a research coordinator for the project phoned each mother to fix the closest to exact date day and time of the visit. During the follow-up visits a paediatrician examined the babies and anthropometrical measurements were taken. Mothers were asked about breastfeeding and whether or not they used any supplementation. Exclusive breastfeeding, i.e. breastfeeding without any supplementation, is not a common practice in Russia, and thus could not be registered in this study. Instead the expression used in this study was <italic>"nearly exclusive breastfeeding" </italic>which was defined as breastfeeding including <italic>irregular </italic>supplementation of juices or solids in a daily volume of 30 ml or less, or formula in a daily volume of 100 ml or less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>All mother-infant pairs except nine were followed up until the age of 12 months. Among those, four had unexpectedly moved to other towns and four mothers had difficulties visiting the maternity home for follow-up.

To compare the treatment groups, one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used. Kruskal-Wallis test was used instead of ANOVA when comparing groups with few observations and risk of non-normality in distributions. Repeated measures ANOVA together with Fisher's Protected Least Significant Differences (Fisher's PLSD) were used to analyse data over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Multiple linear regression was used to explore the relationship between the variable "milk amount on day 4" in a series of exploratory regression analyses, using different combinations of the explanatory variables, including early suckling, breast engorgement, feeling "low/blue", number of breastfeeds at day 3, and the design variables skin-to-skin or not, rooming-in or not, and swaddling or not. For use in the regression analyses, the variable "engorgement" &#x02013; originally classified into three groups, "none", "slight" and "marked" &#x02013; was re-coded into a 0 &#x02013; 1 dummy variable by coding "none" and "slight" to 0 and "marked" to 1. The variable "feeling low/blue" was re-coded for the regression analysis as "low" when under 40 and "marked" when 40 or more was noted on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). This break point (40 on a VAS) had been chosen to discriminate mothers with marked "feeling low/blue" according to the distribution (approximately 15% of all mothers in the study).</p><p>Many of the analyses in this study are performed on data from day 3, the day before the amount of breast milk was measured. Additionally, since the randomisation was stratified by parity, separate analyses for primiparas and multiparas were possible.</p><p>Sample size was originally determined by using experiences from previous studies basing power calculations on variation obtained in these studies. To check the adequacy of the sample size retrospectively we used the variance observed in the present study and found that to compare groups the most probability to detect difference of 75 ml of ingested/produced milk is about 66% and to detect difference of 100 ml is about 97% which for instance is the difference on milk amount if early suckling or not occurred.</p><p>Data were treated with "per protocol" analyses and not according to "intention to treat" as the present study has an explanatory, rather than a pragmatic aim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Prior to conducting the study, approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, and the Health Care Division of the Mayor-Council of St. Petersburg, Russia.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of parity and ward routines</title><sec><title>Milk volume &#x02013; day 4</title><p>When the average milk volume ingested by infants was measured in primi- and multiparous mothers on day 4 after birth, no significant difference was obtained (ANOVA F<sub>1,141 </sub>= 0.53, p value = 0.47).

The different results obtained between studies may be related to the fact that the design of the previous studies did not always allow a clear distinction between the effects of skin-to-skin contact and early suckling on the outcome of breastfeeding.</p><p>It should be mentioned, however, that the infants in our study that suckled early weighed significantly more and had a significantly higher mean gestational age than those that did not suckle, differences which may be related to the outcome.</p><p>Surprisingly the amount of milk ingested/produced four days after birth did not differ between the groups of mothers and infants that were allowed to stay together after birth (Skin-to-skin and Mother's arms groups) or that were subjected to a short-term separation (Reunion group), in spite of the positive effect of early suckling in the former groups.</p><p>Maternity ward routines had a strong impact on the outcome of milk ingestion/production in the present study. Infants staying in the nursery at the maternity ward ingested less milk than infants who were rooming-in and thus allowed breastfeeding on demand. This difference in milk ingestion reached significance in infants of multiparous women. This lower milk intake was not related to more supplementation.</p><p>The difference in the amount of milk ingested/produced on day four may be related to the fact that the number of breastfeeds was set to seven times per day in the group of mothers who had their infants in the nursery (Group III), to the use of infant formula in the nursery, and most likely to the more limited contact between mother and infant subjected to this routine due to the separation of mother and infant in between feeds.</p><p>Swaddling did not have any significant effect on milk production as had been hypothesised, since in a previous study we found that swaddling could delay recovery of weight loss in babies while combined with potential stressors, such as separation after birth and supplementation by formula or glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The relative importance of the different parameters shown to be of importance for milk ingestion/production four days after birth was further investigated by means of regression analysis. The design of the study allowed four different analyses to be performed. Thus, groups of mothers and infants that were staying together at the labour ward and those that were separated at this time were analysed separately and there was a further split of the data based on parity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).</p><p>In the groups of mothers and infants that stayed together in the labour ward, early suckling, the intensity of breast engorgement and the number of breastfeeds on day 3 after delivery were positively associated, and the intensity of feeling "low/blue" was negatively associated, with the amount of milk ingested/produced four days after birth. These relationships were, however, only seen in the primiparous mothers. In multiparous mothers, early suckling was found to be the only factor of importance.</p><p>A similar pattern was obtained in the mothers and infants that were exposed to a short-term separation after birth. Thus, even in the separated groups, the intensity of breast engorgement was positively associated and the intensity of feeling "low/blue" was negatively associated with the amount of milk ingested/produced four days after birth in the primiparous women, whereas the routine of rooming-in was of singular importance for milk ingestion/production in multiparous women.</p><p>One conclusion that could be drawn from the regression analyses is that milk production might be differently influenced in primi- and multiparous women. Obviously, the intensity of breast engorgement was associated with milk ingestion/production in primiparous mothers, irrespective of labour ward routines, whereas multiparous mothers seemed to rely more on "sensory stimulation", such as the procedure of early suckling or the routine of rooming-in.</p><p>Breast engorgement has been suggested to be related to "hormonal" stimulation of milk production. Oestrogen and progesterone levels are high during pregnancy, but since these hormones are, to a great extent, produced in the placenta, the levels of these hormones decrease rapidly after birth. Decreased levels of these steroid hormones have been associated with initiation of milk production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Possibly the experience of physiological engorgement is related to this phenomenon.</p><p>Oxytocin is of main importance for milk ejection and related behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Animal studies indicate that there are differences in primi- and multiparas regarding sensitivity to sensory cues that trigger milk ejection and maternal behaviour. Animal studies show that in ewes, the first pregnancy induces permanent changes with regard to the release of oxytocin and oxytocin receptors, e.g. the expression of oxytocin receptor mRNA is increased in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the brain and the sensitivity of oxytocin autoreceptors is increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These changes resulting from maternal experience may facilitate the expression of oxytocin-mediated functions, such as milk ejection, in connection with later pregnancies. An analogous finding is that the prolactin surge to suckling is blunted in rats having previous experience of lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Studies in humans actually indicate a similar increased sensitivity of prolactin receptors in multiparous when compared to primiparous women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>These data may indicate that the "machinery" for milk production might be primed by previous lactations also in women. As a consequence, it may be easier to trigger milk production by sensory stimuli. Thus, early suckling and/or rooming-in may suffice to initiate milk production, when the mammary tissue is already primed.</p><p>The results of the multiple regressions must, however, be interpreted with some caution. Since they were based on information obtained on days 3 and 4 of lactation, it cannot be excluded that other relationships might have been established if data from other time points had been explored. Other unknown factors may also play an important role. Still the similarity of the results obtained for primiparous women in the regressions performed on the groups of mothers and infants that stayed together after birth and those that were separated after birth speak strongly in favour of the reliability of the analyses.</p><p>In the present study we were able to cover the impact of some factors affecting milk ingestion/production four days after birth. This may not complete all possible influences such as cultural differences, for example. Yet the above data suggest that milk production, a physiological function of vital importance for the offspring and survival of the species, is under multifactorial control. When infants are allowed close contact with their mother immediately after birth, early suckling may be a strong promoter of milk production. If, on the other hand, mother and infant are separated after birth, e.g. because of complicated delivery, alternative physiologic pathways may be activated to ascertain an adequate production of milk. Intense sensory stimulation as offered by the routine of rooming-in or feeding on demand may compensate for effects cause by short-term early separations.</p><p>It is important to mention that early skin-to-skin contact should be promoted even if it does not seem to play a direct role for milk production and duration of breastfeeding. Skin-to-skin contact in this study started between 20 &#x02013; 25 minutes after birth as the infants were subjected earlier to compulsory hospital practices. This may have interfered with the baby's developing breastfeeding behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and may have disguised some effects of immediate skin-to-skin contact.</p><p>Even if there are no measurable effects of skin-to-skin contact, it may still create a positive experience for the infant and the mother and facilitate the procedure of breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Additionally, stress levels have been shown to be reduced both in mothers and infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and, as has been demonstrated by Klaus and Kennell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] amongst others, early skin-to-skin contact occurring immediately after birth may promote attachment between mother and child and facilitate maternal-infant interaction in a long-term perspective.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows that ward routines influence milk production. The data also suggest that milk production in primi- and multiparous women may be differently influenced or even regulated by many factors and further research to identify these factors is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KB collected, coded and analysed data; performed statistical analyses; drafted the manuscript.
