These authors speculated that there is greater disuse of leg muscles than of arm muscles with increasing age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-8-401">9</xref> Similarly, Frontera et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cia-8-401">8</xref> in a 12-year longitudinal study, documented that the mean annual reduction in strength was in the range of 1.4%&#x02013;2.5%, with elbow flexors having a mean loss of isokinetic strength at 60&#x000b0; per second of 16.4% (annual loss approximately 1.4%) and knee extensors having significantly greater loss of strength (23.7%, annual loss about 2.0%). Candow and Chilibeck<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cia-8-401">10</xref> also analyzed elbow flexor and knee extensor torques (among other muscle groups) in young and elderly subjects, and found that strength in the lower body muscles is more affected by age than that of the upper body muscles.

It was hypothesized that young individuals would have more strength in the elbow flexors and knee extensors than their elderly counterparts, and that matching ADL level to age, similar losses of muscle strength could be expected for elbow flexors and knee extensors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>The number of participants required for the present study was determined by sample size estimation utilizing G*Power (version 3.0.10)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cia-8-401">13</xref> based on data from a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-8-401">9</xref> that analyzed the strength of elbow flexors and knee extensors in young and old individuals. The estimation was based on a difference in loss of strength of about 6% between elbow flexors and knee extensors with aging. We used an &#x003b1; level of 0.05 and a power (1 &#x02212; &#x003b2;) of 0.95. Calculations demonstrated that a total of eight individuals were needed to test our hypothesis.</p><p>We recruited 12 healthy men (seven younger and five older subjects) for the present study, and their characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cia-8-401">Table 1</xref>. The inclusion criteria were: no cardiac disease, arterial hypertension, or diabetes mellitus; no participation in a resistance training program for at least 12 months prior to the study; and no musculoskeletal injuries of the upper or lower extremities. All volunteers were evaluated by a medical doctor and were considered to be able to perform maximal strength tests. All participants provided their informed consent and the study was approved by the ethics committee at our institution. The study was conducted in conformity with the policy statement regarding use of human subjects by the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The subjects were asked and reminded not to perform any physical exercise for at least 96 hours before and during the study period. All volunteers were evaluated for their physical activity level using the Baecke questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-8-401">14</xref> This questionnaire evaluates the ADL level for the past 12 months, taking into account occupational physical activities, physical exercises practiced during leisure time, and physical activities practiced during leisure time and locomotion (excluding physical exercise).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cia-8-401">15</xref> Limb circumference was measured by an experienced investigator using a constant-tension tape (with 1 mm resolution) at the mid portion of each limb (at the middle point between the acromion and the olecranon for elbow flexors, and at the middle point between the inguinal ligament and the top edge of the patella for knee extensors). The circumference of the elbow flexors and knee extensors was defined as the perpendicular perimeter of the longitudinal axis of the humerus and femur, respectively. The investigator measured the circumference three times for each limb while the volunteer stood with arms relaxed beside the body. The average of three measurements for elbow flexors and knee extensors was used as the circumference value.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>All volunteers were familiarized with the study equipment and tests before collection of data. Three days later, the strength protocols for elbow flexors and knee extensors were performed in a random and counterbalanced order between ages and limbs, with two weeks of rest between the elbow flexor and knee extensor tests according to a crossover design. All tests were performed using the nondominant limb (determined by the writing hand and leg used to kick a ball with precision<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cia-8-401">16</xref>) in an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 4 Pro, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA) to standardize the velocity of execution and range of motion and also to quantify the peak torque. A warm-up consisting of two sets of three repetitions (concentric/concentric) at 90&#x000b0; per second was performed before all procedures on the isokinetic dynamometer. The volunteers were positioned in the dynamometer chair and fixed by straps at the chest, lap, and leg to limit extraneous movement. For elbow flexor exercise, the shoulder joint was positioned at 90&#x000b0; of flexion and 0&#x000b0; of abduction, and the forearm was supinated, holding the lever arm of the dynamometer. For knee extensor exercise, the hip joint was positioned at 85&#x000b0; of flexion with the arms folded in front of the chest.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-cia-8-401">17</xref> The dynamometer rotation axis was visually aligned with the elbow joint or knee joint for the elbow flexor and knee extensor exercises, respectively. All subjects were verbally encouraged to achieve maximum strength at each strength test (concentric, isometric, and eccentric), and the maximum torque developed was calculated by the software of the isokinetic dynamometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Concentric torque</title><p>To quantify maximum concentric contraction torque, the volunteers performed a set of four maximum concentric contractions at 60&#x000b0; per second for the elbow flexors and the knee extensors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-cia-8-401">17</xref> The range of motion of each contraction was 60&#x000b0; (20&#x000b0;&#x02013;80&#x000b0; for elbow flexors; 90&#x000b0;&#x02013;30&#x000b0; for knee extensors).

The movement return was realized passively at 5&#x000b0; per second, resulting in 12 seconds of rest between contractions. Maximum eccentric contraction torque developed at the set was used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Mean torque</title><p>The arithmetic mean for the concentric, isometric, and eccentric contraction torques was calculated for each limb (elbow flexors and knee extensors) and each age group (young and old) in order to establish the general strength of each limb.

However, the results show that elbow flexor strength did not vary with advancing aging, but that knee extensors had significantly less strength in older men than in young men. Thus, our results document that even with a similar ADL level; the upper limbs maintain better muscle strength than do the lower limbs with aging.</p><p>Participant characteristics did not differ between the age groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cia-8-401">Table 1</xref>), with the younger and older groups having the same body mass, height, body mass index, elbow flexor and knee extensor circumferences, and Baecke scores. This is important, and highlights the need for standardization with regard to the main comparison in the present study, ie, elbow flexor and knee extensor strength between younger and older subjects with the same level of ADL. Analyzing the muscle strength data (ie, concentric, isometric, eccentric, and mean contraction torques), it was found that younger and older men showed similar elbow flexor strength. This is consistent with previous research in men<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-cia-8-401">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-cia-8-401">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cia-8-401">21</xref> and women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-cia-8-401">22</xref> demonstrating that younger and older individuals do not differ in isometric strength of the elbow flexors. With regard to eccentric strength in the elbow flexors, Lynch et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-8-401">9</xref> documented results similar to those of the present study, ie, no difference between eccentric strength of the elbow flexors in younger (20&#x02013;29 years) and older women (60&#x02013;79 years). When the same comparison was made between younger (about 19 years) and middle-aged men (about 48 years), also no difference in isometric strength of the elbow flexors was found.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cia-8-401">23</xref> However, conflicting results have been found in other studies showing significant loss of elbow flexor strength in men as a result of aging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cia-8-401">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-8-401">9</xref> These contradictory results might reflect different ADL levels in the age groups included in these studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cia-8-401">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-8-401">9</xref> It is possible that the similar levels of ADL in the age groups included in the present study could have been responsible for maintenance of elbow flexor strength with aging.</p><p>In our study, analysis of concentric, eccentric, and mean contraction torques of the knee extensors revealed important differences between the age groups, ie, older men showed lower concentric, eccentric, and mean contraction torques than young men. Only isometric strength of the knee extensors showed no difference between the age groups. The method used to analyze isometric torque in this work (testing at a single fixed angle, ie, 50&#x000b0; for the elbow flexors and 60&#x000b0; for the knee extensors) might have influenced the results. It has been suggested that the pennation angle decreases with aging;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-8-401">9</xref> such that aging significantly affects muscle architecture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-cia-8-401">24</xref> Muscle architecture, eg, pennation angle and fascicle length, can change the optimum angle of peak torque.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-cia-8-401">25</xref> Therefore, isometric torques at fixed angles might not precisely reflect peak torques in younger or older subjects. Accordingly, it has been suggested that age deficits in isometric torque are angle-specific.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-cia-8-401">26</xref> On the other hand, peak eccentric and concentric contraction torques measured dynamically show lower values in older men than in younger men. Altogether, from the results presented (ie, for concentric, eccentric, and mean contraction torque), it is reasonable to suggest that aging promotes major losses in knee extensor strength even with the same level of ADL. The present study demonstrated about 25.0% of loss in concentric strength of the knee extensors (measure at 60&#x000b0; per second) in older men compared with younger men. A similar degree of loss was reported by Candow and Chilibeck,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cia-8-401">10</xref> who also measured peak isokinetic concentric torque at 60&#x000b0; per second for the knee extensors and found an approximate torque loss of 25.3% comparing younger and older subjects. Lynch et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-8-401">9</xref> observed a difference of approximately 23.3% in concentric strength of the knee extensors (at 30&#x000b0; per second) for younger (20&#x02013;29 years) and older men (60&#x02013;69 years). Also analyzing concentric strength of the knee extensors at 60&#x000b0; per second, Frontera et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cia-8-401">8</xref> showed a loss with aging of about 2.0% per year. These authors demonstrated that, over a period of 12 years, men had a loss of concentric strength in the knee extensors of about 23.7%. Also consistent with the present study, Balagopal et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cia-8-401">27</xref> documented that isokinetic strength of the quadriceps (the main muscle group involved in knee extension) and strength of the knee extensors measured by one repetition maximum, decreased significantly with age (23 years versus 77 years). In addition, Ploutz-Snyder et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-cia-8-401">28</xref> demonstrated that concentric and eccentric strength in the knee extensors were lower in older than in younger women.</p><p>Interestingly, the present study demonstrated that knee extensor strength in younger men was significantly greater than that in older men, but that elbow flexor strength did not differ between the age groups, indicating that aging modulates muscle strength of the lower and upper limbs in different ways. Similar results have been found in previous studies, demonstrating that with aging, lower limb muscles (eg, knee extensors) show greater loss of muscle strength than the upper limbs (eg, elbow flexors).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cia-8-401">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cia-8-401">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-cia-8-401">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-cia-8-401">31</xref> Most of the previous studies have considered the level of ADL relevant when interpreting their results. The novelty of the present study is that the same results were found even when matching older and younger men for their level of ADL. It has been proposed that aging may induce more inherent morphological changes in the knee extensors than in the elbow flexors,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-cia-8-401">29</xref> ie, leg muscles might be more susceptible to loss of lean mass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-cia-8-401">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-cia-8-401">33</xref> and might suffer major changes in muscle contractile properties, connective tissue, and muscle architecture (eg, pennation angle) than arm muscles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-8-401">9</xref> Further, it is possible that use of the legs in ADL is reduced to a greater extent than use of arm muscles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cia-8-401">8</xref> One limitation of the present study is that our Baecke questionnaire on ADL does not segregate frequency and intensity of daily use of the arms and legs. In fact, this has been proposed before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cia-8-401">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-cia-8-401">34</xref> and might also explain the results of the present study, in that older individuals could supplement weaker lower body movements (such as rising from a chair) with contraction of the upper limb muscles. Future studies investigating the level and intensity of ADL in the arms and legs separately would be helpful to clarify these speculations.</p><p>The results of the present study are relevant in the context of physical training and health. For example, strength training programs should be structured with greater emphasis on gains in lower limb strength, given that the strength of the knee extensor muscles predicts levels of dependency and survival.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cia-8-401">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-cia-8-401">35</xref></p><p>We conclude that even when comparing younger and older men with similar levels of daily life activities, the elbow flexors maintain better strength than the knee extensors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors extend their thanks to all volunteers who participated in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-cia-8-401"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors declare no financial support or relationship that might pose any conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-cia-8-401"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lexell</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name><name><surname>Sjostrom</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What is the cause of the ageing atrophy?
