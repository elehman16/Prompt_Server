Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 90-95% of diabetic cases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] is an important cardiovascular risk-factor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Notably, the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with type 2 diabetes with no previous history of coronary heart disease is similar to that among patients without diabetes who have already had MI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Recent advances have designated dyslipidemia as an important risk-factor for CVD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Diabetic dyslipidemia, which is called atherogenic dyslipidemia, is a cluster of lipoprotein abnormalities characterized by elevated triglycerides (TGs), reduced high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle. This abnormal lipid profile commonly presents in type 2 diabetes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and is even a more important risk-factor for CVD than hyperglycemia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In contrast to type 1 diabetes, diabetic dyslipidemia is not reversed with glycemic control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies have provided evidence that dietary modification can affect coronary events[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and risk-factors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In addition, some other studies have shown that diets containing nuts (as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet) could exert anti-diabetic, anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Epidemiologic studies have consistently shown an inverse dose-response relation between nut consumption and incidence of CVD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Considerable research has demonstrated that nut consumption has beneficial effects on cardiovascular risks.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Furthermore, a recent analysis of 25 intervention trials has concluded that nut consumption can improve blood lipid profile and that these effects are dose-related.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Nuts are energy-dense foods and their total fat content ranges from 44% in pistachios to 76% in macadamia nuts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) is the predominant fatty acid in nuts, including hazelnuts (but not walnuts).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Indeed, the fatty acid composition of hazelnuts is unique because 18:1 fatty acid (Oleic acid) contributes more than 99% of its MUFA content (~74% for acadamias).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Moreover, hazelnuts contain several non-fat constituents. They are good source of plant protein, as the amino acid composition of hazelnuts is comparable to that of a whole egg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Nuts have a high amount of l-arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] After macadamia nuts, Hazelnuts have the lowest Lys: Arg ratio among the tree nuts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Furthermore, among the tree nuts, hazelnuts are one of the richest sources of vitamin E (&#x003b1;-tocopherol) and folate. The other non-fat compounds are micronutrients (manganese, zinc, magnesium and copper), fiber, and phytochemicals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] There are evidences regarding the favorable effects of fiber on lipid profile.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>Although, hazelnuts have favourable macronutrient and micronutrient contents, limited number of studies have examined the effects of hazelnuts on serum lipid profiles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] With the exception of one study, which has been performed in diabetes filed,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] other studies have focused on non-diabetic patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Indeed, although there are some reports about the beneficial effect of hazelnut on blood lipoproteins levels (including total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C), the lack of information about the effects of hazelnuts on fasting blood sugar (FBS) and related variables in patients with type 2 diabetes still remained. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there have been no studies on the effects of hazelnut consumption on serum lipid profiles in the Iranian population. Thus, we conducted a randomized parallel trial to examine the effects of replacing 10% of energy intake with hazelnuts on serum lipid profiles as well as on FBS in type 2 diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Fifty type 2 diabetic patients (16 men and 34 women, mean age 55.68 &#x000b1; 7.74 years) were recruited from the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: Any known allergies to nuts, insulin therapy, cigarette smoking, history of stroke, heart disease or thyroid disorders, diabetic nephropathy or retinopathy, or following vegetarian or weight-loss diets up to 2 months before the study. Those patients who had consumed nuts more than 2-times/week and changed their medications (type or dosage) up to 2 months before the study were also excluded. All subjects were taking hypoglycemic agents. Patients were asked to maintain their medications and physical activity throughout the study. Physical activity was assessed using short form of international physical activity questionnaire at baseline and at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>In an 8-week, randomized, parallel controlled feeding trial, 50 volunteers were assigned to either the control, (<italic>n</italic> = 25) or intervention groups (<italic>n</italic> = 25) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>], using blocked randomization method. All subjects were required to complete 24-h dietary recall (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) at baseline and at weeks 4 and 8 of the study. Then, dietary data were analyzed for energy and selected nutrients, using Nutritionist IV software (version 3.5.2., First Databank Division, The Hearts Corporation). Anthropometric measurements were carried out by trained personnel from the Institute and recorded at the start of the trial and at the end of week 8. After an overnight fast, venous blood samples were obtained at the start and at the end of the study period to measure blood biochemical values including FBS, TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C concentrations. All patients gaved informed consent. The Ethics Committee of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences approved the study.

To achieve this goal, a nutritionist provided detailed instructions for each patient individually. During the study, subjects in the control group followed their own-self-selected diet. The intervention diet was similar to the control diet, but the size of the portions of fatty foods such as meats were reduced and the amount of visible fats (oils, margarines, and butter) were decreased to allow hazelnuts to be taken as snacks without increasing total energy intake. Furthermore, hazelnuts were consumed as snack. One-day supplies of raw, unsalted hazelnuts with skins were weighed with a digital food scale (Beurer, DS81) and provided in separate packages. The mean amount of hazelnuts consumed was 29 g, depending on each subject's energy intake. 24-hour dietary recalls (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) were obtained in the middle and at the end of the study to analyses the dietary variables. Compliance was assessed from dietary recall and telephone calls throughout the study. To improve compliance, an extra package of hazelnuts was given to subjects to share with others.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Laboratory analyses</title><p>Within 1 h of blood sample collection, the serum was separated by centrifugation at 2500 &#x000d7; g for 15 min.

Additionally, serum TC, TG, and HDL-C concentrations were also determined by enzymatic methods (Pars Azmoon kit, Tehran, Iran). The sensitivities of blood lipid profile assays were 5 mg/dl for TC and TG and 1 mg/dl for HDL-C.

The other study performed by Tey <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] demonstrated that 30 g/d hazelnuts in three different forms (ground, sliced or whole hazelnuts) for 4 weeks significantly reduce TC and LDL-C concentrations in mildly hypercholesterolmic individuals.</p><p>Nuts are healthy foods with favorable lipid profiles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] which, due to their fatty acid contents, have several effects on TC and LDL-C that are predictable by a number of available equations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] Furthermore, nuts contain several components that cause additional effects on blood lipoproteins beyond those expected from their fatty acid contents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] These effects are similar to some other food such as soy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] Recent findings have shown that soy and soy products could exert favorable effects on serum lipoproteins in patients with type 2 diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>] Some of these effects could partially be attributed to soy protein. Noteworthy, other components of soy, especially isoflavones, besides their antioxidant properties[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>] could have synergistic effects on hypolipidemic features of soy proteins.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] However, it seems that the lack of effects of hazelnuts on TC and LDL-C in our study could possibly be attributed to the low-TC and LDL-C concentrations observed at baseline. Two recent hazelnut studies which demonstrated significant results, had higher LDL-C levels at baseline compared with our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Indeed, a recent analysis of 25 intervention trials suggested that the most pronounced effects of nuts on cholesterol levels have been observed in subjects with baseline LDL-C levels above 160 mg/dl.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In other words, the aforementioned analysis showed that nuts might not affect blood cholesterol levels when the baseline LDL-C concentrations were less than 130 mg/dl.</p><p>In addition, the effects of nuts consumption on blood lipid levels show a dose-dependent pattern, so they could be most effective in reducing TC and LDL-C if they replaced 20% of total daily calorie intake.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In Yucesan <italic>et al</italic>. study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] TC levels were similar to our study at baseline, but higher hazelnut consumption in Yucesan study (49-86 g/d vs. 29 g/d in the present study) could partially explain the differences in TC outcomes between two studies. In the present study, only 10% of energy intake was substituted with hazelnuts (29 g/d), while in another study performed by Li <italic>et al</italic>., 20% of daily calorie intake was replaced with almonds.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Similarly, Tapsell <italic>et al</italic>. also did not observe any significant effects of walnut supplementation (30 g/d) on TC and LDL-C levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] However, in another study, Tapsell <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that incorporation of 30 g of walnuts into the diet lowered LDL-C levels, but not TC.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] This finding can probably be ascribed to the diet composition in the study. In the study by Tapsell <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] SFA intake decreased and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake increased significantly in the walnut group compared with the control group, while in our study, no significant differences were observed in SFA intake between the two diet groups. However, as expected, MUFA intake increased significantly following hazelnut consumption in the hazelnut group compared with the control group. This is important when we consider that PUFAs exert stronger cholesterol-lowering effects relative to MUFAs. Moreover, reduction of SFA intake is also effective in lowering TC and LDL-C levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>]</p><p>As mentioned before, we observed a significant difference in HDL-C between the two study groups, which was due to a significant reduction in HDL-C in the control group. As a result, it seems that hazelnut consumption tends to preserve HDL-C in patients with type 2 diabetes. Existing studies regarding the effects of nuts on HDL-C in type 2 diabetes have reported different results. Although, Tapsell <italic>et al</italic>. showed that daily consumption of 30 g of walnuts for 6 months increased HDL-C in persons with type 2 diabetes,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] Lovejoy <italic>et al</italic>. found that a diet enriched with 57-113 g almonds resulted in a significant unexpected decrease in HDL-C among patients with type 2 diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] The results of these two studies are not in agreement with other studies performed in diabetes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] and metabolic syndrome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] In a subsequent study, Tapsell <italic>et al</italic>. failed to show any effects of walnut consumption (30 g/d) on HDL-C in patients with type 2 diabetes over a 12-month intervention period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Similarly, another study performed by Li <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that substituting 20% of total calorie intake for almonds had no effects on HDL-C in diabetic subjects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Similarly, the results of two studies conducted in metabolic syndrome did not show any significant effects of nuts on HDL-C.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] The result of hazelnut studies are controversial too.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] While Yucesan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] demonstrated that 49-86 g/d hazelnut had no significant effects on HDL-C levels in normocholesterolemic healthy subjects, Tey <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] and Mercanligil <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] found that compared with baseline, hazelnut caused a significant increase in HDL-C levels in hypercholesterolemic individuals.</p><p>The number of studies performed in type 2 diabetes regarding the effects of nut consumptions on blood lipid profiles is limited. However, other studies in hyperlipidemic or normolipidemic subjects have also reported varying results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>] A recent meta-analysis estimated that walnut consumption had no significant effect on HDL-C levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>] In addition, a pooled analysis of 25 intervention trials that have assessed the effects of different types of nuts on blood lipid levels demonstrated that HDL-C levels were not affected by nuts consumption.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] These two studies have also included trials conducted in diabetes, suggesting that nuts do not alter HDL-C concentrations in neither diabetic nor non-diabetic subjects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>]</p><p>Although, substitution of dietary calorie intake with nuts have demonstrated beneficial effects on plasma lipid profile (particularly TC and LDL-C), its effects on FBS is controversial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Further studies are needed to confirm the effects of nuts consumption on FBSs in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>There are some limitations in our study. We could not observe expected results, which were probably due to wide inclusion and exclusion criteria and also our standard deviations that were not small. Furthermore, using crossover design seems to be preferred. However, with respect to our study duration (8 weeks), we used parallel design.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that replacing 10% of total daily calorie intake with raw, unsalted hazelnuts could preserve HDL-C in patients with type 2 diabetes but had no effects on FBS, TC, LDL-C, and TG levels. However, the baseline values of TC and LDL-C among the study subjects were low, potentially limiting the findings of our study. Nevertheless, a large number of studies in diabetes regarding the effects of various types of nuts on blood lipid profiles have reported improvements in TC and LDL-C levels,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>] as recently confirmed by two meta-analyses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>] Consequently, further studies are warranted to examine the effects of nuts on the lipid profiles of patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Diabetes Association.
