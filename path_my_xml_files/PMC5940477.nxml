pain and depression among patients with degenerative arthritis. [Subjects and Methods] In
total, 32 patients with degenerative arthritis were randomly assigned to one of two
groups: the experimental group that underwent taping therapy and the control group that
underwent regular treatment (16 patients per group). In the experimental group,
therapeutic tape was wrapped all around the knee joint. Pain and depression were measured
using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
respectively. [Results] The intra-group comparison showed significant differences in VAS
and BDI for the experimental group. The intergroup comparison showed that the differences
in VAS and BDI within the experimental group appeared significant relative to the control
group. [Conclusion] It was observed that taping therapy showed an immediate effect in
decreasing knee pain and depression among patients with degenerative arthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Taping therapy</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Degenerative arthritis begins with acute degeneration of the joint cartilage, attributed to
many different causes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. As joint
deformation continues, ligaments and muscles moving the joints are weakened, and the
cartilage is worn out severely, with pain, ankylosis, decrease in the range of joint
movement, and edema showing up as the main symptoms<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Degenerative gonarthritis is a
disease that can cause physical problems such as functional disorders and pain as well as
decreased quality of life, causing psychosocial problems<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taping therapy is a simple method that alleviates pain caused by
degenerative arthritis, has very few side-effects, allows smooth performance of daily life
activities even with the tape attached, and can be used in combination with other treatment
methods<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also decreases muscular
imbalance, pain, and muscle fatigue, while simultaneously improving neurologic functions,
proprioceptive sensibility, and blood and lymph circulation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was especially effective in reducing pain and depression among
elderly patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although many studies
have proven the positive effects of taping therapy, there have not been enough research that
the taping therapy improves the pain and depression of degenerative arthritis patients. In
view of the evidence acquired by previous studies, this study will administer taping therapy
to patients with degenerative arthritis to verify its immediate effects in reducing knee
pain and depression, as well as to investigate its potential as an effective treatment for
degenerative arthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on 32 patients diagnosed with degenerative arthritis who were then
randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The
experimental group underwent taping therapy, and the control group received regular
treatment. Each group had 16 (8 males and 8 females) participants. They were given a
detailed explanation of the purpose and method of the study, and their consent was obtained
before participation. The study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
The ethics committee of Daegu University approved this study. The study participants
selected had knee pain scores of VAS 6 or higher on the visual analogue scale (VAS), were
not to receive any other treatment or therapy for pain alleviation during the study period,
and were not on any pain or depression medications. For the experimental group, the average
age was 63.5 &#x000b1; 5.7&#x02005;years, the average height was 162.3 &#x000b1; 7.6&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was
60.2 &#x000b1; 7.2&#x02005;kg. For the control group, the average age was 61.5 &#x000b1; 3.4&#x02005;years, the average
height was 160.7 &#x000b1; 7.0&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was 58.7 &#x000b1; 6.7&#x02005;kg. Both groups received 30
minutes of thermotherapy and 20 minutes of electrotherapy. In addition, the experimental
group underwent taping therapy five times a week for four weeks wherein an elastic tape was
wound tightly around the knee joint and was kept on for 24 hours. Pain was measured using
the visual analogue scale. The VAS is a measurement that involves a patient marking the
degree of pain from 0 points to 10 points, 0 indicating no pain while 10 points indicate the
most severe pain. Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI
is a four-point measurement method including 21 questions. Its total scores range from 0 to
63; 9 points, 10&#x02013;15 points, 16&#x02013;23 points, and 24&#x02013;63 points equating with no depression, mild
depression, depression, and serious depression, respectively. SPSS software version 19.0 was
used to statistically process and analyze the collected data. A paired t-test was performed
to compare the extent of pain and depression in both groups before and after the study. An
independent t-test was used to compare differences between the groups, and statistical
significance level was set at p=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Changes in VAS and BDI are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

VAS scores before and after the intervention that was more significant than the difference
shown by the control group in the intergroup comparison. Some previous studies showed that
taping therapy had an effect on decreasing pain among elderly patients and that taping was
also effective in decreasing pain of patients with degenerative arthritis<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
When a certain area is taped with its muscles stretched, the muscles then shrink causing
wrinkles and widen the space between the skin and fascia. This results in increased blood
flow to the muscles, thus alleviating pain. Another reason taping therapy brings about pain
alleviation is that it activates the afferent neuron responsible for apperception by sense
of touch. In addition to pain, depression also decreased more significantly in the
experimental group than in the control group. Kwon<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> as well as Kang and Kim<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that taping therapy decreased depression, which supported
the study results. Depression and pain were correlated, and pain was shown to have a
negative influence<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, both
depression and knee pain decreased by application of taping therapy because it normalized
the movements of the lower limbs for daily life activities. Not only did the pain die down,
but it also made moving around much easier, and activities which were previously tedious
suddenly became effortless. However, more research and development are required because
controversies shroud the mechanism of taping, and its neurophysiologic theories have not
been consolidated yet.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Imhof</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Czerny</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Gahleitner</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>[Coxarthrosis]</article-title>.
