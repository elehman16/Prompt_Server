In this study, <italic>Kshar Sutra</italic> Ligation (KSL), a modality of treatment described in Ayurveda, was compared with Barron's Rubber Band Ligation (RBL) for grade II and grade III hemorrhoids. This study was conducted in 20 adult patients of either sex with grade II and grade III hemorrhoids at two different hospitals. Patients were randomly allotted to two groups of 10 patients each. Group I patients underwent RBL, whereas patients of group II underwent KSL. <italic>Guggul</italic>-based <italic>Apamarga Kshar Sutra</italic> was prepared according to the principles laid down in ancient Ayurvedic texts and methodology standardized by IIIM, Jammu and CDRI, Lucknow. Comparative assessment of RBL and KSL was done according to 16 criteria. Although the two procedures were compared on 15 criteria, treatment outcome of grade II and grade III hemorrhoids was decided chiefly on the basis of patient satisfaction index (subjective criterion) and ability of each procedure to deal with prolapse of internal hemorrhoidal masses (objective criterion): Findings in each case were recorded over a follow-up of four weeks (postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 15 and 30). Statistical analysis was done using Student's <italic>t</italic> test for parametric data and Chi square test &#x00026; Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric data. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. RBL had the advantages of being an OPD procedure requiring no anesthesia and was attended by significantly lesser postoperative recumbency (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 ) and significantly lesser pain (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005 on day 1) as compared to KSL. However, Group II (KSL) scored better in terms of treatment outcome. In Group II, there was significantly high (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) patient satisfaction index as compared to Group I. Group II reported 100% 'cure' (absence of hemorrhoidal masses even on proctoscopy) of internal hemorrhoidal prolapse as against 80% in Group I (RBL); however, this difference was statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Both the groups were comparable statistically on all other grounds. <italic>Kshar Sutra</italic> Ligation is a useful form of treatment for Grades II and III internal hemorrhoids.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Barron's rubber band ligation</kwd><kwd>hemorrhoids</kwd><kwd><italic>kshar Sutra</italic> ligation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Hemorrhoids have plagued human civilization for centuries.

In3 cases of slippage of Rubber Bands detected on Day 1 or Day 3, reapplication of elastic bands was done immediately.

The mucosa and the submucosal vascular cushions are fixed to the underlying muscle coat by creating scarring after full thickness ulceration. <italic>Kashara sutra</italic> transfixation and ligation leads to strangulation of the hemorrhoidal tissue.</p><p>By virtue of its penetrating and '<italic>Ksharan</italic>' properties, the <italic>kshara</italic> induces a sterile inflammatory response in hemorrhoidal tissue and neighboring tissue leading to scarring and mucosal fixation. <italic>Guggul</italic>, by virtue of its soothing action, prevents harm to delicate anal canal tissue by the irritant action of <italic>Kshar</italic>. <italic>Haridra</italic> by virtue of its antiseptic, <italic>varnya</italic> (wound healing) and <italic>krimighna</italic> (antimicrobial) properties promotes wound healing as well.</p><p>Since hemorrhoids is, primarily, a subjective disease presenting with a distressing symptom complex of pain, bleeding, prolapsed piles, discharge per anum, it is important that treatment is targeted at elimination of symptoms, improvement of quality of life and hence patient satisfaction. KSL scored higher on this parameter as compared to RBL. On the objective parameter of prolapse of internal hemorrhoids (treatment outcome) Group II gave better treatment outcome than group I. Since the difference in treatment outcome was insignificant statistically, we concluded that the two forms of treatment were comparable on this aspect [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>].</p><p>In group I, all the patients underwent RBL without any anesthetic requirement. This was possible because RBL is done about 1 cm above dentate line in the base of hemorrhoids, strangulating rectal mucosa or upper anal canal mucosa, which is pain insensitive due to autonomic innervation. In group II, all the patients required local hemorrhoidal and/or pudendal block along with sedation. This facilitated Recamier's digital anal dilatation up to maximum of six fingers. Also pain sensitive external part of hemorrhoids could be dealt with as effectively as internal hemorrhoids.</p><p>In group II, statistically significantly higher pain score was observed as incorporation of external hemorrhoidal tissue within <italic>Kshar Sutra</italic> ligature caused pain after effect of local anesthesia and sedation had worn off. This pain responded well to simple analgesics like paracetamol, warm sitz bath, and ensuring that first bowel movement after <italic>ksharasutra</italic> ligation was soft and smooth. On the other hand, RBL produced less pain as RBL was done 1 cm above dentate line in pain insensitive mucosa, banding only the internal hemorrhoids.</p><p>The observed gradual control of bleeding in RBL as compared to KSL can be accounted for by the different principles of both these treatments. RBL reduces bleeding by producing mucosal fixation and submucosal fibrosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] This process of submucosal fibrosis is completed by three weeks. Therefore, proctorrhagia is controlled by the end of three weeks. KSL reduces or cures proctorrhagia by ligation and phytochemical cauterization of hemorrhoidal mass or vascular cushions at the time of operation and so cure of proctorrhagia is evident soon after KSL.</p><p>KSL is an operative technique attended to by greater postoperative pain. Higher postoperative pain combined with factors like perfusion volumes over 1000 ml, use of pentazocine, multi-pedicular hemorrhoidectomy and neurotonic susceptibility of the patient resulted in postoperative urinary complaints. However, this complication was completely prevented after first two cases by taking precautions such as encouraging immediate preoperative urination, restricting perfusion volume to not more that 500 ml, avoiding large intracanal dressings or packings, hot fomentation and warm sitz bath (between 40&#x000b0; and 50&#x000b0;C), which have been shown to induce lowering of urethral pressure and micturition,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] avoiding opioid analgesics in postoperative phase, and excluding patients with obstructive uropathies for KSL treatment RBL resulted in reduction of internal hemorrhoidal prolapse but not its complete cure in 2 patients. External hemorrhoidal plexus engorgement remained unchanged after RBL. Persistent internal hemorrhoidal prolapse and external hemorrhoidal plexus engorgement interfering with anal hygiene were the causes of per anal discharge. Helminthic infestation was also suspected for which deworming was done.</p><p>The average period of anal stenosis is six weeks, although it can be detected at four weeks. No incidence of anal stenosis was observed in either group in the present study. In Group II being the following precautions were taken to prevent anal stenosis, minimizing tissue dissection (in the form of semi-circular groove) thus safely preventing circumferential loss of anal canal mucosa, maintenance of normal intestinal transit by use of bulk evacuant postoperatively, regular monitoring of wound healing in order to avoid any wound stickiness, and single digital dilatation P/A starting from seventh postoperative day, until complete scarring.</p><p>In KSL, external hemorrhoidal plexus or dermal component was included in the ligature besides internal part of hemorrhoids. On the contrary, in RBL, only a part of internal hemorrhoidal tissue was included in elastic band ligature, the strangulated tissue mass being about 1 cm. Small tissue mass held in elastic ligature resulted in formation of a smaller wound by rapid sloughing off in group I as compared to group II.</p><p>Since RBL causes necrosis of only a small nub of internal pile, it was found to be ineffective in relieving or curing external hemorrhoidal plexus engorgement. KSL dealt with external hemorrhoidal plexus engorgement at the time of operation by including it in the transfixation ligature and thus resulting in its complete cure in all the patients.</p><p>In the present study, anal incontinence of any type (feces, flatus, both) was not encountered in any patient of group I and group II. Anal incontinence after KSL was prevented by taking following precautions: digital dilatation of only six (3+3) fingers was done by applying gentle, steady and continuous pressure in all directions and making circular finger movements for about 10 min,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] internal anal sphincter was carefully prevented from being injured or included in <italic>Kshar Sutra</italic> ligature, sphincterotomy was not performed in any case,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] wide retractors like Park's retractor or <italic>Ferguson's</italic> retractor were not used during surgery[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] and patients with history of obstetric anal trauma and neuropathic irritable bowel syndrome were excluded from the study.</p><p>This study had some limitations including the fact that this is not randomized study as two groups were treated in two different hospitals. Ten consecutive patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were included in each group. The sample size was small, but homogeneity was maintained in terms of demographic features, clinical features of patients and the team performing procedures. Follow-up of patients could have been longer than 04 weeks, but for the limitations imposed by time period within which this study was to be completed. However, this is the first study of its kind comparing KSL for hemorrhoids with a conventional technique like RBL, albeit in a small sample of patients. <italic>Guggul</italic> has sticking property. It also has <italic>Vranashodhana, Vranaropana, Putihara, Jantughna</italic> and <italic>Vedanasthapana</italic> properties.

Use of <italic>Guggul</italic>-based Apamarga <italic>Kshar Sutra</italic> in treating hemorrhoids grades II and III is new.</p><p>We have also modified the technique of KSL such as gentle anal stretching and three fingers Recamier's anal dilatation instead of the more traumatic Lord's procedure to prevent injury to internal anal sphincter, minimal tissue dissection in the form of semi-circular groove on anal skin, crushing and thinning of pile mass pedicle using specially improvised pile mass crushing forceps leading to less tissue trauma and negligible blood loss during the procedure, minimal tissue dissection saving circumferential loss of anal mucosa, andtight, secure ligature as <italic>Kshar Sutra</italic> is made from linen thread.

However, RBL was not able to reduce or cure external hemorrhoidal engorgement, which was not only unaesthetic but also created problems like pruritus ani, mucoid discharge, peri-anal dermatitis and soiling of underclothes.
