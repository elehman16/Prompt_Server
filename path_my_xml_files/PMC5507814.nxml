Propranolol, a nonselective &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduces resting heart rate and cardiac work caused by elevated circulating catecholamines. Oxandrolone, a testosterone mimetic, promotes protein synthesis and anabolism to counter muscle wasting. Coadministration of these drugs is expected to synergistically improve patient outcomes. Testosterone administration is known to alter &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling. Here, we determined whether the coadministration of oxandrolone alters plasma propranolol concentrations. Ninety-two pediatric patients with burns covering &#x02265;30% of the TBSA were enrolled in this institutional review board-approved study and randomized to receive propranolol (n = 49) or oxandrolone + propranolol (n = 43). Plasma propranolol concentrations were determined following two dosing strategies: Q6 (liquid formulation; n = 86) and Q24 (extended-release capsule; n = 22). Samples were drawn before drug administration and at regular intervals throughout the next two dosing periods. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded throughout the study. Propranolol half-life was 3.3 hours for the Q6 drug dosing frequency (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001) and 11.2 hours for the Q24 strategy (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). Percentage of predicted heart rate declined by 2.8% for each doubling of the propranolol concentration in the Q6 dosing schedule (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). Percentage of predicted heart rate declined by 2.5% for each doubling of propranolol concentration on the Q24 dosing schedule (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). Maximum and minimum propranolol plasma concentrations were similar with either dosing regimen. The addition of oxandrolone did not affect any of the measured parameters. Oxandrolone coadministration does not alter propranolol&#x02019;s plasma concentration, half-life, or effect on heart rate.

Numerous studies investigating the hypermetabolic response after severe burn injury and relevant therapeutic interventions have been published during the past 30 years (reviewed in <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Two of the most promising therapeutic interventions to mitigate this hypermetabolic hypercatabolic response are propranolol (PROP) and oxandrolone. PROP is a &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor antagonist that improves cardiac outcomes in severely burned pediatric patients.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition to having cardiac effects, long-term PROP administration in children with massive burns reduces skeletal muscle catabolism and lipolysis.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> More rapid wound healing and decreased blood loss have also been noted following PROP treatment in severely burned adults.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Administration of oxandrolone, a testosterone mimetic with reduced hepatotoxicity and virilization, increases anabolism in the severely burned as evidenced by increases in lean body mass, strength, and bone mineral content.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Oxandrolone also improves lung function and reduces resting energy expenditure in this patient population.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> For the past several years, a clinical trial has been underway at our institution to determine whether coadministration of PROP and oxandrolone will further improve outcomes in severely burned pediatric patients. We have recently reported that oxandrolone and PROP coadministration blunts growth arrest after severe burn injury.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>While the cardiac effects of PROP are well known, there is little information regarding the effect of oxandrolone on the myocardium. Clinical data regarding the effect of testosterone on the heart are controversial, with some studies reporting that androgen administration is detrimental and others reporting that it is cardioprotective. Exogenous androgen administration has been implicated in prothrombotic, prohypertrophic signaling (reviewed in <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition, there is a solid body of basic science research indicating that testosterone modulates &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor signaling. For example, studies in isolated cardiomyocytes demonstrate that testosterone administration significantly increases &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor expression after testosterone treatment.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Alterations in the &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor signaling system were also seen after testosterone treatment in an animal model of heart failure.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>We have previously reported plasma PROP kinetics in severely burned children treated solely with PROP.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Given the previously mentioned data regarding the effect of androgen administration on &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor expression and signaling, we hypothesized that oxandrolone may also modulate &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor signaling. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether oxandrolone coadministration alters PROP plasma concentrations.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>The University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX) Institutional Review Board approved this study.

Oxandrolone was administered at a dose of 0.1&#x02009;mg/kg twice daily. PROP was given either every 6 hours (Q6) as a liquid formulation or as a once daily extended-release capsule (Q24) with a maximum dose of 16&#x02009;mg/kg/d. Both PROP formulations were administered to reduce heart rate by 15%. Both PROP and OXPROP patients 6 years or older were switched from the liquid formulation to the extended-release capsule shortly before discharge from the intensive care unit as recommended by the attending physician and following successful completion of a swallow test.

Recently we showed that the combined administration of oxandrolone and PROP improves growth.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Given the preclinical and clinical data regarding interactions between androgen and &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor activity, understanding how oxandrolone may affect PROP plasma concentrations is important for patient safety. The data reported in this study indicate that oxandrolone does not affect plasma PROP concentration or half-life.</p><p>As previously described in severely burned pediatric patients, peak PROP concentrations were achieved earlier than described in the literature.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Peak PROP concentrations occurred at 2.6 hours post dose in neonates treated with 0.5&#x02009;mg/kg/6&#x02009;hr PROP, whereas we observed peak concentrations at 0.5 hours post dose (Q6 administration).<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Despite the earlier peak time, we observed a half-life of 3.3 hours when PROP was given four times daily, a value within the range of the published half-life of 3 to 6 hours.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The half-life of the extended-release capsule was also similar to what we expected based on previously published results in adults.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> We measured both enantiomers of PROP, as there have been several reports indicating that the clearance of the enantiomers differ and can be affected by various disease states.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Based on our kinetic profiles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), both enantiomers appear to be cleared at the same rate irrespective of treatment or dosing regimen.

Although the majority of patients received lower doses than were administered in our study, there was one patient who received a similar dose and whose mean PROP concentration was still much lower than that observed in our study.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Patients treated with conventional PROP maintained concentrations within the therapeutic window regardless of oxandrolone coadministration. However, those receiving PROP as an extended-release capsule with oxandrolone exhibited subtherapeutic PROP concentrations before receiving the next dose, although this change was not statistically significant. It is not clear whether this tendency for the oxandrolone-treated patients to have lower PROP concentrations is clinically significant, as dosing was similar between the two groups. Going forward we will monitor patients on the dual administration regimen to determine whether PROP dose and/or dosing frequency needs to be increased with oxandrolone coadministration. Additional studies are needed to verify this phenomenon and determine the mechanism. Patients in the Q24 groups also received a significantly lower average PROP dose than those in the Q6 groups. This may be due to limitations in the flexibility of dosing as the extended-release capsule is available only in discrete dosages. In addition, it has been postulated that, with chronic PROP administration, lower doses can achieve the same effect that required a higher dose during the acute administration.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>Similar to what has been published with PROP administration for hypertension and tachycardia in adults, we were unable to correlate the PROP dose given with the plasma concentration required to achieve the desired effect (data not shown).<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> This directly contrasts what was previously shown in newborns, where there was a significant correlation between PROP dose and plasma concentration.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Wilson et al<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> showed that, in a small subset of pediatric patients aged 2 to 14 years, there were significant individual variations in plasma concentrations despite receipt of similar doses. While our data show that oxandrolone coadministration does not significantly alter PROP kinetics, these data cannot be used to predict the optimal PROP dose or to estimate the effect of a given dose.</p><p>We have previously reported on propranolol kinetics in severely burned pediatric patients and determined that a dose of 4&#x02009;mg/kg/d is needed to reduce cardiac work and heart rate by 15%.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The current study has used a more sensitive and accurate method of measuring PROP concentrations (ultraviolet detection vs fluorescence detection). In addition, the previous publication only investigated the kinetics of the conventional liquid formulation of PROP administered Q6, whereas we have reported and compared the conventional liquid formulation administered Q6 with the extended-release formulation administered Q24.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> We further extended our previous report by statistically determining the decay rate, half-life, and relationship between PROP concentration and the percentage of predicted heart rate. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the extended-release formulation is equally effective as the conventional formulation in severely burned children despite lower doses, which is a novel finding. Finally, our data show that oxandrolone coadministration does not significantly alter plasma PROP concentrations.</p><p>Limitations of this study include our inability to measure plasma 4-hydroxy PROP concentrations. 4-hydroxypropranol is an active metabolite that is formed after oral propranolol administration. In addition, because the majority of patients admitted to our institution are below the age of 5, our sample size for the Q24 administration was very small. While PROP concentrations tended to be lower with oxandrolone coadministration, this was insignificant, and a larger study is needed to definitively determine whether oxandrolone coadministration does indeed have an effect on plasma PROP concentration with Q24 administration.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank Chris Nieten, Kaitlin Watson, Liz Montemayor, and Maricela Pantoja for sample collection and processing, as well as the Clinical Research Staff and Dr. Kasie Cole.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was supported by NIDILRR (90DP0043-02-01 [DNH]), National Institutes of Health (P50GM060338, R01GM056687, and T32GM008256 [DNH]; R01HD049471 [OES]; and R01GM112936 [CCF]), and Shriners of North America (84080, 79135, 80100, and 71008 [DNH]; 71009 [OES]; and 84291 [CCF]).
