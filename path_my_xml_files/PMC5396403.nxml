Of them, approximately 70% are diagnosed as nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) at presentation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Transurethral resection (TUR) remains the gold standard for NMIBC treatment. Although state-of-the-art TUR by itself can eradicate Ta, T1 tumors completely, these tumors frequently recur and/or progress to muscle-invasive bladder cancer in up to 40% of cases within a year[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] mainly due to persistence or re-growth of residual tumor after incomplete TUR.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Therefore, a single perioperative dose of intravesical chemotherapy is recommended immediately after initial TUR in low-risk disease patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A single instillation of mitomycin C (MMC), which acts by chemoresection of tumor or by destruction of circulating tumors, at the time of TUR reduces the rate of recurrence in the first 2 years. However, it does not reduce the risk of tumor progression or overall survival. Further, the clinical benefits of MMC are weak in treating recurrent, large (&#x0003e;5 cm), high-grade tumors, or high-risk patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Recently, sterile water has emerged as a valuable alternative.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The majority of these studies have shown significant efficacy of sterile water in lysing tumor cells, where the cytotoxic effects are mainly caused by osmotic cytolysis. Initially, Price indicated that sterile water can be used for the irrigation of peritoneal cavity to destroy released cancer cells after surgery for several types of cancers.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] An <italic>in-vitro</italic> study has also demonstrated that sterile water causes significant tumor cell death within 10 min in all cell lines.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Another study demonstrated that postoperative irrigation with saline for 18 h post-TUR significantly prolonged the time to the first recurrence, with about 17% reduction in relative risk of recurrence.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In another study, the osmotic tumor cytolysis by overnight irrigation with sterile water has shown to reduce the recurrence rate by 19%.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Since there are no trials comparing the efficacy of MMC and sterile water, we designed a randomized study to compare the recurrence-free rate and recurrence-free interval in NMIBC patients receiving continuous sterile water irrigation (CSWI) versus single dose intravesical MMC following TUR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Study design and patient population</title><p>We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, two-arm, single-center, pilot study between December 2013 and September 2015 at a tertiary-care center in South India. Patients undergoing TUR with cystoscopic findings (visual impression) suggestive of NMIBC were considered for enrolment. Of them, patients with previous history of intravesical therapy, synchronous upper tract tumor, bladder perforation during TUR, significant hematuria after TUR, tumor size &#x0003e;3 cm, prostatic involvement on cystoscopy, or incomplete resection of bladder tumor were excluded from the study. Signed informed consent was obtained from each patient. The institutional ethics review board approved the study protocol.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Treatment allocations</title><p>Enrolled patients were assigned to receive either single dose intravesical MMC or CSWI following TUR for NMIBC. For patients randomized to MMC group, TUR was performed with glycine as irrigant (for those undergoing bipolar TUR, normal saline was used). A three-way catheter was placed into the bladder and the inflow port was attached to a saline infusion bag while still in the operating room. A single dose of intravesical MMC (40 mg in 20 mL saline) was instilled within 6 h of TUR through the outflow port in the recovery room and the outflow tubing was clamped with a hemostat. After 1 h, the outflow tubing was released and saline was run through the irrigation port. All intervention was done using strict aseptic precautions. For patients randomized to CSWI group, TUR was performed with sterile water as irrigant. Thorough bladder wash was performed on table with 1 L sterile water following TUR. CSWI was continued for next 24 h, that is, 2000 mL/h for first hour, 1000 mL/h for next 3 h, and 250 mL/h for 14&#x02013;18 h: a total of 8.5&#x02013;9.5 L.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Data collection</title><p>An expert pathologist reviewed all hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of surgical specimens of tumor collected from each patient.

Urologists blinded to the form of postoperative intravesical therapy performed cystoscopy. All enrolled patients were followed up with check cystoscopy and urine cytology at 3-monthly interval for 1 year. Tumor recurrence was defined as identification of tumor at cystoscopy and/or positive urine cytology.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was recurrence-free rate at 1 year, whereas recurrence-free interval was estimated as secondary outcome measure. In addition, postoperative complications of local toxicities such as macrohematuria, irritative bladder symptoms, micturition pain, frequency of urination, and systemic toxicities were examined. Tumor progression was also monitored.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous variables were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, whereas categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentages.

The sex-wise distribution of NMIBC showed a clear male preponderance with a male to female ratio of 12:1. This is much higher compared to western literature, which can be due to the decreased exposure to industrial carcinogens as fewer number of women work outside the home. In the present study, we randomized 39 patients with bladder tumor following cystoscopy, with visual impression of NMIBC. Of them, 36 were found to have NMIBC on final biopsy. This is in concordance with other studies,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] indicating that combination of negative urine cytology and cystoscopic expertise accurately identifies histologically confirmed low-grade and low-stage tumors in &#x0003e;90% cases.</p><p>In the present study, the overall recurrence-free rate at 12 months was 47% for the MMC group and 52.6% for the CSWI group. Further, the mean recurrence-free interval was 10.9 (range: 10.05&#x02013;11.8) months and 9.78 (range 8.4&#x02013;11.17) months for MMC and CSWI group, respectively. These observations may imply that continuous postoperative intravesical instillation of sterile water in NMIBC could have similar or even better efficacy compared to a single intravesical cytostatic factor administration. A retrospective study by Grivas <italic>et al</italic>. have also shown that single and multiple bladder tumors receiving sterile water irrigation had a recurrence-free rate similar to those receiving immediate single dose of MMC.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In another study by Onishi <italic>et al</italic>., the recurrence-free rate at the end of 1 year with continuous saline bladder irrigation (<italic>n</italic> = 123) and intravesical instillation of MMC (<italic>n</italic> = 115) after TUR were 76.7% and 81%, respectively, for patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC. They found no significant difference in the recurrence-free rate, the period to first recurrence and frequency of recurrence between the two groups.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In a recent publication, Onishi <italic>et al</italic>. showed similar 5-year recurrence-free rates for continuous saline bladder irrigation and MMC group (62 vs. 70.4% P<sub>LogRank</sub> = 0.53), where median time to recurrence was 8 months in saline irrigation group and 8.5 months in MMC group.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the recurrence-free rate for intermediate-risk tumors was 40% in the CSWI group and 60% in the MMC group. The low recurrence-free rate in our study can be attributed to less number of patients in each subgroup. We also observed that the recurrence-free rate was low for both MMC and CSWI groups in high-risk tumors. Analysis of outcomes according to Tumor staging revealed that recurrence-free rates in MMC and CSWI groups were distinctly better for Ta tumors than for T1 tumors. On the other hand, analysis of outcomes according to tumor grading revealed that recurrence-free rates in MMC and CSWI groups were comparable for low-grade and high-grade tumors. Further, the efficacy of CSWI for low-grade tumors in the present study was comparable to that with Grivas <italic>et al</italic>. study in terms of recurrence-free rates (55% and 61%, respectively) and recurrence-free interval (11 months and 15 months respectively).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In the present study, the number of patients with high-grade tumors was very small. Further, the complication rates in our study are similar to a study by Onishi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title/><sec id="sec3-11"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The major limitation of the present study is its small sample size and short follow-up period. Another drawback of our study is that three patients were excluded from the analysis after randomization, as histopathology was not compatible with the inclusion criteria of our study.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Findings of the present randomized pilot study indicate that continuous bladder irrigation with sterile water after TUR may be comparable to immediate intravesical MMC in preventing tumor recurrence in NMIBC with significantly lower adverse effects.
