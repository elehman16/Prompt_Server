SMARTER will determine whether physician-delivered step count prescriptions reduce arterial stiffness over a one-year period, compared with usual care, in sedentary overweight/obese adults with DM2/hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Randomized, allocation-concealed, assessor-blind, multisite clinical trial. The primary outcome is change in arterial stiffness over one year. The secondary outcomes include changes in physical activity, individual vascular risk factors, medication use, and anthropometric parameters. Assessments are at baseline and one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants are sedentary/low active adults with 25&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;BMI &#x0003c; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> followed for DM2/hypertension by a collaborating physician. The active arm uses pedometers to track daily step counts and review logs with their physicians at 3 to 4-month intervals. A written step count prescription is provided at each visit, aiming to increase counts by &#x02265;3,000 steps/day over one year, with an individualized rate increase. The control arm visits physicians at the same frequency and receives advice to engage in physical activity 30-60 minutes/day. SMARTER will enroll 364 individuals to detect a 10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5% difference in arterial stiffness change between arms. Arterial stiffness is assessed noninvasively with carotid femoral pulse wave velocity using applanation tonometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The importance of SMARTER lies not simply in the use of pedometer-based monitoring but also on its integration into a prescription-based intervention delivered by the treating physician. Equally important is the measurement of impact of this approach on a summative indicator of arterial health, arterial stiffness.

In the National Health Interview Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], walking 120 minutes or more each week resulted in a 40% relative mortality rate reduction over 12 years. In the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], those in the highest quartile of walking lowered their risk of heart attack, stroke, and related mortality by more than 30% over a decade. However, walking levels have declined in an era of Internet transactions, &#x02018;smart&#x02019; phones, and &#x02018;social networking,&#x02019; contributing to escalating rates of obesity and its detrimental consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A meta-analysis indicates that the integration of physical activity promotion into primary care is associated with a 42% increase in self-reported activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The Green Prescription approach (physical activity-based prescriptions with three telephone-based support calls from trained counselors) has been widely implemented in the primary care context in New Zealand and has demonstrated sustained increases in physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These approaches, however, require paramedical staff support which may not be feasible in many settings. A more physician-driven approach had some effect on physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but physicians generally lack the skills or time to provide more complex physical activity counseling, despite calls for more specific prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this regard, step count monitors such as pedometers may be a useful tool.</p><p>Pedometers permit simple, real-time tracking of walking and other step-related activity. Among NAVIGATOR trial participants (Nateglinide and Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]), both pedometer-assessed daily step counts at baseline (hazard ratio [HR] per 2,000 steps/day 0.90, 95% CI 0.84&#x02013;0.96) and change in step counts over an average follow-up of 6 years (HR per 2,000 steps/day increase 0.92, 95% CI 0.86&#x02013;0.99) led to reductions in cardiovascular disease events. These effects were independent of one another and also independent of underlying co-morbidities and changes in body mass index (BMI). Group pedometer-based programs increase physical activity levels and improve vascular risk profiles. In a meta-analysis of eight clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], such interventions led to a 2,491 daily step increase [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1,098 to 3,885], a -3.8 mm Hg change in systolic blood pressure (95% CI -5.9 to -1.7) and a -0.38 kg/m<sup>2</sup> change in BMI (95% CI -0.05 to -0.72). These programs, however, may not be available or sustainable. Self-monitoring and target setting could be an inexpensive and accessible option, with assistance through web-based tools, but for many individuals this may not provide sufficient accountability and motivational support, elements deemed important to change health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Integration of pedometer-based monitoring into routine medical visits, however, could help meet the need for accountability and support, without requiring additional staffing. We have developed such a strategy and we are testing it through a randomized controlled trial, as described herein. In our strategy, participants self-monitor and track step counts. They review these records with their physicians who then assist them in setting realistic step count targets, consistent with the monitoring-prescription-monitoring-adjusted prescription dynamic approach to which both physicians and patients are accustomed. Many patients with DM2 and hypertension self-monitor glucose and blood pressure levels; based on this information, their physicians are better-positioned to prescribe and adjust medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Such a strategy has not previously been evaluated for physical activity monitoring. A recent Green Prescription trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] integrated pedometer-based self-monitoring in a clinic setting and demonstrated higher activity levels, but again the intervention structure relied on paramedical clinic staff, rather than being routinely integrated as a component of medical visits with a physician. Thus the physician-patient relationship, an important factor in adherence to medications and physical activity, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] was a less important factor in the intervention. In contrast, this is arguably the most important element of the SMARTER strategy. Another trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] did examine a physician-delivered intervention in DM2 and demonstrated a step count increase over a 12-week period but did not examine vascular effects; we are evaluating a one-year physician-delivered intervention and its impact on a summative indicator of arterial health, arterial stiffness, as described below.</p><p>The previously-cited meta-analysis of group-based pedometer interventions demonstrated reductions in blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While blood pressure is one important indicator of arterial health, recent technological developments have allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of the arterial system through measurement of arterial stiffness, capturing the summative impact of vascular risk factors. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that higher arterial stiffness is associated with increased risk of vascular disease and events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In a trial among DM2 patients, a three-month supervised exercise program conferred a 20% greater reduction in arterial stiffness compared to usual care alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Higher daily step counts have been associated with lower carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), the gold standard measure of arterial stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>We are conducting a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of a physician-delivered step count prescriptions on arterial stiffness in sedentary overweight/obese adults with DM2 and/or hypertension. We present herein the design and methods of the SMARTER (Step Monitoring to improve ARTERial health) trial. Our primary objective is to assess the impact of the intervention on cfPWV using applanation tonometry. Our secondary objectives are to assess effects on individual vascular risk factors, medication use, anthropometric parameters, and physical activity, as detailed below.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The SMARTER trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01475201).

A high-fidelity micromanometer is placed on the tip of a hand-held tonometer (SPC-301; Millar Instruments, Houston, TX, USA) and applied to the skin overlying the radial artery to flatten but not occlude the artery.

The control arm receives advice to engage in 30-60 minutes of activity daily, consistent with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In the active arm, the physician writes a step count prescription at each visit. As previously noted, pedometer-based interventions led to a 2,491 daily step increase in a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A step count increment of 2,500 to 3,000 steps is roughly equivalent to 30 minutes of walking at a moderate pace, as established through direct counts of individuals walking on a treadmill at a workload of 3 metabolic equivalents (METS)/minute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In the SMARTER active arm, the aim is to achieve a net increase over baseline values of at least 3,000 steps/day over one year. DM2 and hypertension follow-up visits are recommended at 3 to 4 month intervals. Testing an intervention over 1 year permits 3 to 4 contacts with the treating physician but still respects the reality of usual clinical follow-up. This is important if the results of this trial are to be implemented in real-world practice following the trial itself. A 1-year study duration will mean that participants are examined at roughly the same time of year (i.e., season) at the baseline and final assessments. This will help ensure that any changes demonstrated are not attributable to seasonal differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Finally, many physical activity intervention studies have been criticized as being too short in duration; we suggest that a 1-year period of intervention and follow-up provides a reasonable time frame over which to evaluate effects.</p><p>The rapidity at which this is achieved is individually-tailored (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The baseline step count value is provided by the research team as derived from the baseline assessment. The general time frame for the increase by 3,000 steps/day is 10 months for sedentary participants (&#x0003c;5,000 steps/day), 7 months for low active participants (5,000-7,499 steps/day), and 5 months for somewhat active participants (7,500-9,999 steps/day). Subsequent prescriptions are based on step counts achieved and individual circumstances.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Step count prescription framework by baseline activity category.</bold> Months in red are those at which a clinic visit occurs.

Exercise sessions were three times per week (cycle ergometers, treadmills). They demonstrated a 13.9% reduction in cfPWV in the intervention arm compared with a 4.4% increase in the control arm (i.e., an 18.3% difference). To be conservative, we aim to detect a 10% difference between our active and control trial arms to an accuracy of&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5% over a one-year period. This implies that our CI for the difference will be narrow enough to rule out only trivial effects. Based on the report by Madden and colleagues, we estimate a standard deviation (SD) of 28 in the active treatment arm [standard error, SE* sqrt (n) = 6.7 * sqrt(17)] and 14 for the control arm [3.3*sqrt (17)]. Under these conditions, with&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5% CI width, we will need to retain 151 per arm (i.e., 302 in total). Allowing for a loss to follow-up of up to 17% based on our previous studies, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] we require a sample size of 364 individuals (i.e., 182 per arm).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Our main outcome is percentage change in arterial stiffness (i.e., cfPWV) within each trial arm. We will calculate mean between trial arm differences in &#x0201c;after minus before changes&#x0201d;, with 95% CIs (intent-to-treat analysis). In addition to examining between trial arm differences in percentage change from baseline arterial stiffness, we will also evaluate between arm absolute differences in raw &#x0201c;after minus before changes&#x0201d; in cfPWV. Although trial arms are likely to be similar at baseline, we may use a linear model to adjust for any possible differences between arms for important covariates (e.g., baseline daily steps, baseline BMI, age, sex, changes in medications). If relevant, in a sensitivity analysis, we will use multiple imputation to impute missing data. A similar approach will be used to examine between-arm differences in daily steps and vascular risk factors. We will also correlate increments in steps to changes in arterial stiffness, anthropometric parameters, and specific vascular risk factors. Finally, we may employ additional secondary analyses (e.g., per protocol analyses; analyses in DM2 alone, hypertension alone, DM2 and hypertension; analyses in participants with and without medication changes).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The SMARTER trial is testing an innovative step count prescription strategy delivered by physicians to their patients with DM2 or hypertension. The focus on daily step counts arguably simplifies the process of physical activity prescription. Increasingly, physicians and patients are partners in monitoring and managing chronic diseases. Such partnerships can improve patient adherence and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Less than one third of North Americans achieve the recommended 10,000 steps/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and we have demonstrated that in adults with DM2 and/or hypertension, mean counts are low at approximately 5,000 steps/day, with a further 15% reduction during fall and winter months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. &#x0201c;Re-engineering&#x0201d; walking into daily life could be an effective means of improving the arterial health of patients with DM2 and/or hypertension.</p><p>The effects of the SMARTER intervention are being determined in terms of biological impact, particularly in terms of changes in arterial stiffness as captured by cfPWV. In the Framingham Heart Study, a one SD increment in arterial stiffness was associated with a 48% increase in arterial disease risk, independently of individual vascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A meta-analysis indicates that an increase in cfPWV by 1 m/s corresponds to an age-, sex-, and risk factor-adjusted risk increases of 14%, 15%, and 15% in total cardiovascular disease event rates, cardiovascular mortality, and all cause mortality, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. A recent analysis of the Framingham Offspring study demonstrated that higher aortic stiffness is associated with higher risk of incident hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], suggesting that in some cases stiffness precedes the development of hypertension. Illustrating the responsiveness of cfPWV to higher activity levels, a trial among older patients with vascular risk factors including DM2 demonstrated a 3-month supervised exercise program to confer an important reduction in cfPWV compared to usual care alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We are aware of some potential limitations to the trial. Firstly, physicians cannot be blinded to the intervention given that they are delivering it. However, outcome assessors are blinded to intervention arm status, and both the primary outcome and most of the secondary outcomes are evaluated objectively (i.e., assays or automated measurements). We acknowledge the possibility of contamination of the control arm: that is, physicians may be tempted to employ the SMARTER intervention in the control arm, particularly if they perceive benefit. However, only the active trial arm receives pedometers at the onset of the intervention period. Following the final trial evaluation, the control trial arm participants will be provided with a pedometer in gratitude for their participation, and they will be free to engage in a step count prescription strategy with their treating doctor. This &#x02018;delayed&#x02019; intervention may facilitate adherence to study procedures. Physicians are free to modify medications during the trial period and this could impact some outcomes. To address this possibility, we will perform secondary analyses with (i) adjustment for changes in medications and (ii) restriction to participants without such changes. We acknowledge that more frequent contact with physicians and/or other health care team members could strengthen the impact of the intervention; however, DM2 and hypertension follow-up frequently occurs in settings without multidisciplinary teams and the demands of clinical care may render more frequent contact challenging. We have, therefore, designed our intervention to be &#x02018;pragmatic&#x02019; with 3 to 4 follow-up visits over one year accompanied by a written prescription. Patients with DM2 and hypertension generally have common features including insulin resistance and increased risk for vascular disease. The inclusion of participants with DM2 and hypertension, each alone or in combination, allows us to achieve recruitment targets in a reasonable time frame and to generalize our results to groups of patients seen frequently in clinical practice; we will nonetheless perform subgroup analyses (DM2 alone, hypertension alone, DM2 and hypertension in combination).</p><p>We have developed our trial in collaboration with physicians who manage DM2 and hypertension. We held several meetings with over 24 physicians to discuss the intervention. They underscored their need for physical activity promotion tools and viewed the SMARTER strategy to be feasible and easily integrated into clinical practice. They, nonetheless, expressed the need for Level A evidence as derived through a randomized controlled trial. This integrated knowledge translation approach will facilitate future knowledge translation efforts. If effectiveness is demonstrated, we are well-positioned to consider inclusion in Clinical Practice Recommendations for DM2 and hypertension.</p><p>The SMARTER intervention is novel in several respects: (i) It is physician-specific intervention that may be particularly important in understaffed clinics without the support of a full multidisciplinary team. (ii) A specific, signed, stamped written prescription is provided, focusing on step count targets. (iii) The rate of step count titration is individualized, based on baseline step counts, leveraging an existing therapeutic alliance. (iv) The primary outcome is change in arterial stiffness, a summative indicator of arterial health. Prior pedometer-based intervention studies have examined specific individual vascular risk factors but to our knowledge, none have evaluated a summative indicator of arterial health (arterial stiffness) as the primary outcome. (v) A shortcoming of prior studies has often been a lack of attention to medication use. This is being carefully recorded during our trial and we will perform subgroup analyses in those with and without medication changes (e.g., antihypertensive agents, antihyperglycemic agents, lipid-lowering agents). We will further evaluate changes in medication use as a secondary outcome. (vi) This will be one of the largest pedometer intervention trials ever conducted (364 participants).</p><p>In summary, the potential impact of the SMARTER intervention relates not only to the use of pedometers but rather to its incorporation into clinical care, leveraging the physician-patient therapeutic alliance. A key strength of the SMARTER trial is the ability to capture biological impact through measurement of arterial stiffness. Demonstration of effectiveness of the SMARTER intervention has strong potential to lead to wide and sustained adoption in clinical practice with integration in DM2 and hypertension management.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: Body mass index; DM2: Type 2 diabetes; CI: Confidence interval; cfPWV: Carotid femoral pulse wave velocity; PWA: Pulse wave analysis; PWV: Pulse wave velocity; ECG: Electrocardiogram; VO2max: Maximum oxygen uptake; HDL-C: High density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C: Low density lipoprotein cholesterol; Hemoglobin A1C: Glycosylated hemoglobin; HPLC: High performance liquid chromatography; MET: Metabolic equivalent; CVD: Cardiovascular disease</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KD and SSD conceived and designed the study and co-wrote the study protocol, with critical input from ER and the SMARTER collaborators.
