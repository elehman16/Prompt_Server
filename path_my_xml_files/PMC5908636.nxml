Combined evaluation of the lungs and the mediastinal structures is often indicated in oncologic patients and can be achieved by i.v. contrast media injections. The broad availability and rapid technological evolution of CT are leading to a steadily increasing number of indications and examinations.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> However, the adverse effects of ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast media (CM) are ongoing reasons for concern. According to the linear-no-threshold model in cancerogenesis by ionizing radiation,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> radiation dose has to be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ie, the ALARA principle).<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Intravenous application of iodised CM might impair renal function and induce a hypersensitivity reaction or thyrotoxic crisis.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> A correlation between the extent of CM-induced nephropathy and CM dose has been reported in literature.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>Several technical solutions have been proposed to achieve a substantial radiation dose reduction while maintaining image quality on a diagnostic level. Online tube current modulation (TCM) with respect to patient geometry is widely implemented in routine protocols.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Reduction of the tube voltage decreases the radiation dose and increases the image contrast, with the shortcoming of increased image noise.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Hence, automated tube voltage adaptation (TVA) algorithms were designed to individually combine adjustment of the tube voltage and the tube current using attenuation information from the localizer to provide an optimum for both radiation dose reduction and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for each individual.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>However, the increased image contrast obtained by reduced tube voltages in CM-enhanced CT additionally offers the opportunity for reduction of the CM dosage by reducing the iodine delivery rate.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> But most x-ray tubes are unable to completely compensate for the increased image noise at reduced tube voltages by increasing the tube current. Therefore, iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms have been used to balance the image noise in examinations with reduced tube voltages and reduced CM dosage. They have proven their ability to substantially decrease the image noise at a given radiation dose and can therefore be used to obtain diagnostic image quality even at reduced radiation exposures.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>The wide range of individual settings for the TVA and IR algorithms means that it is challenging to find a combination that provides a well-balanced mixture of the advantages of each algorithm in clinical routine. The aim of this study was therefore to find an examination protocol for CM-enhanced CT of the chest that provides a consistent image quality compared with a reference at 120&#x0200a;kV, and individually reduces the radiation exposure and CM dosage using the latest techniques with a minimum of complexity for medical staff in clinical routine.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>This prospective, single-center study was performed under an institutional review board-approved protocol and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each individual. In all, 112 subsequent patients with a clinical indication for CM-enhanced CT of the chest was enrolled over a time period of 3 months and randomly assigned either to the reference (A: n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) or study group (B: n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;62) without restrictions by the radiographer using simple coin toss.

Interobserver agreement was substantial: the kappa value was 0.73 overall, 0.70 in the study group and 0.78 in the control group. Subjective image quality evaluation was not statistically different between the study and the reference groups for overall diagnostic image quality (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.81), image artefacts (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.87), and image noise (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.76).

However, image artefacts slightly increased in the 80-kV images (mean ranks at 80/100/120&#x0200a;kV: 44/61/56), with increased ratings as &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; with acceptable influence on the image quality (score 3) and no rating as &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d; without artefacts (score 5), were statistically significant compared with the 100-kV subgroup (pair-wise post hoc <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.02).</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Results of subjective image evaluation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e0388-g010"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>The systematically designed study protocol provided equivalent objective and subjective image quality, despite the substantial reduction in radiation exposure and iodine dosage, each by approximately one-third, when compared with the reference, by combined and individually adapted application of the latest technical developments in contrast-enhanced CT of the chest.</p><p>Many articles have recently been published concerning the advantages of low tube voltage examinations of the chest considering increased CNR or decreased radiation doses.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Further literature states show that it is feasible to reduce iodine dosage by taking advantage from the increased iodine contrast, whenever the x-ray spectra converge towards the k-edge of iodine (33.2&#x0200a;keV), for several indications.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> In the chest, Szucs-Farkas et al<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> found comparable image quality for patients with pulmonary embolisms, and reduction of the iodine load by 37% and the radiation dose by 57%, if the tube voltage was reduced from 120 to 80&#x0200a;kV. Zhang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> found increased image quality for a coronary CT angiography protocol, with iodine reduced by 52% and radiation dose by 56% using a combination of tube voltage reduction from 100 to 80&#x0200a;kV and different IR algorithms in rather high-dose protocol (5.5 and 2.4&#x0200a;mSv). However, none of these studies was performed following an equivalence hypothesis. This study provides a systematic approach to find the highest extent of iodine dosage and radiation dose reduction that is suitable for each individual patient by automated TVA, TCM, and IR. The extent of both reductions of the iodine dosage (35%) and the radiation dose (31%) lies within the overall range of previously published studies. Moreover, this study provides detailed insight into the gradual effects of different settings of the current technical developments and their synergetic interaction on 1 side, and on the other, provides examples of judicious combinations for a clinical routine collective.</p><p>However, there are some limitations of this study that need to be addressed. First, despite the lowest radiation dose in the 80-kV subgroup, the objective image quality for the aortic measurements was superior compared with both the reference collective and the 100-kV subgroups. Hence, a further decrease of the iodine dosage and radiation dose might have been possible in these patients. Second, we intentionally did not evaluate the second protocol given by the ex-ante trials (TVA grade 11, IR-level 2) to prevent a further divergence between the subgroups and avoid conflicts with the tube capacities, because insufficient tube current modulation is a well-known limitation for low tube voltage examinations. The increased image artefacts in the 80-&#x0200a;kV subgroup confirmed this decision. Nevertheless, this might be a suitable approach to further exploit the advantages of low tube voltages. Moreover, the latest x-ray tubes have increased outputs and allow for narrow adjustment of the tube voltage in steps by only 10&#x0200a;kV and down to 70&#x0200a;kV. Thus, more aggressive settings of TVA and higher IR levels are promising and should be evaluated for future scanner generations. Third, for this proof of concept, we did not yet evaluate a certain population or certain indications and therefore did not evaluate diagnostic accuracy. Fourth, our findings provide information about chest CT in a late aortopulmonary contrast setting without individual identification of the circulation time. Transfer of these findings to angiographic procedures or soft tissue imaging has to be confirmed by further studies. Fifth, we used a dilution of the contrast media bolus in order to keep the total volume and therewith bolus dynamic unchanged. Our results cannot be transferred to injectors that are incapable for dual flow setting.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that the average iodine dosage, and also the average radiation exposure in patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT of the chest can be reduced by one-third if individual TVA, TCM, and IR are judiciously combined in a structured examination protocol to provide a consistent image quality in a clinical routine setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Petra Ruse, Antje Heunemann, and Stephan Kunzelmann for excellent patient management, and Thomas Allmendinger, Bernhard Schmidt, and Martin Sedlmair for physical support.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Achim Eller, Rolf Janka, Michael Uder, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Achim Eller, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Achim Eller, Wolfgang Wuest, Stephan Ellmann, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Investigation:</bold> Achim Eller, Wolfgang Wuest, Marc Saake, Stephan Ellmann, Nadine Kaemmerer, Matthias Hammon, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Achim Eller, Stephan Ellmann, Michael Uder, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Project administration:</bold> Achim Eller, Rolf Janka, Michael Uder, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Resources:</bold> Marc Saake, Nadine Kaemmerer, Matthias Hammon, Michael Uder, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Wolfgang Wuest, Marc Saake, Matthias Hammon, Rolf Janka, Michael Uder, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Validation:</bold> Matthias Hammon, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Visualization:</bold> Stephan Ellmann, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Achim Eller, Matthias Stefan May.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Wolfgang Wuest, Marc Saake, Stephan Ellmann, Nadine Kaemmerer, Matthias Hammon, Rolf Janka, Michael Uder.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AV = attenuation value, BMI = body mass index, CM = contrast media, CNR = contrast-to-noise ratio, CT = computed tomography, CTDI<sub>vol</sub> = volumetric CT dose index, DLP = dose length product, ED = effective dose, FBP = filtered back projection, HU = Hounsfield units, IR = iterative reconstruction, ROI = region of interest, SD = standard deviation, SNR = signal-to-noise ratio, TCM = tube current modulation, TVA = tube voltage adaptation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brenner</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name></person-group>
