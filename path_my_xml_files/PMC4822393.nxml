Therapeutic treatment includes traditional surgery, cystoscopy or laparoscopy micro invasive operation and chemotherapy. Most patients still require post chemotherapy treatment after the operation to enhance tumor apoptosis rate and improve survival and prognosis. Cystoscopy is widely applied in the diagnosis, therapy and review of tumors, which has the advantages of being a simple operation with minimal trauma, quick recovery and high accuracy. However, bladder cancer itself strikes a serious blow to patients, and it significantly lowers the quality of life with the addition of operative trauma, complications of chemotherapy and postoperative bladder colostomy.</p><p>Nursing services that cooperate with clinical treatment plays an important role in the aspects of improving the confidence of patients, building a harmonious doctor-patient relationship, enhancing compliance and improving the living status of patients (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).

Through the application of extended nursing services on patients with bladder cancer after endoscopic bladder electrosection, it improves the effect and long-term prognosis of patients, which provides new strategies for nursing measures for patients with this disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>General Information</title><p>Sixty-six patients diagnosed with bladder cancer in Laiwu People&#x02019;s Hospital(NO. 001, Xueyehu Street, Changshao Road, Laiwu, Shandong, China) between February 2012 and February 2014 and underwent endoscopic bladder electrosection were enrolled into the study. All patients were pathologically confirmed, and had indications of endoscopic bladder electrosection. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Recurrent bladder cancer, operation history of bladder and secondary bladder tumor. 2) The combination of serious organ dysfunctions of the heart, liver and kidney, and the estimated survival time no more than 12 months; 3) Poor compliant and patients who rejected this research.</p><p>After obtaining approval of the admission of Ethics Committee of Laiwu People&#x02019;s Hospital and the informed consent of patients and their relatives, patients were randomly allocated into the control group (n=30 cases) and the observation group (n=36 cases) according to the order of hospitalization. The control group consisted of 21 male patients and 9 female patients with the age ranging between 48 and 69 yr and with an average age of 53.7&#x000b1;10.5 yr. The control group also consisted of 22 patients with superficial bladder cancer, eight patients with invasive bladder cancer and five patients with abdominal wall fistulation. The observation group consisted of 25 male patients and 11 female patients with the age ranging between 45 and 71 and with an average age of 55.2&#x000b1;11.4. The observation group also consisted of 25 patients with superficial bladder cancer, 11 patients with invasive bladder cancer and 8 patients with abdominal wall fistulation.

As well as possible complications and corresponding treatment measures, the introductions of the ward&#x02019;s environment, doctor-in-charge and duty nurses, taking medicines according to the doctor&#x02019;s advice and using a calling service when feeling uncomfortable.</p><p>Patients in the observation group were given extended nursing service measures, and service connotations were specifically optimized from two aspects; content and scope, including 1) Patients revisit archives are established (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Detailed personal information was registered when patients entered the hospital (kept privately), and their personal details and family backgrounds were acquired. This was beneficial to conduct psychological comfort and enhance their confidence of overcoming the disease. Sufficient communications with their relatives were carried out in order to coordinate in the disease treatment. Regular telephone follow-up or outpatient reviews were carried out post hospitalization to acquire the living conditions of patients and adapt them accordingly. Operative counter-measures were also given to prevent difficulties such as disease recurrence and complications. 2) Responsible medical group were established (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); aiming at patient groups of the same disease and of the same therapeutic strategy. Highly qualified doctors and nursing teams were established, with one doctor and two nurses allocated to every three patients.</p><p>After relevant trainings, a simple and programmed survey form was designed, and specific therapeutic methods and nursing contents were fully explained to patients and their relatives. As a result, the enthusiasm of active participation of the patients was established. The degree of accomplishment of the specific form content was evaluated by the head nurse or the nurse-in-charge, and was regarded as qualified only when the complete target rate reached 95%. 3) Various forms of educational activities were carried out (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), including lectures conducted on health education, voluntary medical consultations in communities, health brochures, consultations via telephone and online questioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Observation Indexes</title><p>The differences of the occurrence rate of postoperative complications (infection, haemorrhage, bedsore and malnutrition), length of hospital stay, nursing service satisfaction (nursing questionnaire was adopted, and three categories of very satisfied, satisfied and dissatisfied were divided) between the groups were compared.

Extended nursing modes adapts to diversify and multi-layered health requirements of patients, gradually extends to families and communities, and plays an active role in nursing for the aged, patients with chronic diseases and palliative care patients (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Drawing on the experience of extended nursing servicein China and abroad, Laiwu People&#x02019;s Hospital provides &#x0201c;seamless&#x0201d; continuous nursing service for patients who require nursing post hospitalization, whole-range nursing for patients from hospital admission to post hospitalization home nursing. It includes regular follow-ups including phone calls, text messages, e-mails, home revisits, outpatient health educations and patient meeting activities. Attention is also paid to the communication within the nursing service of community hospitals, achieving the &#x0201c;seamless&#x0201d; connection of high quality nursing from leaving the hospital to the stage of home recovery, improving the self-management abilities and quality of life for patients, lowering the possibility of rehospitalization, and reducing the financial medical burden on society (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Past researches focused more on various studies based on post hospitalization, including establishing communication with patients, instructing the health of patients post hospitalization and the right method of nursing, and thus improved the long-term prognosis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). By expanding the content and scope of extended nursing during hospitalization and post hospitalization as well as combining high-quality nursing and specific nursing, this research provides whole-range, high-quality and continuous nursing services. Patients with bladder cancer are at risk of losing confidence, become seriously anxious and depressed, or even commit suicide because of fearing they will develop tumors. This can be a burden to the family and society. In addition, high expenses of operations and chemotherapies can also bring serious economic burdens to the family. Post hospitalization treatment for complications may also be required and bring serious negative effects to patients&#x02019; life and work. Improving aspects of specialization, humanization, enhancing nursing post hospitalization and follow-up visits, extended nursing service significantly improves quality of life for patients, and lowers the recurrence rate of tumors to a certain degree (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Based upon this research, the occurrence rate of postoperative complications within the hospital for the observation group was significantly lower than that of control group, length of hospital stay was significantly shortened, and nursing service satisfaction was significantly improved.
