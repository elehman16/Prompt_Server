In these post hoc analyses from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, forced-dose titration study, clinical efficacy of LDX (30-70 mg/d) in adults with ADHD receiving AMPH treatment at screening vs the overall study population was evaluated. ADHD symptoms were assessed using the ADHD-RS-IV with adult prompts at screening, baseline (after prior treatment washout), and endpoint. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, laboratory findings, and electrocardiogram.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 414 participants (62, placebo; 352, LDX) included in the overall study population, 41 were receiving AMPH therapy at screening (2, placebo; 39, LDX); mean AMPH dose was 35.0 and 34.1 mg/d for participants in placebo and all LDX groups, respectively. Of the 41 participants, 36 remained symptomatic (ADHD-RS-IV &#x0003e;18) at screening despite receiving AMPH. For the 36 participants in the placebo (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) and LDX (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;34) groups, respectively, at endpoint, mean change from screening ADHD-RS-IV total scores were -5.5 and -14.8 and from baseline scores were -13.5 and -17.8. For the overall study population, endpoint mean change from baseline ADHD-RS-IV total scores were -7.8 for placebo and -17.5 for LDX. In the prior AMPH subgroup, 2/2 (100.0%) in the placebo group and 22/39 (56.4%) participants in the LDX (all doses) group reported any TEAE. Events that occurred in &#x02265;5% for LDX were dry mouth (5/39; 12.8%), headache (5/39; 12.8%), fatigue (3/39; 7.7%), insomnia (3/39; 7.7%), decreased appetite (2/39; 5.1%), and nausea (2/39; 5.1%).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Currently, psychostimulants, both amphetamines (AMPH) and methylphenidate (MPH), are considered first-line ADHD pharmacotherapy in adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Clinically nonresponsive patients treated with one psychostimulant will often obtain an improved clinical response when switched to another psychostimulant class; possibly because classes may differ in mechanisms of action
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As reviewed by Arnold and colleagues, AMPH and MPH are reuptake inhibitors of norepinephrine and dopamine (DA)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, AMPH also stimulates neurotransmitter release from presynaptic receptors.</p><p>Moreover, it is observed in psychiatry that, when patients exhibit efficacy or tolerability concerns while on a treatment, it is not uncommon in clinical practice (e.g., depression treatment) for a patient to be switched to a different medication within the same class
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In ADHD treatment and management, this has included switching from an immediate-release or short-acting formulation to a long-acting formulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], or from a racemic mixture to a single enantiomer formulation (e.g., d-MPH)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The AMPH class of psychostimulants comprises short- and long-acting formulations of mixed AMPH salts (MAS) and MAS extended release (MAS XR), respectively, and d-AMPH formulations, including short-acting d-AMPH and long-acting d-AMPH (d-AMPH-ER), and the prodrug lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX). LDX is a long-acting prodrug stimulant indicated for ADHD treatment in children (6 to 12 years), adolescents (13 to 17 years), and adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The inactive prodrug is converted, primarily in the blood, to l-lysine and therapeutically active d-AMPH
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. MAS XR is a once-daily beaded formulation, also indicated for ADHD treatment in children (6 to 12 years), adolescents (13 to 17 years), and adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Overall, studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of LDX and MAS XR in adults with ADHD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, a qualitative comparison in a matched-group post hoc analysis suggested that LDX provided greater improvement in ADHD symptoms
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Unlike LDX, the pharmacokinetic profile of MAS XR is altered by gastrointestinal pH variations, as assessed by coadministration with a proton pump inhibitor that reduces stomach acid
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>A PubMed literature search of relevant papers produced none that systematically assessed treatment response in patients switched between different formulations of the same class of stimulant (e.g., from one MPH or AMPH formulation to another). Therefore, a study assessing treatment effects of a more recent psychostimulant formulation in adults who remain symptomatic while using another psychostimulant formulation may be useful to clinicians choosing between treatment options for adults with ADHD.</p><p>The objectives of these post hoc analyses were to assess the efficacy of LDX in adults with ADHD who remained symptomatic on AMPH therapy (various formulations) prior to enrollment vs the overall study population in a 4-week, placebo-controlled, LDX trial. Comparing symptomatic recent and prior AMPH users to the overall study population of adults with ADHD treated with LDX can aid clinicians in determining if LDX may be a viable treatment option after another AMPH medication has been used with suboptimal treatment response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, forced-dose titration, 4-week study that evaluated efficacy of LDX (30, 50, and 70 mg/d) vs placebo in adults (18 to 55 years) with ADHD.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As reviewed by Steele and colleagues, when individuals are treated (with or without medication), symptomatic remission in ADHD should be defined as a &#x0201c;loss of diagnostic status, minimal or no symptoms, and optimal functioning&#x0201d;

Twenty-two of 420 (5.2%) participants were discontinued due to TEAEs in the overall safety population. In this population, there were no deaths, and 2 of 420 (0.5%) participants had serious AEs (leg injury due to motor vehicle accident [LDX 30 mg/d group] and postoperative knee pain [LDX 70 mg/d group]). Both reported serious AEs were considered not treatment-related, and participants were discontinued.</p><p>At endpoint for the overall safety population, small mean increases in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) from baseline were not statistically significant vs placebo. At endpoint for pulse, the slight mean difference vs placebo was significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.0018). There were no significant meaningful changes in QTcF interval data from baseline between the placebo and LDX groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In these post hoc analyses, adults with significant baseline ADHD symptoms in the prior AMPH group, despite adequate mean AMPH treatment dose and duration of prior treatment (only 1 participant was treated for &#x0003c;4 weeks), showed improvements in symptoms with LDX treatment similar to the overall study population. Improvement in ADHD symptoms in LDX-treated adults was similar in the prior AMPH subgroup and overall efficacy population. Moreover, global severity at baseline and global symptom improvement with LDX treatment were comparable across all treatment groups in the prior AMPH subgroup and overall efficacy population.</p><p>One study suggests that, although psychostimulants (both AMPH and MPH) are effective in ADHD management, some participants responded better to one type of psychostimulant than to the other
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, results of studies that assess treatment response after switching between agents in the same class are few. A comparative review of psychostimulants suggests that many studies assessing differences between psychostimulants do not show comparisons at the individual participant level
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, it is unknown if patient variability in terms of prior treatment history may affect response to current treatment.</p><p>This study suggests a differential response to various ADHD formulations within the same class of psychostimulants may occur, as indicated by the improved clinical response with LDX treatment in participants who had significant ADHD symptoms despite prior AMPH therapy. Although conducted in animals with results that may not apply to humans, a study by Joyce et al supports this contention; potential variability in response based on formulation differences among the same AMPH class of psychostimulants was suggested by differential response in AMPH-evoked DA release with MAS (racemic mixture of 76% d-AMPH and 24% l-AMPH salts), d-AMPH, and d, l-AMPH in the rat striatum
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Such variations in neurotransmitter release based on the differing formulations of the same class of psychostimulant may play a pivotal role in intrapatient variability to treatment response. LDX, which is a prodrug of d-AMPH covalently bound to therapeutically inactive l-lysine, has demonstrated consistent and low inter-and intrapatient pharmacokinetic variability in d-AMPH mean observed maximum drug concentration and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity<sub>,</sub> as well as consistent delivery of d-AMPH in adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although a small amount of LDX is hydrolyzed to d-AMPH in the gastrointestinal tract, the conversion into active d-AMPH occurs primarily in the blood. The LDX conversion to d<italic>-</italic>AMPH is unlikely to be affected by gastrointestinal pH and variations in normal gastrointestinal transit times
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Another open-label, adult study that assessed LDX and MAS XR pharmacokinetics, alone or in combination with omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) demonstrated that MAS XR-treated participants on omeprazole experienced a shortened time to maximum drug concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of &#x02265;1 hour in more than 50% of participants vs MAS-XR alone. However, LDX combination therapy with omeprazole resulted in shortened T<sub>max</sub> in only 25% of participants vs LDX alone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, the study indicated that the distribution around the median d-AMPH T<sub>max</sub> for LDX was unaffected by omeprazole administration, although for MAS XR the dispersion was compressed. These aforementioned study data suggest a variable pharmacokinetic response even among the same class of psychostimulants. Data in animal models suggest that amphetamine formulations may differ in their pharmacodynamic effects as well. In rats administered equivalent doses of LDX and d-AMPH, increases in striatal dopamine release and in locomotor activity were lower in peak effect but more sustained with LDX vs d-AMPH
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>A post hoc comparative qualitative analysis, using groups that were matched based on treatment duration, baseline ADHD symptom severity, and approximately equivalent AMPH doses of LDX and MAS XR in adults with ADHD from 2 similar short-term trials, found that both psychostimulants demonstrated efficacy vs placebo. Safety profiles were consistent with psychostimulant use
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, this qualitative analysis also suggested that LDX treatment vs MAS XR demonstrated greater numerical improvements in ADHD core and global symptoms, as well as decreased frequency of percent differences (active treatment minus placebo) in AEs. Although exploratory in nature, these data suggest that there may be within-class efficacy and safety differences among psychostimulants; however, prospective and quantitative head-to-head comparison trials are needed to confirm these findings.</p><p>Findings from clinical trials have not provided clinicians with sufficient comparative data to adequately assess which psychostimulant may be optimal for individual patients, especially since large variations in response rates to drugs and doses exist, and the best sequence of dispensing the various psychostimulant treatments by the clinician is currently unknown
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Studies such as the present analysis may prove beneficial to clinicians in determining appropriate treatment options after nonresponse or suboptimal response to a particular psychostimulant therapy.</p><p>Overall, the safety profile of LDX was consistent with other long-acting psychostimulants. The frequency of common TEAEs &#x02265;5% appeared to be lower in the LDX-treated prior AMPH groups compared with the overall population, perhaps because these patients were acclimated to the effects of psychostimulant medications. This effect was also seen in a pediatric study of LDX with patient groups that were previously treated with psychostimulants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of this analysis include results that may not be representative of large cohorts because of the small subgroup sample sizes and the study design features discussed below. Since analyses were not designed or powered to assess group differences and were described with summary statistics, prospective studies are needed to confirm these results. The majority of participants were non-Hispanic/non-Latino, white, and moderately to markedly ill at baseline; results may not be able to be generalized to other ethnicities, races, or global illness severity levels. Due to the post hoc nature of this analysis, factors related to prior use of AMPH were not controlled or assessed in the study: despite the knowledge that adequate mean doses of prior AMPH were used, there was no information to determine if these doses were clinically optimized; data on the level of compliance with prior AMPH treatment were also lacking; and individuals with poor tolerability to AMPH would be ineligible to participate in this study, presenting another study limitation. The baseline symptom severity before AMPH treatment was unspecified. In addition, there was no apparent limitation on study enrollment that would exclude participants with sufficient clinical response to prior medication, since symptomatic nonremitters on prior AMPH were not defined by overall clinical response to AMPH, but only by the participant&#x02019;s screening ADHD-RS-IV total score.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, the analyses provide a signal suggesting that, for patients who are not optimally treated with AMPH formulations, LDX remains a potential alternative to consider for the treatment of ADHD in adults. In addition, efficacy outcomes in the prior AMPH subgroup population were consistent with those of the overall study population. The LDX safety profile was consistent with long-acting psychostimulant use. However, this study was not designed to address or compare relative advantages and disadvantages of particular pharmacotherapeutic alternatives. Prospective trials assessing this signal would be helpful in determining the utility of such options in clinical management of patients requiring treatment changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADHD: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; ADHD-RS-IV: ADHD Rating Scale IV; AEs: Adverse events; AMPH: Amphetamine; CGI: Clinical Global Impressions; CGI-I: CGI-Improvement; CGI-S: CGI-Severity; DA: Dopamine; d-AMPH: dextroamphetamine; DSM-IV-TR: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition, Text Revision; ECG: Electrocardiogram; ITT: Intention to treat; LDX: Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate; l-amphetamine: levo-amphetamine; MAS: Mixed AMPH salts; MPH: Methylphenidate; SD: Standard deviation; TEAEs: Treatment-emergent AEs; T<sub>max</sub>: Time to maximum concentration; XR: Extended release.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr Babcock is an employee of Shire and holds stock and/or stock options in Shire.</p><p>Dr Dirks is an employee of Shire and holds stock and/or stock options in Johnson &#x00026; Johnson and Shire.</p><p>Mr Adeyi is an employee of Shire and holds stock and/or stock options in Shire.</p><p>Dr Scheckner is an employee of Shire and holds stock and/or stock options in Shire.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p><bold>TB</bold> was the associate director, Scientific Publications, Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for this study, and made substantial contributions to the analysis and interpretation of the data.
