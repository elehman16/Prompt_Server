This systematic review also concluded that &#x0201c;cotrimoxazole significantly increased survival in HIV infected adults on ART. Further research is needed to determine the optimum duration of CTX treatment in these patients&#x0201d;. Campbell and colleagues carried out a trial in a home based care setting in rural Eastern Uganda in which 836 patients who had been on ART for a median time of 3.7&#x000a0;years and who had a CD4 count above 200&#x000a0;cells/&#x003bc;l were randomised at household level to continue or discontinue CTX prophylaxis in an open label design <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The trial was stopped at the recommendation of the DSMB following the occurrence of significantly higher rates of asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria in the group which stopped CTX (RR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;27.7, 95% CI 6.8, 113.1, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). There was also a significantly higher rate of self-reported diarrhoea, but no difference between the two arms in the incidence of AIDS-related opportunistic infections and no deaths were reported. Recently, a study conducted in Kisumu&#x02014;Kenya compared the effect of CTX cessation <italic>versus</italic> continuation on a composite outcome of death, malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea among HIV infected adults stabilised on ART <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

No additional participants are recruited to replace those withdrawn. Participants withdrawn from trial treatment due to a confirmed CD4 count drop to below 250&#x000a0;cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or due to consent withdrawal are prescribed open label CTX.

Participants are seen monthly for the first three months and 3 monthly thereafter. All participants are provided with an insecticide treated mosquito net (ITN) and educated about the importance of using it. Other medications and investigations are provided as required for the management of the participant's reported disease condition.

The randomisation schedule was produced by an independent statistician at the MRC/UVRI Unit using random permuted blocks of variable size with separate randomisations carried out in four strata, defined by the four possible combinations of study site (Entebbe or Masaka) and baseline CD4 count (250&#x02013;499&#x000a0;cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or &#x02265;&#x000a0;500&#x000a0;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>). Neither study staff nor the endpoint review committee (ERC) members have access to the randomisation schedule. Eligible participants details are entered by the study clinician on the next available row of the enrolment register in accordance with their CD4 count. The trial number corresponding to that row is used on all trial documents and to identify the pre-labelled study medication.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.6</label><title>Unblinding procedures</title><p>The randomisation codes are maintained by the independent trial statistician and a copy is held by the trial pharmacist. Unblinding is discouraged during treatment; if however, a trial clinician considers it necessary for a participant's allocated treatment to be unblinded this is first discussed with the chief investigator. If unblinding is considered appropriate the reason for unblinding is recorded in the unblinding register and an unblinding form is completed and sent to the independent statistician, or in his absence to the pharmacist. The unblinding information is disclosed to the attending clinician and is kept confidential to other study staff and is entered on the database.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.7</label><title>Outcomes</title><p>There are two co-primary outcome measures: time to the first CTX preventable event (either one of the WHO staging events in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> or else a death adjudicated by the ERC to be CTX preventable), and time to the first grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse event. Secondary outcome measures include the following: all-cause mortality; incidence of all CTX preventable events, all clinical events and SAEs; incidence, severity and outcome of all malaria episodes (asymptomatic and symptomatic) confirmed by positive parasitaemia on a blood slide; incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events; mean change in CD4 and haematologic indices after 12&#x000a0;months; adherence to use of ART, trial drug and ITN.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>2.8</label><title>Assessment of adherence</title><p>Adherence to the use of trial drug, ART and ITN is assessed at every scheduled and unscheduled visit using a standard adherence questionnaire and by returned trial drug and ART pill counts.

Under these assumptions a total of 2000 participants would be required, among whom a total of 494 CTX preventable events would be expected. For the co-primary safety end-point a sample size of 1000 per arm would have over 80% power to detect a halving in the rate of grade 3 or 4 haematological events at the 5% level, assuming that at least 10% of those in the arm that continues to receive CTX prophylaxis experience such an event. The sample size was estimated using the formula of Schoenfeld <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><label>2.10</label><title>Trial oversight</title><p>The overall trial oversight is provided by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC). There is an unblinded Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) that meets six monthly and is responsible for reviewing study recruitment targets, the safety and efficacy endpoints and the available external evidence from other related studies. The IDMC is also responsible for advising the TSC on whether to stop, amend or continue the trial as originally planned. The IDMC can recommend stopping the trial if there is overwhelming evidence (as determined by the Peto&#x02013;Haybittle rule) <xref rid="bb0055 bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref> of a difference in the rate of CTX-preventable events between the two arms.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><label>2.11</label><title>Ascertainment of the primary endpoints</title><p>All potential primary endpoints are captured by the study clinicians and adjudicated by the ERC. Haematological events (anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) are assessed through scheduled laboratory tests carried out in the MRC laboratories. Critical CD4 count measurements (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;250&#x000a0;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) are confirmed with a repeat test. The DAIDS toxicity grading tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> are utilized to grade the severity of the measured laboratory parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><label>2.12</label><title>Data management and quality assurance</title><p>A database for the COSTOP trial is custom designed in MS ACCESS. All CRFs are printed in duplicate and the data is double-entered and validated before being uploaded into the database. The data from the Masaka site is transferred and merged with the main trial database in Entebbe every two weeks. The monitoring of the trial to assess adherence to the protocol, respect of participant rights and data quality is done routinely by the MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS monitors and monitors from the East African Consortium for Clinical Research (EACCR) and these are blinded to the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>2.13</label><title>Analysis plan</title><p>Two data sets will be used for analysis namely per protocol (PP) and intention to treat (ITT) populations. The PP population will consist of all subjects who were considered to have taken at least 80% of their blinded study medication in each period between scheduled study visits. Study participants will remain in the per protocol population as long as their adherence as defined above remains at 80% or higher, and will be dropped from the PP data set at the visit at which their adherence during that period drops to below 80%. Such patients will not re-enter the PP data set. The ITT data set will consist of all subjects who took at least one dose of blinded study medication and for whom there is at least one follow-up assessment.</p><p>For the primary analysis of the first co-primary endpoint, namely time to first CTX preventable event or death, the analysis will test for non-inferiority (NI), hence the main analysis will be a per-protocol (PP) analysis. An ITT analysis will also be done on this population as a form of sensitivity analysis. For the primary analysis of the second co-primary endpoint (time to first haematological grade 3 or 4 adverse event) and for all secondary endpoints, analysis will be carried out on the ITT population.</p><p>For all time to event analyses, a subject will be considered to be part of the trial until the subject experiences the event, or the trial ends, the subject leaves the trial (due to withdrawal or loss to follow-up), the subject dies or in the case of the co-primary non-inferiority endpoint, the subject no longer qualifies for the per protocol population.</p><p>The comparative incidence of first clinical events in the two study arms will be illustrated graphically using Kaplan Meier plots. The incidence rate in each arm will be estimated together with 95% confidence limits, since it is considered safe to stop CTX-prophylaxis if the event rate in the experimental arm is sufficiently low (upper limit of 95% confidence interval is below 1 per 100&#x000a0;pyar), even if the formal non-inferiority limit is not met. Non-inferiority will be tested by fitting a Cox proportional hazards regression model with terms for centre (Entebbe or Masaka), CD4 stratum (250&#x02013;499&#x000a0;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>
<italic>vs.</italic> 500 or more cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) and treatment arm and calculating the one sided 95% confidence limit for the hazard ratio for the experimental arm (stopping CTX) relative to the control arm (continuing CTX). The experimental arm will be deemed to be non-inferior to the control arm if the upper limit of the confidence interval is less than 1.25, that is, no more than a 25% increased risk of an endpoint event on the placebo arm. In investigating whether stopping CTX prophylaxis is superior to continuing CTX prophylaxis with respect to the safety endpoint of time to the first grade 3 or grade 4 haematological adverse events, an intention-to-treat approach will be used.</p><p>The frequency of such events will be tabulated by treatment arm, separately for neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Further analyses will be carried out using survival analysis methods. The incidence of grade 3 or grade 4 haematological adverse events will be illustrated graphically using Kaplan Meier plots. The primary analysis will be carried out by means of a log-rank test, stratified by the four randomization strata defined by the combinations of study site and CD4 stratum, to compare the event rates between the two study arms. Further analysis will be carried out by fitting a Cox proportional hazard regression model, with terms for site, CD4 stratum and treatment arm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0080"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of COSTOP is to assess whether CTX prophylaxis can be safely discontinued among HIV-infected African adults that have achieved sustained immune reconstitution following initiation of ART in resource limited settings. According to the recent WHO guidelines <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, completed studies that have evaluated this concept have provided moderate to low quality evidence and the main reason for this is related in part to their design.</p><p>Most clinical trials involving the use of drugs are &#x02018;forward sighted&#x02019;, comparing a new drug to a standard, placebo or no treatment at all. In a situation where stopping the standard treatment (intervention) needs to be compared to the standard treatment itself (control), the choice of study design and the methodological considerations to be made can be quite challenging. A clear example in this case is the design and conduct of CTX cessation studies.</p><p>In our study a non-inferiority design was required since the goal was to determine whether withdrawing CTX would not disadvantage the participant. The use of a matching placebo in the intervention arm in which CTX is withdrawn is particularly important to avoid possible biases associated with knowledge of whether the patient is receiving prophylaxis. It would be very difficult to maintain cessation of CTX prophylaxis among patients randomised to do so in a setting where CTX is readily and cheaply available and CTX widely believed to be always beneficial. Adherence of participants to their allocated treatment arm is clearly much easier if they are unaware of whether they are receiving CTX or placebo. If either the investigators or the patients feel that those allocated to placebo are disadvantaged, this may lead to differential reporting of events and even premature withdrawal of patients from the trial. This could lead to failure to demonstrate non inferiority when it actually exists (type II error). Without double blinding, both the patients and investigators may perceive this to be true based on the previous evidence that HIV infected patients on ART who stop CTX may be at a higher risk of experiencing HIV-related mortality and morbidity <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> while those continuing on CTX may be at risk of adverse drug reactions.</p><p>The dose of CTX is maintained at 960&#x000a0;mg daily as is the current practice since a reduction could result in increased event rates in the control arm making it no longer a true control. Study drug and ART adherence are strictly monitored as differential rates of adherence could lead to erroneous conclusions <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The primary outcome is a composite of morbidity and mortality due to all CTX preventable WHO staging events. The criteria developed by WHO for the diagnosis of these events is based on both definitive and presumptive evidence by the clinician. In this study, an Endpoint Review Committee is established to ensure precise ascertainment of endpoints based on the presumptive/definitive WHO criteria <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Since some diagnoses based on this criterion involve some degree of subjectivity, in the absence of the ERC, a high proportion of incorrect diagnoses could add &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; to the trial results and hence diminish the difference in the arms. All these design considerations are necessary for the non-inferiority trial to be conducted with rigour and avoid making false conclusions about the effectiveness of the intervention <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>We are aware of concerns that patients might have access to unused supplies of CTX or be able to purchase CTX during the study. Ideally, adherence to trial medication would be best assessed by serum level measurements of CTX or its metabolites. However, there is no suitable method that would only detect serum or urine levels of CTX or its metabolites without being affected by other drugs that patients take. In the absence of a suitable test it was decided to conduct end-of-trial interviews by independent researchers in order to identify patients who had possibly taken open label CTX at some time during the trial and had correctly reported this to the trial team. If participants have such access, non-inferiority might be inappropriately demonstrated.</p><p>In conclusion, this paper describes the design and methods used in the COSTOP trial highlighting some important aspects in designing CTX cessation studies. It is expected that the design and methodological considerations will significantly contribute to the quality of evidence from this study.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>No conflict of interests declared by the authors.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PM, JL, RK and HG conceived the initial trial idea.
