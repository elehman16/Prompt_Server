Patients were randomized (7:9) to receive a 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination four weeks prior to (pre-belimumab cohort) or 24 weeks after (belimumab-concurrent cohort) commencing four-weekly belimumab 10&#x02009;mg/kg intravenous treatment plus standard systemic lupus erythematosus therapy. Analyses of vaccine titers were performed on the as-treated population (received &#x02265;1 dose of belimumab).

To account for the expected difference in dropout rates at Week 4 and Week 28 (four weeks post vaccination for each group), patients were unequally randomized in a 7:9 ratio. Patients received open-label belimumab 10&#x02009;mg/kg intravenously (IV) at Weeks 4, 6, and 8 and then every four weeks to Week 32 (nine doses, pre-belimumab cohort) or at baseline and Weeks 2 and 4, and then every four weeks to Week 28 (nine doses, belimumab-concurrent cohort). The baseline visit was defined as the latest pneumococcal titer collected prior to vaccination (Week 0 for both cohorts; Week 24 for the belimumab-concurrent cohort following a protocol amendment). Post-vaccination pneumococcal titers were assessed at Week 4, prior to the first dose of belimumab, in the pre-belimumab cohort and at Week 28, prior to the last dose of belimumab, in the belimumab-concurrent cohort. Exit visits occurred on Week 32 and Week 28 for the pre-belimumab and belimumab-concurrent cohorts, respectively.</p><p>After commencement of the study, the study protocol was amended to remove the administration and assessment of tetanus vaccine response, and the study therefore focused on pneumococcal vaccination alone.

It was demonstrated that the proportion of patients generating a response to &#x02265;1 serotype was very high, and did not differ between those who were vaccinated prior to commencing belimumab and those who were vaccinated after receiving treatment with belimumab for 24&#x000a0;weeks. Similarly, little difference was observed across a broader response (from &#x02265;2 serotypes up to 23 serotypes).</p><p>The primary endpoint of this study, which was created in collaboration with regulatory agencies, was the proportion of patients with a response to &#x02265;1 serotype, and other endpoints included the proportion of patients responding to a broader range of up to &#x02265;10 serotypes. Although not clinically validated, expert panel recommendation is that an adequate response to 70% and 50% of serotypes tested (equivalent to &#x02265;16 and &#x02265;12 serotypes in this study) is a normal response for those over five years of age, and children aged two to five years, respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Thus, post hoc analyses were carried out in this study to investigate additional cut-off levels. The majority of patients responded to 50% and 70% of serotypes, and results appeared to be comparable between the pre-belimumab and concurrent-belimumab cohorts.</p><p>In further post hoc analyses, mean baseline Ig levels (IgA, IgG and IgM) in the 15 patients who did not respond to 50% of serotypes were not deemed as &#x02018;low,&#x02019; suggesting that these patients were not immunodeficient. However, a higher percentage (20%) of non-responders had low IgG (&#x0003c;7&#x02009;g/L) compared with responders (3.4%), and mean Ig levels appeared to be slightly lower in the non-responders compared with responders. Low or low-normal range Ig levels in patients with SLE may be due to SLE developing in the context of underlying humoral immune deficiency.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Indeed, the assessment of responses to pneumococcal vaccination is often employed to identify such patients in clinical practice. Low Ig levels in patients with SLE may also be due to intercurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Studies investigating immunological therapies have previously demonstrated the potential for attenuation of patient vaccination responsiveness, and there is evidence that concomitant medications may affect the outcome. One study investigating the effects of rituximab and concomitant methotrexate on vaccination responses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed a decreased response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in patients receiving rituximab compared with patients treated with methotrexate alone.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In a study of patients with SLE, the response to influenza vaccine was reduced by immunosuppressive therapies, but appeared to be restored by antimalarial treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In the present study, no trend was identified in terms of baseline medication use and a response to &#x02265;1 serotype. The proportion of patients with a response to &#x02265;12 serotypes appeared to be higher in both cohorts among patients who did not receive immunosuppressives at baseline compared with those who did. However, patient numbers were small in these analyses.</p><p>The results of this study are consistent with a small sub-study of the Phase 3 BLISS-76 trial, which evaluated the effects of belimumab on pre-existing antibody levels against pneumococcal, tetanus, and influenza antigens in patients with SLE.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In this sub-study, a sub-population of patients received pneumococcal (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) vaccination. All patients treated with belimumab or placebo who received pneumococcal vaccination (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7, five of whom received belimumab) were able to mount a protective response and responses did not differ between treatment groups.

Two serious suicide/self-injury events (one suicide attempt and a self-hospitalization to a psychiatric facility) were reported in the belimumab-concurrent cohort (none were reported in the pre-belimumab cohort), but there were no completed suicides. The overall incidence of these events was 2.5%, which is higher than observed in previous, larger studies, but may be a chance observation given the size of the study. The potential for a relationship between suicide-related events and belimumab is being formally addressed by two large ongoing prospective studies (BEL116543 [NCT01729455] and BEL115467 [NCT01705977]), designed to capture more detailed information about psychiatric events and other AEs of special interest.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the lack of a placebo arm and the small sample size. Also, less than 50% of patients who were enrolled were taking concurrent immunosuppressants that could potentially affect vaccine responses when belimumab is added to their treatment regimen.</p><p>Infections are a major cause of mortality in patients with SLE.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0961203317703495" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This study provides additional data supporting the notion that treatment with belimumab does not appear to affect responses to pneumococcal vaccination in patients with SLE.
