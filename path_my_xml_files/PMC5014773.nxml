All study participants will continue to receive the usual feedback from the electronic health records system. The control group (well-established feedback) will be compared with reminders and a well-established feedback system. The study will include all general practitioners (3425) and nurses (3262) providing primary care for a population aged 14&#x000a0;years or older in the 282 primary care teams reporting to the Catalan Institute of Health. Up to 10 clinical reminders are offered for each patient, recommending action related to at least one of nine clinical conditions: arterial hypertension, elevated cardiovascular risk, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, smoking habit, and hepatitis C. The outcomes are the resolution of the clinical condition that motivated the reminder and the time elapsed between the first reminder message and implementation of the recommended action (months). Due to the obvious correlation between reminders about the same patient, the profile of patients assigned to a particular professional, and the professionals assigned to a particular centre, hierarchical modelling will be used to simultaneously estimate the effect of the study variables at these different levels of analysis. To estimate the impact of the intervention arm, an analysis of adherence to each type of reminder will be carried out, using multi-level logistical regression models at level of the primary care centre. Time to adherence will be estimated by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and comparisons will be done using the log-rank test.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study could provide new evidence on the impact of computerized reminders at the point of care on adherence to clinical guidelines in primary care with an established feedback system.</p><p><italic>Trial registration</italic> ISRCTN42391639.

The Catalan Institute of Health (<italic>Institut Catal&#x000e0; de la Salut</italic>, ICS) is the main public provider of primary care services in the National Health System of Catalonia, with 282 primary care teams serving nearly 6 million people (80&#x000a0;% of the Catalan population). The 8000 health professionals comprising these teams provide family, paediatric, and nursing care. Since 2005, all ICS primary care providers have used the same electronic health records system, called ECAP, and since 2006 have been able to access a feedback system, updated monthly, that reports on quality indicators evaluating the care provided. All professionals have access to their rates of adherence to the evaluation standards and can view detailed information at the patient level. The feedback system also compiles a list of patients who do not meet all established criteria of the 62 evidence-based recommendations that constitute a unique index known as the Quality of Care Standard (<italic>Est&#x000e0;ndard de Qualitat Assistencial</italic>, EQA). At present, health professionals have point-of-care access to all of these results, with no additional data-recording effort on their part (Coma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>).</p><p>Primary health care allows longitudinal follow-up of a population. It also requires attention to multiple health conditions and disease prevention activities in a relatively brief office visit. Bodenheimer estimated that a primary care physician would require 18&#x000a0;h per workday to implement all of the prevention activities recommended by experts in chronic diseases (Bodenheimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>). Given the multitude of recommendations, it would be of great interest to health care professionals to have tools available that would help them carry out evidence-based activities. One of the strategies used to improve clinical practice is the incorporation of recommended activities as reminders in the clinical record (Jamtvedt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>).</p><p>The availability of the shared electronic health record allows electronic reminders at the point of care, which has been associated with an improvement in clinical practice, estimated at 4.2&#x000a0;% (interquartile range 0.8&#x02013;18.8&#x000a0;%). This wide variability could be explained by differences in the settings where the studies were carried out, the basal levels of adherence, or the characteristics of the reminders studied (Shojania et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>).</p><p>Most of the randomized clinical trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of reminders in the primary care setting have included reminders for just one disease or clinical condition (Eccles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>; Filippi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2003</xref>; Flottorp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>; Hicks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>; Krall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>; Safran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1995</xref>; Sequist et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>; Tierney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>; van Wyk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>). The studies that have included interventions with multiple reminders have focussed on preventive measures such as vaccinations and screenings or potential adverse effects of medications (Frank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>; Tamblyn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>).</p><p>In a retrospective analysis, an association was observed between the level of adherence to the recommendations of interest and the frequency of accessing the feedback provided and the patient list. In other words, the professionals who consulted their own quality results and the status of their patient lists showed greater improvement in their clinical indicators than their colleagues who did not consult the feedback results; in addition, a temporal relationship was detected between the availability of feedback and the clinical improvement (Fina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>). Even though different clinical trials have studied the impact of paper reminders and other interventions such as economic incentive or educational support materials, there is a lack of scientific evidence on the impact of computerized reminders (Shojania et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>).</p><p>In 2012, a maximum of 10 computerized reminders per patient was introduced into the ECAP system, visible to the health professional during the patient visit and related to 25 of the 62 recommendations considered as quality indicators in the EQA. We designed a clinical trial to evaluate whether adding computerized reminders to a well-established feedback system would improve adherence to multiple clinical recommendations in the primary care setting.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research hypothesis</title><p>The hypothesis was that computerized point-of-care reminders (i.e., presented during the contact between a primary care professional and a patient) improve the level of adherence to the recommended action and reduce the time to implementation of the recommendation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary objectives</title><p>To determine the effectiveness of reminders compared to no reminders in improving adherence to multiple clinical recommendations measured as the resolution of the clinical condition that motivated the reminder, in a primary care setting with a well-established feedback system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>To describe the effectiveness of the three levels of reminders intervention: (1) pop-up reminder, (2) pop-up reminder and a calendar icon, and (3) pop-up reminder, calendar icon, and configurability (users can select how the reminders are shown).</p><p>To describe resolution and time to resolution of the reminders by type of professional, primary care team and by each of the reminders in improving adherence to the clinical recommendations contained in the reminders.</p><p>To compare the effectiveness of computerized reminders in improving adherence to multiple clinical recommendations by category (primary, secondary and tertiary prevention).</p><p>To compare the effectiveness of computerized reminders in improving adherence to multiple clinical recommendations by category (professional action only and the professional action plus the modification of patient behaviour).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a controlled clinical trial, cluster-randomized by primary care team, designed to evaluate the impact of computerized reminders on adherence to clinical recommendations in a primary care setting with an established feedback system. A pilot study will conducted with primary care centre (PCC) health professionals to improve the development of the reminders. During the clinical trial, all of the study participants, including the control group, continued to receive the usual feedback. The control group is compared with each of the three study arms: (1) pop-up reminder, (2) pop-up reminder and a calendar icon, and (3) pop-up reminder, calendar icon, and configurability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study population</title><p>The inclusion criteria are: being a family physician or nurse who care for adult patients aged 14&#x000a0;years of older with clinical conditions that could generate at least one of the reminders in one of the 282 primary care teams managed by ICS. The exclusion criteria are: professionals who did not adopt the reformed model of primary care defined in Spanish legislation will be excluded due to low utilization of the electronic health record (Real Decreto 137/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1984</xref>). Furthermore professionals of a primary care team participating in other clinical trials of electronic health record reminders, and those that participate in the pilot stage of this clinical trial will be excluded. It is important to emphasize that this is a global intervention involving all ICS health professionals. The analysis will take into account all included professionals in each PCC (or cluster).</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Control group</title><p>During the clinical trial, all study participants, including those in the control group, will continue to receive the usual feedback established in 2006. This feedback consists of a monthly update for each family physician and primary care nurse of their percentage of adherence to each of the evidence-based recommendations in the EQA, along with a comparison of the month&#x02019;s results with their own basal data, with the rest of their team, and with the mean of all ICS teams.</p><p>For ease of interpretation, the results will be color-coded by target values. For 20 of the 25 recommendations, in addition to the numerical score, professionals will be able to consult the list of patients who do not meet the target; the goal is that the professional will review and take action with those individuals. Access to the feedback screen is provided as a direct link within the electronic health record (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, in Catalan; an online demonstration of this feedback system is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.amf-semfyc.com/sisap/">http://www.amf-semfyc.com/sisap/</ext-link>) (Coma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). The monthly results are also used as part of a performance incentive variable in the compensation model; during the intervention year, the incentive will not exceed a total of 750 euros per physician and 380 euros per nurse.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Feedback screen that can be accessed by health professionals from the electronic health records system.

The reminders are integrated into the electronic health record for each patient so that they are available to any health professional who cares for the patient; the information is updated weekly to reflect any changes that occur.</p><p>Each reminder consists of the following information: an orange or red icon that codes the importance of the recommendation as moderate or high, respectively; the relevant clinical condition; the recommended action; and the date and value entered for the recommendation or related laboratory results. A recommendation is classified as highly important if treatment is required (red icon: e.g., atrial fibrillation, anticoagulant/antiplatelet treatment, 12/06/2011) and as moderately important if it refers to a variable, laboratory result, or vaccination (orange icon: e.g., Type 2 diabetes mellitus, monitor HbA1c, most recent value, 8.3, 12/05/2011) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Recommendations, clinical conditions, importance and estimated number of reminders</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Recommendation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gencat.cat/ics/professionals/guies/mpoc/mpoc.htm">http://www.gencat.cat/ics/professionals/guies/mpoc/mpoc.htm</ext-link>)</th><th align="left">Clinical condition</th><th align="left">Importance</th><th align="left">n (estimated)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Control blood pressure: &#x02264;140/90 or &#x02265;150/95, depending on risk status</td><td align="left">Arterial hypertension/elevated cardiovascular risk</td><td align="left">Moderate</td><td char="." align="char">534,702</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Control glycaemia: HbA1c&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;%</td><td align="left">Type 2 diabetes mellitus</td><td align="left">Moderate</td><td char="." align="char">92,520</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Control cholesterol: LDL&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;120</td><td align="left">Cerebrovascular accident/Ischemic heart disease</td><td align="left">Moderate</td><td char="." align="char">90,060</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Screen for retinopathy</td><td align="left">Type 2 diabetes mellitus</td><td align="left">Moderate</td><td char="." align="char">67,710</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Smoking cessation within past year</td><td align="left">Smoking habit</td><td align="left">Moderate</td><td char="." align="char">711,392</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Vaccination for hepatitis B</td><td align="left">Hepatitis C</td><td align="left">Moderate</td><td char="." align="char">14,534</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ACEI/ARA2 treatment</td><td align="left">Heart failure</td><td align="left">High</td><td char="." align="char">11,394</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Beta blockers treatment</td><td align="left">Heart failure/Ischemic heart disease</td><td align="left">High</td><td char="." align="char">69,155</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatment</td><td align="left">Atrial fibrillation</td><td align="left">High</td><td char="." align="char">16,260</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Antiplatelet treatment</td><td align="left">Cerebrovascular accident/Ischemic heart disease</td><td align="left">High</td><td char="." align="char">12,916</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

The reminder provides a link to the patient&#x02019;s electronic health record, from which the pertinent action can be taken (generate a prescription, record a vaccination, request a laboratory test, or record a clinical variable). There is also an option to ignore or exclude a recommendation for a particular patient and enter a comment about the reason for the exclusion.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomization</title><p>The PCC will be the unit of analysis, so that all professionals from the same centre will be assigned to the same arm of the trial. Randomization will be done with the Stata/SE (v. 11.2, StataCorp) module for the design of randomized clinical trials (Ryan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1990</xref>). With the goal of achieving a balanced distribution of the quality of care by PCC in each arm, centres will be stratified by the quintiles of EQA results in the month prior to study initiation. The procedure will consist of obtaining the ICS list of PCCs, importing the data in STAT format, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and adding the EQA value for each PCC. The PCCs will be allocated in randomized blocks of 6, 12, and 18 to achieve the same number of PCCs in each of the study groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Algorithm for the randomization to each study group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40064_2016_3124_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention groups</title><p>The reminders can appear in the electronic health record screens in 3 levels.

The study protocol was approved by the Committee on Clinical Research Ethics of the Jordi Gol Institute on Research in Primary Care (<italic>Institut Universit&#x000e0;ri d&#x02019;Investigaci&#x000f3; en Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria</italic>, IDIAP Jordi Gol).</p><p>All data extracted from the electronic health records system to create the reminders, as well as all data collected during the study for later analysis, will be anonymized so that it will be impossible for the research team to identify individual patients of the participating health professionals. A computer algorithm will be used that shows patient identification only to the primary care professionals (physicians and nurses) responsible for the patient&#x02019;s care.</p><p>Patients are only indirectly affected by the trial because the researchers are not involved in any intervention or interaction with patients, all patient data are anonymized in accordance with national data privacy laws and National Health System policy, and the intervention is based entirely on best practice recommendations drawn from existing scientific evidence, published in clinical practice guidelines, and included in the objectives of the Catalan government&#x02019;s Health Plan (<italic>Pla de Salut</italic>). Indeed, if the intervention results in better adherence by health professionals in the ICS primary care network to these evidenced-based recommendations, patients will benefit from the outcomes achieved by this clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Study oversight</title><p>There isn&#x02019;t an independent data monitoring or trial steering committee.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the present clinical trial will contribute new evidence on the impact of computerized point-of-care reminders on the adherence to clinical recommendations by primary care professionals, using an established feedback system. The study will involve almost all health professionals in the ICS primary care network and the population they serve, and therefore will be highly representative of clinical practice in the primary care setting. If the intervention is shown to be effective, the improvements should be almost immediately apparent, benefiting almost 5 million patients in the National Health System in Catalonia. Since the interventions will involve a high number of patients, small improvements in effectiveness could have a great impact on population health, according to the literature, both in terms of direct benefit and side effects. For example, increased use of antiplatelet therapy in patients with cerebrovascular disease reduces the number of coronary or cerebrovascular episodes and the associated mortality, but the number of haemorrhages also increases as a consequence of the treatment. To avoid undesirable effects to the extent possible, we selected indicators for which risk&#x02013;benefit analysis has provided evidence that clearly favours the intervention.</p><p>Previously published studies have described better effectiveness when the feedback is a response to low adherence to clinical practice guidelines (Jamtvedt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>). In our study population, there is no low level of adherence to recommendations concerning the conditions we are studying, because health professionals have already been receiving performance feedback and lists of patients for 5&#x000a0;years during which their indicators have raised significantly. On the other hand, in contrast to many of the published studies, our design adds the reminders to an established feedback system that will be used in all arms of the study; this may lead to a smaller effect size. Holt et al. compared the use of reminders to a control group with no supporting tools (Holt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>). Therefore, we selected a 10&#x000a0;% intervention effect as clinically relevant.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. Some authors have suggested that &#x0201c;pay for performance&#x0201d; incentives may lead to better recording rather than better clinical practice (Bell and Levinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Petersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). A Cochrane review concluded that despite the increasing growth in this type of payment system, there is insufficient evidence for or against any impact on improving primary health care services (Scott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). The compensation for objectives related to the indicators included in the intervention is low, not exceeding 750 euros per physician and 380 euros per nurse. In any case, this effect would occur in both the control group and the intervention groups; therefore, it would be unlikely to have an impact on the results that may be obtained. On the other hand, most of the selected indicators would not be susceptible to manipulation because they are based on laboratory results such as LDL cholesterol levels or HbA1c levels in patients with diabetes, or prescription data for specific drugs (e.g., antiplatelets, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Therefore, it is likely that any recording changes would have real impact on health status.</p><p>Studies based on data from electronic health records can also be limited by the quality of the record, and any clinical records software such as ECAP could have a certain level of under-recording. Nonetheless, this limitation should affect both the intervention and control groups, and most of the reminders are related to health problems that are long-term indicators with a prevalence similar to what has been reported in the literature. This leads us to conclude that potential under-recording is not a major problem of the study design.</p><p>Finally, the health professionals participating in our study cannot be blinded to the intervention, which could possibly generate an information bias. Nonetheless, we selected cluster randomization because most studies of this type use this design; we decided against any design in which the same health professional would have some patient records with reminders and others without. In a study by Chambers et al. participants in one study arm received sporadic reminders about flu vaccine, others received them consistently, and a third group received no reminders (Chambers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1991</xref>). The outcomes were worse for the sporadic reminders than for the control group, suggesting the hypothesis that health professionals become dependent on the reminder: if it does not appear, they may assume that the patient does not need the vaccine, which could result in a harm rather than a benefit to the patient.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CEIC</term><def><p>Clinical Research Ethics Committee (<italic>Comit&#x000e9; &#x000c9;tic d&#x02019;Investigaci&#x000f3; Cl&#x000ed;nica</italic>)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECAP</term><def><p>electronic health record system of the Institut Catal&#x000e0; de la Salut in primary care (<italic>Estaci&#x000f3; Cl&#x000ed;nica d&#x02019;Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria</italic>)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EHR</term><def><p>electronic health record</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQA</term><def><p>quality care indicator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQPF</term><def><p>prescription quality indicator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQR</term><def><p>quality of data recording</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>general practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICD</term><def><p>International Classification of Diseases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICS</term><def><p>Catalan Institute of Health (<italic>Institut Catal&#x000e0; de la Salut</italic>)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDIAP</term><def><p>University Research Institute on Primary Care (<italic>Institut Universitari d&#x02019;Investigaci&#x000f3; en Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria</italic>)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDL</term><def><p>low density lipids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCC</term><def><p>primary care centre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIDIAP</term><def><p>information system for research on primary care (<italic>Sistema de Informaci&#x000f3; pel Desenvolupament d&#x02019;Investigaci&#x000f3; en Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria</italic>)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SISAP</term><def><p>primary care database of the ICS (<italic>Sistema d&#x02019;Informaci&#x000f3; dels Serveis d&#x02019;Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria</italic>)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBP</term><def><p>high blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVA</term><def><p>cerebrovascular accident</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IC</term><def><p>ischemic cardiomyopathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FA</term><def><p>atrial fibrillation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACE</term><def><p>angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARB2</term><def><p>angiotensin receptor blockers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRG</term><def><p>clinical related groups</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p> MM proposed the research and participated in designing the study and the feedback screens.
