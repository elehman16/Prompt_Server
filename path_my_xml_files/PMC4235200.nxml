Nevertheless, only 22.7% of German adolescents are sufficiently physically active. Thus, the promotion of an active lifestyle in youth is an essential issue of public health.</p><p>This study will evaluate the implementation and efficacy of the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; program to enhance physical activity in adolescence. &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; is a multicomponent school-based program developed on the basis of effective strategies for health interventions and behavioral change.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; physical activity program targets four different levels. (a) Each student receives a pedometer and documents his/her steps over 12&#x000a0;weeks using an interactive user account on the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; homepage. (b) For classes there will be different competitions, with achieving the most steps in selected weeks, the highest increases of steps and developing the most inventive ideas to promote physical activity in school. Besides, the intervention includes four educational lessons. (c) The headmasters and teaching staff of the participating schools will get information material with suggestions and encouragement to enhance physical activity in school. Participating teachers will be invited to an introductory seminar. (d) Parents will be provided with informational material about the program and will be invited to a parent-teacher conference about the benefits of being physically active and how they can support their children in engaging in a physically active lifestyle.</p><p>To evaluate the efficacy of the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; physical activity program, a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in three waves: (1) baseline assessment, January/February 2014, (2) post assessment, June/July 2014 and (3) 12-month follow-up assessment, June/July 2015. Data collection will include physical and medical testing, self-administered questionnaires, group discussions and document analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>&#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; aims at fostering a physically active lifestyle in adolescence while a considerable decline of physical activity is present. Physical activity programs based in the school setting and following a multicomponent approach have been proven to be most successful. Furthermore, the use of pedometers is promising to enhance physical activity during the entire day and targets a wide range of adolescents regarding fitness and weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN49482118">ISRCTN49482118</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Cluster-randomized trial</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>School-based intervention</kwd><kwd>Pedometer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>There is extensive literature emphasizing physical activity as an important and modifiable factor influencing physical and mental health: being physically active on a regular basis is associated with substantial health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], including primary and secondary prevention of chronic diseases, a reduced risk of premature death and better mental health.</p><p>Physical activity in childhood and adolescence prevents a widespread variety of chronic diseases, including hypertension, obesity and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. An active lifestyle early in life is not just important for health outcomes in adolescence but may also be a significant factor for the level of activity in adulthood and health-related physical fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Global recommendations on physical activity suggest that children and adolescents should take part in physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity for at least 60&#x000a0;minutes per day to maintain health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In consideration of epidemiological data, only 17.3% of female and 28.2% of male adolescents in Germany aged 11 to 17&#x000a0;years meet these recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, physical activity declines in older adolescents compared to children and younger adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Nader <italic>et al</italic>. reported a decline of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity from 180&#x000a0;minutes per day at 9&#x000a0;years to only 42&#x000a0;minutes per day at 15&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Hence, the promotion of an active lifestyle and physical fitness in early adolescence is an issue worthy of intervention development.</p><p>Considering the access to a large adolescent population, interventions based in the school setting are supposed to be the method of choice for increasing physical activity in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Meta-analyses and reviews indicated positive impacts of school-based interventions for promoting physical activity on health-related indicators, namely an increase of rate and duration of in-school physical activity as well as aerobic fitness and a decrease of blood cholesterol and of physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Notably, multicomponent interventions involving peers, parents and communities were assumed to be highly effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, despite these encouraging outcomes, almost no improvements in out-of-school physical activity has emerged from studies to date, and increases in activity level were rather short-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, school-based programs which aim to enhance physical activity and fitness in adolescents should also focus on changing the everyday routine to increase out-of-school physical activity and on establishing an active lifestyle in the long term.</p><p>There are several options for interventions to induce effects on physical activity throughout the entire day. One promising approach could be the use of pedometers which has already been shown to be effective in increasing physical activity among adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], not just in-school but also during out-of-school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These findings are supplemented by studies emphasizing self-monitoring and goal-setting as one of the most effective intervention strategies to promote physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Both strategies can be easily and effectively combined with pedometer use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; program integrates these strategies that have been proven to be successful in the promotion of physical activity into a multicomponent approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] that is school-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and includes social support from peers and parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], goal-setting and self-monitoring through pedometer use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><sec><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><p>The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; physical activity program among adolescents in grade 8. Therefore, a two-arm three-wave cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Expected effects on primary outcomes of the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; program in the intervention compared to the control group are defined as:</p><p>1. an increase in physical activity in general and in different contexts measured by questionnaires;</p><p>2. a decrease of sedentary behavior measured by questionnaires; and</p><p>3. an increase in cardiovascular fitness measured by the 20-meter shuttle run test.</p><p>In addition to primary outcomes, the following secondary outcomes will be included in the evaluation study of the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; physical activity program: body composition (that is, Body Mass Index (BMI), percentage of body fat mass and waist circumference), cardiovascular risk factors (that is, blood pressure, heart rate after stress as well as resting and recovery heart rate), mental health (that is, general self-efficacy, psychological well-being, self-esteem and depression), enjoyment of physical activity and sedentary behaviors, physical self-concept (that is, general physical capacity and physical attractiveness), self-efficacy towards physical activity, intention for physical activity and physical well-being.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>&#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; was designed by an interdisciplinary team of sport medicine specialists, sport scientists, teachers, nutritional scientists and psychologists.</p><p>The intervention operates at four levels: individual, class, school and parents. The intervention period is 12&#x000a0;weeks. An overview of all components of the intervention is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of intervention components.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-416-1"/></fig><sec><title>Class</title><p>The core components of the intervention are class competitions. On the one hand, each individual student in the class receives a pedometer and records the daily amount of steps over a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks. Steps are summed up to a class mean, documented on a class poster and reported to the project staff in three selected weeks. On the other hand, each class collects creative and inventive ideas on how to increase physical activity in everyday school life and keeps records of these ideas on the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; homepage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.laeuft.info">http://www.laeuft.info</ext-link>). In addition, the classes take part in four educational lessons: (1) introduction to the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; program, distribution of pedometers and informational material for students and their parents, (2) introduction to the creativity contest, (3) physical activity that combines running/walking with exercises at environmental facilities (for example, a bench, stairs or a jungle gym), and (4) reflection of strategies to take more steps in everyday life and setting of physical activity goals for the time period after the project. Besides, additional modules are offered that can be flexibly conducted during the program. The modules deal with topics such as the reflection of student&#x02019;s physical activity, motives for being physically active or possible barriers to physical activity and how to handle them. Each lesson takes 45&#x000a0;minutes and will be conducted by teachers of the participating classes. After the end of the competition period, classes with the highest means of steps per week, with the largest increases and with the most inventive and creative class projects are awarded.</p></sec><sec><title>Individual</title><p>By using a pedometer, each student can evaluate his or her daily physical activity objectively and compare it to the class mean and common recommendations. Additionally, students can document their steps as well as their experiences during the program using a private and interactive user account on the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; homepage. Based on students&#x02019; entries, statistics (for example, mean of the week or day of best performance), a diagram to follow daily step totals over time and feedback will be delivered. Furthermore, the homepage provides opportunities to share experiences with other participating students and compete on step totals. The homepage is optimized for online use with smartphones.</p></sec><sec><title>School</title><p>The headmaster and entire teaching staff of each participating school will receive information material, including background and description of the program, activity-promoting teaching methods, suggestions on how to improve the school environment to stimulate physical activity, and related links leading to further information. All participating teachers will be offered an introductory seminar to learn more about the concept and components of the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; program.</p></sec><sec><title>Parents</title><p>A parent-teacher conference will take place at the class level to emphasize the importance of physical activity throughout the entire life and give parents ideas of how to support their children in establishing a physically active lifestyle. In addition, parents will receive information material about the program and the assessments. To take parents with a foreign background into account, materials will also be available in Turkish and Russian as the most frequently spoken foreign languages in Germany.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The effectiveness of the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; physical activity program will be tested in a two-arm three-wave cluster randomized controlled trial. Data of the different waves are hypothesized to be clustered at the individual, class and school level. Schools are the units of randomization and will be randomly allocated to the intervention and control group. In intervention schools the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; physical activity program will be implemented, while schools of the control group run through the usual curriculum and will receive no further intervention. In both groups, fitness, medical and questionnaire data will be collected for three times: &#x0201c;baseline&#x0201d; (immediately before the intervention), &#x0201c;post&#x0201d; (immediately after the intervention) and &#x0201c;follow-up&#x0201d; (12&#x000a0;months after the end of the intervention) assessment. In addition, after the intervention, qualitative analyses will be conducted in classes of the intervention group to gain insight into interactive processes within the classes and to reconstruct subjective experiences and interpretations of activating-strategies.</p><p>Process evaluation of the planned trial will be realized through questionnaires and interviews during and after the study, respectively. The study design is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-416-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>There are specific constraints for analysis of cluster randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] since the responses of individuals within a cluster tend to be more similar than those of individuals of different clusters. This clustering effect can be defined as 1&#x02009;+&#x02009;(m-1)p, where m is the average number of subjects per cluster and p the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The ICC for physical fitness and adiposity was taken from another cluster randomized controlled trial, the Kindersportstudie (KISS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and estimated with approximately 0.05 (p). Assuming an equal average cluster size of 20 pupils with parental consent (m&#x02009;=&#x02009;20), a clustering effect of 1.95 was determined. Without taking into account the clustering of the data, assuming a small to medium effect size of the intervention (Cohen&#x02019;s d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.30) on physical activity as one primary and the most important outcome being still detectable at follow-up, applying a significance level of alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 and power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80, it can be estimated that N&#x02009;=&#x02009;350 pupils are required to detect a difference between two independent sample means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Taking the cluster effect into account, a required sample size of N&#x02009;=&#x02009;683 students and 34 classes was determined. A computerized sample size calculator for cluster randomized trials was used to confirm this estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Based on earlier experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], a drop-out rate of 25% over the study was hypothesized. Hence, a total sample size of 911 pupils and 46 classes will be recruited for baseline to detect possible differences between the groups at follow-up. In order to recruit the estimated sample size of 46 classes while assuming a participation rate of 20% and an average of at least two participating classes per school, about 100 schools will be invited to participate.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure and participants</title><p>The study has been approved by the ethics committee of the German Psychological Society as well as the Ministry of Education and Science of Schleswig-Holstein. It targets 8<sup>th</sup> grade classes with students aged 12 up to 15&#x000a0;years in secondary schools in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany. Schools will be selected from a complete list of all secondary schools in Schleswig-Holstein obtained from the Ministry of Education. All types of schools will be included, except schools for disabled students. In order to recruit a study sample of 46 classes, about 100 schools will be invited to participate. An invitation letter and information sheets about the aims, methods and requirements of the study will be sent to the head of each school. Copies of the letters of approval by the Ministry of Education and the ethics committee will be attached. Schools agreeing to participate must send back their written consent indicating the acceptance of study characteristics (including randomization), number of grade 8 classes eligible for the study, names of the class teachers, and number of students per class. All students of participating classes will be included in the study. Schools not agreeing to participate are requested to explain their denial. In order to conduct non-responder analysis, all invited schools will be asked to provide some basic data about type and size of school, number of grade 8 classes, gym and sports equipment, sports facilities on the school ground and offered sports events, projects and courses. Participating schools will be stratified (type of school and number of grade 8 classes) and randomly allocated to the intervention and the control groups. Furthermore, parents will receive information sheets about the study and will be asked for informed consent to the storage and use of assessed data of their children. Teachers will register all names of students with no permission in a list which they keep throughout the entire trial. Students with refusals will take part in the assessment but their data will not be registered.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>To avoid interference between the intervention and the control groups, stratified randomization will be carried out on the school level (according to the type of school and number of grade 8 classes). Expecting a higher drop-out of schools in the intervention group, randomization follows a 3:2 ratio, that is, each school will have a 3:2 chance of being assigned to the an intervention group. Randomization will be performed with a computer program.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>From October 2013 to January 2014 the recruitment and randomization of schools will take place. In the intervention as well as in the control group, baseline data will be obtained in January and February 2014. The intervention program is scheduled for the period of March to May 2014. During this time the control group runs the usual curriculum. After 12&#x000a0;weeks, in the period of June to July 2014, post assessment data will be obtained. The follow-up assessment is planned for June and July 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Pilot study</title><p>The program has been tested, evaluated and adapted during a pilot study. From April to June 2013 a pilot study with a shorter intervention period (eight weeks) was conducted, including two schools with four classes and 89 students (41 female students; M<sub>age</sub>&#x02009;= 13&#x000a0;years, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.50&#x000a0;years). To evaluate and improve the &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; physical activity program, different qualitative and quantitative methods were employed: participant observation of the educational lessons, questionnaires for students and teachers to evaluate these lessons, and the assessment as well as interviews with students and teachers about the entire intervention. Based on the insights gained with respect to feasibility, comprehensibility and acceptance from the obtained data and experiences, the program was modified. The intervention was followed by one assessment in order to evaluate the feasibility of physical and medical testing as well as the comprehensibility of the questionnaire. The assessment was adapted in accordance with the experiences and results.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>The outcomes will be measured anonymously with self-administered questionnaires, physical testing and medical testing on the individual level as well as qualitative methods on the individual and the class level.

Thus, to accomplish an increase of the basic physical activity level in everyday life the intervention is targeted on four different components: individual, class, school and parents.</p><p>In the promotion of physical activity in adolescence, a multicomponent approach and interventions in the school setting have been proven to be most promising and successful strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Considering the easy access to students from all levels of society and the long period of time they spend in school, health programs in the school setting can effectively reach a large number of adolescents. On the other hand, many school-based interventions were insufficient in enhancing not just in-school but also out-of-school physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The &#x0201c;l&#x000e4;uft.&#x0201d; physical activity program tries to overcome this shortcoming by changing students&#x02019; everyday routine by using pedometers throughout the entire day. Moreover, pedometers have been proven to increase physical activity also in low-active adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] who are at high risk of adiposity, and poorer cardiovascular health and fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. The implementation of a follow-up assessment 12&#x000a0;months after the program ends, takes into account that interventions for promoting physical activity in adolescents are mostly limited to rather short-term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Considering four educational lessons over a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks, time and effort for participating teachers are rather low. Indeed, the intervention might not be intensive enough to lead to major improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, such as BMI or blood pressure, but the low threshold for successful participation might also cause better acceptance. Students do not need to be athletic or of normal weight to achieve a high number of steps.</p><p>Nevertheless, universally applied programs also include students that are already sufficiently physically active. Thus, not all resources will be used efficiently. As the main limitation of the presented study, physical activity will be assessed by using self-administered questionnaires and will not be measured objectively through accelerometers. Even though, with respect to adolescents, reliability and validity of self-administered recall-questionnaires are acceptable to good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]; aiming for triangulation of quantitative and qualitative research methods, the qualitative results pose an opportunity to reach a better and deeper understanding of the barriers and prospects of a &#x0201c;successful&#x0201d; intervention and aspired sustainability.
