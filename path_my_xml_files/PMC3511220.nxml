[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Weight gain during adulthood increases the risk of CHD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a modest reduction in weight (i.e. 5% of body weight) in female subjects reduces the incidence and progression of CHD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although several diet strategies exist to help individuals lose weight, one regimen that has gained considerable popularity in the past decade is intermittent fasting (IF)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This diet strategy generally involves severe restriction (75-90% of energy needs) on 1 or 2 days per week. Results from a recent 24-week randomized clinical trial revealed that IF can reduce body weight by 7% in obese women
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. LDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations also decreased by 10% and 17%, respectively, in these subjects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Though these findings are promising, this regimen is limited in that a long duration of time (i.e. 24 weeks) is required to experience only modest reductions in body weight. One possible method of augmenting the rate of weight loss is to combine IF with a daily calorie restriction (CR) protocol. In this way, the individual would fast one day per week, and then undergo mild CR (i.e. 20% restriction of energy needs) on 6 days per week. This combination therapy (IF plus CR) produces greater reductions in weight and superior changes in CHD risk parameters when compared to each intervention alone in animal models
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Whether the beneficial effects of IF plus CR on weight and CHD risk can be reproduced in human subjects has yet to be elucidated.</p><p>It is well known that many obese subjects are unable to adequately estimate portion sizes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This inability to estimate portions during periods of dieting results in excessive food intake, which then blunts overall weight loss
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In order to take the guesswork out of estimating portion sizes, some CR protocols implement portion controlled liquid meals to replace 1 or 2 meals per day. When liquid meal replacements are employed, subjects tend to lose greater amounts of weight when compared to subjects receiving diet counseling alone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Whether or not the implementation of liquid meal replacements during periods of IF plus CR accelerates weight loss remains unknown.</p><p>Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to examine the effects of an IF protocol combined with CR on body weight, body composition, and CHD risk factors in obese women. Whether the addition of liquid meal replacements to this protocol would result in greater weight loss and more pronounced CHD risk reduction was also assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were recruited by means of advertisements placed on and around the University of Illinois campus in downtown Chicago. A total of 77 individuals responded to the advertisements, but only 60 were deemed eligible to participate after the preliminary questionnaire, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference assessment (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Key inclusion criteria were as follows: female, age 35&#x02013;65 y, BMI between 30 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, waist circumference &#x0003e;88 cm, weight stable for 3 months prior to the beginning of the study (i.e. &#x0003c;5 kg weight loss or gain), non-diabetic, no history of cardiovascular disease, no history of cancer, sedentary or lightly active for 3 months prior to the beginning of the study (i.e. &#x0003c;3 h/week of light-intensity exercise at 2.5&#x02013;4.0 metabolic equivalents (METS)), non-smoker, not claustrophobic, and not taking weight loss, lipid-lowering, or glucose-lowering medications. Peri-menopausal women were excluded from the study, and post-menopausal women (defined as absence of menses for 2 y) were required to maintain their current hormone replacement therapy regimen for the duration of the study.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <bold>IFCR</bold><bold>L subjects</bold> (n = 30) consumed a calorie-restricted liquid diet for the first 6 days of the week, and then underwent a fast on the last day of the week (water consumption + 120 kcal of juice powder only, for 24 h). The liquid diet (during the CR period) consisted of a liquid meal replacement for breakfast (240 kcal) and a liquid meal replacement for lunch (240 kcal). All liquid meal replacements were provided to the subjects in powder-form in premeasured packets (Isalean Shake, Isagenix LLC, Chandler, AZ). At dinnertime, IFCR-L subjects consumed a 400&#x02013;600 kcal meal. Food was not provided to the subjects for the dinnertime meal. Instead, subjects met with a Registered Dietician weekly to learn how to make healthy eating choices that are in compliance with the National Cholesterol Education Program Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet (i.e. &#x0003c;35% of kcal as fat; 50-60% of kcal as carbohydrates; &#x0003c;200 mg/d of dietary cholesterol; and 20&#x02013;30 g/d of fiber). In following this regimen, each subject was calorie restricted by 30% of their baseline needs. <bold>IFCR</bold><bold>F subjects</bold> (n = 30) consumed a calorie-restricted food-based diet for the first 6 days of the week, and then underwent a fast on the last day of the week (water consumption + 120 kcal of juice powder only, for 24 h). IFCR-F subjects ate 3 meals per day in accordance with the TLC diet guidelines. Food was not provided to the subjects. Instead, subjects met with a Registered Dietician weekly to learn how to make healthy eating choices that were in compliance with the TLC diet. Subjects were instructed to eat approximately 240 kcal for breakfast, 240 kcal for lunch, and 400&#x02013;600 kcal for dinner. In following this regimen, each IFCR-F subject was calorie restricted by 30% of their baseline needs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><sec><title>Adherence with diets</title><p>A 7-d food record was used to assess adherence to the diets. Subjects completed the food records at week 3 and 10. The Registered Dietician provided 15 min of instruction to each participant on how to complete the food records. These instructions included verbal information and detailed reference guides on how to estimate portion sizes and record food items in sufficient detail to obtain an accurate estimate of dietary intake. All dietary information from the food records was entered into the food analysis program, Nutritionist Pro (Axxya Systems, Stafford, TX) by a single trained operator to alleviate inter-investigator bias. In addition, IFCR-L subjects were provided with a checklist each day to monitor: 1) adherence to the liquid meal protocol, and 2) adherence to the fast day regimen. IFCR-F subjects were also given a checklist to monitor their adherence to the fast day regimen. If an IFCR-L or IFCR-F subject consumed more that 100 kcal on the fast day (above the 120 kcal of juice powder allotted to the subject), the subject was considered non-adherent with the fast day protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Maintenance of physical activity habits</title><p>Changes in daily energy expenditure associated with alterations in physical activity habits were quantified by the use of a pattern recognition monitor (Sense Wear Mini (SWM), Bodymedia, Pittsburgh, PA). Subjects wore the lightweight monitor on their upper arm for 7 d at week 3 and 10 of the trial. The SWM is a wireless multi-sensor activity monitor that integrates motion data from a triaxial accelerometer along with several other physiological sensors (heat flux, skin temperature and galvanic skin response). The data was analyzed using Bodymedia Software V.7.0, algorithm V.2.2.4 (Bodymedia, Pittsburgh, PA).</p></sec><sec><title>Body weight and body composition assessment</title><p>Body weight measurements were taken to the nearest 0.5 kg at the beginning of each week in light clothing and without shoes using a balance beam scale (HealthOMeter; Sunbeam Products, Boca Raton, FL). Height was assessed using a wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm. BMI was assessed as kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Fat mass and fat free mass were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at weeks 1, 3 and 10 (QDR 4500 W, Hologic Inc. Arlington, MA). Waist circumference was measured by a flexible tape to the nearest 0.1 cm, midway between the lower costal margin and super iliac crest during a period of expiration. Abdominal visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes were quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at week 3 and 10
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Images were acquired using a 1.5-T superconducting magnet (Siemens, Iselin, NJ), and were obtained every 1 cm from the 9th thoracic vertebra (T9) to the first sacral vertebra (S1). Image locations were defined relative to a common anatomical landmark, the L4&#x02013;L5 intervertebral space. To facilitate the comparison of individual image data, we limited our analyses to the set of images ranging from 20 cm above L4&#x02013;L5 (+20 cm) to 3 cm below L4&#x02013;L5 (&#x02212;3 cm), for a total of 24 images per subject. Segmentation of the axial images into visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas (cm<sup>2</sup>) was performed using HippoFat image analysis software
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas were summed across all 24 images to obtain visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes, and then these volumes were multiplied by 0.916 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, the density of adipose tissue, to obtain total visceral adipose tissue mass (kg) and total subcutaneous adipose tissue mass (kg)

This novel regimen also decreased key indicators of CHD risk, such as LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and the proportion of small LDL particles. When liquid meal replacements were incorporated into the IFCR regimen, greater reductions in body weight and indicators of heart disease risk were noted.</p><p>Studies of IF in human populations are very limited. To our knowledge, only two studies have examined the effect of IF on body weight
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In a trial conducted by Williams et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], obese subjects consumed a very-low calorie diet (VLCD; &#x0003c;500 kcal/d) 1 day per week, and ate ad libitum every other day of the week. After 20 weeks of treatment, body weight decreased by 9% (9 kg) from baseline
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Similar decreases in body weight were also observed in a recent trial by Harvie et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In this study, obese women underwent 2 days of VLCD (600 kcal/d) and ate ad libitum on every other day of the week, for 24 weeks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Body weight was reduced by 7% (6 kg), fat mass decreased by 13% (4 kg), and waist circumference (an indirect indicator of visceral fat) decreased by 6% (6 cm)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the present study, we observed modest weight loss in both the IFCR-L and IFCR-F groups after 8 weeks of treatment. We also observed that the addition of liquid meals to the protocol resulted in greater weight loss (IFCR-L group: 4.1% weight loss versus IFCR-F group: 2.6% weight loss). Reductions in fat mass and visceral fat mass were also demonstrated at the end of the trial, but did not differ between groups. As for fat free mass, no significant changes were noted in either intervention group. This is surprising as a previous study that implemented energy restricted liquid meals observed small but significant decreases in fat free mass (i.e. 3% reductions from baseline) after 8 weeks of treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The greater weight loss by the IFCR-L intervention is most likely due to better dietary adherence. Analysis of food intake revealed a greater degree of energy restriction in the IFCR-L group (29%) compared to the IFCR-F group (22%) over the course of the trial. This greater overall restriction in the IFCR-L group, and hence better adherence, is not surprising as these subjects were given portion-controlled liquid meals for breakfast and lunch everyday. Providing such meals has been shown to boost initial weight loss during dietary restriction protocols as it takes the guesswork out of having to estimate calories from varying foods
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although these liquid meals are effective for helping with initial weight loss, lasting weight loss and weight maintenance requires extensive dietary counseling to instill healthy behaviors that can be employed long-term
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In view of this, both groups met with a Registered Dietician weekly to incorporate TLC dietary guidelines into their daily lives and to help make the leap from the liquid diet to a wholesome food-based regimen after the study was over.</p><p>Beneficial modulations in key lipid risk factors were also observed by both diets. For instance, total and LDL cholesterol decreased in the IFCR-L group (19% and 20%, respectively) and IFCR-F group (8% and 7%, respectively), with greater changes noted for IFCR-L. In contrast, only the IFCR-L group experienced reductions in triglycerides (17% from baseline). The proportion of small LDL particles was also decreased by both the IFCR-L group (week 3: 37 &#x000b1; 1%, week 10: 28 &#x000b1; 2%) and IFCR-F group (week 3: 39 &#x000b1; 1%, week 10: 36 &#x000b1; 1%). However, increases in LDL peak particle size and the proportion of large LDL particles, were only noted in the IFCR-L group. Taken together, these results suggest that IF combined with CR is an effective means of improving lipid profile in a short-term (8 week) intervention. We also show that adding a liquid diet component may enhance this lipid-lowering effect. The greater decreases in plasma lipids by the IFCR-L diet is most likely due to the greater weight loss noted in this group. For every kg of body weight loss, LDL cholesterol is estimated to decrease by 2 mg/dl

Since the IFCR-L group lost 1.4 kg more body weight than the IFCR-F group, this may explain why the reductions in LDL cholesterol by the liquid diet intervention were more pronounced. The decreases in lipids demonstrated in the present study are similar to what has been reported in previous trials of IF
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Williams et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] noted a 10% and 52% lowering of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, respectively, after 20 weeks of treatment. In accordance with these findings, Harvie et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] observed a 10% decrease in LDL cholesterol and a 17% reduction in triglycerides. No trial to date has examined the effect of IF on LDL particle size, thus there is no data for which to compare our findings.</p><p>Modulations in other CHD risk parameters were also more pronounced in the IFCR-L group compared to the IFCR-F group. For instance, fasting plasma glucose and insulin were only decreased by the liquid intervention, suggesting that this diet therapy may benefit glycemic control. Heart rate and homocysteine concentrations were reduced solely in the IFCR-L group. Leptin concentrations, on the other hand, were lowered by both diets. The decreases in leptin are most likely mediated by the reductions in fat mass and visceral fat mass observed in both groups
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Leptin may be involved in atherosclerotic plaque formation through its effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in monocytes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, these reductions in leptin by IFCR may play a systemic anti-atherogenic role
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Adiponectin levels were also decreased by both diet interventions. This finding is not surprising, as adiponectin levels have been shown to decrease during the first 8&#x02013;12 weeks of CR, and then increase only once a 10% weight loss has been achieved
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since the present trial only ran for 8 weeks, and since weight loss was &#x0003c;5%, this may explain why adiponectin concentrations were lowered from baseline. Blood pressure and CRP also remained unchanged throughout the course of the trial in both groups. Accumulating evidence suggest that a 5 and 10% reduction in body weight is required to decrease blood pressure and CRP, respectively
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This degree of weight loss was not attained, which may explain why these two variables were unaffected by either treatment.</p><p>This study is limited in that it did not tease apart the effect of IF and CR on body weight and CHD risk. Thus, the independent contributions of the IF diet versus the CR diet on these various parameters, are not known. In order to answer these key questions, a future study should be performed that compares the effect of IF combined with CR, to that of IF alone, and CR alone. An additional limitation of the study was that it did not carefully control for food intake by providing food-based meals to the intervention groups (i.e. dinner meal for the IFCR-L subjects, and 3 meals/d for the IFCR-F subjects). If meals were provided, a more precise measurement of energy restriction and dietary adherence could have been obtained. The study is also limited in that it employed HippoFat software to quantify visceral fat mass from MRI images. This software is limited in that it underestimates visceral fat and overestimates subcutaneous fat, particularly in larger individuals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Another limitation of the study is that we employed food records to estimate overall calorie restriction in each group. It is well known that obese individuals underreport food intake by 20-40% when completing food records
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Future studies in this field should therefore implement more robust measures of energy assessment such as the doubly-labeled water technique
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The last disadvantage of the study is that only female subjects were employed, and as such, the applicability of these findings to males remains uncertain.</p><p>In summary, these findings suggest that IFCR may be effective for reducing body weight, visceral fat mass, and CHD risk in obese women. We also report that incorporating liquid meal replacements into an IFCR regimen may facilitate greater weight loss and lipid-lowering. From a clinical standpoint, we would recommend this diet to individuals who wish to boost the weight loss they see with IF, by adding a daily CR regimen. This combination may also help reduce the boredom typically associated with attempting only one dietary plan. Although these short-term findings are promising, the long-term effects of this novel diet strategy still require confirmation in a large-scale human trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Krista Varady has a consulting relationship with the sponsor of the research, lsagenix, LLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MCK conducted the clinical trial, analyzed the data, and assisted with the preparation of the manuscript.
