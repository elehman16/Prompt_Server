Thirty-eight individuals who have suffered a stroke will participate. The experimental group will undertake a 40-min of respiratory muscle training program, seven days/week, for eight weeks in their homes. Training loads will be increased weekly. The control group will undertake a sham respiratory muscle training program with equivalent duration and scheduling of training. The primary outcome will be the strength of the inspiratory muscles, measured as maximal inspiratory pressure. Secondary outcomes will include expiratory muscle strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, dyspnea, respiratory complications, and walking capacity. Outcomes will be collected by a researcher blinded to group allocation at baseline (Week 0), after intervention (Week 8), and one month beyond intervention (Week 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>High-intensity respiratory muscle training may have the potential to optimize the strength of the respiratory muscles following a stroke.

This respiratory device allows patients to train the inspiratory and expiratory muscles simultaneously and to adjust the loads independently. The Orygen Dual Valve is a relatively cheap, portable, easy to use piece of equipment and provides workloads up to 70&#x000a0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O with load adjustments of 10&#x000a0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O.<xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>The experimental group will receive home-based respiratory muscle training, totaling 40&#x000a0;min per day, seven days per week, over eight weeks. The 40-min daily training will be split into two daily sessions (i.e., morning and afternoon). Each daily session will be comprised of 4 four-minute sets of respiratory training with one-minute rest intervals between each set. The resistance will be provided by the Orygen Dual Valve, which allows individuals to exercise the inspiratory and expiratory muscles simultaneously during the training session.<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Training will be individually tailored for each participant. The initial training load for each participant will be set at 50% of his/her maximal baseline inspiratory and expiratory strength for both inspiratory and expiratory strength training. The participants will be trained and instructed to do the exercise program on their own with no supervision. Once a week, during the physical therapist's home visit, the clinician will determine the new values for maximal inspiratory and expiratory strength, and will adjust the load to 50% of the new values. The device will be covered with opaque material, so that participants will be blinded to the training load.</p><p>The control group will receive a sham intervention. Sham respiratory muscle training will be delivered using a Orygen Dual Valve with no resistance (0&#x000a0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O) or progression, over the 8 week period, 40&#x000a0;min per day, seven days per week. The device will be covered with opaque material, so that participants will be blinded to the fact that they are receiving no training load. The control group will receive the same training and testing schedule as the experimental group. This will avoid bias related to amount of attention given to participants. If training proves to be effective, the control group may receive the experimental training program after the experiment is complete and if it proves to be effective.</p><p>The respiratory muscle training will be undertaken in the participant's home environment, which will reduce the cost of the intervention and may result in good compliance.<xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> On the other hand, this means that the training will not be directly supervised. To record the compliance, participants will receive a diary to register the time and days of each training session and their daily training volume.

Since respiratory muscle training not only imposes a resistance to the respiratory muscles, but also causes hyperventilating for prolonged periods of time, it may have an additional effect on respiratory muscle endurance,<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> which could translate into a more efficient use of the respiratory muscles in activities of daily living. Furthermore, if benefits are carried over to activity, the findings may have broader implications, since walking capacity has been shown to predict physical activity and community participation following a stroke.<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>In addition, a previous systematic review<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> has indicated that respiratory muscle training has the potential to decrease the risk of respiratory complications after stroke. It is well known that pneumonia and respiratory illness are the most common reasons associated with hospital admissions and death following a stroke, responding for 15% of the readmissions.<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> The adoption of interventions capable of preventing the occurrence of respiratory complications may substantially improve the long-term outcomes of patients following a stroke.<xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Our clinical trial aims to clarify the evidence regarding the effects of a respiratory muscle training on the occurrence of respiratory complications. If training benefits will lead to decreases number of readmissions/deaths due to respiratory complications, the findings may have broader implications, such as reduced costs arising from immediate and long-term health care, increased production due to reduced sick leave, and early retirements.</p><p>The experimental intervention will be delivered via the Orygen-Dual Valve<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. This device is a relatively inexpensive (costs about 60 US dollars) and portable respiratory trainer that also allows patients to simultaneously work both the inspiratory and expiratory muscles.<xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Although it has been recently developed, studies have proven its efficacy in patients with chronic heart failure<xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and stroke.<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> If the intervention provides better results than the sham treatment, this device could be a good option for patients with respiratory muscle weakness.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the trial may result in an important advance in neurological/pulmonary rehabilitation. First, the magnitude of effect may be higher than previous trials, due to the increased intensity of training. Second, if benefits are carried over to activity, community participation may be enhanced, given that the 6-min Walk Test is a strong predictor of community walking in people following a stroke.<xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Third, if the results lead to a reduction in hospital admissions, respiratory muscle training could help reducing direct and indirect costs associated with a stroke.</p></sec><sec id="sec0070"><title>Strengthens and weakness of the proposed protocol</title><p>The strength of the proposed protocol is that it is a randomized controlled trial that has been prospectively registered. The trial also includes concealed allocation and an intention-to-treat approach. The sample size has been calculated to provide appropriate statistical power to detect between-group differences in the primary outcome. The assessor responsible for collecting the outcome data will be blind to group assignment. The physical therapist, who delivers the training, has clinical experience and a masters degree in neurological rehabilitation. This trial has some limitations, since participants and therapist cannot be really blinded, which is impractical during the delivery of complex interventions. The experimental and control interventions consist of home exercises, which depend on participants&#x02019; motivation. It is not possible to predict the amount of home exercises that will be performed. Strategies to encourage participants to comply with the protocol, such as contract of commitment to the training, phone calls, and weekly visits, are planned.</p></sec></sec><sec
