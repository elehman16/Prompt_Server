The FDA recognizes that standard methods of defining racial subgroups are necessary to compare results across pharmacokinetic studies and to assess potential subgroup differences. The design of the study was as an open labeled, randomized, one treatment, one period, single dose pharmacokinetic study. The main pharmacokinetic parameters estimated were C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, t<sub>1/2</sub>, elimination rate constant, AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>. The insignificant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between Egyptians and white German subjects suggests that no dose adjustment should be considered with administration of 25&#x02009;mg empagliflozin to Egyptian population. A new LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated, allowing sensitive estimation of empagliflozin (25&#x02013;600&#x02009;ng mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in human plasma using dapagliflozin as an internal standard (IS). The method was applied successfully on the underlying pharmacokinetic study with enhanced sample preparation that involved liquid-liquid extraction. Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) of the transition pairs of m/z 449.01 to 371.21 for empagliflozin and m/z 407.00 to 328.81 for dapagliflozin (IS) was employed utilizing negative mode Electro Spray Ionization (ESI). The validated LC-MS/MS method is suitable for further toxicodynamic and bioequivalence studies.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defined ethnic factors as those related to races or large populations grouped according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Empagliflozin (EG) and dapagliflozin (DG), (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), are inhibitors of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) that inhibit glucose re-absorption into the blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. SGLT-2 is expressed in the kidneys and plays an important role of renal glucose re-absorption. EG and DG can selectively inhibit SGLT-2 and therefore enhance urinary glucose excretion. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Chemical structures of empagliflozin (<bold>a</bold>) and the internal standard, dapagliflozin (<bold>b</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_2895_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e371"/></fig>
</p><p>The pharmacokinetic evaluation of EG after administration to Egyptian volunteers and its comparison to the previously developed studies on different races will minimize the duplication of clinical data. A fully validated bioanalytical method is a prerequisite to perform a successful pharmacokinetic study. In the present work, a new fast LC-MS/MS method was developed for sensitive estimation of EG using DG as an internal standard (IS) to enable further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation to facilitate satisfactory clinical outcomes.</p><p>LC-MS/MS parameters and analytical procedure details were not described in the pharmacokinetic studies reported for EG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Therefore, the novelty of the present work was achieved by providing the full details regarding the development and validation of the proposed analytical procedure for the simultaneous extraction and LC-MS/MS determination of EG and DG (IS). Furthermore, in the present work, the first pharmacokinetic study on healthy Egyptian volunteers, after administration of 25&#x02009;mg EG (JARDIANCE), was applicable using the proposed bioanalytical method.</p><p>Investigation of the relationship between drug dosage and the concentration time profiles will be useful for the design of subsequent clinical trials, appropriate analysis in post-marketing pharmacovigilance, determination of the appropriate use of medicines according to genotype of drug-metabolizing enzymes, and providing information for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The developed LC-MS/MS method measures the plasma concentration of the parent compound (EG) because no major metabolites of EG were detected in human plasma as glucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Instrumentation</title><p>WATERS ACQUITY UPLC system (S/N F08UPH, USA), TQ detector (S/N QBA530, USA) accompanied with ESI source and WATERS ACQUITY UPLC BEH Shield RP C<sub>18</sub> column (S/N 01563430116023, Ireland) with dimensions (150&#x02009;mm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2.1&#x02009;mm, 1.7&#x02009;&#x000b5;m) were used.

Written informed consent was provided by each volunteer before enrollment. Approval of the study by the ethical committee was mandatory according to the Egyptian ministry of Health and The British University in Egypt research ethics guidelines. The experimental protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy, The British University in Egypt. The clinical trial protocol was registered in a publically accessible primary register that participates in the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, 16/02/2017, ID: NCT03059056). Good health of the human subjects was confirmed with a complete medical history and physical examination. Fasting of all volunteers eliminated the possible interaction from high fat meals. The evaluation of safety of the study was based on monitoring of blood glucose level, vital signs, pulse rate, monitoring of adverse events, and physical examination. Samples from 6 healthy, adult, male, Egyptian volunteers (age: 22&#x02013;33 years, average weight: 77.8&#x02009;kg, average body mass index (BMI): 29.2) were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 hrs, transferred to heparinized centrifuge tubes and analyzed with the proposed method after single oral dose administration of one JARDIANCE tablet nominally containing 25&#x02009;mg EG.

For the extraction procedure, liquid-liquid extraction was tried using ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, and diethyl ether, and the best results were obtained with TBME. This may be attributed to the ability of EG and DG (IS) to migrate to TBME according to their partition coefficients and log P values. Using DG as IS for EG bioanalysis enhanced the validation results because of their structural similarity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), closely related plasma extraction recoveries, and similar matrix factors (MF). After vortex and centrifugation, vacuum evaporation of the TBME layer until dryness at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C followed by reconstitution with 300&#x02009;&#x000b5;L acetonitrile was employed as a sample enrichment technique, enabling determination of EG at the LLOQ, equal to 25&#x02009;ng/mL. Another advantage of using liquid extraction is sample clean-up, decreasing the matrix effect on the detector response. Furthermore, using acetonitrile as solvent for IS decreased the formation of irregular emulsion between aqueous/organic interfaces and modulated the polarity of the extraction solvents to achieve the desired recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In addition, TBME was reported by Kobuchi <italic>et al</italic>. for sample preparation of some SGLT-2 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> with structural similarity to EG, namely, canagliflozin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, tofogliflozin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, ipragliflozin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and luseogliflozin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> using EG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> or DG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> as IS.</p><p>For optimum detection of EG and the IS, both the chromatographic conditions and the mass detector parameters were adjusted.

The selected DG transition is consistent with previous LC-MS/MS methods in the negative mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, while the transition of EG is reported here for the first time using negative mode.

The final mobile phase was selected based on the high response and best peak shape of the analytes in a reasonable run time. Because DG (IS) readily forms adducts in the presence of formic acid, the mobile phases were simple mixtures of water and acetonitrile, which is consistent with previous reports for LC-MS/MS determination of DG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Optimum results with well-defined peaks and high sensitivity (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) were obtained using a mixture of water and acetonitrile in the ratio of (10:90, <italic>v/v</italic>) as a mobile phase, keeping column temperature at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, using 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;L as the injection volume and 0.3&#x02009;ml/min as the flow rate with 1.5&#x02009;min as run time. LC-MS/MS was selected for the underlying investigation because it is a well-known, sensitive technique that has been commonly used for many pharmacokinetic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) chromatogram of empagliflozin (m/z&#x02009;=&#x02009;449.01 to 371.21) and dapagliflozin (internal standard, m/z&#x02009;=&#x02009;407.00 to 328.81): (<bold>a</bold>) blank plasma; (<bold>b</bold>) zero plasma spiked with internal standard.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_2895_Fig4_HTML" id="d29e652"/></fig>

Recovery experiments were performed by comparing the peak area of the low and high QC samples extracted from human plasma with those spiked in the supernatant of the extracted blank plasma at the same concentration levels.

There is no significant difference was observed between the studied group and the compared ethnic group which suggests that no dose adjustment should be considered with administration of 25&#x02009;mg EG to Egyptian population. The proposed LC-MS/MS method is simple, fast, accurate, and reproducible for determination of EG in human plasma. The validated method was proved to be suitable for further toxicodynamic evaluation. The method was applied successfully for the pharmacokinetic study under investigation and owing to the short run time used, rapid analysis of many plasma samples per day was achieved.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>
