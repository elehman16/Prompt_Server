We performed a prospective, randomized, non-inferiority trial comparing the Kineflex Disc with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x02013;approved Charit&#x000e9; device (DePuy Spine, Raynham, Massachusetts). Our objective was to evaluate the Kineflex Disc's safety and efficacy using validated outcomes measures&#x02014;the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty-four patients were randomized to receive either the Kineflex Disc or Charit&#x000e9; device and were then followed up for up to 3 years.

Results were analyzed in terms of change in mean VAS score and ODI from baseline, as well as with a comparison of clinical success as defined by FDA investigational device exemption criteria. Non-inferiority was defined as a difference of less than 18 points in the VAS score and difference of less than 10 units on the ODI scale, in keeping with a previously established minimum clinically important difference.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>The mean improvement for the Kineflex Disc group at 24 months was 56.80 for the VAS score and 37.30 for the ODI.

</p><p>The Kineflex Disc is a 3-piece chrome-cobalt-molybdenum device, with a semiconstrained core, posterior center of rotation design, and mobile center of rotation. Its design allows 12 degrees of movement into flexion, extension, and left-/right-side bending. A retaining ring on the inferior endplate limits excursion of the captured sliding core to 2 mm in all directions and prevents dislodgment of the sliding core. The disc is introduced as a single unit with fin fixation to the vertebral endplate allowing for increased ease of implantation and improved reliability in positioning.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> A non-inferiority design was used because these features are notable only if equivalent safety and efficacy of the Kineflex Disc device can be established.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0001"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial assessing the safety and efficacy of the Kineflex Disc to relieve symptoms associated with degenerative disc disease at either the L4&#x02013;5 or L5-S1 levels. Institutional review board approval was secured before initiation of the study. Informed consent was obtained from all patients, who were then randomized to receive either a Kineflex Disc (n = 33) or Charit&#x000e9; disc (n = 31). All patients were blinded to their device assignment until after surgery. Each was evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively, as well as at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Patients completed visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaires and were monitored clinically and radiologically for device failure, complications, and need for reoperation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those used in the original ADR-versusfusion trials (a full review of inclusion and exclusion criteria is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">2</xref>).

FDA &#x0201c;clinical success&#x0201d; was assessed, defined as (1) a minimum of 25% improvement in low-back pain ODI score at 24 months compared with baseline; (2) no revisions, reoperations, or device removals; and (3) no occurrence of a major device-related adverse event.</p><p>We also compared mean improvement in VAS and ODI scores at 24 months. As cutoffs for non-inferiority, we used a VAS difference of greater than 18 points and an ODI score of greater than 10 units. No absolute consensus exists regarding what constitutes a minimal clinically important difference for the ODI and VAS scales. However, there is a good deal of literature suggesting that our chosen cutoffs are both theoretically sound and practical values that indicate that the patient has had significant relief (or worsening).<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>
</p><p>Non-inferiority was defined as a mean reduction in VAS score in the Kineflex Disc group at 24 months of less than 18 points below the mean reduction in the Charit&#x000e9; group. Similarly, the Kineflex Disc device would be determined to be inferior to the Charit&#x000e9; disc if the mean reduction in the ODI score in the Kineflex Disc group was greater than 10 units below the mean improvement in the Charit&#x000e9; group.</p></sec><sec id="S20003"><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>Because a major benefit of disc replacement as compared with other surgical modalities is in its long-term preservation of motion and decrease in adjacent-disc disease, we performed a mixed-effects model analysis to observe the difference between the 2 groups over time.

The Kineflex Disc comes in 3 endplate sizes. Size 1 is 27 mm &#x000d7; 36.5 mm, size 2 is 30 mm &#x000d7; 41 mm, and size 3 is 35 mm &#x000d7; 44 mm. The implant is inserted as a single unit with assembled disc heights of 11 mm, 12 mm, 12.75 mm, 13 mm, and 13.75 mm. In addition, there are 3 different built-in lordosis angles of 0&#x000b0;, 5&#x000b0;, and 10&#x000b0;. Unique to this system are 3 distractor instruments of 9 mm, 11 mm, and 13 mm in height, as well as a disc space distractor similar to the Charit&#x000e9; distractor and a slot cutter similar to the ProDisc-L slot-cutting technique. Although the implant is 3 separate parts, it is inserted as a single unit. The core component of the implant is a constant 10.5 mm in height with a diameter of 19.25 mm and sits within the concave surfaces of the disc endplates.</p></sec><sec id="S20005"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Our statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the recommendations made in the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) consensus statement for reporting of non-inferiority trials.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> For our primary outcomes, a 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test was performed comparing the mean change in ODI and VAS scores from baseline to 2 years, as well as the percentage of each group achieving FDA-defined clinical success.

Histograms were used to determine the normality of improvement scores in both the Charit&#x000e9; and Kineflex Disc groups, for both the 2-year and 3-year analyses. Normality assumptions were adequately met for the <italic>t</italic> tests.</p><p>In the mixed-effects model analysis, the mean VAS pain score and mean ODI score were compared for the 2 groups over the 2-year follow-up.

For the Charit&#x000e9; group, the ODI and VAS scores were 63.90 and 85.41, respectively, preoperatively but 25.50 and 30.98, respectively, at 24 months. One Charit&#x000e9; patient underwent revision of her L5-S1 implant to a more central position. One Kineflex patient underwent ALIF revision of her L5-S1 implant, which had subluxated anteriorly 4 mm 24 hours after the index operation.

A similar trend was noted for the disability scale, where the Charit&#x000e9; group, over time, was on average 2.43 points (95% CI, &#x02212; 2.33 to 7.20) higher than the Kineflex Disc group (<italic>P</italic> = .31).</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mean VAS pain scores over time (preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months) for each group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SAS-5-2011-07-003-g001"/></fig><fig id="F0002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Mean ODI scores over time (preoperatively and at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months) for each group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SAS-5-2011-07-003-g002"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S0007"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purpose of a non-inferiority trial is to use a particular intervention either as a surrogate for the gold standard or in comparing two interventions where one is believed to have an important feature that is not readily amenable to a clinical trial (price, ease of use, and so on). The Kineflex Disc was designed to be introduced as a single unit, thereby aiding reliable midline posterior introduction despite a severely diseased disc space. In addition, material studies of prostheses suggest superiority of metal-on-metal devices in terms of long-term wear profiles and of reduced immunogenicity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> However, these facts are only relevant insofar as the device can be shown to be non-inferior to an established ADR device in terms of safety and efficacy.</p><p>In this study both groups showed statistical and clinically significant success over baseline for treatment of lower back pain caused by degenerative disc disease.</p><p>We found the Kineflex Disc to be non-inferior to the Charit&#x000e9; device at 24 months of follow-up, defined as a mean reduction in VAS score by a difference of less than 18 points established by previous literature. The Kineflex Disc arm showed a small trend toward improvement over the Charit&#x000e9; group (2.37 points); however, superiority cannot be claimed by this analysis.</p><p>The ODI analysis was inconclusive. This does not, however, indicate inferiority in terms of disability reduction. In fact, at 2 years, the ODI change CI includes a term nearing a minimum clinically significant improvement.</p><p>In addition, the mixed-effects model analysis confirms Kineflex Disc non-inferiority over time and shows a small trend toward superiority in pain and disability scores, although these conclusions cannot be definitively made.</p><sec id="S20008"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study is potentially limited by the problem of &#x0201c;biocreep&#x0201d; inherent in any multigenerational non-inferiority trial.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> With this problem, each subsequent iteration of noninferiority trial increases the size of error bars around the true results, and it becomes increasingly difficult to state with certainty that the newest intervention is, in fact, noninferior to the original (in this case ALIF with BAK cages). That said, because this procedure is no longer the standard of care, such a trial is not possible despite it being preferable in terms of statistical modeling.</p><p>In addition, a conclusion that one might be tempted to draw from this study (ie, non-inferiority of the Kineflex Disc device to spinal fusion) is limited by the fact that original trials comparing the Charit&#x000e9; device with fusion used ALIF with BAK cages, a procedure no longer considered to be the gold standard for fusions. However, because this was the standard of care at the time of the original Charit&#x000e9; trials, this control arm was considered reasonable.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0009"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Kineflex Disc ADR device is non-inferior to the Charit&#x000e9; ADR device at 24 months&#x02019; follow-up in terms of pain reduction and FDA-defined clinical success&#x02014;a composite term that includes safety measures. The ease and reliability of implantation of the Kineflex Disc ADR device and improved wear profiles make it a viable alternative technology. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the long-term risks and benefits of these devices beyond 2-year follow-up, and a well-designed head-to-head trial is needed to establish whether any particular ADR is superior with respect to hard clinical outcomes. Every patient (except the 2 undergoing reoperations) was discharged from the hospital within 24 hours of surgery. These cases are scheduled as outpatient procedures.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation
