Focus on optimizing recovery between training sessions is necessary to minimize the risk of injuries and improve adaptations to the training stimuli. Carbohydrate supplementation during sessions is generally accepted as being beneficial to aid performance and recovery, whereas the effect of protein supplementation and timing is less well understood. We studied the effects of protein ingestion during training sessions on performance and recovery of elite cyclists during a strenuous training camp.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized, double-blinded study, 18 elite cyclists consumed either a whey protein hydrolysate-carbohydrate beverage (PRO-CHO, 14&#x000a0;g protein/h and 69&#x000a0;g CHO/h) or an isocaloric carbohydrate beverage (CHO, 84&#x000a0;g/h) during each training session for six days (25&#x02013;29&#x000a0;h cycling in total). Diet and training were standardized and supervised. The diet was energy balanced and contained 1.7&#x000a0;g protein/kg/day. A 10-s peak power test and a 5-min all-out performance test were conducted before and after the first training session and repeated at day 6 of the camp. Blood and saliva samples were collected in the morning after overnight fasting during the week and analyzed for biochemical markers of muscle damage, stress, and immune function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In both groups, 5-min all-out performance was reduced after the first training session and at day 6 compared to before the first training session, with no difference between groups. Peak power in the sprint test did not change significantly between tests or between groups. In addition, changes in markers for muscle damage, stress, and immune function were not significantly influenced by treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intake of protein combined with carbohydrate during cycling at a training camp for top cyclists did not result in marked performance benefits compared to intake of carbohydrates when a recovery drink containing adequate protein and carbohydrate was ingested immediately after each training session in both groups.

Similarly, endurance races over several days necessitate fast recovery. It is generally accepted that ingestion of carbohydrate is beneficial for performance and recovery during high-intensity endurance sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The effect of protein on endurance performance and recovery is less well understood. The majority of studies on protein supplementation during exercise show no acute performance effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but a few studies have shown improved performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In most of these studies beverages were matched for carbohydrate content rather than energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and/or a suboptimal carbohydrate beverage was used as a control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], making it difficult to differentiate between the effects of elevated intake of protein or calories.</p><p>The influence of protein supplementation during [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or post-exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] on recovery and subsequent performance or endurance capacity has been investigated in several short-term (&#x0003c;24&#x000a0;h) studies, of which some report advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], whereas others report no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] compared to intake of carbohydrate. Long-term effects (&#x0003e;24&#x000a0;h post-exercise) are less examined and there is a lack of studies on elite athletes. Current results on well-trained athletes (max. oxygen uptake &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ml O<sub>2</sub>/kg/min) are mixed. Some studies show no effect of ingesting protein-carbohydrate beverages compared to control (carbohydrate) during and/or after exercise sessions on performance measured as time to exhaustion (TTE) after two weeks intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], repeat-sprint performance during six days intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], or running performance during six days intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Others show performance advantages of partial substitution of carbohydrate with protein in TTE during two weeks intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], time trials (TT) after one week intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], or repeat-sprint performance tests after 3&#x02013;4 days intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similarly, results from intervention trials are mixed in regard to effect of protein ingestion on attenuation of muscle damage. A combined intake of protein and carbohydrate has, in some cases, shown attenuation of markers for muscle damage in well-trained athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], whereas others report no difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The conditions vary considerably between studies and there is a great need for well-controlled studies focusing specifically on the effect of protein on performance and recovery over a period including daily strenuous exercise sessions.</p><p>Optimization of performance and recovery is essential at the top level where athletes often compete several days in succession. Elite athletes also have periods, typically team training camps, where they add a substantial amount of extra training. Excessive training loads in combination with inadequate recovery can further lead to a state of overreaching or overtraining, characterized by a long-term decrement in performance capacity as well as a decline in immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is therefore of specific interest to study nutritional strategies in order to optimize recovery during training camps with excessive training loads. The present study was designed to re-examine the nutritional practice of the Danish national team in race cycling (U23), which currently entails consumption of carbohydrate beverages during exercise and recovery beverages containing both carbohydrate and protein post-exercise. The present study compared the effect of consuming a protein-supplemented carbohydrate beverage to an isocaloric carbohydrate beverage during each session of an intense six-day training camp for Danish elite racing cyclists at Lanzarote. Under controlled conditions with cyclists, coaches, and scientists all residing at the training campus for a full week, the aim was to determine whether ingestion of a beverage containing partial substitution of carbohydrates with protein <italic>during</italic> exercise would have additional performance and recovery effects beyond that of the protein already present in the recovery beverage. Both acute effects of protein supplementation during the first session as well as accumulated effects over the six-day training camp were examined. It was hypothesized that there could be advantages of ingesting protein during exercise over a training period since the training sessions were extensive and lasted up to 6&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The study was designed as a double-blinded, randomized, controlled intervention trial during a one-week training camp for elite racing cyclists (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The subjects were pre-tested before the camp and matched in pairs based on weight, maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>), a 5-min all-out performance, and training history. Afterwards they were randomized to consume either a 1) carbohydrate beverage (CHO) or a 2) protein-carbohydrate beverage (PRO-CHO) during each training session at the camp. Both groups consumed the same recovery beverage after exercise, containing 18&#x000a0;g protein (~0.25&#x000a0;g/kg) and 69&#x000a0;g carbohydrate (~1&#x000a0;g/kg). The athletes were further divided into a short distance group (~25&#x000a0;h/6&#x000a0;days) or a long distance group (29&#x000a0;h/6&#x000a0;days). The cyclists in CHO and PRO-CHO pairs were cycling the same distance.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overall design of the test protocol.

The test protocol was repeated at day six in the morning (D6pre). Breakfast and time points for testing at Day six were the same as at Day one of the intervention. The protocol consisted of a standardized warm-up prior to a 10-s peak power test followed by a 3-min recovery period and a 5-min all-out performance test.</p><p>Blood samples were collected before (morning sample) and immediately after the performance tests at Day 1 and Day 6 as well as in the morning of day 3, 5, and 7, and analyzed for markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and myoglobin) and cortisol. Saliva samples were collected in the morning after overnight fasting at Day 1, 5, 6, 7, immediately after exercise, and 1&#x000a0;h after the training session on Day 6 to be analyzed for immunoglobulin A (IgA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eighteen young, male racing cyclists (age 20&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;years) were recruited for the project.

The PRO-CHO group ingested a beverage containing 0.2&#x000a0;g of protein/kg/h (Whey protein hydrolysate with a degree of hydrolysis between 23&#x02013;29&#x000a0;%, Arla Foods Ingredients Group P/S, Viby, Denmark) and 1&#x000a0;g of CHO/kg/h (Maxim Energy Drink, Maxim International, Ishoej, Denmark). The CHO group consumed an energy-matched carbohydrate beverage containing 1.2&#x000a0;g of CHO/kg/h (Maxim Energy Drink, Maxim International, Ishoej, Denmark). The carbohydrate content in both beverages consisted of maltodextrin and fructose in the ratio 2:1. We chose an isocaloric control beverage rather than a beverage matched for carbohydrate to isolate the effect of the addition of protein rather than an extra amount of energy.</p><p>Residual fluid left in used bottles was less than 300&#x000a0;ml in total per training day except for one subject in the PRO-CHO group who was not able to drink the total beverage volume on three of the six days (residual fluid remaining was 400 out of 4500&#x000a0;ml, 600 out of 3750&#x000a0;ml, and 1875 out of 3750&#x000a0;ml, respectively).</p><p>Both groups consumed a recovery beverage immediately after exercise each day containing 18&#x000a0;g of protein and 69&#x000a0;g of carbohydrate corresponding to ~0.25&#x000a0;g protein/kg and 1&#x000a0;g carbohydrate/kg (similar sources of protein and carbohydrate as during cycling). Nothing else was ingested, except water, within the two hours before and the one hour after each training session each day. Neither the subjects nor the testing staff was informed about the content of the beverages. Beverages were prepared by staff members not present during the training and performance testing. At D1, the recovery beverage was ingested after the post-exercise testing (D1post).</p><p>On Day 6, individual weight changes during the 6&#x000a0;h training session were determined to check hydration status. The athletes were weighed immediately before and after the training session in minimal clothing. The individual bottles were weighed before and after the 6&#x000a0;h training session. On average the athletes were provided with 4.33&#x000a0;L in total during the training session (0.72&#x000a0;L/h). One subject did not consume 0.35&#x000a0;L of the provided beverages during the training session and two subjects consumed additional 0.50 and 0.75&#x000a0;L plain water. Weight data from these three subjects were adjusted in the evaluation of the effect of 0.72&#x000a0;L/h on hydration status (weight change).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Training schedule and performance testing for the training camp</title><p>The training regime was standardized and controlled by the National U23 coach in cycling. The subjects were divided in two groups depending on their training status and history (long: 28.6&#x000a0;h/6&#x000a0;days and short 24.9&#x000a0;h/6&#x000a0;days). The cyclists in the matched pairs were within the same training groups and thereby an equal number of long and short distance subjects were represented in PRO-CHO and CHO respectively. The long distance group biked ~5, 5, 1, 6, 5, and 6&#x000a0;h during the 6 training days (plus standardized warm-up and tests) and the short distance group biked 4, 4, 1, 4, 5, and 6&#x000a0;h (plus standardized warm-up and tests). The training program within both the short and long distance group consisted of a mix of distance training, interval training, mountain climbing, and an individual time trial. The total number of training hours and training distance were identical in the two intervention groups since cyclists in the matched pairs were cycling together.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Diet control</title><p>To avoid any dietary bias, subjects followed a predetermined energy balanced diet plan throughout the week. Prior to the intervention week, each cyclist had an individual meeting with a dietitian where the importance of the diet control was emphasized. Furthermore, food preferences were noted and the subjects were asked if they were suffering from food allergies. Afterwards, an individual diet plan was prepared based on the weight, training load, and preferences using the online software madlogvita (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.madlogvita.dk/">http://www.madlogvita.dk</ext-link>). Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) was estimated for each training day during the intervention and the diet plans varied between days, depending on training schedule. Total daily energy expenditure was estimated based on the following equation: TEE (kJ/day)&#x02009;=&#x02009;RMR x PAL&#x02009;+&#x02009;EX, where RMR is the estimated resting metabolic rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], PAL is estimated physical activity level in non-training hours, which was set at 1.5 corresponding to a sedentary lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and EX was the estimated energy used during training sessions (number of training hours&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;200 W&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(100/25)), assuming an exercise effectiveness of 25&#x000a0;% and an average power output of 200 W. The food was served as a buffet and the participants weighed all the food items in accordance with their individual diet plan. A dietitian was available at the buffet each morning and evening. In addition, participants could always contact and meet with the dietitian if they had a question about their individual diet plans. The subjects were not allowed to consume dietary supplements, sports products, or any food item apart from the items in their individual diet plans.</p><p>The average distribution of macronutrients in the diet (excl. intervention beverages) was 8&#x000a0;g of carbohydrate/kg/day (~62&#x000a0;% of energy (E%)) and 1.7&#x000a0;g protein/kg/day. The 18&#x000a0;g protein in the recovery beverage ingested by both groups was included in the 1.7&#x000a0;g protein/kg/day, whereas the protein content in the intervention beverages ingested by PRO-CHO during cycling was in addition to the controlled diet. Fat was supplemented to meet each individual&#x02019;s energy need (~22&#x02013;24 E%). The daily intake of protein in CHO corresponded to protein recommendations for elite endurance athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The protein intake in PRO-CHO, including the intervention beverages, was 2.6&#x000a0;g/kg/day. Total daily carbohydrate intake including beverages was 14.6&#x000a0;g/kg/day in CHO and 13.6&#x000a0;g/kg/day in PRO-CHO. The energy content of the diet was adjusted (&#x000b1;125&#x000a0;kcal/day) to reestablish energy balance if morning weight had changed more than 1&#x000a0;kg body weight and a bioimpedance measurement did not indicate that the weight change was due to change in hydration. Average energy intake was 24.4&#x000a0;MJ/day in long (29&#x000a0;h training) and 22.0&#x000a0;MJ/day in short (25&#x000a0;h training), including 8.4&#x000a0;MJ/day (long) and 7.2&#x000a0;MJ/day (short) from intervention beverages. The food and nutrient composition of the breakfast before the test protocol at D1 and D6 was the same to ensure standardization of the subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Determination of VO<sub>2max</sub></title><p>The subjects completed a VO<sub>2max</sub> test on a stationary bike ergometer (SRM) one or two weeks before the training camp. After a 15-min warm-up, subjects were instructed to work all-out for 5&#x000a0;min during which they were allowed to change load and cadence.

The main findings of the present study were that compared to isocaloric ingestion of carbohydrate, partial substitution of carbohydrates with whey protein hydrolysate during exercise did not significantly reduce the decline in performance after 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;h cycling or after five days of strenuous training.

The importance of comparing isocaloric beverages rather than non-isocaloric beverages (matched for carbohydrate content) ingested during exercise on endurance capacity is underlined by results from two studies from the same research group using almost identical protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Optimizing recovery is especially important for elite cyclists who often have to compete several days in a row. We observed a decline in performance at Day 6 compared to before initiating the intervention, but the decrease in performance was not significantly different between groups as hypothesized. This finding is in line with studies of moderately or well-trained subjects where protein along with carbohydrate ingested during and immediately after exercise compared to carbohydrate beverages show no effect on TTE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] or TT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] performed less than 24&#x000a0;h after exercise completion.

The content of the beverages ingested during the initial exercise bout was in accordance with the beverages used in the present study, but the discrepancy in theirs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] our findings is likely related to either the duration of the recovery period between exercise sessions or the type of test. In the majority of road bike races, an overnight recovery is possible. The prolonged overnight recovery may render any benefits of protein ingestion during exercise inconsequential compared to shorter recovery duration.</p><p>The athletes in the present study were supplied 18&#x000a0;g protein/CHO immediately after the training sessions as part of their normal routine, and we aimed to investigate whether additional protein during the training session could prevent the gradual decrease in performance during repeated days of strenuous cycling during a training camp. In contrast to our hypothesis, performance in the 5-min &#x0201c;all-out&#x0201d; test declined similarly in CHO and PRO-CHO during the 6&#x000a0;days of training camp, whereas 10-s sprint performance did not decline. The effect of combined CHO-PRO vs CHO supplementation on cycling performance during eight days of a strenuous mountain bike race in a hot environment has been studied in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this study, the PRO-CHO supplemented group completed the race faster than the CHO supplemented group, but in contrast to our study, ingestion of the beverages was not controlled but ingested <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Furthermore, the daily total energy content was not controlled, and in the CHO group, the body weight was reduced after the intervention period. Therefore, the performance-enhancing effect of PRO-CHO compared to CHO supplementation during repeated days of racing in the previous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] may be related to negative energy balance in the CHO group rather than the addition of protein to the carbohydrate beverage.</p><p>In the present trial the diet was energy-balanced, standardized, and controlled.

A carbohydrate-rich diet was served to both groups to negate any effect of suboptimal carbohydrate intake on recovery of glycogen stores between training sessions and a recovery-beverage containing both carbohydrate and protein was served immediately after each training session in line with the recommendation and normal practice within this group of elite cyclists. Therefore, we cannot rule out that protein ingestion during exercise would be beneficial on performance under circumstances where the nutrient guidelines are not followed and/or the energy intake is insufficient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Test protocol</title><p>The acute and accumulated reduction in 5-min all-out performance during the training camp reflected the high physical demand of the camp. A time trial test was chosen rather than a time to exhaustion test because time trial tests more closely simulate an actual performance situation and hence are regarded a more valid measure of performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, the performance in the 10-s sprint test was not significantly affected after either 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;h cycling or the accumulated hours of cycling during the training camp. The latter indicates that this test was not sensitive to catch development of fatigue and impairment in recovery. The 10-s peak power test was chosen as peak power is typically obtained after 3&#x02013;5 s in a 30-s Wingate test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and this test allows quick recovery with the impending 5-min performance test in mind.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Markers for muscle damage</title><p>LDH and myoglobin as markers for muscle damage were not significantly different between the groups. Surprisingly, the results suggest that carbohydrate supplementation rather than protein plus carbohydrate attenuated the increase in plasma concentration of CK as a marker for muscle damage during the strenuous training camp. However, there was a large variation in CK between the subjects and the overall CK values were at the low end. Additionally, it must be emphasized that CK was higher at baseline in the CHO group due to high values in two subjects. Therefore, one should be cautious when drawing conclusions. Overall, the changes in markers for muscle damage were small, which probably is explained by the fact that cycling is primarily based on concentric muscle contractions. In agreement with the latter suggestion, orienteering has a greater proportion of eccentric muscle actions, and in a group of elite orienteers we in an earlier study observed an increase in markers for muscle damage in the group ingesting carbohydrates before and after each of 13 training sessions during a one-week training camp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This increase was attenuated in the group ingesting protein before and a protein-carbohydrate beverage after each training session. Although not all trials are in agreement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], many previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] show that protein ingestion immediately <italic>after</italic> exercise attenuates markers of muscle damage. Therefore, the addition of a protein supplement <italic>during</italic> exercise may further attenuate the increased rate of muscle damage that is associated with exercise that includes an eccentric component. Future trials should clarify if protein supplementation <italic>during</italic> exercise has an additive effect for decreasing muscle damage beyond what has been observed when provided immediately <italic>after</italic> exercise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Immune function</title><p>Studies have shown that high availability of carbohydrate reduces the immune depression associated with extreme endurance training in athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, little is known about the effect of protein supplementation on immune function in relation to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In the present study, changes in the immune marker salivary IgA did not differ between groups, which may be related to the fact that subjects were in energy balance and the carbohydrate intake was high in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Limitations</title><p>A drawback of the present study was that we were not allow to obtain muscle biopsies from the subjects since they were all part of or candidates for the Danish National Team in cycling (U23). Analysis of muscle biopsies could have given information about if the adaptation to training stimuli differed between the intervention groups.</p><p>This field study was performed at a training camp with a temporarily established laboratory. Since the time frame for testing all athletes in the beginning and end of training camp was very short, it was only possible to perform a short-term performance test. We assumed that extra protein ingested during training could reduce muscle damage and this would be reflected in a short-term test. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that ingestion of extra carbohydrate during cycling in CHO compared to PRO-CHO actually would be beneficial for performance in a more long-term endurance test due to greater glucose availability.</p><p>It is debatable whether our results are transferable to other groups of elite endurance athletes than cyclists. Cycling is dominated by concentric muscle contraction and probably only a minimum of muscle damage is induced, even though the cyclists increased their training load during the training camp. We cannot exclude that other types of athletes (runners and triathletes) may benefit from ingestion of protein during exercise when following a strenuous training regime, particularly those that use predominantly eccentric muscle contractions (such as downhill running and resistance training).</p><p>A recovery beverage was provided after each training session with a dose of protein corresponding approximately to the amount of high-quality protein that appears to maximize the acute anabolic response in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We hypothesize that the recovery beverage may have diminished the potential positive effect of ingestion of protein during exercise. Therefore, it is possible that we would have observed a positive effect in PRO-CHO if the habitual recovery beverage had been excluded during the training camp. In regards to mitigating markers of muscle damage, a potential positive effect of co-ingestion of protein during exercise may have been visible if we had included elderly subjects who require a greater amount of protein (35&#x02013;40&#x000a0;g protein) to maximize skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Partial substitution of carbohydrate with whey protein hydrolysate during exercise has no significant acute ergogenic effect on performance in elite cyclists compared to ingestion of isocaloric recommended amounts of carbohydrates. Similarly, when a recovery drink containing PRO&#x02009;+&#x02009;CHO was ingested immediately post-exercise, the decline in performance after a strenuous training camp was not significantly different between the groups, indicating no beneficial effect on recovery from ingesting protein plus carbohydrate during exercise compared to ingestion of carbohydrate alone.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CHO</term><def><p>Carbohydrate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CK</term><def><p>Creatine kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>E%</term><def><p>Energy %</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR<sub>max</sub></term><def><p>Maximal heart rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IgA</term><def><p>Immunoglobulin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDH</term><def><p>Lactate dehydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OAL</term><def><p>Physical activity level</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRO-CHO</term><def><p>Protein and carbohydrate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TT</term><def><p>Time trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTE</term><def><p>Time to exhaustion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEE</term><def><p>Total energy expenditure</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>This work was supported by Arla Foods Ingredients Group P/S and Team Denmark, which is an organization funded by the Danish government with the purpose of promoting elite sports in Denmark.
