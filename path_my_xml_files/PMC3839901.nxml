Children with LVAS may have unstable hearing (i.e., fluctuating or progressive hearing loss) during childhood. This progressively deteriorating hearing loss is usually associated with exercise, minor head trauma or upper respiratory tract infection [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. </p><p>Evidence from many previous studies suggests that cochlear implantation (CI) is effective in patients whose hearing condition or speech perception has worsened to a severe-to-profound level (i.e., they are unable to detect sounds quieter than 90 dB HL or score &#x0003c;40% on the monosyllabic word test) because of LVAS [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Miyamoto et al. [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed that their 14 adult patients attained a mean score of 69.2% on the sentence test after implantation but only achieved a mean score of 28% on the monosyllabic word test. The results of our previous research also indicated that after three years of CI use, patients with LVAS had better speech perception in the implanted ear than in the other ear with a hearing aid [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. That finding indicates that although the implanted ear originally had poorer auditory and speech perception abilities, it improved considerably and surpassed the other ear over time.</p><p>Miyamoto et al. [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] demonstrated that 46% to 65% of patients in past studies were found to have progressive sensorineural hearing loss associated with LVAS. Gopen et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] also mentioned that three long-term studies [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reached similar conclusions. However, Emmett [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Zalza et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] obtained contradictory results; they reported that most of their patients had stable hearing. Nevertheless, the follow-up spans of these studies were either short or ranged greatly. Regarding Mandarin-speaking patients with LVAS, Wu et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] recruited 101 CI patients with LVAS and found that 75% of them had fluctuating hearing loss. Lai and Shiao [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that most of their patients had stable hearing in at least one ear during follow-up; only 33% fluctuated. However, the sample size was rather small (twelve cases only).</p><p>Despite the effectiveness of cochlear implantation, clinicians are caught in a dilemma when dealing with the optimal timing of surgery for patients with LVAS. The dilemma is related to the hearing fluctuation. In one way, the hearing of these patients may fluctuate; although it may deteriorate to a profound level, it still can return to an aidable level. Therefore, implantation that is performed too early may not allow adequate time for hearing to recover on its own. On the other hand, waiting for too long may miss the best time frame to provide the secure auditory input that is required for normal speech and language development.</p><p> As <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081568-t001">Table 1</xref> shows, many studies have proposed that the best timing for implantation is when a patient&#x02019;s hearing has deteriorated to a profound level [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In our previous study [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we suggested that patients with LVAS should receive implantation within three months of when their hearing began to deteriorate and remain at the profound level. However, our clinical observations show that although many patients with LVAS have considerable residual hearing, some of them have high-frequency loss, which worsens their speech perception; many others have poor speech intelligibility. This implies that the level of residual hearing may not be an adequate indicator or criterion with which to determine implantation timing because it does not take speech perception and intelligibility into consideration. However, there are too few data available for clinicians and parents to evaluate how much improvement in speech perception and intelligibility can be expected after implantation. Only with information about these standards can the clinicians determine the best timing for implantation.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0081568-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0081568.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Comparison among studies that addressed the timing of implantation and postsurgical speech perception performance.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of&#x000a0;&#x000a0; patients</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">ImpAge (mean)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Level of deafness</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Timing proposed&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome measures (mean)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Au &#x00026; Gibson [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.3-9.8 (6.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Profound</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sentence score &#x0003c; 40% with hearing aids or 3 significant decreases in hearing within 1 year</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Word (43%); sentence (79%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Miyamoto et al.

The CAP and SIR scales were rated either by the parents or by the speech-language therapists who knew the children best. The speech perception tests were conducted in a sound-insulated booth. The stimulus level was controlled at 60 dB HL. The children were asked to orally repeat the words or sentences they heard. The easy-sentence and difficult-sentence tests were scored based on how many key words the child correctly repeated, while the PB word test was scored according to how many words the child correctly repeated. The Mandarin tone recognition test was scored according to the tones only. A word would be counted correct as long as its tone was correctly repeated; the mistakes the patient made on the vowel or consonant were overlooked. The number of the correctly repeated items for each test was converted into percentages (% correct) for further analysis. To minimize learning effects, the testing lists were randomly selected. The answers were recorded for later evaluation, and the same procedure was administered preoperatively and postoperatively. The following analysis was primarily based on the children&#x02019;s scores before implantation, one year after implantation and most recently.</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were summarized using frequencies, percentages, median, means, standard deviations (SDs) and ranges.

However, the results of the present study show that younger age at implantation is not necessarily related to better speech perception and intelligibility outcomes. Rather, the late group generally had better speech perception performance and higher CAP/SIR scores compared with the early group after one year of implant use, indicating the late group&#x02019;s rapid improvements after cochlear implantation. This probably resulted from the late group&#x02019;s preoperative residual hearing and language experience. After some years of implant use, the early group showed significant improvement at their most recent follow-up and reached a similar performance level as the late group did in the subjective and objective evaluations. This finding shows that earlier implantation allows patients with LVAS to develop their language skills through a gradual process similar to that undergone by normal-hearing children. Yet, it does not necessarily lead to better speech perception outcomes because those who get implanted at a later age can take advantage of their past language experience to achieve good speech performance after their fluctuating hearing is restored and stabilized by CI.</p><p>Many of the patients in the late group received CI because their unstable hearing continued to fluctuate and to deteriorate, leading to unsatisfactory speech intelligibility despite considerable residual hearing and many years of hearing aid use. One factor worth noticing is that more than half of the participants were implanted after the age of 5 years, suggesting that many patients with LVAS undergo cochlear implantation at a later age, possibly because of the fluctuating hearing loss. Many previous studies also used a large proportion of postlingually deafened participants [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and studies that focused on prelingual implantees were relatively unavailable [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These studies showed that many adult patients with LVAS need cochlear implantation despite many years of experience with hearing aids. We thus suggest that if patients have unstable hearing, high-resolution computed tomography and genetic examinations should take place to confirm the cause of hearing fluctuation, and regular follow-up is needed.</p><p>The evaluations, however, should not solely depend on patients&#x02019; auditory performances and PB word scores (which are usually used to define hearing loss level) because LVAS patients have unstable/fluctuating hearing. The CAP scores only reflect the patients&#x02019; auditory level at the time of the evaluation and fail to indicate whether the patient has unstable hearing. Because of unstable hearing, auditory performance and hearing thresholds are not entirely reliable. The PB word test also reveals that LVAS patients progress slowly on the test after having used the implants for one year. These outcomes suggest that speech perception and speech intelligibility are better evaluation tools because they represent a combination of total past hearing experience and language acquisition results before implantation. Thus, speech intelligibility (SIR scale) and a more comprehensive speech perception test should be administered during preoperative and postoperative evaluations.</p><p>The observation that the long-term effectiveness of CI was better than that of the hearing aids suggests that the inclusion criteria for CI candidacy could be expanded [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Currently, it remains unclear whether and when the patient with fluctuating or progressive hearing loss should receive implants. The selection of CI candidates primarily focuses on patients with severe-to-profound hearing loss defined by their hearing threshold or PB scores. Patients with unstable hearing could thus be easily overlooked.</p><p>Due to unstable hearing, some patients or parents of the patients hesitate over the decision of CI. They fear that CI may destroy the residual hearing, affecting their current speech perception level, or rule out the possibility that the hearing could recover on its own. Many of them thus delay the implantation surgery. This delay in implantation may cause the patients to miss the optimal time frame for developing good speech intelligibility and proper learning skills because the unstable hearing condition remains unchanged, which may further affect their life quality [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In view of such cases, we wish to establish a reference for evaluating cochlear implantation candidacy and suggesting an optimal surgical timing. Our results suggest that patients with LVAS have the potential to score higher than 80% on speech perception tests and to reach the highest level of speech intelligibility after using implants for more than 5 years. Those who get implanted after 5 years of age even achieve it within one year after implantation. Therefore, although we cannot suggest a specific time frame for surgical intervention based on our data, we encourage patients with LVAS to consider cochlear implantation if they are not able to reach the performance level suggested in this study and do not show much improvement for more than three months. It may not be necessary to wait until they can only hear sounds louder than 90 dB HL or score below 40% on a PB word test (i.e., until they are defined as having profound hearing loss). For further studies, we suggest recruiting more subjects from different clinics to do a larger-scale long-term outcome survey, which may help strengthen our proposal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the postoperative speech perception and intelligibility are satisfactory after more than 5 years of CI use in a small cohort of children with LVAS. Although our preliminary results are promising, further research such as a large-scale long-term outcome survey is indicated. Nevertheless, we suggest LVAS patients with insufficient speech perception or speech intelligibility performance to undergo earlier CI because it may provide a better opportunity and greater amount of time to develop their language skills in a manner similar to that of normal-hearing children. </p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0081568.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
