Low mood also affects a third of stroke survivors; yet psychological support is poor. While Arts for Health interventions have been shown to improve well-being in people with mild-to-moderate depression post-stroke, their role in helping people regain sense of self, well-being and confidence has yet to be evaluated. The main aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of conducting a pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an Arts for Health group intervention (&#x02018;HeART of Stroke&#x02019; (HoS)) for stroke survivors. HoS is a 10-session artist-facilitated group intervention held in the community over 14&#x02005;weeks. It offers a non-judgemental, supportive environment for people to explore sense of self, potentially enhancing well-being and confidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Sixty-four people, up to 2&#x02005;years post-stroke, recruited via secondary care research staff or community stroke/rehabilitation teams in two UK centres will be randomised to either HoS plus usual care or usual care only. Self-reported outcomes, measured at baseline and approximately 5&#x02005;months postrandomisation, will include stroke-related, well-being, mood, self-esteem, quality of life and process measures. Analyses will focus on estimating key feasibility parameters (eg, rates of recruitment, retention, intervention attendance). We will develop outcome and resource use data collection methods to inform an effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis in the future trial. Interviews, with a sample of participants, will explore the acceptability of the intervention and study processes, as well as experiences of the HoS group.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>National Health Service (NHS), Research and Development and University ethical approvals have been obtained. Two peer-reviewed journal publications are planned plus one service user led publication.

This work was instigated by RC, a stroke survivor and co-applicant. While working on the NIHR-Stroke Research Network (SRN) Rehabilitation Clinical Studies Group (CSG), he recognised that there was very little research into his experienced loss of confidence in life, a &#x02018;hidden&#x02019; area of great importance to him. Through discussions with other stroke survivors it became apparent that this was a common experience. RC organised a small national seminar of researchers in the area of psychological rehabilitation and identity research, and brought CEH and FG together. This work is the result of that meeting. RC has been involved in national policy initiatives (eg, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)) and two other service user members are representatives of the local Stroke Association and Different Strokes (two UK charities). We will recruit three additional service users from the Cambridge centre. One service user will be a member of the study steering group. All out of pocket expenses will be paid and time funded in accordance with INVOLVE&#x02019;s recommendations,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> and working relationships will be informed by recommendations in INVOLVE&#x02019;s briefing pack.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Service users will be provided with regular email updates, be invited to provide comments via email and to attend three service user meetings over the course of the study. All service users will be invited to review drafts of the study report, contribute to writing the Plain English Summary and advise on dissemination. They will also be invited to comment on, contribute to, and lead on other outputs such as web blogs and articles in newsletters.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size considerations</title><p>A sample size of 64 will be adequate to estimate, to an acceptable degree of precision, the key parameters needed to address the study objectives. A questionnaire return rate of 80% would mean data at baseline and 1&#x02005;month postintervention would be available for 51 participants. Estimating the recruitment rate will help us to plan the full-scale RCT. Precision of this estimate will be summarised using the distance from the estimate to the upper/lower limit of the 95% CI. With a total sample size of 64, the recruitment rate will be estimated with a precision of &#x000b1;6% (assuming a recruitment rate of 30%). Assuming a questionnaire return rate of 80%, the return rate (in the short term) will be estimated with a precision of &#x000b1;10%. We aim to estimate the SD of potential primary outcome measures in preparation for a formal sample size calculation for a larger RCT. Assuming these outcomes are standardised (SD of 1), the precision (as summarised by SE) will be 0.1 based on n=51 with follow-up data. For the full trial, the sample size calculation will be inflated appropriately to take into account potential clustering effects due to the group-based nature of the intervention.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> The aim is not to test the effectiveness of the intervention. However, we will take into account the magnitude of the estimated effect size (95% CI) when considering the plausibility of effect sizes to be used in the sample size calculation for the full trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Participants</title><p>At each centre (Bournemouth and Cambridge), we aim to recruit 32 participants (64 in total). In each centre we will run two successive iterations of the HoS group intervention (in total: 4 blocks of 16 participants recruited, 2 blocks per centre). In each block of 16 participants recruited, half will be randomised to HoS plus usual care and the other half to usual care alone.</p><p><italic>Inclusion criteria</italic>
