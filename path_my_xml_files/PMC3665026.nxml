Professionals athlete must exercise at high intensity with restricted rest times between attempts; thus recovery methods in sport can aid athletes to improve performance in competitions.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In order to enhancement function, a kind of post-exercise recovery interventions are frequently utilized to improve recovery from training time.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The composition and timing of nutrient intake can considerably impact recovery from severe exercise.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Some appearance of recovery, including reduced muscle damage and boosted performance can be magnified by nutritional intervention, carbohydrate (CHO)-electrolyte drink beverage intake.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The beverages are generally utilized throughout and after exercise, ranging from bottled water to CHO-electrolyte replacement drinks.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Beverages can aid in quick restoration of performance, blood sugar and muscle glycogen if used instantly after exercise. Post-exercise recovery drink have underlined on timing, type of beverage, macro- and micro-nutrient content (calories, CHO and protein (PRO), mineral, and vitamins).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Recent research suggests that a CHO-PRO) beverage consumed after exercise may satisfyingly affect the exercise recovery.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Therefore, composition of PRO to CHO in beverages can enhance performance and recovery between exercise sessions with a short recovery period.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Chocolate milk is as a popular and easily available drink among children and adults and is proposed to be effective. Thomas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Karp <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have shown that chocolate milk is an effective recovery drink after exercise in comparison with CHO replacement drink and fluid replacement drink. Another study,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that post-exercise chocolate milk consumption is as effective as a CHO beverage. Lunn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] examined effects of chocolate milk consumption on markers of PRO turnover, muscle glycogen, and performance during recovery from endurance exercise, and observed beneficial effects of chocolate milk compared to the CHO only beverage.</p><p>Dough, a yogurt-based, salty drink popular[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and non-alcoholic beer are two other famous drinks in Iranian diet. Dough is a low-CHO high-PRO drink, which has a high amount of electrolytes like sodium (usually 0.8-1 g/100 g) and high calcium while non-alcoholic beer is a high-CHO low-PRO with vitamin B, C, and mineral. Although these beverages are highly consumed by professional athletes, their effect on post-exercise recovery is not assessed yet. In present study, we tried to evaluate the effects of different beverage consumption on recovery time, Performance, lipids profile, inflammatory biomarkers after RAST test in Iranian professional Taekwondo athletes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted as repeated measures crossover design with 22 men Taekwondo player (mean &#x000b1; SD: Age 23.8 &#x000b1; 2.7 years; Stature 173.7 &#x000b1; 4.3 cm; BMI 24.02 &#x000b1; 0.92). These athletes were involved in professional sports. Before beginning the study, all subjects were informed of all procedures of the study and signed an informed consent. Participants were asked to refrain from exercise 24 h before trial initiation and to sustain their customary physical activity and dietary patterns. Participants were asked to fill a &#x0201c;food recall&#x0201d; for 1 day before intervention. Afterwards, venous blood samples were obtained from all participants. Subjects completed standard protocol running-based anaerobic sprint test (R.A.S.T), after a self-determined warm-up for 10 min. Participants concluded after protocol blood lactate was determined by lactometer (Scout) so that immediately and 1 h posterior R.A.S.T protocol received no.1 beverage. Subjects spend 2 h recovery periods. Finally, after 2 h recovery time, blood sample were obtained. Second and third sessions trial were similar to prior trial, separated by at least 4 days, instead of no. 1 beverage, participants received no.2 and no.3 beverages. The subjects were also asked to replicate their diet and activity in during study period. Dietary analyses were performed using nutritionist IV software.

In this study, the serum CRP levels in Dough treatment was reduced more than non-alcoholic beer, whereas, in CHO fluid treatment was increased. However, there was no difference in lipids profile, among groups. On the other hand, VO<sub>2max</sub> increased in Dough and non-alcoholic beer treatments, but not in CHO fluid group.</p><p>On the one hand, in a study carried out by Agerbaek <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] On a total of 58 healthy, non-fat men, it was concluded that 6-week intervention with fermentative product of milk caused a significant decrease in LDL; however, HDL in the both groups of Placebo and intervention showed no changes. On the other hand, in a time-frame study carried out by Demosthenes <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] on a total of 1514 men and 1528 women who use dairy products including milk, cheese, and yogurt, it was figured out that the diet containing dairy products has no relation to the level of HDL. Furthermore, in another study,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] 34 women were using yogurt or fermentative milk during 4 weeks and the results showed that dairy products cause a decrease in the level of LDL. In fact, the observations were parallel with the results of the current study and it showed that using yogurt drink causes a significant decrease in the level of LDL. Out of the possible reasons for the resemblance in these results, it can be pointed that there was no differences in the ingredients of yogurt and yogurt drink of which calcium and vitamin D cause a decrease in LDL. Whereas, other studies showed different results; for instance, in a cross 3-period, 7-week study done upon 29 healthy women, intervention with yogurt caused an increase in HDL but upon LDL no impact was noticed.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In another study carried out by McNamara <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] the 3-week effect of yogurt intervention on 18 men were investigated and the results showed that yogurt had no effect on lipids profile. The period of study and the subjects were the possible reasons for conflicting results of above mentioned studies with the current study.</p><p>In cross-sectional study done on 3042 men and women using dairy products, the results showed that dairy intake causes a significant decrease in the level of CRP.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The study had the same results as those of the present study and its possible reasons are: the presence of PRO of high-quality, riboflavin, genjoged linolenic acid[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that might be effective on Biomarkers. Whereas, in a study, Van Meijl investigated the impact of dairy intake on 35 fat or overweight volunteers during 8 weeks, and he noticed no impacts upon the prominent factors.
