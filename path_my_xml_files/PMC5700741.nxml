To regain functional elbow motion several conservative- and surgical treatment options are available. Conservative treatment includes physical therapy, intra-articular injections with corticosteroids and a static progressive or dynamic splinting program. If conservative treatment fails, an operative release of the posttraumatic stiff elbow is often performed. The best Evidence-Based rehabilitation protocol for patients after an operative release is unknown to date and differs per surgeon, hospital and country. Options include early- or delayed motion supervised by a physical therapist, immediate continuous passive motion (CPM), (night) splinting and a static progressive or dynamic splinting program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The SET-Study (Stiff Elbow Trial) is a single-centre, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The primary objective of this study is to compare the active Range of Motion (ROM) (flexion arc and rotational arc) twelve months after surgery between three groups. The first group will receive in-hospital CPM in combination with early motion Physical Therapy (PT) supervised by a physical therapist, the second group will receive only in-hospital early motion PT supervised by a physical therapist and the third group will receive outpatient supervised PT from postoperative day seven till ten.

After trauma, up to 12 % of all elbows end up with a decreased range of motion (ROM) requiring surgical release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], however the etiopathogenesis remains largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. According to Morrey and colleagues, most activities during the day can be accomplished with 100 degrees of ROM regarding to flexion-extension arc (30 to 130) and 100 degrees of forearm rotation (50 to 50). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Nevertheless, more recently, others reported that functional elbow ROM necessary for activities of daily living may be greater than previously concluded. Contemporary tasks, i.e. as using a computer mouse and keyboard, appear to require greater pronation than drinking from a glass, and using a cellular telephone usually requires greater flexion than for example eating with fork and knife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">To regain functional elbow motion several conservative and surgical treatment options are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Surgical contracture release can be performed open or arthroscopically depending on the type of deformity of the posttraumatic elbow and surgeons&#x02019; preference. The results of both techniques are largely comparable, but the amount of complications seems to rise with the extent of the surgical procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recurrence of elbow stiffness up to 37% remains a point of concern and is unrelated to the techniques used to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Post-operative rehabilitation protocols after operative release for a patient with a posttraumatic stiff elbow include: PT, CPM or a static progressive or dynamic splinting program as prospectively studied by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a retrospective study, Lindenhovius et al. previously found that CPM may be redundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, from basic science perspective, it theoretically seems that due to early expression of myofibroblasts after trauma that are susceptible to traction (i.e. biomechanical stimuli), it seems that early motion or traction as provided by CPM should be avoided until after the acute phase in order to prohibit the myofibroblasts to produce abundant extra-cellular matrix. This hypothesis is theoretical, based on preliminary histology studies by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In contrast to CPM and splinting programs, in all previous described studies physical therapy plays a role and is therefore always included in rehabilitation protocols.</p><p id="Par29">However, the best Evidence-based rehabilitation protocol regarding additional treatment and timing of physical therapy for patients after an operative release is unknown and differs per surgeon, hospital and country. The most recent review on this topic does not show a clear clinical benefit of any of the respective post-operative rehabilitation protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, no randomized controlled trials were included. Therefore, we study which type of rehabilitation protocol after elbow capsule release at one year after surgery is most effective in terms of range of motion (ROM) in a randomized controlled trial. The potential health care efficiency gain consists of more homogeneity in rehabilitation after elbow capsule release and less costs regarding in-hospital stay. Hence, unnecessary treatments could be avoided and a more universal treatment can be established.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par30">The SET-study is a three-arm, prospective, single-centre, randomized controlled trial with twelve months of follow-up.

The SET-study will compare management of these rehabilitation protocols by using in-hospital CPM in combination with early motion supervised PT, in-hospital early motion supervised PT without CPM and outpatient delayed supervised PT. Based upon current scientific literature, there is no clear preference for one of the treatments regarding the increase of ROM after surgery. CPM in elbow surgery may be redundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and also in other joints such as the knee, the use of CPM as after treatment seems ineffective and unnecessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">The different treatment options are regularly applied for posttraumatic elbow contractures in the participating institution and all surgeons participating in this study are familiar with the procedure. Patients in all cohorts are likely to benefit from treatment. The motivation for the study is that unnecessary treatment burden for patients (prolonged hospital stay, because of CPM sessions) as well as redundant costs for society can be avoided, a more universal Evidence-Based method of treatment can be established and the quality of the care can be improved. Regarding to potentially less healthcare costs, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed in a separate study.</p><p id="Par79">Patient enrolment will start in March 2017 and we expect to enroll 4 patients per month. Considering the one-year follow-up, publication of data will be expected in 2020.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CESD-R</term><def><p id="Par5">Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPM</term><def><p id="Par6">Continuous Passive Motion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par7">Computed Tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DASH</term><def><p id="Par8">Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPT</term><def><p id="Par9">Delayed Physical Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM</term><def><p id="Par10">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDC</term><def><p id="Par11">Electronic Data Capture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCID</term><def><p id="Par12">Minimal Clinically Important Difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MEPS</term><def><p id="Par13">Mayo Elbow Performance Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NTR</term><def><p id="Par14">Netherlands Trial Registry (in Dutch: Nederlands Trial Register)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OES</term><def><p id="Par15">Oxford Elbow Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS</term><def><p id="Par16">Pain Catastrophizing Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PROMs</term><def><p id="Par17">Patient Reported Outcome Measures</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PT</term><def><p id="Par18">Physical Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROM</term><def><p id="Par19">Range of motion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SET</term><def><p id="Par20">Stiff Elbow Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF</term><def><p id="Par21">Short Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p id="Par22">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par23">Visual Analogue Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WORQ</term><def><p id="Par24">Work Related Questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None.
