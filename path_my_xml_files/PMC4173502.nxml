Despite introduction of new anti-emetic medication and short acting opioids and anaesthetics, 20-70% of surgical patients still experience PONV[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and universal pharmacological PONV prophylaxis does not seem to be cost effective.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] PONV can lead to high levels of patient distress, dissatisfaction[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and may lead to increased health care costs, increased recovery room time, expanded nursing care and the need for overnight hospital admission.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There remains a need to develop cost-effective, ideally non-pharmacological, strategies to decrease the incidence of PONV, especially in high risk patients. Psychometric and stress assessment[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] tests to evaluate the patient satisfaction and feeling of well being after general anesthesia revealed that a significant improvement could be achieved by reduction of PONV. Advances in surgical techniques have shown a trend towards standard open procedures being modified to become less invasive and shorter in duration. Patients predominantly incur a fluid deficit due to mandatory preoperative fasting and therefore, guided intravenous (IV) fluid therapy, targeted towards replacement of the pre-operative volume deficit, may improve clinical anesthesia outcomes and reduce the incidence of PONV.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The last menstrual dates (LMP) of all 200 subjects were noted, as previous studies have shown correlation between different phases of menstrual cycle and PONV in women.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This study is designed to compare the infusion of balanced salt solution at 30 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> and 10 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> with respects to incidence of PONV and to correlate various phases of menstrual cycle with incidence of PONV in healthy women undergoing ambulatory gynaecological laparoscopic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Hospital Ethical Committee and a written informed consent from the patients. This prospective, randomized, double blinded study was conducted on 200 patients of ASA physical status I/II, of either sex in the age group of 20-40 years, who were scheduled to undergo ambulatory, elective gynaecological laparoscopic surgery in the supine position under general anesthesia with controlled ventilation. Patients were randomized according to the contents of a sealed envelope labelled Group I and Group II.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patient's with hypertension, diabetes, history of congestive cardiac failure, valvular heart disease, motion sickness, epilepsy, hemoglobin level &#x0003c;10gm %, relevant drug allergy and undergoing procedure involving more than a diagnostic laparoscopy surgery were excluded from the surgery. Patient's who have received anti-emetic medication within 24 h prior to surgery and intraoperative events like hypotension and excessive blood loss during surgery were omitted from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Anesthetic technique</title><p>A detailed pre-anesthetic check-up was done one day prior to surgery. Details of patient's clinical history, LMP and physical examination were noted. Baseline investigations included complete hemogram, random blood sugar, urine routine and microscopy and chest X-ray (PA view). All patients were made to fast overnight and were administered tab. Alprazolam 0.25 mg orally at 10 pm on the night before surgery. For the purpose of study, patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: Group I (<italic>n</italic> = 100) received 10 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> compound sodium lactate (CSL) and Group II (<italic>n</italic> = 100) received 30 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> CSL. To maintain patient and investigator blinding, I.V. fluid administration was initiated in the preoperative area by the investigator, who inserted an 18G I.V. cannula and attached 500 ml CSL to it. The investigator did not see the patient again until they were shifted to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). In all patients, fluid was administered to the patient according to body weight in the preoperative area and continued in the operating theatre and completed by the end of 1 h. Patients returned to the PACU without fluids attached and neither the patient nor the investigator was aware of the volume given or the group allocation. After attaching the monitors to the patient, baseline parameters (SpO<sub>2</sub>, ECG lead II, heart rate, systolic, diastolic, mean BP and respiratory rate) were noted. All patients received paramedication with Midazolam 1-2 mg I.V. bolus and Ranitidine 50 mg I.V. in operation theatre. Anesthesia was induced with Fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>) I.V. and Propofol (2-2.5 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>) I.V. Neuromuscular block was achieved with Vecuronium Bromide 0.08-0.1 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> I.V. Patients were ventilated via face mask with N<sub>2</sub>O 70% and 0.4% Isoflurane in O<sub>2</sub> for 180 seconds before endotracheal intubation was done and an oro-gastric tube of 14 French gauge was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with N<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub> mixture (2:1), 1% Isoflurane and intermittent boluses of Vecuronium administered I.V. for neuromuscular blockade. During anesthesia hemodynamic parameters (SpO<sub>2</sub>, ECG lead II, heart rate, systolic, diastolic, mean BP and respiratory rate) were monitored and recorded every 5 min. Ventilation technique was aimed at maintaining oxygen saturation between 98-100% and end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> between 30 and 40. Diclofenac Sodium (Justin) 75 mg I.V. was given to all patients as routine analgesia intraoperatively. At the end of surgical procedure anesthesia was discontinued, muscle relaxation was reversed with Neostigmine (0.05mg. kg<sup>-1</sup>) I.V. and Glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg. kg<sup>-1</sup>) I.V. Patients were questioned after regaining full consciousness and assessed for PONV and pain every half hourly in PACU until 4 h. Fentanyl 50 &#x003bc;gm I.V. bolus was given to patients who complained of pain and repeated after 15 min if required.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Nausea was graded as follows[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</title><p>0 No nausea</p><p>1 Nausea only</p><p>2 Retching/1 episode of vomiting</p><p>3 &#x0003e; 1 episode of vomiting</p><p>Grades of nausea and rescue anti-emetic regimen were documented for all patients till 4 h after anesthesia. As the discomfort experienced due to nausea is subjective, rescue anti-emetics were given only on occurrence of symptoms and not on demand. Rescue anti-emetic in the form of Ondansetron 4mg I.V. was given for grades 2 and for patients who progressed to grade 3, Metoclopramide 10mg I.V. was added.

On basis of the observations and data analysis, we found out that intraoperative administration of 30 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> CSL compared with 10 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> CSL significantly reduced the incidence of nausea and vomiting post-operatively. Perioperative hypoperfusion of the gut mucosa owing to hypovolemia and consequent ischemia results in the release of serotonin, one of the most potent triggers of PONV.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Most of the patients are hypovolemic before the induction of anaesthesia due to overnight fasting.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Euvolemia is not achieved, until the post-operative period and by that time factors causing nausea/vomiting are well established. Bowel mucosal perfusion may be a factor in PONV and oesophageal Doppler studies have reported that goal directed fluid therapy aimed at maintaining stroke volume may lead to return of bowel function, decreasing the length of hospital stay and reducing the incidence of PONV.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Supplemental fluid load most likely decreases the volume deficit leading to a positive effect on splanchnic perfusion which might inhibit the impending intestinal ischemia. Chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) is the most probable place that is affected by dehydration.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Yogendran <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] who administered I.V. fluids before the induction of anaesthesia were unable to show a significant difference in the early post-operative period but reported a decrease in incidence of late PONV. Ali <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have reported that a supplemental preoperative I.V. fluid therapy with 15 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> significantly reduced the incidence of PONV. Magner <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that the administration of a crystalloid solution of 30 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> to healthy women undergoing ambulatory gynaecologic laparoscopy reduced the incidence of PONV. Holter <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] suggested that the intraoperative administration of 40 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> of fluid reduced the incidence of PONV. In all of the above studies, supplemental fluid volume, whether it was administrated intraoperatively or before the induction of anesthesia, was large. Although, the effect of fluid management in maintaining cardiovascular stability and renal function in major surgery has been studied, their place in minor surgery still remains to be established. Perioperative administration of large volumes may have significant adverse effects, especially in the patients who have cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, lung, or cerebral disorders. For this reason, only ASA I and ASA II patients were selected for the clinical investigation in the present study. Papadimitriou <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Habib <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] suggested that the combination of the anti-emetics were superior, which is probably explained by the fact that the two drugs have different sites of action, thus preventing emesis by blocking different pathways. Adanir <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that PONV can be further decreased by means of compensation of fluid losses of patients 2 h prior to the operation rather than by the compensation of fluid losses during the operation. Their argument is explained by the fact that if the fluid deficit is covered 2 h prior to the operation, the crystalloid fluids diffuse outside of the blood vessels into tissues and this allows the fluid to restore the deficit at the cellular level which may affect both the peripheral (mucosal hypoperfusion of gastrointestinal tract) and central (probably the hydration of CTZ cells) mechanisms of PONV. Differences that exist between the present study and those of previous investigators may be due to heterogenous surgical approaches, demographic variability and different volumes of fluid administration. The difference in the incidence of PONV in males and females has been attributed to fluctuations in female sex hormones.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Beattie <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported how a hormone-related threshold for PONV is altered by general anesthesia and mensuration has been reported as an important independent risk factor in PONV. In the present study, a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting were reported by the patients in menstrual phase of cycle, and required rescue anti-emetics according to the protocol. The role of supplemental oxygen, both intraoperatively and post-operatively, in decreasing incidence of PONV has been emphasized time and again in various studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] To avoid the confounding effect of supplemental oxygen on the results of the study all patients were given 30/70 ratio of O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O through surgery and 4L.min<sup>-1</sup> by mask for 2 h post-operatively. As there was no significant difference in the hemodynamic parameters of the two groups, hypotension and hypercarbia were excluded as causative factors of PONV.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, tissue oxygenation, mucosal perfusion and emetogenic mediator released were not measured, thus the mechanism of attenuation of PONV by I.V. fluid still remains speculative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Modern multivariable studies, meta-analysis and systemic reviews have greatly increased our knowledge about the risk factors of PONV. Consensus is emerging that antiemetic prophylaxis is neither cost effective nor free from side effects. Multimodal management of PONV obviates the need of antiemetic prophylaxis and its associated side effects and therefore the importance of adequate hydration of patients has been stressed on. Our study reported statistically significant difference in the outcome of PONV in the two groups and it clearly elucidates that there was a reduced incidence of PONV and anti-emetic usage in the group receiving 30 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> CSL. We also found a positive correlation between PONV and women in the menstruating phase. To summarize, intravenous hydration is a safe and effective means of preventing PONV and ensuring patient satisfaction at the time of discharge.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Pubmed articles, National Medical Library (AIIMS)</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Watcha</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postoperative nausea and vomiting</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>1992</year><volume>77</volume><fpage>162</fpage><lpage>84</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1609990</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Apfel</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Eubanks</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Consensus guidelines for managing PONV</article-title><source>Anaesth Analg</source><year>2003</year><volume>97</volume><fpage>62</fpage><lpage>71</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Macario</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Weigner</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Carney</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Which clinical anaesthesia outcomes are important to avoid?
