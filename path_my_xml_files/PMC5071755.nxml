The current study investigates the effects of two different amino acids on the human gut-brain system, using a multimodal approach, integrating physiological and neuroimaging data. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, L-tryptophan, L-leucine, glucose and water were administered directly into the gut of 20 healthy subjects. Functional MRI (fMRI) in a resting state paradigm (RS), combined with the assessment of insulin and glucose blood concentration, was performed before and after treatment. Independent component analysis with dual regression technique was applied to RS-fMRI data. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons. In comparison to glucose and water, L-tryptophan consistently modifies the connectivity of the cingulate cortex in the default mode network, of the insula in the saliency network and of the sensory cortex in the somatosensory network. L-leucine has lesser effects on these functional networks. L-tryptophan and L-leucine also modified plasma insulin concentration. Finally, significant correlations were found between brain modifications after L-tryptophan administration and insulin plasma levels. This study shows that acute L-tryptophan and L-leucine intake directly influence the brain networks underpinning the food-reward system and appetite regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Luminal enteral communication is a key factor in the regulation of appetite, food intake and metabolism.

Protein is currently believed to exert the greatest appetite-suppressing effect of the three macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats and proteins) in animals and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. High-protein diets have been extensively studied for their ability to reduce total energy intake and body weight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Mechanisms that have been suggested include stimulation of insulin release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, postprandial thermogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, intestinal gluconeogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, and direct effects of amino acids in regions of the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In addition, it has been hypothesized that protein-induced satiation could be due to alterations in the release of gastrointestinal satiation peptides, such as cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY). Already in 1956, it was suggested that an elevated concentration of plasma amino acids serve as a satiation signal for food intake and thereby results in depressed food intake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. To date the effect of specific amino acids on satiation and appetite is only rarely studied.</p><p>Amino acids, including L-leucine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, L-glutamine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, and L-phenylalanine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> modulate appetite and/or glycemia in lean, obese, or type 2 diabetic subjects. The aromatic amino acid, L-tryptophan, is of particular interest, as previous studies have reported effects on digestive functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and food intake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>It is unknown how amino acids affect specific brain regions. After eating, the brain senses a biochemical change and then signals satiation, but the precise sequence of events has not been determined. Even for established physiological systems such as glucose-insulin regulation, the timing of the interaction between hormonal processes and neural events has mostly been inferred from blood sampling studies. Recently, neuroimaging studies have provided <italic>in vivo</italic> information about the neuro-anatomical correlates of the regulation of energy intake. Temporal orchestration of such systems is, however, crucial to the integration of the neural and hormonal signals that control eating behaviour. In a landmark paper demonstrating eating-related neural activity in the brain, the response was shown to interact with an internal signal, plasma insulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. As it was shown that most amino acids induce an increase in insulin (possibly due to an increase in GLP-1), amino acids could be one of the signals from the gut that interact with the brain through satiation peptides.</p><p>The present study was designed to further investigate the luminal influences of nutrients, which orchestrate gut-brain interactions. The objective was to compare the effects of intragastric L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and L-leucine (L-Leu) on brain networks and the release of insulin and glucose. We used plasma levels to represent physiological differences; this is a reliable measure of appetite and satiety<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In particular the association between brain activity in areas involved in appetite, appetite and satiety rating scores and levels of insulin and glucose was already demonstrated in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>On the basis of previous studies highlighting the differences between L-Trp and L-Leu on digestive functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, with L-leucine stimulating appetite and L-tryptophan stimulating satiety<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, we hypothesized that L-Trp would induce a different activation pattern in the brain, leading to modifications in brain networks related to appetite and metabolism regulation. The selection of the doses of L-tryptophan was based on the daily intake recommended by World Health Organization (WHO)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The doses are comparable to the amount of L-tryptophan in soybeans in a normal portion of an Asian dish. For L-leucine an isocaloric approach to L-tryptophan was chosen. Glucose was chosen as a positive control and water as a negative control as we have previously shown effects on brain activity with both of them<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.

The present findings suggest that intragastric L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and L-leucine (L-Leu) lead to differential modifications in insulin and glucose plasma concentrations and in brain networks connectivity, that are related to metabolic regulation and appetite sensations.</p><p>Our results from laboratory analyses indicate that different amino acids affect specific satiation hormones. In particular, L-tryptophan and L-leucine lead to a significant increase in insulin plasma levels when compared to water, but at the doses given they do not affect glucose levels. The differential effects of amino acids on insulin but not on glucose have been shown before in several studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. On the other hand, and in line with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, glucose is associated with both insulin and glucose plasma levels. As L-Trp and L-Leu have been proposed to be involved in food-intake and regulation of energy homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, our findings suggest that L-tryptophan and L-leucine are key amino acids that affect satiety and appetite perception. To further explore these dynamic interactions, we investigated the effects of these amino acids on brain functional networks that are related to the food-reward mechanism.</p><p>Our additional findings are related to large-scale alterations in brain networks involved in metabolic regulation after amino acids ingestion. Our results reveal that - compared to glucose and placebo - L-tryptophan gives higher connectivity within the default mode network in the cingulate cortex and in the precuneous and within the salience network in the bilateral insula. In general, the finding that activity in brain areas regulating appetite can be influenced by different nutrients is consistent with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> on modifications after glucose and fructose ingestion. Our study extends this research, by focusing for the first time on amino acids ingestion and suggesting that L-tryptophan may be a key amino acid that increases brain connectivity in areas controlling the metabolic state of the individual.</p><p>Moreover, the direct link between satiation hormones and brain areas involved in metabolism regulation is confirmed by the positive correlation between brain activity in the insular cortex and insulin plasma levels after L-tryptophan administration. These results resemble previous findings in studies with glucose intake and confirms that there is a direct link between these regions and food-reward mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, in comparison to placebo and glucose, L-tryptophan administration also increases activity within the sensorimotor network in somatosensory areas. This is the first study to report large-scale modifications in brain activity after L-tryptophan manipulation within the sensorimotor network. The reorganization in the sensorimotor network is also evident in the analysis of the effects of glucose administration compared to placebo that shows greater activation in somatosensory areas. As demonstrated in a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, the somatosensory area (SMA) integrates sensory and visceral signals associated with protein intake and is therefore one of the main brain areas involved in appetite regulation and food-reward mechanism. In our study, its function is confirmed by the positive correlation found between changes in activity in SMA and in insulin.</p><p>Apart from brain modifications related to the food-reward system, we infer that L-tryptophan has an influence on cognitive functions and mood regulation. In fact, as demonstrated by different studies manipulating serotonin levels, changes in the activity in prefrontal regions can affect cognitive control and emotion processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In particular, as suggested by Kramer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, L-tryptophan depletion is linked to reduced activity in the insula, that in turn regulates decision making in potential aggressive situations. On the other side, modulation of L-tryptophan leads to changes in the DMN that may reduce depressive mood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Following this interpretation changes in the DMN and SN after L-tryptophan intake can be linked to changes in cognitive functions and emotion processing.</p><p>Our last result concerns the role of L-leucine on brain networks at rest. When L-tryptophan was compared to L-leucine, no differences were found in the activity in the insular cortex within the SN or within the DMN in the precuneous, while significant differences were present in the ACC within the DMN and within the SMN in the SMA. Moreover, comparison of glucose vs. L-leucine didn&#x02019;t find any differences in the DMN or SN.</p><p>Even if no previous studies have been conducted on the effects of L-leucine at brain level, these results suggest that this amino acid has an effect on brain network connectivity that is not equivalent to that of water, which suggests that L-leucine may influence areas responsible for cognitive and metabolic processing. Further investigations are needed to further clarify the effect of this amino acid on brain networks at rest.</p><p>It is important to note that this study has some limitations. As in previous neuroimaging studies of the brain-gut axis in healthy subjects, our sample size was modest because the design of the study makes recruitment of subjects relatively difficult. On the other hand Cohen&#x02019;s effect size analyses reveal that the treatments show already high magnitude. In addition, the present study focused on only two amino acids. Further investigations should be conducted on more amino acids. Moreover, plasma levels were measured for glucose and insulin, while other hormones might have better detected physiological differences between the different amino acids. Our results might potentially be influenced by mood variations not investigated by the oral examination of the health status of the participants. However, it is important to highlight that the aim of the present study is to investigate changes in brain networks involved in satiation and appetite regulation and changes in hormones levels also related to satiation and appetite (as glucose and insulin). Moreover, it is unlikely that there are systematic changes in mood associated with specific amino acids (the treatments were randomized), hence it is unlikely that potential mood variations systematically biased the current results. Furthermore, the fMRI examination in our study is not conditioned by a paradigm, so the results reflect pure resting state functional connectivity and they may not be comparable to other studies that use a tasks-related approach. Concerning the fMRI analyses, it is important to notice that smoothing may introduce spurious local functional connectivity and affect the subsequent conduction of ICA. Therefore, we performed the analyses without applying smoothing and we compared the three functional networks with and without smoothing. As expected smoothing improves the quality of the results, making the components less noisy. Therefore we decided to work on smoothed data. Lastly, T1 images were acquired at Time0 but not Time2, but the preprocessing of the Time2 images used the T1 image at Time0, so there were different space templates in segment. Since the subjects stayed in the MRI during the treatments administration, the position of the subjects remained the same during all the sequences, therefore the registration can be considered quite effective. Moreover, we repeated the analyses registering the EPI images directly to standard space. Slightly worse registration was seen in the brain networks for the registration directly to MNI, as expected (in fact this is the reason why the high-resolution 3DT1 was used). Despite this small reduction in the quality of the spatial normalization, we observed no relevant differences in the brain networks identified by ICA between the two different registrations. This shows that the registration first to T1 and then to MNI was the most effective one, and that the effect of the spatial registration on the results was marginal.</p><p>Finally, it is important to underline possible confounding results from structural changes in grey matter that can influence the response to the treatment administration. To avoid this, VBM analyses were conducted before treatment administration and no differences were observed between the visits, thus excluding this potential confounder.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current work provides new insights into acute neural modifications after ingestion of amino acids.

Twenty-three (23) subjects were recruited through local and Internet advertising. Each participant underwent a medical interview, laboratory screening and gave written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were: lactose intolerance, smoking, substance abuse, regular intake of medications, medical or psychiatric illness, and any contraindication to MRI (e.g. claustrophobia, non-removable metal devices) or abnormalities detected upon laboratory screening. Of the 23 subjects originally recruited, three had to be excluded, as they did not meet the eligibility criteria. The final sample included 20 healthy volunteers (28.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.2 years, 11 females). Estimation of statistical power in functional MRI requires knowledge of the expected percent signal change between two conditions, as well as estimates of the variability in percent signal change. We calculated the sample size for a strict statistical adjusted threshold of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, 20 subjects were required to achieve 50% power at the single voxel level for brain activations in the a priori defined networks of interest.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental Protocol</title><p>This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover study and was carried out at the Phase I Research Unit of the University Hospital of Basel. L-tryptophan, L-leucine, glucose and placebo were administered to each subject on four different days, following the procedure described below. The treatment order was randomized and at least 7 days passed between the visits. Therefore no interaction was present between the four administrations.</p><p>The subjects started each physiological and imaging examination between 9 and 10am in the morning, after an overnight fast of at least 10&#x02009;hours. The subjects consumed no breakfast before the visits.</p><p>The study was carried out in three phases: Baseline (Time0), treatment administration (Time1) treatment assessment (Time2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>Before each visit health status assessment was performed orally by a physician. At the beginning of the experiment an 8F polyvinyl nasogastric tube was inserted into the stomach through an anesthetized nostril and its intragastric position was confirmed by rapid injection of 10&#x02009;ml of air and auscultation of the upper abdomen. Then two blood samples were taken through a peripheral venous cannula and stored for laboratory analyses. Baseline examination (Time0) was then conducted, in order to control for possible differences in hormone levels and brain functions and structures before treatment administration. To assess for possible functional and structural differences at the brain level, subjects underwent an fMRI examination, including a functional resting state (RS) sequence and a T1 sequence. Before scanning a pillow in dotation of the MRI PRISMA was set in the head-coil behind the head of the subjects to prevent subjects head movements.</p><p>After the fMRI examination, the treatment was administered (Time1). The solutions were freshly prepared and were at room temperature when administered. L-tryptophan and L-leucine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Company, Germany (&#x0003e;97% pure) and glucose monohydrate was purchased from Haenseler AG (Herisau, Switzerland). Different persons prepared and administered the treatment, in order to maintain the double blindness of the study. Subjects received 300&#x02009;ml tap water with 1.56&#x02009;g (7.5&#x02009;mmol) L-tryptophan, 1.56&#x02009;g (11.89&#x02009;mmol) L-leucine, 75&#x02009;g glucose, and 300&#x02009;ml pure tap water (placebo) via a nasogastric tube, over 2&#x02009;minutes while sitting in the MR room.</p><p>15&#x02009;minutes after administration, the tube was removed. To evaluate treatment effects, the subjects underwent a second physiological and brain imaging examination (Time2): blood sampling assessed through a peripheral venous cannula and fMRI examination (RS sequence) was repeated. No T1 sequence was used in this phase, since structural changes were not expected, due to the short period of time after treatment administration.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Laboratory analyses</title><p><italic>Plasma glucose</italic> concentration was measured by a glucose oxidase method (Rothen Medizinische Laboratorien AG, Basel, Switzerland).

Two blood samples were taken through a peripheral venous cannula and stored for laboratory analyses (for blood collection method refer to 38. To assess for possible functional and structural differences at the brain level, the subjects underwent an fMRI examination, including a functional resting state (RS) sequence and a T1 sequence. After the fMRI examination, the treatment was administered (Time1). An 8F polyvinyl nasogastric tube was inserted into the stomach through an anaesthetized nostril. Subjects received 300&#x02009;ml tap water with 1.56&#x02009;g (7.5&#x02009;mmol) L-tryptophan, 75&#x02009;g glucose, 1.56&#x02009;g (11.89&#x02009;mmol) L-leucine and 300&#x02009;ml pure tap water (placebo) via the nasogastric tube over 2&#x02009;minutes while sitting in the MR room. 15&#x02009;minutes after administration, the tube was removed. To evaluate treatment effects, the subjects underwent a second physiological and brain imaging examination (Time2): blood sampling assessed through a peripheral venous cannula and fMRI examination (RS sequences) were repeated.
